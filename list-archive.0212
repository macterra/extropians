Hi Extropians,

I don't have anything to say.  Anyways, I felt like posting anyways.  
Hurrah, ultratech.

I hope I can catch up with my library.  (Dangling preposition.)  If so, 
I will be a skilled microbiologist, computer scientist, mathematician, 
physicist, and chemist.

Happy Turkey Day, thanks,

Ross

Robert, can you explain this further? Our bodies derive from information

something obvious tell me where to do some reading! Thanx.]

more open question.

I agree with you on this Robert, I anticipate some crude measures up to hair 
colour, wrinkling and disease solving to be available between 2012 and 2015, 
culminating in the surface appearance of youth. I agree that materials 
nanotech precedes assembler and intelligence nano (molecular 
supercomputers). I suspect long term problems will require the incorporation 
of nano mechanisms in cell structure for efficient and easy maintenance of a 
billion-year state of approximation (leaving the issue of memory aside). 
Strictly speaking, the Singularity (for me anyhow) has existed since 1870 in 
an obvious way, and is only manifesting a very fast spurt in a few decades 
from now... Therefore it is already part of the nanotech process, for 
example.

Are we doing "My country right or wrong"???  Surely we can do 
better than claim someone is trashing the US every time a few

I'm with you here.  Proton decay, in and of itself, only means that.
There's no reason to think there can't be information storage in another
substrate.  To believe otherwise beforehand is sort of like thinking,
circa. 1900, that only biobrains can store minds -- and since biobrains
eventually die, there's no chance of immortality.

Also, I'm not sure proton decay would rule out proton creation.  If
that's the case -- viz., protons can decay, but new ones can be
created -- then there's no reason to believe the substrate can't be
renewed.  Other considerations might come into play here, but they would
have to be considered in turn.

If it gets out us to a a few billion years -- IIRC, models of proton
decay predicted tens of billions of years for decay -- I'm willing to
take the risk.:)  Life extension science has only been around for a few
decades.  We shouldn't be making too many bold claims about its limits
while it's still in its infancy.

Happy Holidays!

I would also like to point out the difference between a nation and its
government.  Bashing Bush does not bash the United States per se (or
even the whole of its government, though I would go as far as to do
that:) -- only one person out of about 290 million people.

    > I very much question such numbers.

Various numbers and the assumptions they are based on can be disputed and
not just in one direction, the figures I gave are not the most pessimistic,
but I don't know of anyone who claims the Kyoto Protocols even if followed
to the letter will significantly slow global warming. This is a gesture to
make people feel good about themselves; I must be a good person because I'm
at least doing "something". Well, there is nothing wrong with gestures but
this is the most expensive one in the history of the world, so expensive it
will keep millions in poverty who need not be.

Just thought I'd try and cheer yo'all up a bit.

Last week a MORI poll in Britain said that four out of five people in
Britain like Americans.
http://www.mori.com/digest/2002/c021122.shtml

Quote:-
"What's the source of all the talk about the rise in Anti-Americanism in
this country? Despite reports regularly appearing these days in certain
sections of the British media, Americans are liked by more people in
Britain than at any time in past three decades."


There is a section of the media that make a lot of noise about how bad
America is, but they are a small minority. The noise they make is
wayyyyy out of proportion to the amount of support they have. This small
group that is so critical of America would be anti-America no matter
what America did. The USA can't win with this group.

I see the same in the American media as well. There is a small, noisy,
very critical group, but the vast majority of Americans support current
USA policies.

The minority protesting noisily will say, of course, that the majority
in Britain and the USA have all been brainwashed by propaganda.
But, on the other hand, the majority might be right. No?

Sorry, my bad.  I'm leaping from extremely long lifespans to unimaginably
long lifespans.  The proton decay issue only comes in the extremely far
future (see "The Five Ages of the Universe" by Adams and Laughlin).
You are certainly dead by the time the protons decay unless you have
figured out how to trump the universe's hazard function.  (For example
even a good hazard function like that found in the U.S. will limit
you to a few thousand years [on average]).

Not even in trillions of years does the proton decay problem apply
which is why the hazard function is of much greater significance.
The proton decay problem only applies if one figures out how
to trump all the other problems (all of the stars stop burning,
all matter getting sucked into black holes, etc.).  The proton
decay problem is the ultimate wild card against "immortality"
but it comes long after some other very significant hurdles
must be avoided.

This is something most people seem to not understand -- all of biology
involves "nano mechanisms".  Its already here -- biotech *is* nanotech.
If you want to apply patches to the genome start thinking about engineered
intracellular bacteria.  You don't need diamondoid.  Now as far as
a "billion" years goes you aren't going to get close to that in your
current form.  This was one of the main points I tried to make at Extro-3.
The only way you can trump a local hazard function is to become a
"distributed replicated intelligence".  One of the main reasons
I developed the Matrioshka Brain architecture was so that "individuals"
could distribute themselves such that local "accidents" couldn't
destroy them.

In the long run one must upload or one is dead.

Robert

Bill,
       I have been reading, off and on, for some times about reports coming 
out of Britain that say we, the Americans, are well liked by the folks in the 
street but heartily disliked by the "Chattering Classes."
       Heck, we are even disliked heartily by the chattering classes in our 
own country.
       It appears you are adding support to that viewpoint.

I see nothing wrong with being proud of a government
that refuses to go along with a bad agreement, just
because a lot of others are following like a procession
of catatonic quaalude quaffers.

Without doing any involved math, we know the mass of
the atmosphere is about 10 meters of water, so thats
about 11 meters of wood.  The big hoot is over the mass
of carbon dioxide rising from a historic 300 parts per
million to a current 360 ppm, so thats equivalent of a
column of wood less than a millimeter thick, once you
account for the fact that CO2 is mostly oxygen and wood
is nearly all carbon.  The total addition of carbon to
the atmosphere in the industrial revolution is less than
a millimeter thick coating of wood over the entire surface
of the planet.

So fer cryin out loud, how hard would that be to undo
that?  We can come up with 1% of the earth's surface
somewhere and park the equivalent of 10 cm of wood
there, cant we?  Hoerkheimer!  Why would we need to
slow down emissions?

OK, I will do a little math.  I do a quicky calculation
and see that the atmosphere contains about 7.5E14 kg of
C02, so thats about 2E14 kg of carbon, or wood.  I have
seen a eucalyptus tree grow to well over a meter
diameter and 20 meters tall in ten years.  Model that
as a cylinder, and just say a square meter at the base
and 10 meters tall and with the branches thats about 10
cubic meters or 1E4 kg, so we only need 1E10 of those to
contain half the carbon in the atmosphere.  A square array
of trees 100k on a side would get us our 1E10 trees.  Well,
I know those could be grown on 10 meter centers easy, so a
eucalyptus tree farm 1000 km on a side would do it.

The earth's surface is 5E8 km^2, and a quarter of that is
dry land so it would require less than 1% of the land in
new trees.  Wyoming alone is over a quarter of that, and
there is nothing out there but cows and cow pokes.  Hell,
there are ranches in Australia bigger than that, with
nothing but quaalude-quaffing wallabies hopping around
out there (or whatever wallabies actually do, if anything.
Perhaps they poke cows.)

Pipe in fresh water and a fire suppression system and no
more global warming.

Of course this all assumes we decide we dont like global
warming.  Poor Anders is up there freezing his Viking fanny
off, and we are down here worrying about where we are going
to have the winter olympics.  Kyoto schmyoto!  Its a bad
political solution to a relatively easy technical problem,
and I commend those governments who just said no.

Subject: 1024 bits stored in a single molecule?
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org

New Scientist reports on a new technique for storing and retrieving
data using quantum mechanics.  The article is here,
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993129, with the
abstract available from
http://ojps.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JCPSA6000117000015006903000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes.
If you have access to a university computer you may be able to download
the whole article from that second link.

The researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology to store
a 32 by 32 bit picture into liquid crystal molecules of 19 atoms each.
This is a total of 1024 bits, which they claim was stored in the 19
nuclear spins of a single molecule.  They were then able to retrieve the
image and display the picture.  This method is very similar to some of
the current early approaches to quantum computing.

However my understanding of quantum theory says that it is not possible
to store 1024 bits into 19 nuclear spins.  Whether they realize it
or not, the researchers are working with a large number of molecules
simultaneously, and this is what makes it possible to put in and read
back that much data.

You could draw an analogy with a polarized photon, where you can in
principle put one photon into any of an infinite number of polarization
states.  But when you read it back, you get only 1 bit of data.  Now, if
you have zillions of photons in a laser beam, and you put them all into
the same polarization state, then you can indeed recover that state with
considerable precision, thereby retrieving a large amount of information.
Each photon is in exactly the same state, as in the NMR experiment, but
you need to use lots of them in order to recover the full information
about that state.  Something similar is happening with the New Scientist
article, I am sure.

So overall I think this is a promising technique that could have practical
applications for information storage, but I don't agree with the "spin"
(pardon the expression) that is being put on the result.

'One World': The Moral and Practical Challenges of Globalization

By ANDRES MARTINEZ
 
Close your eyes and picture your community. Whom do you see? Your
family, surely. Work colleagues? Everyone who shares your area code?
Your religion? All Americans? Folks in Afghanistan? Unless we start
answering yes to all of the above, we're in for big trouble. 

That's the message of Peter Singer's timely and thoughtful book, ''One
World: The Ethics of Globalization.'' A professor of bioethics at
Princeton University and one of the most provocative philosophers of our
time, Singer writes, ''How well we come through the era of globalization
(perhaps whether we come through it at all) will depend on how we
respond ethically to the idea that we live in one world.'' 

''One World'' is a manual for elaborating this response. Singer's
recipes are at once simple and elusive: we need to do more as
individuals to alleviate the plight of the world's poor, and the world
needs more effective global governing bodies to establish protections
like meaningful labor and environmental standards. 

The United States, Singer says, often stands as an obstacle to
humanity's quest to embrace the idea of one world. As a proportion of
national wealth, American foreign aid is the skimpiest among rich
countries. We constantly refuse to pay our United Nations bills. We have
failed to join, and are busy trying to undermine, the new International
Criminal Court, as well as global efforts to crack down on pollution and
end discrimination against women. 

Ignorance may be our best defense. How many Americans understand the
extent to which their country, especially during the Bush presidency,
strives to undermine collective action on a number of fronts? Surveys,
Singer reminds us, have shown that Americans wrongly believe that some
20 percent of the federal budget goes to foreign aid. A majority of
respondents would like to see foreign aid's slice of the pie ''reduced''
to 10 percent. Of course, that would amount to a more than tenfold
increase in Washington's development assistance. 

''One World'' opens with an analogy between terrorists who fly planes
into skyscrapers and drivers of sport utility vehicles who engage in
less deliberate killing by contributing to global warming. But that is
more a tease than a sign of things of things to come. As globalization
polemics go, the book is rather restrained. More than a rant, it is a
stimulating tour of the moral and practical challenges posed by the
world's accelerating contraction. 

There is plenty here to encourage either side of the globalization
debate. Singer serves up many of the same criticisms of the World Trade
Organization that protesters at international gatherings chant about.
Yet throughout, he seems to believe that globalization, if only we could
regulate it properly, offers humanity its best hope. His is a study of
how, not whether, to embrace globalization. 

In chapters dedicated to the environment, trade, the evolution of
international law and foreign aid, Singer grapples with globalization's
thorniest questions. Among them: to what extent must political leaders
look beyond their direct constituents and act out of a concern for the
welfare of people everywhere? And here's one that's well timed: when may
a state that is not itself under attack go to war? 

''One World'' contains far more statistical analysis than one might
expect from a volume on ethics. But there is a refreshing intellectual
integrity in Singer's efforts to assess the facts on the ground, as when
he writes, ''No evidence that I have found enables me to form a clear
view about the overall impact of economic globalization on the poor.''
Singer is equally perplexed about contradictory indications on whether
global inequality is on the rise. At times, though, his exhaustive
surveying of others' research can become tedious -- as if he feels the
need to show he's done his homework. 

Singer is a calculating ethicist. He applauds Kofi Annan's doctrine of
humanitarian intervention, arguing that sovereignty considerations
should not prevent the international community from intervening to
protect people from their own governments. But, he says, it would have
been foolish to try to protect Chechnya from Russia, or Tibet from
China. Costs must always be calculated when deciding whether to do
something potentially beneficial. 

Singer's sense of realpolitik is more contrived when he writes that the
war on terrorism has turned America's need to embrace altruism into a
strategic imperative. This reads much like the spinning of an author who
got a call from his editor on Sept. 12 demanding a new introduction. To
argue that the terrorist attacks made the hardship of distant villagers
a national security issue is to disregard the fact that much of
America's development assistance during the cold war was conceived as
part of the effort to contain Communism -- often with disastrous results
for villagers. 

The book's strongest chapter is undoubtedly ''One Atmosphere.'' It is,
at one level, a primer on global efforts to contain greenhouse gas
emissions, and it concludes with Singer's well-reasoned call for
granting nations, based on their projected population in 2050, a fixed
entitlement to the amount of emissions they can produce. Singer's plan
envisions the trading of polluting rights, along the lines established
domestically by the 1990 Clean Air Act. 

The chapter on trade is less satisfying. Not only does Singer dwell on a
number of past disputes (including some that even he concedes are a bit
dated), but he fails to confront some of the issues that are most
outrageous from a moral perspective, like the hypocritical agricultural
subsidies in Europe and America and their dire consequences for poor
nations. 

The pressing challenge for the new century, in Singer's view, is the
creation of a truly democratic global government, and by this he
emphatically does not mean federalism of the type that grants all
countries one vote, with the powerful ones having a veto. A lamentable
shortcoming of ''One World'' is its failure to dwell more on the
experience of the European Union in this and other areas. The union, a
trading bloc that has evolved into a formidable transnational regulator,
is the one cutting-edge research lab for many of Singer's core issues,
especially the need to subjugate national interests to the welfare of a
broader community.

Not passed, and I think Republican legislators had a big part in that, to give
credit where it's due.  Not everyone in the GOP is happy with King George's
trend, it'd seem.

Robert I looked over your paper and it goes
into a lot more detail than my back of the envelope
one significant digit calcs.  There seems to be a curious
non-sequitur in there about the total mass of all the
products of the planet being lower than the mass of
the carbon removal needed to return the atmospheric
CO2 to prehistoric levels.

First of all, we neednt use an industrial process of
any kind, and secondly, that number is annual product
mass.  I figure we took a few centuries to send that
carbon up there, we neednt be in any desperate rush
to get it back down.

You bring up a very good problem with my notion of
growing a forest where currently there is a desert
to soak up CO2.  Wood contains more than carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen and oxygen.  It also has phosphorus.  So we
need to mine a whole bunch of that stuff, perhaps from
the bottom of the sea.  Seems to me that the sea bottom
must be under a constant shower of dead animal stuff,
every cell of which contains phosphorus that is locked
up in a form that does not quickly decay, such as bones.
The sea bottom must be rich in phosphorus, which we will
need to fertilize our new forest.  Perhaps we could get
tricky and learn how to recover phosphorus from wood
and make something useful in the process.

We both got the same answer with regard to the mass of
carbon to be scrubbed, you said 5E13 kg, I said 1E14 kg,
within a factor of 2 is close enough.  Also my conservative
swag takes into account the other mass in wood besides
carbon, so lets just say 1E14 kg of wood, thats 1E10
big trees, and yes I do think we could put something
like that into place with nothing technologically more
tricky than pipes and canals.  We just hafta stop wasting
fresh water into the damn sea.

But Robert (J not N), you have flown over this country
and looked down, you know how much empty wasted space
there is.  We *can grow* ten billion new trees, honest
we can.

The tree-huggers should love that solution too.  If they
hug one tree per second, they would be at it for over
300 years, plus there would be lots of new habitat
for the endangered double breasted fleep bleater.  For
that matter we could transplant every endangered species
into that area, and let them cheerfully (if illegally)
devour each other.

Lets grow a biiiig new forest.

Frankly, I think someone came to their senses.  If you forget civil liberties 
for the moment and ask your self -- if I had criminal information that a 
citizen ought to report where would I go, you will find you already have 
every place you need.  If you knew of a murder or a planned murder you dial 
your local gendarmes.  If you know of a terrorist cell and its plans the FBI 
number is in every phone book.  If you have a crank report to make you can go 
almost anywhere and get yourself committed.
       TIPS strikes me as an ideas whose time has long since passed.

Barbara babbles;
It is. The OED rather narrowly defines "forteana" as the noun of
"Fortean (adj) relating to or denoting paranormal phenomena".

Personally I define forteana as; the study of the anomalous - be it
phenomena, behaviour, animals, people, places, or things.

Once under the influence a dentist's morphine I defined it as "the Big
Picture printed on a mobius strip" - which seemed perfectly sensible at
the time ;-)
 
And while I admire the simplicity of Rachel's definition, I can be
somewhat more prudish, and would bowlderise it to "wierd stuff".

Forteana after its grande dame, the late great Charles Fort. Fort's books,
published in the nineteenth century, covered a wide range of phenomena
including strange animals, weird science, freaks, lights in the sky, and all
the other bizarre stuff you can imagine.

Unlike many scientists (both then and now), Fort refused to theorise without
evidence. While Forteana is generally a poor-relation science, it still
remains (in my opinion) both an example of the Scientific Method at its
finest, and a marvellous breeding-ground for cranks and nutters.

The British magazine Fortean Times is one of the best Fortean publications
on the market; broad, impartial coverage and a funky layout make this
surprisingly intelligent magazine a joy to read.

FORTEANA 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question Reality. I became a Physicist out of a desire to understand what
the universe is all about. The world, I was to discover encompasses a wide
variety of bizarre and unexplained events. Forteans (named after Charles
Fort, a collector of oddities), tend to look at the anomalies with neither
the jaundiced eye of the skeptic nor the wide eyed acceptance of the true
believer. Writing between 1919 and 1932, Fort noted that people saw strange
objects in the sky and that there are many unexplained anomalies. My
personal take on Forteana is to enjoy the chaos and revel in the anomalous.
There may be some element of the Trixter hidden in the framework of reality,
and if that is so, perhaps we can engage it in creative play. The news group
alt.misc.forteana is devoted to discussion of Forteana. The International
Fortean Organization (INFO) which was founded in 1965, publishes a fine
journal and plays host to a yearly conference. Their web page is listed
among the Fortean links below along with a link to the video tape lecture
series that I have edited.

is noticeable more americophilic than the rest.

There is a difference between liking *americans* and liking the *US* or
the *US government*.  Even in traditionally anti-american Sweden people
in general think that americans are OK as people when they decry the
evil imperialism of the Bush Regime. 

It is probably true that the most noise against America comes from a 
small group. But that group has a tremendous influence in legitimizing 
prejudices.

Well damn.  A year ago, I posted to extropians
a calculation that there was a 50% chance the
next record prime would be discovered by November
2002, which is history now.  What happened is the
number of participants in GIMPS levelled off,
or rather grew more slowly than I anticipated.
One would almost get the impression that not
many people even care what is the largest known
prime number.  spike

When the Kyoto Protocol was being debated I wondered
about the fact that the US government does not have
the authority to dictate how much CO2 is produced by
its citizens.  Furthermore there is nothing in the
US constitution from which such authority could be
derived.  In their saner moments, every government
on the globe must have realized that they too lacked
the authority to dictate CO2 production.  Why did they
decide to play chicken with that proposal, and wait
for the US to be the bad guy?  Did not every government
recognize this as a bad solution to a questionable
"problem"?  Did they not wait around for the US to
point out that the emperor was naked as a boiled egg?

Hal, I just read the abstract since the New Scientist is currently
unavailable.  It seems like they are storing the information in
the spin state of the protons.  The abstract doesn't mention "19
nuclear spins", but I can imagine a "nematic liquid crystal"
containing enough atoms which in turn contain enough protons
that one could extract 1024 bits if one has fine enough control
over individual proton spin states.

I don't know enough about NMR to know whether or not that is
a feasible assumption.

A nice piece of work if they have managed it though.  Begs some
complex issues from a long term perspective of information storage
densities -- how many atoms (in the instrumentation) did they need
to control the spin states.  "Hey look ma, I can store 1024 bits
and it only requires this 10 ton magnet and 4 megawatt supercooler
to keep them at 0.1 deg. K to do it."

Earth to spike, Earth to spike ... It's been a looooong time since
governments didn't assume the authority to regulate such things as are
covered by the Kyoto Protocol. The constitutional groundwork for such
regulation in the U.S. was laid over a hundred years ago in the series
of Supreme Court decisions that gave an almost infinitely broad
interpretation to the Commerce Clause in order to grant Congress the
power required to "regulate commerce."  Even without this, the feds
would assume they had the power under the "general police power."
Whether the Kyoto Protocols are a good idea or bad, the legal framework
for instituting them domestically has existed in the States for at least
a hundred years.  Jurists in other constitutional democracies couldn't
even postulate the question -- there was never a time when their
governments didn't have such power.

Just out of curiosity, how does this handle future carbon emissions?
Do we have to keep planting another billion trees a year?  Does the
number of trees we plant increase each year as our carbon emissions
increase?

FYI, some random data about forests worldwide.

The US has about 10% of the world's forest land.  As of 97, US forests
contained roughly 2 x 10^10 cubic meters of wood.  The dry weight of a
cubic meter of wood is roughly 500 kg.  So the US contains roughly
10^13 kg of wood (dry weight) and we can estimate the dry weight of
all the world's forests at 10^14 kg.

So your proposal involves roughly doubling the size of worldwide
forests.  This will undoubtedly take time, since the mean age of trees
worldwide is almost certainly in the tens of years, and trees grow
larger with age.  This would also take the US to roughly 1.5 x the
amount of forest land here when the first European settlers arrived.
That sounds quite challenging but not completely impossible.

In the US our 10^13kg of forest are spread across ~300 million
hectares of land.  Total US land area is ~9 billion hectares, so
forests currently constitute around 3% of US land area. If we estimate
the price of a hectare of extremely rural land as $1000 (about what it
costs in rural Washington state, where I live), then we're talking
about $300 Billion just to buy enough land in the US to plant these
forests on (assuming that there's sufficient rural non-forested land
available), plus presumably additional funds to plant and maintain the
trees.  So let's say a $500B initial investment plus some rather small
amount per year.  $500B is only about $50B more than the combined
annual military and homeland defense budgets in the US.   I'd be fine
with cutting say a third off those budgets for each of three years and
doing the purchasing and planting over that time.  

Fascinating.

I do wonder about where the nitrogen and phosphorous to do this come
from, though.   Mining phosphorous from the ocean bed doesn't sounds
like a good idea, as it may disturb clathrate beds down there and
release a huge amount of carbon into the atmosphere.

*shrug*  Overall it sounds almost viable, modulo the questions about
whether we have to keep planting more and more forests each year to
deal with even increasing carbon emissions.  At some point we really
do have to  stabilize the carbon content of the atmosphere, and
emissions reductions are a powerful tool in that.

The US government has many indirect ways of manipulating US CO2
production.  For example, the more you tax CO2 emissions, the more
pressure there is to reduce those emissions.

Huh?  Americans who don't like the [current] US government include many
who are far from Democrats, including many paleoconservatives (the Old
Right types, such as Thomas Fleming, Patrick Buchanan, and Joseph
Sobran), libertarians (e.g., George H. Smith, Murray Rothbard, me),
Objectivists (e.g., me:), and various other groups and individuals.
(I've never been a Democrat or even a Leftist.:)

Also, I see a large amount of continuity between the current political
rulers in the US and the previous ones.  Surely, not everything is the
same between the administrations of G. H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and G.
W. Bush, but the similarities are striking.  (Talk about the country
moving to the Right is mostly rhetoric and due partly to the fact that
many on the so called Right have actually moved Leftward or are even
just ex-Leftists.)

Happy Holidays!

Uh-oh, I've discovered some data that makes this plan a bit doubtful.
As I posted earlier, your proposal is basically to double the mass of
forests on earth.  However, I made a calculation error in that post.
Total US land area is roughly 900 million hectares, not *9 billion* as
I previously posted.  Of that area, 300 million hectares are already
forest land.  So in the US you're talking about taking the % of land
that is forests from 33% to 66%.  That's not realistic.

The same problem exists worldwide.  Worldwide there are about 13
billion hectares of land (not all of which is arable), of which 3.9
billion are already forests.  There is no way that we could double the
amount of forest on the planet without severe reduction in human
population.  Even then it would be a very ambitious project.

Sorry, I don't think just planting trees is going to do the trick.

This is something most people seem to not understand -- all of
biologyinvolves "nano mechanisms".  Its already here -- biotech *is*
nanotech. If you want to apply patches to the genome start thinking about 
engineered intracellular bacteria.  You don't need diamondoid.  Now as far 
as a "billion" years goes you aren't going to get close to that in your 
current form.  This was one of the main points I tried to make at Extro-3. 
The only way you can trump a local hazard function is to become a 
"distributed replicated intelligence".  One of the main reasons I developed 
the Matrioshka Brain architecture was so that
"individuals" could distribute themselves such that local "accidents" 
couldn't destroy them. In the long run one must upload or one is dead."
----------------
Thanks for the correction: I should have said intelligent nano structures 
(molecular computers and intelligently directed cell repair devices).
----------------
Regarding Matrioshka brains: If you believe that uploading represents death 
followed by the creation of an atomic-lelel approximate duplicate, then it 
doesn't really matter much about the continued existence of uploads of you 
(rough approximations including memory) because you're dead. It more a 
cultural legacy or will following a suicide.

I don't know whether many extropians still hold with his views but Tipler 
would argue that his Omega Point theory provides an out for those who die 
(or a re-entry perhaps).

Of course, you could upgrade your brain and then physically distribute it in 
continuously interlinked way, including through broadcast. Then only one 
area of your brain could ever be destroyed by a minor catastrophe. This is 
what I would recommend. It might only be necessary to have two or three 
sections of your brain physically separate. This does presume notions of 
continuity, potential and development being interlinked.

Local hazard funtion: an interesting point. Fast cars and cars in general 
(and their fumes) threaten me every day. so too does slipping in the bath or 
having an accident at home. The fact that little is done to address these 
issues indicates that most people do not believe in science being at all 
feasible until it is actually right in front of them, that cultural history 
is strong in their behavioural patterning and that physical immortalism is 
not a prevalent belief system. [Perhaps the efforts against passive smoking 
represent a slow awakening to unchosen risk.] Ideally I would want failsafe 
systems in my body and especially my neurological system and in the 
environment around me and in particular in terms of objects or activities 
which could harm me. I would want to have to turn off these fail safe 
systems if I wished to take a risk (yes, paradoxically I would want to be 
able to do so). I would want sufficient fail safe systems to give me a low 
risk (one per 3 billion years as an ideal minimum start).

Perhaps the second great software surge will be encoding failsafe beliefs 
into intelligent nanotech and computationally flexible operational 
environments (the sysop principle in Singularitarianism).

It is also interesting to note that Tipler envisages a form of Matrioshka 
brain/s as a precursor to the Omega Point, which finally results in a 
multiverse with a divergency of life forms and approaches. Again, there 
could be differences of opinion about whether this (the Tiplerian version of 
the process) might be achieved through uploading or (continuity-friendly) 
upgrading.

I myself make no value judgements about choosing uploading as being a 
negative act in itself (it is a personal choice) - similarly joining a 
Matrioshka brain is also a personal choice in my opinion. I would want to 
ensure that conservatives can continue to choose conservative options, i.e. 
have mortal or immortal human or human-like bodies.

My own views about the future are not relevant to my ethics. [I believe that 
abilities in the future may be more extreme than currently envisaged.]

...And the more that administration risks getting thrown
out on its ear in the next election.  Fuel taxes are unpopular
with the voting masses because they hit disproportionately
the poorer people.  I think thats why they have been avoided
in the past: no one can figure out how to soak the rich.

Regarding Greg's post, the actual mechanism for taxing
CO2 production still is not clear to me, other than fuel
taxes, which again would bankrupt the poor before the
rich even noticed anything was up.

Suppose the US had agreed and whole world signed up to
this absurd proposal.  How would it be enforced?  If we
didn't meet the goal, who would be sued?  Is it Anders?
Im sure the northern Europeans burn more fuel than I do
to keep their houses warm.  At the same time, Im sure that
a bit of global warming is sounding pretty good to those

Dan, 
       If you are a libertarian (small l) then you and I can probably come to 
an agreement.  Can we agree that the continuum from Democrats on the right to 
the Republicans on the right is not nearly as relevant as the continuum from 
the various totalitarian ideologies to the libertarians on the other end of 
the continuum?
       If so we can agree on that much then perhaps we can agree that we both 
wish to strengthen the libertarian position.
       My problem at this time has less to do with goals than trying to cut 
through the Democrat & Republican, BS is put out in their pursuit of their 
partisan goals.
       For example I am having great trouble with cutting through the BS of 
the current civil liberties argument.  We (Americans) gave up a huge chunk of 
our civil liberties way back in the 30s when we went for social security and 
that little ring through our nose known as the social security number and the 
IRS.  Presently I am studying tax accounting and cannot get over how much of 
liberties we gave away when we adopted social security and income tax.  That 
loss of rights almost makes the present situation look trivial in my opinion.
       I would appreciate continuing the dialogue on this subject with you.

Like Greg says, so what?  I don't see anything in the Constitution to allow
making drugs illegal, regulating possession of radioactive materials, or
funding scientific research.  As for CO2, I think there's a federal gasoline
tax already in place, in which it could simply be upped, and let market forces
do their work.  And we've banned how much DDT is produced by the citizens
(i.e. none) and regulated other emissions; nothing special about CO2.  Well,
apart from breathing...

Like the way they lacked the authority to dictat CFC production?

If MWI is true, then anyone who believes in pattern identity shouldn't worry
about dying, since there are countably infinite copies of every possible
human pattern.

Similary, the Dust Hypothesis as outlined in Permutation City by Greg Egan
(there are infinitely many physical systems in the universe -- MWI or
otherwise -- that are mathematically equivelant to at least a few sequential
processing steps of any arbitrary turing machine, combine that with the
pattern identity thingy, and therefore every possible simulation ever is
already being run right now) has the same outcome.

Of course, it's something of a leap of faith to base life and death choices
on pattern identity theory. It might be wrong. Better to be a cautious late-
or non-adopter than rush in and risk personal extinction.

'The political agenda of Fox News, to take the most important example, is
hardly obscure. Roger Ailes, the network's chairman, has been advising the
Bush administration. Fox's Brit Hume even claimed credit for the midterm
election. "It was because of our coverage that it happened," he told Don Imus.
"People watch us and take their electoral cues from us. No one should doubt
the influence of Fox News in these matters." (This remark may have been tongue
in cheek, but imagine the reaction if the Democrats had won and Dan Rather,
even jokingly, had later claimed credit.)'

Ramez I may be over my post limit for today, so do let
me summarize everything in one post.  I argue it is
possible to fix arbitrarily much carbon in trees.
I do not calculate from the existing mass of wood
in existing forest land, for I argue that forest
can be created with far higher wood density than
currently exists in US forests.  We can use species
that grow faster and denser than our current pine
forest, assuming plentiful water.  This is accomplished
by proper water control, which we currently do not
do at all.

Go back to my calculation that all carbon we would
need to fix would be contained in 10 billion big
trees, which could be placed on 10 meter centers,
assuming the right kind of trees and plenty of
water.  Not pines, they cannot grow nearly
densely enough.  They arent the right kind of
trees for this purpose.

As for the argument that much of the land in
the world is not arable, I argue that it can
be made so.  Given plenty of water, some tree
species can grow in very poor soil.  We have
also in our bag of tricks redistributing soil
from places where it is plentiful to where it
isnt.  Redistributing water will do most of
the magic.

Regarding your calculation of existing wood
mass vs existing forest, you did not take into
account the possibility of replacing existing
forest with other tree species that grow more
densely.  If you are in Taxifornia, look me
up and I will take you to a dense stand of
Eucalyptus trees more dense than the meter
diameters on 10 meter centers that I proposed
in an earlier post.

If we got carried away, I could easily see
where we would soak up so much CO2, plants
would be gasping for the stuff, more than
they already are.  Fortunately we could
easily re-liberate it by putting a torch
to one or more of the forests.

Of course it is an ambitious project, but there
is no hurry.  We do not need to have it finished
before the singularity.  It can be a 300 year
project, eh?  Or 3000.

What sites are the rest of you searching for information about news
relevant to Extropy/Transhumanism ??

I scan:

Slashdot (for the occasional interresting story):
http://slashdot.org/

Google news:
http://news.google.com/news/gntechnologyleftnav.html

Randi, for sceptiscism:
http://www.randi.org/

CNN - Sci-tech news:
http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/

BBC - Sci-tech news:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/default.stm

For nanotech:
http://nanodot.org/

But these are so obvious. There must be more and better sites?

NMR molecular photography
Authors: Anatoly K. Khitrin, Vladimir L. Ermakov, B. M. Fung
Comments: 8 pages plus 3 figures, accepted for publication in the Journal of
Chemical Physics

A procedure is described for storing a 2D pattern consisting of 32x32 = 1024
bits in a spin state of a molecular system and then retrieving the stored
information as a stack of NMR spectra. The system used is a nematic liquid
crystal, the protons of which act as spin clusters with strong
intramolecular interactions. The technique used is a programmable
multi-frequency irradiation with low amplitude. When it is applied to the
liquid crystal, a large number of coherent long-lived 1H response signals
can be excited, resulting in a spectrum showing many sharp peaks with
controllable frequencies and amplitudes. The spectral resolution is enhanced
by using a second weak pulse with a 90 phase shift, so that the 1024 bits of
information can be retrieved as a set of well-resolved pseudo-2D spectra
reproducing the input pattern.

Time for my periodic plug: transhumantech covers some of science news 
sources, but we could use some more coverage. Science Daily coverage is 
pretty spotty, for instance.

Aargh. Don't you see the big chances redicing the CO2 emission is giving 
us? Spike, think solar satellites. Think beaming power from the Moon. (And 
this requires completely or almost-complete closure fabbing in situ). 
Think hydrogen economy, cheap photovoltaics, pipelines, storage, 
hydrogen as synthetic agent, fuel cell cars, artificial photosynthesis, 
and scooby dooby do.

This is tech waiting to be developed, and be exported for los muchos 
dineros.

I've changed the subject to reflect the discussion topic.

On Sun, 1 Dec 2002, spike66 wrote:

Spike and I have been having an offline discussion on this
topic which is still in progress.

I think the flaw in his argument is the water requirement.
Cellulose and/or lignin are hydrocarbons and the hydrogen
has to come from water.  There is also an energy requirement
(e.g. X amount of sunlight to fix X amount of C).  Spike's
mass-balance analysis thus far only deals with the C and
doesn't deal with the H.  As he points out we don't do
a heck of a lot to sustainably regulate water distribution
currently.  But if in order to supply the H2O for maximal
growth to the area he decribes it is necessary to install
and maintain drip irrigation for all the trees then it is
quite a different scale project than simply planting the
number of trees he suggests.

I'm also not so sure I believe his growth projections for trees.
Under ideal circumstances perhaps -- but can one get "ideal"
circumstances for the area he proposes?  Was the tree he
described in Wyoming?

I question the 300/3000 year time frame -- by then one may
have destroyed many island habitats.  Spike needs to make
a strong assertion that it is morally reasonable that driving
that big truck of his may flood some island paradise (e.g.
the Mauritius).  This may touch upon the recent thread
by J. Hughes on Singer's "One World" perspective.
The "tragedy of the commons" is going global.  It is unclear
to me how much the impact of rising sea levels/temperatures
and increased storm frequency will be.  Slower coral reef
growth (or increased death) leading to erosion of shorelines
as well as more violent/frequent hurricanes do have
significant economic consequences.  These things must
be considered before adopting a complete "let it be"
perspective.

I'm moderately certain that there are perhaps two ways to
solve this.  The first would involve solar ponds designed
to produce methane, which in turn can be converted to
hydrogen in reformers, that can be supplied with salt water
to grow engineered phytoplankton over much of the rangeland
of the U.S. southwest.  This would eliminate the need for
U.S. oil imports.  The second would involve a serious
program to fertilize oceanic phytoplankton that can sequester
carbon in the open oceans.  This may require also engineering
them to be resistant to consumption by the organisms that
consume them and respire their carbon back into the ocean/atmosphere.

These paths are *not* going to make the environmentalists
happy.  But I am reasonably certain they will solve the problem
of increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

No offense is intended towards Spike by these comments
(I presume he knows that coming from me).

Robert

But I (personally), don't believe uploading represents "death" any more
than I view going to sleep at night represents "death".  I happen to prefer
a more or less continual evolution of ones consciousness into an uploaded
state (i.e. most of your computronium/memory can be more easily replicated
than the current biological computronium/memory).  But that doesn't
mean that I believe the disassembly of my brain and the reassembly of
an equivalent memory matrix on alternate hardware is equivalent to dying.
The information is only "lost" if it is allowed to decay away (or
is explicitly destroyed).

This was the primary point my comments were trying to make.

I'm reasonably sure that in the long run one has to slow down to gain
longevity.  (Unless the speed-of-light constraint can be transcended.)

Agreed.  But things are being done to address the local hazard function.
Seatbelts, requirements for fire alarms, elimination of second hand smoke,
regulations regarding food preparation, gun laws, etc.  But there is a
question of balance -- at what point are the restrictions on activities
so unreasonable that they make life not worth living?

I'm not sure I'd completely agree with this.  If you have some references
please forward them to me.

My impression is that the Tiplerian version requires that one essentially
be able to run the universe backwards (to recreate everyone that once
existed).  Someone please correct this if this is a misperception.

 We probably do. Do you have any argument for your idea of responsibility?
For instance, what risks would population biology help us deal with?
 My impression is that your approach would delay development of assemblers
by decades, which implies either that researchers who ignore your methods
will make your approach irrelevant, or that there is an unusually effective
prohibition on using other approaches.

The population biology mention is out of context.  I was actually
talking about what poor modeling methods we have in areas where we
attempt to model the action of huge populations of individual
entities.  Population biology is an illustration of this.

My problem with only having the degree of control that virus authors
have over their creations is that computer viruses get out of control
all the time.  There are numerous cases, starting with the original
internet worm, of viruses that were written as toys and then ended up
getting loose from their authors and causing a large amount of
trouble.

With an assembler - a totally novel and extremely powerful type of
self-replicator - I would want to make very very certain that it would
not escape into the environment before I ever built one.  That means
modeling and simulating its behavior.  Otherwise how do you know that
the defenses you've built to keep it contained are sufficient?

cheers,
mez

Sounds to me like she was using the Master key, which is not advised.  Most 
imobilizers will allow the programming of extra keys using this key.  I'm 
sure she'll be investing in one now:)

FWIW:  Most "soak the rich" taxes, don't.  They soak the moderately well 
off.  The one's who used to be thought of as the lower-upper to 
upper-lower classes (including the middle classes within the range).  
The one's poorer than that can't pay the taxes, so they do without.  The 
ones above that level have tax lawyers that finagle their taxes so that 
they end up subsidized by the government.
N.B.:  I'm not claiming that only the very wealthy and the very poor are 
subsidized.  There are some others who manage this, but unless they are 
unlucky they usually end up as very wealthy.   (Examine the history of 
Disney, e.g.)

Have you even considered the possibility that Iraqis on the street have
been so terrorized by Saddam's secret police that, much like Soviet
citizens pre-1990, most were too damn scared to say anything on western
tv that deviated one whit from the government propaganda line?

Of course not, since Saddam is so obviously a far more trustworthy
source of fact than the US....

Yes, this is why only 100,000 of them surrendered to us in two days in 
'91.... I'm sure that their patriotic resolve has changed significantly
since Saddam only executed 10,000 of the POWs we returned after the
war...

You really need to go read the papers I mentioned, particularly
Josh Halls.

An assembler does not need to be a self-replicator.  In fact
a self-replicating assembler is vastly harder than an assembly
line that manufactures assembler arrays using special purpose
assembly tools.  To make macroscale stuff rapidly you need
lots assemblers -- you *do not* need lots of self-replication.
Star Trek type "replicators" could be safe so long as they
are certified to only "assemble" things which are safe.
You can make apple pie but not self-replicating assemblers.

It is generally accepted that it would be unwise to build
assemblers that can self-replicate -- this is why the
concept of a "broadcast architecture" that keeps the code
separate from the execution units was invented. I think
that is covered in another one of Ralph's papers, a Google
ought to find it.

This is kind of the principle behind Zyvex's Rotapod(tm).  You
get exponential growth in assembly without true self-replication.

Nor is the New Republic known for its 'neo-conservative' writers. New
Republic is a decidedly moderate democrat mag rag. At best, he
represents the Lieberman wing of the party, siding with Bush on many
foreign policy and some socio-economic matters, while still advocating
authoritative statism that appeals to both Dems and Republicans

Anyone who executes a convicted murderer is defending themselves as
well as the rest of society. Just as it doesn't matter if a gun toting
theif didn't intend to kill me when I blow him away, I am still legally
justified in defending myself because it was my perception at the time
that I was in danger, that the perp intended to kill me, or someone
else. Justified homicide is the worse that I or the executor can be
guilty of.

Actually, there is a legitimate basis for regulating CO2 emissions by
private citizens, since interstate commerce is a constitutionally valid
area of congressional regulation, and emitting any substance that is
determined to be a pollutant becomes a negative externality that
travels across state lines (via the atmosphere) and is therefore
theoretically a form of interstate commerce. The commercial problem of
externalities is getting a proper accounting and payment for them (both
positive and negative externalities.

The problem is of course determining that CO2 is in fact a pollutant.

Okay okay.  Maybe I'm out of date.  The safety concerns I've posted
deal specifically with self-replicating assemblers.  I have far fewer
problems with highly specific non-replicating nano-devices.  (I
hesitate to call these assemblers, though.)

And again, I feel like the non-replicating model results only in
incremental improvement of current manufacturing techniques.  I don't
feel that it achieves the potential for vast social change that

those social changes include very scary risks as well, and big parts
of Eric's reasoning on the economic leveling impact of
self-replicating nano have always seemed a bit dubious.

Well, that's arguable.  It's certainly a better argument than the Feds 
will bother to use.  And better than the justification for most recent

Well the "most recent" legislation is trying to turn back the clock.

(We need to be specific here, I'm not sure Charles and I are on the same
topic.)

If we are discussing the rollbacks on plant improvement regulations
by the Bush administration we are discussing a transfer of pollution
consequences from western or midwest states to the states to the east
of them.  I think these particularly effect Northeastern states
where Mike is and I hail from -- so we are rather sensitive to
these uninvited transfers of environmental consequences.  I view
it as little different from having to clean up my neighbors
dog or cat poop from my lawn.  If its your pet then its your
responsibility to clean it up!  The same is true for your
environmental ca-ca.

But we already have self-replicating assemblers.  Every single living
microbe (not viruses) matches this description.  In fact there are
more copies of microbial self-replicating assemblers in or on your
body than there are copies of your own cells making up your body
(documented in Nanomedicine VI).

Given that situation (that we manage to survive in a sea of self-replicating
assemblers)  you have to make the conversation much more precise -- at least
I hope you would see this.

Why?  A ribosome is an assembler that assembles a large variety
of protein based structures (on which all of nature operates).
If you want to be specific then you need to state a "universal
assembler".  It isn't clear that a "universal assembler" can
exist.  It isn't clear whether it is possible for an assembler
to assemble both diamondoid (largely C based) and sapphiroid
(largely Al2O3 based).  They may require two very distinct assembler
architectures.

You have to get this Mez -- we already have self-replicating
nanotech.  You use it every time you eat a slice of cheese,
a container of yogurt, consume a bottle of wine or beer, or
wash your clothes in detergents equipped with "enzymes"
(derived from bacteria).  Many of your prescription drugs
are also produced using this technology.

The self-replicating model is here now -- we actively use
it in our existing manufacturing processes.  The question
is whether there are better ways to control it (there are
but I'm not at liberty to discuss them).

> I don't feel that it achieves the potential for vast social change that

EOC is a very early view of what is possible.  People are working
on re-writing it.  Exponential assembly achieves much of the social
change that EOC envisioned without the dangers of self-replication.
(because broadcast architectures can operate one-to-many).

> That's fine by me - those social changes include very scary

Granted, but there are paths that allow the risks to generally
be avoided.

I would disagree -- if you can have exponential growth of the benefits
of Nano without the risks of true self-replication then one might be
able to steer a path of having the benefits without the hazards.

That produces the economic leveling effect.  It also lays the foundation
for a subsequent set of problems, documented to my mind in Robin
Hanson's "If Uploads Come First" paper.

Its not over until its over.

Oh, well, if you put it *that* way...  {8^D

My contention is that reducing emissions is perhaps
one solution to increased CO2, but not necessarily
the best, and that increased CO2 is not necessarily
the problem to start with.  The Kyoto agreement is
just a bad idea any way I read it.

True, the H comes from photosynthetic decomposition of water.
The assumption is there is plenty of water on the planet to
supply a couple H atoms for each C.  Keep in mind however
that most of the water used by a plant is not decomposed
but rather reenters the atmosphere to fall as rain elsewhere.

Well, a drip irrigation system is a bit more sophisticated
than I had in mind.  If the ground is minimally shaped to
retain moisture, the piping system required is not so
daunting.  Consider for instance the fact that much of
the currently unused land will support little if any
life because steep slopes do not hold moisture.  It looks
to me like the steep land could be effectively terraced
so that the snowmelt would not drain uselessly to the
sea but would be trapped for trees to use, with minimal
attention required from scarce humans.  Humans are scarce
for two reasons: 1) they are expensive, and 2) the planet
doesnt have nearly enough of them.  Get with it extropians,
breed more.

Wait, we are not out of tricks.  We can sequester water
as well as carbon.  We have mentioned overfilling inland seas
and perhaps creating new inland seas.  Another idea would
be to sequester water on the Antarctic continent.  Antarctica
is the dryest continent, however my intuition tells me that
there must be rivers somewhere under all that snow and ice.

Could we not build dams there and divert the water inland,
into some basin, in which the water would freeze?  Almost no
animals would be slain thus, for almost nothing lives down
there.  Surely we could spare a few polar bears and penguins,
eh?  Transplant em to the arctic or something.

The Sahara is another great place to sequester water
and start a new forest.  There is practically nothing
useful there now.  There is a water source available:
build a covered canal the width of Africa, east-west,
and divert the Nile into that.  Take water out of the
canal to water the new forest.  The soil isnt great
out there but we can work with it.  The jobs created
would pump money into African economies that desperately
need it.

OK, I strongly assert that it is morally reasonable.  {8-]

Keep in mind a few important facts.  1) we could
maintain the sea level by sequestering water for a long
time, 2) we could build floating islands and anchor them
to submerged landmasses, then take lifeforms from the
existing tropical paradises, and 3) I like my truck.

Robert, much of the naysaying by the greens assumes
we cannot do a lot of the things that we really can
do, without great difficulty.  It assumes we cannot
transplant species and cannot risk extinction of
even one species.  But of course we can transplant
species, and some will become extinct regardless of
what we do.  We might as well make the most of it.
Or not: we can save a lot of species on floating
artificial tropical islands.

The greens are merely nattering nabobs of negativity.

>  This may touch upon the recent thread

Singer's One World perspective demonstrates a
deplorable lack of imagination.  Consider:

	[Singer's] "One World'' opens with an
	analogy between terrorists who fly
	planes into skyscrapers and drivers
	of sport utility vehicles who engage
	in less deliberate killing by contributing
	to global warming.

Well fer crying out loud.  I suppose Singer would then
be forced to argue that the planet had *less* life
during the Jurassic, when there was no ice, more water,
more carbon dioxide and higher temperatures.

I firmly believe otherwise.

Global warming would help melt back some of that
useless ice, create *more* land for animals
to live on, *more* plant life for them to devour,
warmer temperatures to support *more* life, not
less.

Singer shamelessly picks on well-meaning SUV drivers,
who selflessly sacrifice and contribute more of
their paychecks at the gas pump in order to set that
carbon free, providing more CO2 for plants to
breathe, which supports wildlife everywhere, and
life in general.

And besides, they like their trucks, evolution bless em.

If humans did their water control correctly, storms

as a cheap and fast way to get water inland, where
it can be useful.

That is a possibility, however I still like the tree
idea, because it is easily reversible.  If we find
it isn't such a good idea to draw down CO2, if we
find the atmosphere hasn't enough of it, then we can
put a torch to the trees.  Or burn them to generate
power.

I suspect we will learn that the planet is healthier
if we have the same or higher CO2 level than it had
during the good old dinosaur days.

That assumes increased CO2 is a problem.  Im not
convinced.  Sounds like a solution to me.  I guess
I can live with a bunch of unhappy environmentalists.
Hey Im an environmentalist too.  I just think we can
improve on the one we have.

Sure.  But microbes occupy a tiny tiny fraction of the total design
space for self-replicators.  They're limited by the materials they're
constructed of, the substrate their design data is encoded in, and the
fact that a huge ecology of competing microbes already exists.

When we start talking about fabricating new replicators out of whole
cloth, we're radically opening up the design space.  Some of what
we've learned from microbes will apply, but there will also be many
surprises.

Excellent.  I have just adjusted my vocabulary.  In the future when I
wish to speak about self-replicating assemblers capable of building
anything, I will refer to them as "universal assemblers".  Hopefully
that'll avoid any future confusion on this point. :)

I get it Robert. I understand the proof of principle that biology
provides.  I understand how we've manipulated biological
self-replicators to do our bidding.  It's truly impressive.

My problem is not with the idea that we can build self-replicating
assemblers - I believe that we can.  My problem is with the belief
that any extremely novel (read: not based on existing biology)
self-replicators we build will behave in a manner that we can
anticipate and control.

I have a bit of a problem.  Procedureally I tend to be a strict 
constitutional constructionist, and find all the vaporous justifications 
about "to promote interstate commerce" to be unjustified by the clear 
text of the constitution.   I even have trouble with your pollution 
argument.

OTOH, my sympathies are rather green.  If I felt that the government 
were even reasonably trustworthy, I would try to find justifications for 
it in implementing green policies.  But I don't, which is the core of 
the reason that I am a strict constitutional constructionist.  The 
reason that you can't trust the king to do what's right, is that history 
proves that he will be more interested in increasing his own power.  You 
can substitute any other centralized authority for king, and you get the 
same answer.  The only legal protection that we have, frail as it is, is 
the constitution.  Once that is discarded, then there is no argument 
against using whatever force you have available to achieve your ends, 
except that this would lead to the kind of society that would make us 
even more unhappy.

Over the span of millions of years, this may be true.

Unfortunately rapid change in climate produces a short term (in
ecological time scales) profoundly negative effect on most life forms.

Why?  Because most species can not quickly adapt to climate change.
Turning up the heat kills off the southern portions of a forest far
more quickly than it extends the range of the forest to the north.  So
for some time you have a net negative impact on diversity and on the
size of that forest.

Indeed, this is an extremely simplistic example, because the effects
of global warming are not homogeneous over the face of the earth.
Some areas will go up in temperature, others will go down.  Some
deserts will experience much higher precipitation and some wet areas
will experience prolonged droughts.  

Frankly, in my own area (Seattle), I've enjoyed the effects of global
warming (more sunny days in the winter), but I realize that it comes
at a cost.  For example, Seattle is experiencing a blight of
evergreen-devouring fungus that is encouraged by the unusually warm
winters we've had recently.  From my back yard virtually every pine
tree I can see is now affected by the fungus and is as good as dead
(once you see the signs, you know the root system is all but gone).
These pines have an average age of several decades, so the damage done
is not exactly quick to undo.  This is the kind of unforeseen
consequence global warming brings.

Another thing I haven't seen much emphasis on here is the uptick in
extreme weather over the last decade.  Higher mean temperatures = more
energy in the atmosphere.  That energy manifests itself as hurricanes,
monsoons, and other extreme weather.  Global weather-related insurance
claims are up strongly over the last 15 years, even adjusting for
inflation AND global population growth.  

Here in the US we can handle more extreme weather fairly well - we're
rich, not dense, and have lots of interior room. But in poor, high
density, coastal nations like Bangladesh, it's a death sentence for
hundreds of thousands of people.  And it's really just getting
started.

All in all I think global warming is worth taking seriously and worth
devoting resources to abetting.  It's not our most pressing
environmental problem (scarcity of fresh water likely gets that title)
but it's a very real phenomenon having a real and negative effect on
the world.  

cheers,
mez

BOOKS ON HEALTH
What's Normal? A Look at Asperger Syndrome
By DAVID CORCORAN

It was an exciting moment for me - and, I imagine, for other parents of
children
with the baffling neurological disorder called Asperger syndrome - when The New
York Times Magazine published Lawrence Osborne's "Little Professor Syndrome" in
June 2000.

The title may have been condescending, but the article itself was terrific,
perhaps the best yet about Asperger's in a mainstream publication: a 4,500-word
exploration, in remarkably vivid and sympathetic language, of a world that few
readers had visited.

So it was doubly exciting when Mr. Osborne, a widely published health and
science journalist, expanded the article into a book, "American Normal,"
published last month.

Asperger's, as most readers probably still need to be told, is a lifelong
disorder of unknown origin that usually shows up around 18 months to 3 years.
Generally thought to be a form of autism, it is characterized by normal or
above-normal intelligence, social awkwardness, verbal rigidity and, most
conspicuously, a fixation with an obscure topic that can be learned by rote.

Editorial Reviews
>From Library Journal
This collection of portraits has that admirable goal of seeking to illuminate
what it's like to live with Asperger Syndrome (AS), one of the Autistic
Spectrum Disorders, but it falters on many counts. First, Osborne, a medical
writer for the New York Times Magazine, devotes too much space to historical
figures who were never diagnosed with AS and probably did not know about the
condition (e.g., Thomas Jefferson, pianist Glenn Gould). Second, he wrongly
identifies inventor and educator Temple Grandin as someone with AS. Since she
lacked speech until she was seven years old, she is always counted among those
with moderate to severe autism despite her current success. Third, his interest
in famous people who may have AS lacks clear value besides creating an Asperger
"hall of fame." By sometimes trivializing the experience of the people
featured, this book will not help those looking to assist someone with AS.
Though little is written in this field, a better title would be Liane Holliday
Willey's Pretending To Be Normal: Living with Asperger's Syndrome. Not
recommended owing to its inaccuracies and muddled definition of AS.

Mel Levine, author of A MIND AT A TIME
AMERICAN NORMAL can and should have a major impact on the ways in which we
think about mental health.

Book Description
Thomas Jefferson may have had it. The pianist Glenn Gould almost certainly had
it. There are even those who insist (probably incorrectly) that Albert Einstein
had it. Whether it is called "geek syndrome," "high-functioning autism," or
simply "Asperger's," it is not just one of the most poorly understood of all
neurological disorders, but amazingly one of the fastest-growing of all
psychiatric diagnoses in America today. Some support organizations even claim
that as many as one in five hundred people in the general population suffers
from some aspect of the disease.

Basing his report on memoirs, clinical histories, poems and stories, and visits
with dozens of individuals afflicted with the disorder, journalist and essayist
Lawrence Osborne shows us what life with Asperger's is really like. Often
brilliant at math and able to perform savant-like feats of memory, those who
are afflicted with the syndrome -- some 80 percent are boys or men -- are also
wracked with bizarre obsessions. And strangely and characteristically, most of
them are unable to understand even the most simple expressions of the human
face. They may know everything there is to know about vacuum cleaners, the New
York City subway system, or industrial deep-fat fryers (or, for that matter, J.
S. Bach), but they are unable to hold a normal conversation about even the most
basic of their own feelings, or anyone else's. They are, in their own words,
the Mind Blind -- strange solitaires, anti-social loners -- in a world
dominated by the ordinary people they call "neurotypicals."

In this front-line report and very personal investigative journey, Osborne also
asks hard questions. Just how different from the so-called normal are those
with Asperger's, and is it possible that virtually all of us have a little of
the syndrome in ourselves? Setting aside the usual pieties of medicine and
rehabilitation, he embarks on a quest that casts a skeptical eye on American
psychiatric culture, with its tendency to over-diagnose, then over-medicate.
And even more, he ventures into the elusive but essential realm where one has
to ask what is the difference between eccentricity (with all its potential for
creativity, for enriching our society and ourselves) and normality, with its
undertones of blandness, averageness, and uniformity?

About the Author
Lawrence Osborne is the author of three previous books, ANIA MALINA, a novel,
the travel book PARIS DREAMBOOK, and THE POISONED EMBRACE, an essay on sexual
attitudes in Catholicism. A widely published journalist, he is a frequent
contributor to THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE and SALON. He lives in New York.

Mez, the coniferous root fungus has little or nothing to
do with global warming.  The greens claim it is, but that
is propaganda.  What is killing the evergreens is your
lawn.  You pour water on that lawn from the sprinkler
to keep it green, along with various fertilizers, you
and your neighbors.  Add up all that water and compare
with the historic rainfall and temperature averages,
which haven't changed much and the mystery is solved.

My parents built a house 27 years ago, cleared the lot
but left 40 big pines.  Over the years all but 2 of those
have perished.  But the lot next door is just as densely
wooded with the same kind of trees as were there all along.
They added up the amount of water that was going on the
grass and it was more than the previous annual rainfall.
Global warming isnt to blame, its global watering.

Furthermore the grass changes the water holding
characteristics of the soil.  The sandy Florida
soil would shed the water quickly, whereas the
grassy lawns maintain the moisture and encourage
fungi.

Its foreseen.  There are other solutions, such as
planting lawns with grass adapted to dryer conditions
and then instead of watering it, you spray it with
a green dye that concentrates in the leaves.  It
doesn't need mowing as often either, and is far
more tree friendly.  spike

Spike,
       I know that some of you know more about ecology than I do so let me 
ask a question instead of commenting.
       I believe I recall seeing a picture on one of the space oriented news 
sites of a noticiable brown cloud over the industrial countries of SE Asia 
that is bringing on El Nino.  Can some of you comment?

Actually the pines I'm referring to aren't on my property - they're on
a state-owned park next door that receives no artificial watering or
fertilizing.  And my information on the impact of global warming on
this blight comes not from green propaganda, but from a friend who did
her doctoral thesis on this particular root fungus.

This is one choice that needs to be more aggressively investigated.  At 
least to the pilot project level.  But NASA is not only quite 
conservative about such things, it appears to be being dismantled.  This 
may eventually turn out to be good, perhaps.  If the funding that was 
directed at NASA goes to other similar activities.  But I feel a bit 
dubious about things actually working out that way.  Still, I have no 
internal knowledge, so there's room for hope.

One of the justifications for the existence of corporations is that they 
are able to undertake projects on too large a scale for any smaller 
entity to consider.  The corresponding problem is that they tend to be 
quite conservative about how they invest their efforts.  Companies start 
small and innovative.  As they become larger, their vision narrows.  In 
a forest with only tall trees, saplings cannot grow.  Around the edge of 
the forest, however, saplings recur.  And within the forest, when one of 
the giants crashes to the ground, saplings rise to take it's place.  
This seems a good analogy to corporations.   But NASA used it's 
regulatory powers to limit the access of small companies to the skies. 
(rightly?  wrongly?  Legitimate safety concerns were present.)  There is 
a poor fit between a small group of engineers and a federal bureaucracy.

Sure, the average executive or manager has as his goal to keep his job and to 
continue "making the big bucks."  It is not to optimise the resources of 
firm.

### Depends what one means by destructive. If I peel off a layer of atoms,
note their positions, and put precisely on top of a stack of previously
scanned layers, the original is much less disturbed than during brain
surgery. During the procedure I have a brain sliced in two pieces, but this
is not destruction.

### Excellent! This is actually all I wanted from you - a little bit of
uncertainty. As long as we agree that the subject matter under discussion is
complex and no simple one-fit-all solution is available, we could perhaps
lay the duck to rest (for now).

Its a very complex problem.  In most third world countries they opt
for cars and/or factories without good pollution controls.  As
they develop and people become wealthy enough to purchase cars
the traffic problems increase (because they don't have the road
infrastructure).  That in turn causes vehicles to sit in traffic
further aggravating the pollution problem.  [This was *very* clear
in Moscow circa 1992-1996.]

This may be providing some of the particulate matter that allows
snow and rain to condense out of the atmospheric water vapor leading
to greater precipitation (as Mez points out a warmer atmosphere
doesn't help either).  That ends up leading to the floods in
countries like Bangladesh.  That may mean that less moisture
gets transported over the Himalayas which in turn makes central
Asia dryer.  That allows very large dust storms to form which
blow out of asia and into the pacific where the dust gets
dropped effectively fertilizing the phytoplankton.  Phytoplankton
blooms would then presumably absorb CO2 out of the atmosphere
leading to an increase in the plankton that consume the phytoplankton
and respire the CO2 back into the atmosphere.

I suspect the interaction between all of these things generates
cycles over multi-year periods.

And that is probablBy highly oversimplified.

There was a paper in Science or Nature just a few weeks ago that
the fires burning accumulated peat in Indonesia a few years ago
added as much CO2 to the atmosphere equivalent to a significant
fraction of the contribution of all of humanity in a year!
Lord knows what that will do to the El Nino cycles.

### Yes, they do share the same experience (having the same memory), and
while frozen they are unconscious.

Gametes lead relatively protected lives, and thus accumulate damage slower
than the typical somatic (body) cell.  Gametes do get genetic damage, but
damaged gametes are selected against during reproduction, and are less
likely to be passed to progeny.  Some damage does get passed on, and it is
seen in genetic drift, and is the source of variation which is seen over
time in the evolution of a lineage.  A relatively undamaged pair of
gametes is selected and passed into each offspring, but an animal's body
has to live with all its cells, each accumulating damage and each changing
more and more as time goes on from the starting genotype.

Cells can escape non-genetic damage such as goop like lipofuscin by
outgrowing it, growing and dividing faster than the goop accumulates.  Or
when a cell divides, the goop can end up mostly in one cell, and the
other becomes heathier.  An animal, of course, stops growing, and goop
accumulates.  Single-celled organisms like bacteria and gametes can use
these strategies to escape aging.

These are telomeres.  In the worms in the paper, C. elegans, the cells
divide in an exactly choregraphed pattern and then stop dividing when the
worm becomes an adult.  These initial adult cells age during the aging of
the worm.  Because of this, telomeres aren't thought to play a role in
worm aging.

In dividing cells with telomerase active, the telomere length is
maintained.  Having telomerase on is not 'expensive', but has drawbacks
which is likely why it isn't on in most somatic (body) cells.  Aging of
the body's tissues is partially due to declining numbers and turnover of
frequently replaced cells, and partially due to accumulating damage to
the stem cells and permanent cells.

This doesn't happen, AFAIK.

### OK, you don't want to pay. You won't let me kill the bad guy (who, say,
killed my wife). What do you want to do? Let him go free, and keep killing?
Maybe make me pay for the incarceration? Let the incarcerated starve if they
can't come up with the cash?

Which solution do you propose?

### I pay taxes, too. Will you let me opt out of paying the taxes going for
the sustenance of murderers, or do you want to force me to pay for your
moral convictions?

Murderers in prison couldn't defray even a small fraction of the
incarceration cost even if they happily worked full-time, for many reasons.

### Good. I am not trying to convince you killing is good, merely to

 How egg-beater at sea could end drought and war

 By Anthony Browne, Environment Editor
 
 FIRST, people danced in circles, then meteorologists tried sprinkling crystals
 in the clouds. Now one of Britains leading inventors has been given a
 government grant to develop the worlds first rainmaker machine. Professor
 Stephen Salter, the Edinburgh University engineer renowned for Salters
 ducks which made energy out of waves, believes that his wind-driven cloud
 maker could finally give man control over the weather and bring agriculture to
 the deserts. Done on a large enough scale, he claims, it could reverse the
 advance of deserts, stop sea levels rising and end the Middle East conflict. 
 
 The rainmaker uses wind power to drive a 200ft high turbine that sucks water
 out of the sea, and turns it into water vapour through nozzles, spraying it
 out into the atmosphere, creating clouds. Professor Salter, 62, dismisses the
 incredulity of many colleagues. They said you couldnt make ships out of
 steel. They said Marconis radio waves couldnt broadcast beyond the horizon.
 The Establishment is almost always wrong, he said. 
 
 He has persuaded the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to
 take his idea seriously enough to award a £105,000 development grant. 
 
 The rain makers, described as looking like giant egg-beaters, would be based
 on catamarans and placed off the coast of desert land. They could be placed
 where they were most needed, depending on the weather patterns. 
 
 They would not work in areas that were too dry because the artificial clouds
 would never generate the critical mass needed. They would be used in areas
 where there were already some clouds but not enough to produce rain. 
 
 The machine uses an existing design known as a Darius turbine, a vertical axis
 turbine that spins around driven by the wind. The turbine blades have water
 pipes inside them, with an inlet just below the surface of the sea. The
 centrifugal force of the spinning blades sucks the water out of the sea and
 propels it nearly 200ft up inside the blades. It is then forced out of
 nozzles, creating a spray that turns to vapour. The salt from the sea water
 crystallises out and falls back to the sea. 
 
 The professor calculates that the machine would produce a cubic metre of water
 for one fifth of a US cent, one thousandth the cost of water produced by
 electrical desalination of sea water. 
 
 Israel is dependent on the West Bank occupation, he says, because it provides
 40 per cent of its water. The rain maker could end that dependency and help to
 end the conflict. He also calculates that if hundreds of thousands of machines
 were used for many years they would transfer so much water from the sea to the
 land that they would reduce sea levels by up to 3ft, reversing the rising
 levels caused by global warming. 
 
 Salters ducks, which bob up and down on the sea producing electricity from
 waves, generated huge public interest in the 1970s but were killed off when
 the Government pursued nuclear power. Professor Salter realises his new
 invention may also come to nothing, but insists it is worth a try.

The usual figure is that it's more expensive to kill someone (and deal with
death row appeals) than to just leave them in jail for life.

As for you, how much of your own money will you pay to the families of
convicts who were executed and then found innocent?  Will you accept being
killed yourself, to satisfy the feeilings of the victimized families?

Of course not.

I don't understand why you see incredulous at this most obvious
solution.  If someone is not willing to produce value, then is
that not the same as choosing to die by starvation?

Since they will have a very large debt to pay, it will be a long
time before a typical murderer can 'go free'.

Note that my assumption is that a criminal justice system based on
restitution will win out in a free market for justice.  This may
not be the case, but if it is, the emphasis will be repaying the
harmed party.  This model is stretched by murder, but I don't think
it's entirely broken.

Death row incarceration is only more expensive because death row
inmates are one to a cell, while lifers are two to a cell, and
infrastructure and operations costs in prisons are generally scaled on
a per cell basis, outside of food and laundry, etc which are
negligible. Death rowers are kept one to a cell so that they are less
at risk of being killed by a fellow inmate, reserving their death for
the just action of the state. If you eliminate this bias, lifers and
death rowers would cost the same.

Mostly to do with current penal architecture policy. If you build a
Coventry style prison (as envisioned by Heinlein), prisoners could be
profit makers for the state. Some state prison systems are
self-sustaining in the industrial output they create.

### Just put a check-box on my tax form, allowing me to donate money to kill
murderers. I (and a lot of other similarly irrational, bloodthirsty humans)
will happily pay a nice sum for every head rolling off the guillotine.

### The direct damages (monetary), plus non-economic losses, up to the
current cap (probably about 250 000 $ in today's money). No problem. It
would be clearly my duty to pay (and then ruthlessly punish those
responsible for the miscarriage of justice that occurred).

By the way, I fully agree with Greg Burch, who is against the death penalty
as currently practiced, with insufficient degree of certainty. The standard
for considering the death penalty must be much higher than the standard for
incarceration.

### I accept the risk of being unfairly accused and executed myself,
therefore I am already paying for my pleasure with real blood. Since the
execution of an innocent would not be the result of my premeditated,
malicious action, I would never be even partially liable for murder, merely
complicity in a negligent application of the law, an offense not punishable
by death.

### Say, I have video footage from the cameras I have in my house. The
murderer was bitten by my dog, there is his DNA splashed around the living
room, the neighbor's cameras filmed him and his car arriving at my house and
then leaving. All other evidence checks out. The guy admitted he did it,
said he felt restless, was stoned, needed some fun. He even gives access
codes to his own cameras, showing exactly what he did. Do you think a jury
might not feel justified in concluding *with certainty* that he did it?

I've said for a while that the death penalty, as it is currently
ajudicated in the US, is demonstrated to have little or no deterrent
effect on crime or murder in particular, while execution of criminals
by their victims or eye witnesses at the crime scene (otherwise known
as self defense) does have a demonstrated deterrent effect on all
crime.

Two million or more crimes a year are prevented by such means (not
necessarily actual execution, merely the visual threat of such),
according to survey studies, while even the FBI, based on crime
statistics, is certain that at least 90,000 and possibly as many as
600,000 crimes a year are prevented by such means.

I think that some crimes which fit not just a 'without reasonable
doubt', but a virtual certainty standard of proof, (i.e. caught at the
crime scene AND witnessed/recorded committing the act AND material
evidence corroborating same) should not be required to follow the drawn
out legal process that we currently have to protect the rights of those
who are arrested under mere suspicion or due to circumstantial
evidence.

For example, if the Beltway Snipers were caught at the scene of a
sniping with the murder weapon and with surveillance video records of
their act, determining their guilt should only be a matter of selecting
a jury and voting on the evidence, with no drawn out appeals process,
execution within one year of conviction.

Furthermore, multiple non-coerced confessions to non-law enforcement
individuals should also be considered to be a 'certainty' degree of
culpability.

For non-certainty convicts, they should have an option for cryonic
suspension available if the convict can raise funds for such
(considering the amounts paid for defense lawyers and for
incarceration, suspension would be a minor consideration). If a
suspended convict is not cleared within a decade they are thawed and
declared dead. 

If cleared, they obviously have the option to be revived at a later
date and ought to have a sum of money put aside for their use upon
their revival. Those either suspended or imprisoned who are wrongfully
convicted should have the right to be compensated for their treatment
in a fair manner. Currently most states which have released wrongfully
convicted prisoners generally give them no more than $50 or so.

It has been my experience, having a number of friends who have worked
as criminal defense attorneys, and having known a few rather squirrelly
characters who have needed such at one time or another, that instances
of individuals being wrongly convicted are very much few and far
between. Most all who get off generally do so on technicalities, not
because they are actually innocent. This isn't an empirical statement,
just one man's experience.

I don't think it is really that difficult a problem, multicell
organisms do it all the time. It's called cellular differentiation, and
it is genetically coded. The human genome fits into 4 CD-ROMs, and an
automobile is a far more simple device than the human body. I'll bet
that you could evolve the code for the genome for a 007 Aston-Martin in
less than 100 megabytes.

The problem with conventional software development is that all current
applications are built by intention according to design rules, not by
evolutionary processes. A nanoswarm design process will give the design
for an auto to a neural network computer and allow it to evolve the
most effective cellular differentiation process to achieve the desired
design within the virtual environment. The most successful evolved
process becomes the code for the nano-swarm.

While I think that Spudboy meant 'nihilistic leftists', not narcissitic
(entirely opposite states, btw), he is essentially correct. Those who
are in the peace movement have taken the pacifist mantra to ludicrous
extremes and automatically assume anything that the US government does,
especially any GOP US government, is automatically evil and to be
opposed. They want the US to totally disarm, to not even respond to
attacks here at home because we so obviously deserve to be attacked for
our alleged past injustices.

I've parked my car to talk to some of these types who maintain a near
24/7 vigil near the busiest onramp to I-89 here in Lebanon, and are
generally Dartmouth students, here. Their grasp of logic and reality is
very badly skewed by the propaganda of Chomsky and others of the sort.
They are also heavily involved in the anti-extropic luddite and
anti-globalization movements which have been shown to be funded by
groups which also are known to fund insurgency and terrorist groups
around the world (like al Qaeda) from Latin America to Europe to the
muslim world.

I'd also like to point out that in the past year, groups like ELF and
ALF have changed their tactics from attacks on property to attacks on
persons. Executives and scientists with companies which conduct testing
on animals and introducing GM products have come under attack from
bombers and bat weilding gangs. In one example, one individual involved
in research that uses stapleguns on animals was attacked with a bomb
impregnated with hundreds of nails. Another animal researcher was
beaten to death by three hooded individuals with baseball bats (no
personal property was taken).

My earlier calls last year for more forceful action against the luddite
movement were rebuffed by many who claimed that the luddites had not
committed sufficient degrees of violence to justify such response. In
light of recent events, what sort of excuse do you now make?

I suppose that would make me a bed whore, since most beds say that to
me, and sleeping is one of my favorite activities.

Those mornings where the sun is streaming in and warming you, and you
feel like you are on a tryptophan/dopamine trip, and no alarm clock is
nagging you.... I've often wondered if I was addicted to sleeping...

Of course, I'm one of those people who can fall asleep almost anywhere.
Back in my Air Force days, I'd often fall asleep in the back of the
crew van whilst parked at the end of the runway, waiting for our planes
to land, while C-130s, C-141s, and C-5's were roaring by, less than 200
feet away.... The other guys in the van would marvel at my abilities...

These days, after working four ten hour days in the garage, I typically
go to sleep saturday afternoon after work (4pm) and don't wake up til
noon the next day.

       I used to do something similar in the plane if I was off duty.  I 
could sleep in the noisiest places but let that pilot touch the engine

there was a problem (there never was) or if I should prepare for landing or

Excuse me?  Are you seriously trying to say that you think
anti-globalization and luddite groups are funded by al Queda?  Or that
they draw funding from the same source?  

Would you care to present any evidence for this rather extreme
assertion?

Certainly neural networks and evolutionary software design have their
uses and advantages, but they do not address my concern about the
computational cost of simulating these systems.  Either an NN approach
or an evolutionary software approach would multiply the required
computational cost by many orders of magnitude.  

This is something that's commonly missed by those who propose NNs or
(especially) evolved code to solve a problem.  These approaches take
incredible amounts of time to train or evolve, and that time rises as
a steep function of the complexity of the problem you're applying them
too.

Yes, as in people who utilize others' property without
permission---indeed they are less well off.

Yes, that's better than my example.  In my example,
after all, the loss in benefit to those who cannot
freely use that which "belongs" to others is more
than compensated for by the benefit to all that
eventually obtains from the maintenance of private
property.

But this applies to your example too:  probably there
are (or have been) some possible societies in which
slavery enhanced everyone's well being, even though
it was bad for some (the slaves).  Of course, I don't
know of any examples, but Thomas Jefferson might 
argue with us.

True, as a generality.  But how does one weigh the
costs and benefits?  The axiom of private property
is much more objective.  Of course, some people will
retort that the Central Committee utilizing the best
Scientific Data can decide when the principle of
private property has to be sacrificed because of
the interests of some people.

But to *me* it's extremely ethical to raise cattle for slaughter,
for example.  Consider the alterative: people stop raising cattle
and they go practically extinct!  Now what would a *true* advocate
of animal rights want?  He or she would want the greatest possible
benefit for his or her clients.  Clearly, that does not mean 
extinction, but ever more numbers (and with ever less suffering,
of course).  But alas, we have all these charlatans who only
pretend to be animal advocates, because they don't understand
the reality of the situation.

I know what you mean.  It's like when you see the name of
the group contained the word "Concerned", e.g., "Concerned
Physicians".  It sort of gives away their ideological stance.

OH!  Self-deception.  Oh yes, I agree.  But I thought
that you were talking about lying.  I really think of
self-deception along with delusion as being the 
maintenance of false belief---and we are all subject
to that from time to time.

Do you really know of any people who are out and out
lying?  (I think that there are some, I just cannot
think of any or do not know of any.)

Yes, it is with great embarrassment that I admit
to agreeing with the logical positivists on this
one.

I will revise my view (and think that perhaps I
already did earlier):  "X is morally wrong" is also
coded talk for "X is not only stridently disagreed
with by me, but also by the great majority of people
that you know and the great majority people in our
society and probably other societies".  In that, I
find it an acceptable abbreviation, except in careful
philosophical discussions, where some might think that
the is/ought barrier is being breached, or suppose that
the speaker depends on a Higher Power or something for
his values.

Ever since Voltaire (at least) there have been those
of principle that might disagree with something without
wishing it to be outlawed.  I disapprove of discourtesy,
for example.

I don't think that this is quite logical.  To use my
example again, I do not believe that discourteous
behavior is ever necessary (except in very rare
cases), and so in fact believe that it leads to
outcomes Y which I find also bad (e.g., greater
incivility and more violence).  But that's not why
I would hate to see discourtesy prohibited by law.
Obviously, it's just too difficult to enforce a
prohibition on discourtesy, and it would also lead
to diminished freedom of action.

Hear, hear!  We can encode our near-unanimous agreements
in laws.  In fact, failure to do so for a well-known
class of conduct is disastrous for societies.

Question:  does my avowal that "It is MORALLY WRONG that x!"
means only "I and most people disapprove of x" make me a
moral relativist?

I don't recall expressing this opinion.  The fact is that I'm deeply
ambivalent about the death penalty.  Some opinions from my current
mind-set: 1) I certainly think that an individual has a right to
self-defense and that killing in real self-defense isn't murder; 2) I
think that there must be very high procedural and substantive safeguards
in any judicial system that would carry out the death penalty; 3)
Jurisdictions that have reason to doubt the integrity of their criminal
justice system (like Illinois) do the right thing by imposing a
moratorium on executions; 4) it can't be right to put people at risk of
the death penalty without having the most effective possible defense
counsel, which presents serious challenges to the system of
publicly-funded defense as it's currently practiced in most (but not
all) American jurisdictions.

All of this leaves to the side the deeper moral question of the
propriety of the death penalty in even an ideal judicial system, a
question I don't have the time to address at this point ...

I suspect that the weight you put on "only", in that sentence, is 
asserting the nonexistence of *something*, but it's not quite clear what. 
  It's possible that the something you assert the nonexistence of makes 
you a moral relativist.

For example, if I avowed that "It is UNTRUE that X!" means only "I and 
most people disbelieve in X", I would be a relativist.  If I innocently 
noticed that disbelief and untruth have *something* to do with each other, 
I would have uncovered a critical fact about the nature and referent of 
this thing called "truth", but not the only critical fact.

Another critical fact about this thing called "truth" is that people 
sometimes go from believing things are true to believing they are untrue. 
  What is it that causes you to go from approving of something to 
disapproving of it?

HU'S ON FIRST
By James Sherman

(We take you now to the Oval Office, as National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice enters to give
the president his daily briefing)
George: Condi! Nice to see you. What's happening?
Condi: Sir, I have the report here about the new leader of China.
George: Great. Lay it on me.
Condi: Hu is the new leader of China.
George: That's what I want to know.
Condi: That's what I'm telling you.
George: That's what I'm asking you. Who is the new leader of China?
Condi: Yes.
George: I mean the fellow's name.
Condi: Hu.
George: The guy in China.
Condi: Hu.
George: The new leader of China.
Condi: Hu.
George: The Chinaman!
Condi: Hu is leading China.
George: Now whaddya' asking me for?
Condi: I'm telling you Hu is leading China.
George: Well, I'm asking you. Who is leading China?
Condi: That's the man's name.
George: That's who's name?
Condi: Yes.
George: Will you or will you not tell me the name of the new leader of 
China?
Condi: Yes, sir.
George: Yassir? Yassir Arafat is in China? I thought he was in the 
Middle East.
Condi: That's correct.
George: Then who is in China?
Condi: Yes, sir.
George: Yassir is in China?
Condi: No, sir.
George: Then who is?
Condi: Yes, sir.
George: Yassir?
Condi: No, sir.
George: Look, Condi. I need to know the name of the new leader of
China. Get me the Secretary General of the U.N. on the phone.
Condi: Kofi?
George: No, thanks.
Condi: You want Kofi?
George: No.
Condi: You don't want Kofi.
George: No. But now that you mention it, I could use a glass of milk.
And then get me the U.N.
Condi: Yes, sir.
George: Not Yassir! The guy at the U.N.
Condi: Kofi?
George: Milk! Will you please make the call?
Condi: And call who?
George: Who is the guy at the U.N?
Condi: Hu is the guy in China.
George: Will you stay out of China?!
Condi: Yes, sir.
George: And stay out of the Middle East! Just get me the guy at the U.N.
Condi: Kofi.
George: All right! With cream and two sugars. Now get on the phone.
(Condi picks up the phone.)
Condi: Rice, here.
George: Rice? Good idea. And a couple of egg rolls, too. Maybe we should 
send some to the guy in China. And the Middle East. Can you get Chinese 
food in the Middle East?

Austin is the occasionaly manic shareware author of the remarkable X-Plane series of flight sims 
(modleing type) for Mac and Windows. Don't know if WINE or Lindows or such works with his code; it's 
OpenGL-centric and loves CPU cycles and as much AGP graphics card as you can throw at it. His new (and, 
for the moment, free) development seemed extroid (extropoid would be extropian-anthropoid, right?) enough 
to post. LENSMAN 2k2! Haiii-YAH!

Sheesh. Phenomenology-epistemology time again.

Damien, can you bring yourself to acknowledge that there are circumstances where (to the degree one can 
aver that *anything* ever really happened), it is possible for a husband to be as correct that Miscreant X 
killed his wife as it is possible for a man or woman to be correct that he or she has just cut himself or 
herself shaving?

MMB, puzzled by the fact that on the aggregate, circumstantial evidence, witness recall, testimony and 
juries *all* have error rates that would warrant a _product_ recall if a multinational was caught selling 
them...

PS: I can't believe I let myself get sucked into this thread.

I should have left out the word "only" and should have
written "mean" instead of "means".

I agree that that is a reasonable way to use the words.

Morality for me is like data fitting.  I definitely and
determinably disapprove of (all other things being equal)
people starving, kittens undergoing torture, and stupid
actions being more rewarded than intelligent ones, to
mention only a few.  From the set of data points like these,
I generalize, and decide my approvals and disapprovals on
the basis of similarity.  In deciding a new situation,
whether, for example, a duplicate should die, I can only
strive for consistency and to approve or disapprove so
as to minimize the tension between particular cases.

So I change my mind when less familiar cases come to 
seem more similar to certain cases than they did before.
Sometimes this results from new information, e.g., we
may learn something about brain function that makes
a class of experience appear to more closely resemble
some particular different case than it used to.

For example, consider the thought experiment of an ur-society
consisting of just a man and a woman (on an island, say).
They can choose between (a) having no children (b) having
a child, but then painlessly killing him at age 12.  Upon
reflection (many would say too much reflection), and letting
X be the personality of the child, then (a) comes to 
resemble X never having a chance at life at all, and never
having any good experiences, while (b) comes to resemble
someone's life which, though good while it lasted, ceased
to attain immortality.  So in ur-society, as is so often
the case, life turns out to be better than death, and choice
(a) is what I approve of.

Since your foregoing example, logic, and good word usage
suggests that I am a moral relativist, I mainly wonder why
most moral relativists seem to me to stand for nothing at
all, and to have no strong preferences.  They might approve
of sati in India, and disapprove of exactly the same process
---incinerating a woman---elsewhere.

I think that capital punishment---in those societies that
choose to exercise it---has profit potential.  The state
might raffle off tickets for who gets to pull the switch
on an extremely notorious murderer or rapist.  Or merely
let it go to the highest bidder, allowing corporate
sponsors and group contributions for one particular 
candidate.  Executions really should turn a profit.

This would be greatly facilitated by a television documentary
to hype (though staying within the bounds of the truth, of
course) the actual acts of the perpetrator.  People who get
really angry---and in my opinion rightfully so---at some
hideous act committed by a criminal, will be willing to 
spend more.

Still, there is a finite non-zero probability that you 
have the wrong man.  To imitate those who reason from
that fact that capital punishment is wrong because
mistakes can be made, perhaps they would be happier if
criminals weren't locked up or punished in any way.
After all, since there is a finite chance that someone
sentenced to a long jail term really is innocent, what
right does the state have in punishing him?  After all,
you can't really ever give him back those years spent
in jail.

If there was a possibility on a tax sheet for you to opt out I would of
course not prevent you from doing so. I am no militant fighter for *any*
rights.

This leaves me speechless and I really feel sorry for this brutalization and
degradation (German:Verwahrlosung) of thinking. I hope you will never
be able to become a person of influence in your future demarchy. It is a
shabby (in German: schaebig) attitude to reduce an issue of life and death
to the almost insignificantly low share of your taxes to keep a murderer
alive. Everybody has to pay taxes and almost any citizen feels that some tax
shares would be better invested if..and if...and if...

But as the "just" killing of a murderer is common law in the USA your stance
only mirrors the dangerously revengeful state of mind of a paranoid,
belligerent and *proud* society, where supporters of peace are regarded
as luddite morons, paid by Islamic terrorists - as Mike Lorrey ran amok
recently.

In Germany for example it is social approval that there should be no death
penalty. There is no movement seriously trying to reestablish death penalty.
Of course there are occasional voices who vote for it especially when a
child was abused and murdered, but generally is is consensus not to execute
convicted murderers. Nobody seriously discusses the issue of reintroducing
capital punishment.

I must say I am really glad to live in a society where the sustenance of
convicted murderers fortunately is common law. I think this is a very
important step for people to learn, that the attitude of "an eye for an eye"
- even if it is comprehensible in the face of a terrible crime -  belongs to
mythical ages and does not fit into a modern, enlightend society.

This is quite amazing.  (By the way, this candid confession
is not intended to provoke rants from anyone on how parochial
I am, and on how narrow and stupid is my understanding of
everything.)  You really mean that every newspaper appeared
to be biased in its own way?  You mean *none* of them appeared
to present news in a fashion that did not allow you to draw
conclusions as to the ideological sympathies of the writer?
While one only sometimes finds it in the U.S., one can find
it.  In fact, I think that in at least one story on the front
page of a major American newspaper, you cannot tell the
political persuasion of the writer, nor whether he or she
is at all pro- or anti-American.

An example or two, so that I can get the idea?

Totally amazing.  So you are saying that all the right-wing
rags, all the left-wing socialist (actually communist, let's
face it) rags, and everything from Lyndon LaRouche, Noam
Chomsky, Rush Limbaugh, and Bill Press all have a certain
definable something in common?  You're right:  it's invisible
to me.  What in heck is it?  Can you say?

Observe how well this fits a point made by Anders in another
thread ("Culture", Mon 11/25/2002 7:58 AM):

     If one looks at surveys of cultural dimensions, the US
     is clearly more individualistic than European countries,
     and there are more complex differences in uncertainty
     avoidance and traditionalism. 

     To take a typical example, American CVs are regarded by
     Europeans as boastful, padded and giving an exaggerated
     image of the person.  While European CVs in the US are
     regarded as too humble, giving the impression of mediocrity.
     Similarly at scientific conferences, American researchers 
     usually strongly delineate their conclusions with few
     qualifiers, expecting the audience to provide the
     balancing criticism, while ***European (especially
     Scandinavian) researchers mention all issues and problems,
     expecting the audience to give constructive criticism on how 
     to reach stronger conclusions.***

(Italics added.)  Indeed it appears that "community
spirit" is more widespread outside the U.S., and in
more ways than one!

> Every country will naturally emphasize local issues,
> but America is big enough, strong enough, and involved
> enough in world issues that the disparity is glaring.

Don't forget the history:  American cultural institutions
developed in relative isolation, and that the American
mind-set is less cosmopolitan isn't too much of a surprise.

> I'm happy to be an American, and proud of my country's
> strengths, but international awareness is one area in
> general where we do need improvement.

Why are you proud?  Did you personally contribute to
any of America's strengths, or feel like you did?

But to re-iterate the most important question in another
way:  how can it be that in a nation of 290 million
people, with enormous liberties of the press, that any
particular slant taken by some (say Japanese) foreign
newspaper is not mirrored by some point on the political
spectrum within the U.S. itself?

Thanks,

I don't think that "It is MORALLY WRONG that x!" is equivalent with "I and 
most people disapprove of x", but if I did, I would probably say something 
like this:

"Starting from only "I and most people disapprove of x", I can construct a 
description of "It is MORALLY WRONG that x!" which accounts for everything 
that I and most people mean by MORALLY WRONG."

If you said that, I might *disagree* with you, but I don't think it would 
automatically make you a moral relativist - your description might account 
for the existence of the very same phenomena that it would make you a 
moral relativist to deny.

Personally, I don't think the relation between "disapproval" and "MORALLY 
WRONG" is such that "disapproval" is the simple phenomenon from which 
"MORALLY WRONG" is constructed.  But it would be interesting to see such 
an attempted description.

A non-exhaustive list of some phenomena that I think would need to be 
explained:

* The existence of perceived higher and lower quality in alternative 
moralities;
* Widespread agreement about such quality in at least some cases;
* The ability of an individual to consider and agree with an argument for 
a higher-quality alternative morality to the one currently possessed;
* The ability of humans to communicate such arguments among themselves;
* The use of the semantics of objectivity in moral argument.

The explanation can take more than one form; for example, you could 
attempt to show that the phenomena above arise from subjective perceptions 
that *do* have real referents, but that the referents are phenomena 
constructed from "I approve of X" or "I disapprove of X".  Or you might 
show that the phenomena above arise from subjective perceptions that are 
cognitive illusions existing for such-and-such a reason.  One is 
"explaining", the other is "explaining away".  Explaining morality doesn't 
make you a moral relativist.  Explaining away morality probably would.  Of 
course, explaining away morality doesn't make you *wrong* unless the 
explanation is *incorrect*.  My own work attempts to explain morality, 
rather than explain it away, so I tend to be highly skeptical of moral 
relativism; but I could be wrong.

At the very least, it seems likely that you explain at least some of the 
phenomena which central exemplars of the "moral relativist" category 
attempt to explain away.  In fact, it seems likely that among the 
phenomena which moral relativists attempt to explain away are agreement 
about disapproval, the existence of any self-consistent position from 
which to communicate disapproval or take social action based on 
disapproval, and perhaps even disapproval itself.

I will ask you the same question, essentially.  How much of
your own money will you pay to the individuals who were
imprisoned for decades and then found innocent?  Will you
accept being incarcerated yourself, to satisfy the feelings
of the victimized individual and his close relations?

I would not make such a strong statement. While many non-US cultures are 
far more collectivist and emphasize altruism to a high degree, 
"community spirit" is a fairly noticeable US culture trait. Maybe it is 
something which is enschrined rather more than practiced, but I get the 
impression that it is still more prevalent than in many other places. 
One reason might be the short historic distance to the frontier culture, 
where it was far more needed, and the community-based social 
institutions which have been codified.

Maybe because the mainstream does not encompass the full complexity of
views, and in fact tends to represent a certain subspace of views?  The
US has a far more diverse mainstream than many other countries, due to
its size and individualist emphassis, but it is not arbitrary.  Certain
views are too weird, too far out, too controversial or simply "do not
fit", and are hence less reported. What we see in media define what we
consider to be mainstream subjects. Since journalists and editors get
their impressions of the world through the media too, they will tend
judge new things by comparing them to the known, setting up a filtering
feedback effect. A kind of spontaneous bias.

There are likely reflections of any outside view somewhere within the 
US. But is it published in something widely read?

I have recently started a danish transumanist website. For that purpose 
I daily read through all the sci-tech news I can find on the web.

I choose the articles based on a "feel" that they have some relation to 
transhumanistic goals.

I then pick out som items from the list, which I research further and do 
a writeup in Daniish for my own website.

But I got the idea that I could share my collected newslist here, with 
only a little extra effort.

Does this format have any interrest here? Or should I drop the idea?

http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&CID=1051-120302A

What are the things that can be done that cause prosperity? Prosperity
depends on growth, so economists want to understand how to improve the
performance of low-growth countries. However, our knowledge is
frustratingly incomplete. Certainly, there is no simple, one-dimensional
answer.

Life 'began on the ocean floor'
===============================

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2541393.stm

A new and controversial theory on the origin of life on Earth is causing a
stir among scientists. And one of the implications is that life could be
more likely on planets where it was previously thought unlikely to
flourish.



Mars rover inspires toy robot
=============================

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2535917.stm

Drawing inspiration from the US space agency's Mars rover, scientists in
the US are working on creating a robot that can teach children about
science.



Molecular memory bank draws closer

Promising Vaccination Approach Using DNA, Oral Delivery Gets Booster
====================================================================

http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-3

Two major problems with vaccination, the use of live or dead viruses and
the use of injection delivery, could soon be history thanks to new
technology that also offers hope for expanding the number of diseases
against which vaccines are effective.



Exercise improves blood vessel function in patients with coronary artery

http://www.lef.org/news/nutrition/2002/12/02/eng-essentialfats/eng-essentialfats_011948_6377574833709460124.html

Exercise is inversely related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in both men
and women, even after controlling for other CVD risk factors (smoking,
overweight, etc). This means that the more you exercise, the less likely
you are to get CVD. Even among patients who already have CVD, exercise
lowers mortality (reduces chance of death).



Extrasolar Planet Twice as Big as Jupiter
=========================================

http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20021202/hubble.html

After two years of painstaking research, scientists have determined the
precise size of a planet beyond our solar system by measuring tiny shifts
in the tilt of light coming from its parent star.


Japanese automakers deliver their first hydrogen-powered cars to California
===========================================================================

http://abcnews.go.com/sections/scitech/DailyNews/fuelcellcars021203_wire.html

California, home to the nation's toughest smog-limiting laws, became a
proving ground Monday for the first commercial cars to run on pollution-
free fuel cells.



Space Station's Total Cost Remains an Elusive Number
====================================================

http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/iss_cost_011201.html

When President Reagan first proposed it, the International Space Station
was supposed to cost $8 billion. Through the years, that number climbed
like a rocket, even though the station design shrank in size and scope. At
one point, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm,
estimated the bill for the orbiting research platform and the shuttle
flights to support it was approaching $100 billion.



US Falling Behind in Stem Cell Research
=======================================

http://abcnews.go.com/wire/SciTech/reuters20021203_670.html

WASHINGTON (Reuters Health) - With the Bush administration's refusal to
fully fund embryonic stem cell research, the US is falling behind in the
effort to find a cure for a range of diseases, one of the nation's leading
scientists and entrepreneurs said on Tuesday.

### There are some substantial problems with this approach. Very wealthy
murderers could go free very quickly, unless the penalty was adjusted to fit
the murderer's resources. I doubt that incarcerated murderers would be
physically capable of paying for the incarceration and restitution. Unless
you add some more features to this system you will have a limited deterrent
and a financial loss.

### Should I have a choice between joining a protection agency which would
ruthlessly pursue and kill somebody who kills me (and take all his money),
vs. joining an agency which merely extracts some money from him, I'd choose
the former. I agree with you that the free market for justice is a great
idea, and I do not doubt that many alternatives would flourish there, from
starry-eyed do-godies, to the heavily armed touch-me-nots.

This is hilarious (no put-down intended).  *The* principle
difference between libertarians and others is their notion
of personal responsibility.  Even in the U.S. (of course)
it's not held to be the consumers' fault for believing
misleading advertising, but rather the government's for not
forcing advertisers to give "correct" impressions of
scientific facts.

It didn't occur to me until Anders' paragraph above that
whether or not something is widely read is anyone's fault
except the audience's.  In other words, I take it for
granted, for example, that the mainstream press in the
U.S. has great liberal bias, and so I seek serious
explanations elsewhere.  Yes, I admit that when I'm lazy
this doesn't work well.

Yes, I'll grant that "community spirit" is an inaccurate

Yes, which does explain so many European/American differences.

Yes, and I have never been able to imagine how it could
be any different.  People will freely choose what they
want to read.  True, it's unfortunate when only one 
point of view *tends* to dominate a medium, such as talk
radio or major newspapers.

Thanks for the explanation.  I was about to ask why!  ;-)

So what have I learned?  On one possible reading of Jef
Albright's original paragraph

  Having lived and travel in Japan and Asia for a few years, I found it very
  interesting to read the international newspapers and see a completely
  different set of biases on American news events.  Traveling from country to
  country, each newspaper was visibly biased in its own way, and it was almost
  shocking to be able to compare and see from that perspective how the
  American news sources deliver their product in a way that looks very much
  like propaganda to an outsider.

there is a monolithic interpretation of events in mainstream
publications within *any* country; it just didn't become so
glaring until he traveled.

But then his next paragraph

  This comes across especially strongly when you see what the US mainstream
  papers do *not* print because it would be contrary to, or question,
  "American values" and diminish the enjoyable entertainment value of the
  paper to their US audience.

becomes more obscure, because this paragraph tends to imply that
it's something peculiar to the U.S.  So far in my attempt to get
all this straight, all I see peculiar about the U.S. is its
relative emphasis on individuality, which is not the same thing.
Perhaps the key is in his phrase "entertainment value".  Maybe
what is perceived is that there is a more strident ideological
"serious" tone to foreign newspapers.  But gee, that would mean
that U.S. papers are *less* ideological, and so closer to being
objective!  Phew!  This is all still quite obscure to me.

### Use Rawl's veil and economic performance optimization. Rawl's veil is a
very strong argument against allowing situations where a sentient is owned -
most of us would be horrified by the idea of finding themselves in somebody
else's computer, and being tortured without recourse to the law that
protects other sentients, but we would not be so horrified by a restriction
on owning of other sentients, be it slaves, or sentient volition-enabled
programs and copies of sentients. No need for a Committee, just an informed
peek into the human nature.

By "translate", Peter, I meant to be taking the speaker's
intent into account.  Since to me "X is wrong" is so
muddled, I refuse to be so charitable and go so far as

Well, yes, it may be the case that that is what the
speaker would like to claim by "X is wrong", if it
happened to occur to him or her, but that's not what
people usually *mean* by "X is wrong".  Like I say,
it usually means only that IMO their epistemology
or ontology is screwed up.

### Excellent suggestions! I would add the sales of pieces of the hangman's
noose, and other paraphernalia, as well as the auctioning of the murderer's
body, fresh off the gallows, to the waiting transplant surgeons. Perhaps
this would make legal killing a financially self-sustaining venture, as
opposed to being merely a pricey way of achieving catharsis. Kudos to Lee
here.

### Actually, we can extend this line of reasoning further - maybe if a
murderer is executed, he is not really dead - there is a finite non-zero
probability that he is being taken to the transtemporal re-education camp
run by advanced beings from the future, and we are actually doing him a
favor by hastening his meeting with the sublime. Imagine how cheated you
might feel, being a German serial murderer, who spent 50 years of his life
in a miserable prison, while his American buddies were already frolicking
with ethereal superintelligence.

I'm opposed to the death penalty for two reasons:
A) The system might make mistakes.
B) I prefer a system which bases justice on results,
rather than intentions.  Given this, it is conceivable
that I (or any other person) might end up causing an
accident which kills someone and find myself in the
same position as anyone else found guilty of causing
a death.

Yes, I understand that what I've mentioned is not a complete
system.  I would expect a more fully realized system from an
actual provider of justice/protection services.

...and I would prefer a system which did no irreversible things in
any event, for a very wide meaning of reversible.

 I assume that there are wide variations from problem to problem in the
costs of experiments and in the value of simulation, so that there won't
be any point where "the" cost of experiments drops below "the" cost of
simulation.
 You seem to be extrapolating from drug development. There may be some
steps in the development of an assembler for which that is a good analogy,
but I see two reasons for suspecting it underestimates the value of
simulation:
 Drug developers have already tested most well-known molecules (i.e. picked
the low-lying fruit). Assembler designers won't have a similar reason for
avoiding well-known molecules for a while.
 Drug developers do their hardest experiments on clinical trials, because
they need to deal with a system (the human body) that is too complex to
simulate well. Assembler designers have some ability to choose their
system so that it can be mostly analyzed by simulating subsystems.

### You are misunderstanding me if you think it's all about petty cash. I
object to the violation of my freedom, the brutal imposition of alien
ethics, inherent in the taxation for the purpose of sustaining murderers.
The reason why I mentioned money in the first place was a conciliatory
gesture - a willingness to forgo what I see as ethically well-grounded
extermination of creatures which by their own actions put themselves beyond
the ethics of cooperative reciprocal interactions that forms our society.
All I wanted in return for my compromise proposal was for the pro-lifers
like you to accept the financial responsibility for your actions.

And what do I get in return? Bin ich wirklich so schaebig? Verwahrlost?

Hmmm.  It seems that Lee is adopting an extreme position here to encourage
debate rather than to refine understanding.  Once again, it feels like
manipulation rather than sincere discussion, but I'm beginning to think it's
simply how Lee likes to play the game.

Your next sentence certainly seems to indicate sarcasm, but maybe it's

Lee, I certainly didn't read EVERY paper available, nor did I mean to imply
that I did.  I was commenting on my general observations over a few years
living and traveling in Asia.  My posting was to make the point that it is
useful and enlightening to be able to see the US from outside, something
many Americans never experience.

I think virtually all of us would agree that there exists some very high
quality, minimally biased reporting in American media.  Once again, it
appears you are re-casting my posting to appear extreme.  My point was that
the mainstream American media generally present issues in a way that is
palatable to American popular tastes, and it can be very enlightening to
view these same issues from a perspective outside the US.

I think you do get the idea, and this is your way of fishing for more
targets to play with in a subsequent post.  It was a general statement about
mainstream media.  We all know that one can find alternate viewpoints in
print, radio and on the Internet.  An example would be looking at recent
mainstream newspaper articles in the US, and observing the multifront
buildup of support for war in Iraq, demonizing of Saddam, and so on, with
less than equal representation of contrasting viewpoints and analysis from
other countries.  It's natural to have this kind of popular bias in the
mainstream American media.  My point was that if you observe from other
countries outside the US, you will see strongly contrasting perspectives,
and that the American popular media can be perceived as self-serving
propaganda to an extent many Americans may be shocked to see.

You're arguing from extremes again here.  I think I was pretty clear that I
was talking about mainstream media.  I think all of us know that alternate
points of view are readily available.

Interesting how you twisted the intended meaning of that paragraph.

Actually, my observations are that Americans in general have a relatively
high level of community spirit, probably due to pioneer heritage, new world
settling dynamics, and various other factors.  But that wasn't my point at
all.

I think it was clear from my post that I was saying that many countries
outside the US see themselves as a community of countries, while they see
the US as less a member of the community of nations, and more inclined to
use its might to have its own way.

Thank you.  I think this is the one valid point you have made with regard to
my post.  I thought long and hard before making the statement that I am
proud to be an American.  I finally included it, with some misgivings,
intending to improve the balance of my message and to divert some
unanticipated unproductive attacks on grounds of patriotism.

I've thought a lot about what it means to say that one is proud of
something, and in a deep logical sense I can't really justify it.  However I
truly do feel proud of some of America's strengths, in the exact same sense
that I feel proud of my children.  However, your point is taken, it's not
the same as saying I'm proud of something I personally accomplished.

By the way, I just realized I feel the same sense of pride with regard to
some Japanese strengths (just one example).  It's the same feeling, but I
can't use the word "proud" in that case because I certainly have no claim to
being Japanese. I need another word that means identifying with
accomplishments and values of others from the perspective that we're all in
this together.  [End half-baked idea.  I need to get to work.]

Let me express one last statement before I leave this thread:

I don't know any further names and terms to paraphrase the fascistic
thinking of the dialog between Lee Corbin and Rafal Smigrodzki, which is
absolute Zero, the lowest point I've experienced on the extropy list since
1996. Sounds like two SS men are joking around. I understand, there is NO
irony involved. If there was, I would probably laugh along and shake my head
in an ironic mood about good ole capitalist profit thinking, but they MEAN
it and I feel absolutely helpless.

Don't tell me anything about freedom of thought. This is inhumane, insane,
sadistic. I sincerely hope neither one of them will ever have enough power,
money and wisdom to get to any initial state of a transhuman being. This
level of degradation and neglect - I mean the German "Verwahrlosung" - is so
fucking dangerous because it is inflaming persons who get involved in it. I
already realize how it starts eating me up and inducing me to write
statements I would rather not do in a normal situation. Once again I realize
the truth of the popular version of the famous "abyss" quote by Friedrich
Nietzsche:

"He who fights the dragon for too long, becomes a dragon himself"

So before it's too late, I quit, but not without having puked the hugest
load my guts are able to throw up.

Uh, actually, not quite.  The description is what they *should*
mean.  Unfortunately, people who write "X is morally wrong" in
careful discussion mean much more than that.  They mean that God
is on their side, or that they have deduced correct moral behavior
akin to mathematical results, or that they perceive moral correctness
the way that I perceive geographic facts when I study an atlas.

Could you tell me what you believe moral relativism to be?
(But see below.)  For once, I don't insist on what is
necessarily the common view, but what, logically and
consistently, moral relativism ought to be taken to be.

I guess that such an attempted description would allow me
to predict under what conditions the "absolutists" would
be likely to say "X is morally wrong".  It still would, to
me, mean that their epistemology is erroneous---just as,
arghh, the logical positivists would have claimed (shudder).

In my brand of relativism---definitely NOT the usual meaning
of "moral relativism" wherein the approval and disapproval
of processes depends on context or surrounding phenomena---
the "higher" is only the more consistent, and the "lower"
only the less consistent.

Though I have said this before in this thread, I see more
clearly than ever how this brings me closer to the moral
absolutists.  For example, someone such as the infamous
Charles Ng who enjoyed torturing women hitchhikers to 
death evidently does not highly disapprove of human
nervous systems being subjected to intense pain.  But he
possesses a human nervous system, and physically there is
not so much difference (IMO?) between his suffering (of
which he presumably disapproves greatly) and that of one
of his victims.  I accuse him of inconsistency.

Yes, I completely agree: in all cases, intellectually,
we want explanations of the world.  You've also captured
why I am always uncomfortable after a "moral relativist"
has spoken.

Hmm.  It's like I'm coming to the same conclusions in most
cases as the moral absolutists, it's just that my criterion,
consistency, sounds so much more wimpish than their great
annunciations.  If the "moral absolutists" would just 
immediately 'fess up that there isn't any objective place
to stand (except consistency) well, hmm, then I guess that
they wouldn't be moral absolutists.

All right, then it's starting to sound as though I (at
least) cannot be considered either a moral relativist
nor a moral absolutist.  What about you?

Roy Walford, whose mind is still as agile and quick-witted as ever, has
ALS. 

Thanks for your concern.  He is certainly one fine person.

That's a good question, and it depends on definitions. When I
think of "moral relativists", I think of those despicable
creatures who try to justify the barbaric practices of other
cultures like slavery, genital mutilation, subjugation of
women, and so on by claiming that "their culture" finds these
things acceptable.  I think that one can take your position
on moral statements by appealing to something like "most
people throughout history" while still condemning practices
of specific cultures--even slavery was disapproved of by most
people throughout history if you include the opinions of the
slaves.

I personally would much prefer to think of moral statements
as stating facts about the nature of a functioning society of
actors with certain features.  I don't think anyone's ever
been able to formulate that idea with sufficient rigor, but I
do think it's possible.

This is one of those mostly pointless perennial threads that 
washes up onto these Extropian (we hope) e-shores periodically. 
  "Absolute" Right and Wrong has no place in a 
naturalist/scientific worldview.  Only an "Absolute Being" could 
force such.  Right and wrong are of necessity contextual in that 
the terms are only meaningful in the context of real beings with 
the power to choose.  Further, the "right" or "wrong" of their 
choices can only be defined in the context of what is the "good" 
for that type of being which very much depends on the context of 
the nature of the beings in question.  Now, it might be possible 
to speak of what is universally for the good of all human beings 
or even (at a stretch) what is universally for the good of all 
sentient beings or what most services some projected notion of 
what the "Good" is.  But this gets to be a bit strained.  In any 
case the term "Absolute" concerning morality should be relegated 
to the dim past when philosophy was considered the handmaiden of 
theology.

Typical Lorrey bald generalizations abound.  There are quite 
good and thoroughly extropic as well as libertarian reasons to 
be opposed to most military actions that the US has been 
involved in in the last half-century at least.  Accusing all 
those who raise the flag of peace against war, especially 
current wars and rumors of wars, of being simpletons and 
automatically knee-jerk anti-US is spurious and uncalled for.

If you can refute Chomsky's views then that is one thing.  But 
to accuse him or those who find his arguments convincing of 
lacking in logic or grasp of reality is ridiculous.  To use the 
argument that "some of those who fund X also fund Y means that X 
should be condemned as we condemn Y" shows a poor grasp of logic 
and justice indeed.  It is a common smear tactic and should not 
be tolerated in any remotely rational discussion.  Waving the 
"Al Qaeda" flag at every opportunity is as bad as comparing 
everyting we we disapprove of to Nazi death camps.

I see, lets throw more and more flak into the air about every 
group that is offensive in the hopes that all things that offend 
Mike Lorrey will be tarred with the same brush.  Again, this is 
not reasonable.  It is rabble-rousing at its worse.

It no more makes sense to use forceful action against all you 
brand "luddite" than it makes sense to use forceful action 
against, say, all Libertarians because a few Libertarians take 
extreme and/or repulsive actions.   A reasonable grasp of 
justice is not an "excuse".  The perps of such violence will 
reap prosecution just as vigilante justice against "luddites" 
should also be prosecuted.

Did Martin Luther King or Gandhi teach "peace at any price"? 
Did those who have been on the front lines of opposing social 
injustice and working for the liberation of a people 
non-violently support "peace at any price"?  No, they put their 
lives on the line for what they believed was right.  They most 
certainly did not accept the status quo or whatever the 
non-peaceful wished without opposition in the name of "peace". 
Peace is an aspect of what we wish to acheive as often as 
possible.  It is not a free-floating abstraction divorced from 
all reality.  However, working to maximize peace consciously can 
lead to finding non-violent solutions more often than simply 
assuming violence is the best answer as many seem too easily to 
do.

Can we please stop the senseless smear campaigns against entire 
groups that run rampant on this list?

Great! The beginning looks promising. You might want to find

I found this refreshing - it admits that there is no patent medicine,
and that "fixing" something as complex as an economy or society is very
hard, without turning apathetic and saying we shouldn't try. The applet
was a nice touch, and is probably a powerful rhetorical trick.

I'm very sorry to hear that.  He certainly sounds like a courageous and
dedicated person.

ALS is also called Lou Gehrig's disease, but is probably best known today
as the affliction of physicist Stephen Hawking.  Hawking's continual
professional accomplishments demonstrate how ALS will spare the mind
even while devastating the body.

Facing a serious and progressive disease like this would be difficult
for anyone, but hopefully it would be encouraging to know that it won't
attack your mind, your inner self.  I don't know what Roy Walford's
plans are for future existence, but a cryonicist could take particular
comfort in that fact.

Typical survival times after diagnosis with ALS are about five years,
but Hawking has lasted almost 40 years so far.  He attributes this to his
diet and vitamins.  If so then this could be another source of hope for
Roy Walford.

Here here!  I agree with you completely, Samantha.  The only things
which are absolutely wrong are those things which are impossible given
the natural laws that govern the universe.

 No, there are differences between cosmetic surgery and surgery that would
make you feel better even if nobody else noticed the results, and there
are differences between surgery which makes you better than average (i.e.
increases inequality of social status) and surgery which makes the patient
more average/normal.
 There is probably some instinctive desire to use appearance as a guide
to the quality of the genes that a potential spouse might contribute. To
the extent that this is why people value pretty faces, changing one's
face seems like fraud.
 I hypothesize that the people who claim there are ethical problems with
cosmetic surgery are reluctant to come up with a clear argument because
they don't want to think clearly about the degree to which social status
matters to them.

 Here's an extropian vision for a technology which would neutralize most
of those motives for objecting to cosmetic surgery:
 You download some basic open-source designs for face-changing nanites, 
and add your own artistic touches, taking care to include some features
that are obviously unnatural. You put pictures of your old and new face
on your website to minimize the chance that anyone will be misled by the
change.
 It would be interesting to find out if people would still raise ethical
questions if this technology could be made as safe and cheap as earrings.

Subject: [CR] Dr. Walford responds about his condition


Dear Francesca,
There has been so much posted recently about my "condition" and about my
"attitude" (the Peg Macintyre article etc.) that perhaps I'd better respond,
through you. (1) My "condition". The specialist at Baylor said that the only
persons he had seen who have a gait disturbance like mine had had carbon
monoxide exposure. Now there was no CO exposure inside Biosphere, but CO
toxicity is in fact a type of hypoxia, and there was a period of peculiar
(normobaric, as opposed to high altitude) hypoxia inside Biosphere (See my
article recently published: Walford, R.L: Biosphere 2 as voyage of
discovery: the serendipity from inside. BioScience. 52:259-263, 2002. ).
I've always been very susceptible to high altitudes in that I was always the
first to feel bad on a mountain trip. Some months ago one of the other
Biospherians had an MRI to rule out a pituitary tumor. It was ruled out but
the radiologist noted in passing some changes in the brain stem which he
said were consistent with CO exposure.  This Biospherian has no gait or
other neurological problems, but I was the most affected clinically
(shortness of breath, sleep problems etc,) and this person the next most
affected by the hypoxia. There also developed a level of nitrous oxide about
80x normal, and this is now thought to be neurotoxic. It is also true the CR
was very severe in Biosphere 2 (see photo of me in June issue of J.
Gerontol.). Also, the physical (as well as psychological) stress was very
severe --- not only more but FAR more and continuous than anything I have
ever experienced, and I've done a lot of stressful things. I was also, at 67
on entry, 27 years older than the next oldest crew member, yet in the nature
of things had to do an equal share of the work. My neurological problems
started during the last 6 or so months inside. Putting all the above
together is why I judge my neurodegenerative problems are related to the
Biosphere 2 experience. But there is no way of really knowing. Also, it's
such a special case that I don't think  my condition means anything as far
as the CR group is concerned. Certainly nobody on the list,
or any place else I know of, is likely to have comparable exposure. (2)
"Attitude".  Professional science writer-journalists usually get it right,
but journalists who are not primarily science writers (like Macintyre) often
not only get it wrong but come on with a preconceived agenda that they try
to, as it were, "read into you." They don't outright lie, but for example a
Favorite trick is to ask "Don't you think it's possible that .....?" and
then they'll add what they want to hear. If you answer, "Well, yes, it's
possible" then you may find in the article, for example, "Dr. Walford says
it's possible that .... ", and then will come something I may not really
agree with, but "it's possible", so they have not actually misquoted me but
have shifted the emphasis. Dean and others of the group should bear this in
mind as they represent CR. It can really trip one up. So by the same token,
the group should not read my "attitude" towards anything at all into what is
written by non-science professional journalists. The only thing right about
her article is that I don't wish to be a "guru" (as opposed, for example, to
Sears, Atkins etc), and that's why I don't post, and don't like to answer
questions. I am too much of an "authority figure" and the group does best
without such a one, in my view. Also, because of my "condition", it's
difficult both to keep up with the literature on CR and do the documentary
about Biosphere 2 that I'm working on, so I really don't want to be involved
in a lot of       questions. I am going in another direction with what
strength I still have. 

        Best regards,
         Roy Walford

Friends,

I was attempting to be discrete.  I will be seeing him this evening and
will ask him to make a statement about his health if he would like so that
those who care about him will know that he is doing well and what his
future holds.

I trust that Francesca Skelton asked Roy before posting his comments
publicly and I'm not very comfortable about cross posting, even if Roy is
on the Advisory Council for Extropy Institute.

Thanks,

Natasha

Jesus Christ.  Why am I not permitted the honest expression of
feeling?  Did you read my entire post before you assumed that
I was nastily manipulating the medium and lying as usual?
(Don't feel guilty---I'm in no mood now to read all of your

I wish to hell that I could have an honest dialog with you.
I tried my best to present my true questions and feelings,
and this is all I get back.

Perhaps any time people ask you questions, you get paranoid
and wonder where it's leading?  Or what their agenda really is?

Sorry.  Of course I should not have implied that you read
every paper.  I meant that---gee---even here (I think!) that
one has to read several articles from the front page of a
newspaper before picking up any bias.  And, more tellingly
(though this is your point) the bias certainly doesn't 
always jump out at one.  Or at me, at any rate.

Thanks for the correction.  (No sarcasm.)  But I sincerely wish
to understand how the newspapers that I generally read (mostly
liberal ones, like the San Jose Mercury) make the news especially
palatable.  (The only thing that I can think of---this is where
your further assistance would help, if you have time---is that
you found foreign newspapers quite incendiary and having an axe
to grind from page one.  Whereas as usual, American politeness
and urge not to offend make our papers here rather too mild?)

You are quite wrong.  I'm not after any targets.  You've been
there and seen it, I have not.  I'm just trying to get a
consistent picture inside my skull of how all this could be.
I'm sorry if my POV is so alien that it makes it hard to
understand you.  (NOTE:  THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS TO BE
TAKEN LITERALLY----NO SARCASM.)

Oh, why thank you.  That was exactly the kind of example
I needed.  It raises a tiny further question, however,
(doesn't everything seem to?  ;-)  in that I wonder how
it must be in typical foreign papers, in that some of
them entertain opposing views more than ours do.  (That
would fit Anders' points about the way people presenting
papers in Europe tend to give more minuses as well as 
the usual plusses for their theories.)

In the same newspaper, or in a number of equally prominent
prominent ones that vie equally for attention in the eyes
of casual readers?  OF course, there are strongly contrasting
perspectives here too, but, as we have said, they don't 
dominate the media.

Propaganda?  Hmm.  Maybe I would understand this point
better if you could specify it as either "right-wing
propaganda" or "left-wing propaganda".  Is that possible?
Now from what you have written, I suppose that one kind
of propaganda that you would find in American newspapers
is anti-Saddam presentations.  Recently there has appeared
in Britain and the U.S. more reports of atrocities 
committed by Saddam Hussein.  But for the last year or
so, I would say that it has been rather quiet.

But you could be right:  I find now that even those opposed
to U.S. policy admit that Saddam is no saint.  Do you find
that in foreign papers a more balanced account, that speaks
of many good points he has?

Hey, Jef!  I am *not* even debating, if you didn't notice.
I am requesting information.  If you find some of my questions

in your replies you have satisfied my curiosity, and for that

Oh, okay.  Sorry for supposing that you had found something
*truly* interesting.  You understand, of course, that it *is*
possible that entire cultures can have blind-spots, and I

the West, or about America in particular.  I misread you,

Twisted, now?  Here I was to the best of my ability complimenting
you and noting that I was perhaps beginning to understand, by
comparing what I thought to be a very similar insight supplied
by Anders.  Boy, do you have a chip on your shoulder!

Yes.  Anders straightened me out on that earlier today.  (NO SARCASM.)
But thanks anyway. (NO SARCASM.)

> I think it was clear from my post that I was saying that many countries

Yes.  But psychologically, can't you see the similarity to
Anders' point?  What could *cause* people in those countries
to see themselves that way?  Yes, it's probably mostly the
temporal nearness of the frontier in American culture, but
whatever it is, it struck me as closely related.  But maybe
I'm wrong.  Perhaps it's not.

> while they see the US as less a member of the community of

Ah, that nuance escaped me. (NO SARCASM HERE.)  That is, you
are saying that the general bias in the foreign papers is to
see the U.S. as a bully, and for the countries---the residents
of those countries, of course---to see themselves all as either
innocent bystanders or (mild) victims.

Yeah; I gave that about a 60% chance ;-)   I can hardly blame
you for getting tired of unproductive attacks, though.  I myself
am the victim of unproductive attacks sometimes too ;-)

Totally agree.  But then I'm not the "team player" that 
many people are.  My pleasure at the U.S. demolition of
Japanese imperialism and barbarity, for example, evokes
in me the same good feelings as when the Romans (in their
less brutal moments) would thoroughly defeat barbarians
and raise everyone's standard of living.

I'm sorry that you disagree with our views.  Actually, Rafal
just wrote something that bothers me here:

###I would add the sales of pieces of the hangman's
noose, and other paraphernalia, as well as the
auctioning of the murderer's body, fresh off the
gallows, to the waiting transplant surgeons. Perhaps
this would make legal killing a financially
self-sustaining venture.

He wrote "killing" instead of executing.  Have you considered
the possibility that he was being sarcastic?  I am forced to.

> Don't tell me anything about freedom of thought.  This is
> inhumane, insane, sadistic.

I think that "inhumane" is best left to describe actions
that harm specific individuals.  I think that you should
focus on *REAL* horrors---people being murdered, raped,
maimed, and starved.  Here is only a proposal for the *way*
in which funds are solicited to pay for capital punishment.
No one is *treated* any differently, no additional *REAL*
harm is done.  It's all in your imagination.

> I sincerely hope neither one of them will ever have enough power,
> money and wisdom to get to any initial state of a transhuman being.

Why, you even wish me to die?  Wouldn't it be enough for
me to never get power over the lives of others?  (I certainly
don't think that anyone should have power over the lives of
others.)  For what it is worth, I sincerely hope that you
and everyone else reading this gets as much life and advancement
as is possible.

I am sorry about that.  I do wish that you were less sensitive.
I sympathize to the following extent:  sometimes when I watch
TV graphic scenes can cause me to lose emotional control.  I
am so revolted by what I'm seeing that I am disturbed for some
time by it.  So I am very sorry that these mere words have done
that to you.

Perhaps it was Rafal's suggestion (perhaps in satire or sarcasm)
that body organs of the executed criminal be auctioned off to
those hospitals that are in most need of them.  Does this raise
in you the messy images of TV medical programs that also disturb me,
and that I won't watch?  Otherwise, please focus on the benefit
to people who would otherwise *die* without those organs, and
be aware that the free market will allow the most efficient
distribution of the organs.

Lee

Samantha,
       Can you prove that we who support the war against the terrorist are 
"simply assuming violence is the best answer?"  I have seen no indication of 
that at all.
       I do believe that present strategy may well "maximise peace" as the 
violent ones find their violence doesn't work and that their silent 
supporters are melting away.  The present strategy IMHO has a strong 
component of "finding non-violent solutions."
       I realise that you might prefer to have a different solution prove 
satisfactory but you could probably get further if you persuade us that your 
solutions are viable.

Well ... I got practically no response, so here we go again with another 
set of news.

#######################################################


Will Smith Winds Up 'Robot'
===========================

http://reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=entertainmentNews&storyID=1847157

Fox has wired Will Smith to star in sci-fier "I, Robot," an adaptation of
the 1940s Isaac Asimov short-story collection that set the groundwork for
robot films ranging from "The Terminator" to "A.I."


Eyes in the Back of Your Mouth
==============================

http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/start.html?pg=9

The brain doesnt care where visual input comes from. So why not see with
a camera jacked into your tongue?



Australia Approves Stem Cell Research
=====================================

http://abcnews.go.com/wire/SciTech/reuters20021205_7.html

Australia's parliament gave the green light Thursday to medical research
on human embryos after the upper house Senate agreed to impose strict
guidelines on research and limit the stem cell lines which can be used.



Mouse clues to human genetics
=============================

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2536501.stm
another angle:
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993147

The genetic make-up of the mouse has been published for the first time in
a scientific journal. The mouse book of life reveals that humans and mice
share at least 80% of their genes, with only 300 unique to either
organism.



Immune Cell Diversity Key to Preventing Age-related Decline in Disease 
Resistance
=================================================================================

http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2002-12-04-2

A discovery about the immune system's training process for pathogen-
fighting cells may lead to new immune-boosting therapies for the elderly
and better vaccines.


Grape-Seed Extract Helps Speed Up Wound Recovery
================================================

http://www.lef.org/news/vitamins/2002/12/03/eng-newswise/eng-newswise_084522_1421614548292615124.html

The extract seemed to aid wound healing in two ways: It helped the body
make more of a compound used to regenerate damaged blood vessels, and it
also increased the amount of free radicals in the wound site. Free
radicals help clear potentially pathogenic bacteria from a wound.



Hold the Lard! - The Atkins Diet still doesn't work.
====================================================

http://www.reason.com/hod/mf120502.shtml

Dr. Eric Westman followed two groups of 60 dieters each, one on a high
carbohydrate diet and one on the high-fat, low-carbohydrate Atkins diet.
He reported that the Atkins group lost twice as much weight during the
six-month study period as did the high-carb group. But this is both
unsurprising and meaningless.



Portion Size Matters: Given Too Much, We Eat It
====================================================

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/12/021204081430.htm

Almost nobody can stop eating at just one normal serving if there's extra
food on their plate, Penn State researchers have shown, and this tendency
coupled with the spread of megaportions may be contributing to the
American obesity epidemic.


And a single article in danish :-s

Det transhumane menneske tror på, at videnskaben og teknologien kan 
skabe en forbedret udgave af homo sapiens.
==============================================================================================================

http://www.weekendavisen.dk/kunst/artikel%3Aaid=4757

MAN kan ikke se noget usædvanligt på ham. *Anders Sandberg* er en nydelig
ung svensker med kommunefarvet glat hår, et par neutrale stålbriller og en
imødekommende manér. Ikke desto mindre optræder den stilfærdige lektor fra
Stockholm Tekniska Högskola som transhumanist.

Well, I find it useful. Quite aside from that, these sorts of
sites/summaries are a form of glue for the various factions of the
transhumanist community, such as it exists in a coherent form. More the
merrier in terms of cross-posting and cross-pollination so far as I'm
concerned.

December 5, 2002

Digital image stored in single molecule. An image composed of over 1000 bits
of information can be stored in the atoms of a single molecule, US
researchers have shown. Bing Fung and colleagues at the University of
Oklahoma found that the 19 hydrogen atoms in a lone liquid crystal molecule
can store at least 1024 bits of information. The data are stored in the
complex interaction of the protons' magnetic moments. Fung hopes the
technique, dubbed "molecular photography", could one day be used to pack
massive amounts of digital information into a tiny space but admits that the
process is currently experimental. "It's a very, very first step towards
using nuclear spins for molecular information processing," he told New
Scientist. (New Scientist 12/2/02)

Boulder firm uses nanotechnology to improve tennis game. A European company
with U.S. operations based in Boulder is marketing a line of tennis rackets
constructed with nanotechnology. These high-tech rackets aren't for the
pros, however; they're made for the amateurs, or "club players," among us.
"Players who don't have a nice full swing need a stiff racket to get speed
into the ball," said Jean-Louis Boyre, president of Babolat VS North
American Inc. "By using nanotechnology, we increase the resistance of a
racket."

Magnets double up. Researchers in the US have developed a new technique for
making small and powerful permanent magnets. These so-called
'exchange-coupled nanocomposites' contain two magnetic phases, which makes
them stronger than conventional magnets made from single phase materials (H

Stanford study may unlock secrets to aging. A new form of nanotechnology
developed at Stanford may lead to a better understanding of the life and
death of human cells. Writing in the Nov. 18 "Proceedings of the National

circles of synthetic DNA -- called "nanocircles" -- could help researchers
learn more about the aging process in cells. (San Jose Business Journal

Growing Smaller. In "Prey," Michael Crichton's latest novel, to be released
this week, the master of technology-run-amok visions sets his sights on
nanotechnology and describes a horde of bacterium-size machines that break
out of a lab and evolve into flesh-eating, self-reproducing predators. While
even experts in nanotechnology consider it "so new that it barely exists,"
the science already sparks widespread alarm among environmentalists and
disarmament proponents, not to mention science fiction writers. (eweek

Nanotech seen enabling steady semiconductor growth. Nanotechnology will
catapult the semiconductor industry into a new phase of relatively steady,
sustained growth that will replace its historical boom-and-bust cycles,
microprocessor veteran Nick Tredennick said Tuesday (Nov. 19) in a keynote
at the Embedded Systems Conference here. Just as the increased circuit
complexity posited by Moore's Law enabled the PC and its derivatives,
nanotechnologies will enable ever more diverse embedded applications that
will outnumber those spawned by the PC, Tredennick said. (11/21/02)

Artificial cell gets light-powered nanopump for calcium ions. A team of
chemists have found a new way to power artificial cells or liposomes: using
an shuttle molecule, calcium ions are transported across the membrane
barrier to the interior of the cell. The process is powered and controlled
by light, using an artificial reaction center molecule adapted from
photosynthesis. (Eurekalert 11/27/02)

New Nano Capacity. As conventional transistors shrink in size, they lose
their ability to amplify signals, and thus their very status as transistors.
Now researchers have taken advantage of a proposed quantum effect to
construct a Y-shaped, nano electronic circuit that boosts signals
spontaneously. The unique device, described in the 25 November print issue
of PRL , is one of just a few known designs that might lead to circuits of
atomic proportions. (Physical Review Focus, Print issue 11/25/02)

Diffusion narrows contact gap. Researchers have come up with a technique
that may ultimately overcome the resolution limits of conventional
lithography to create contacts with very narrow gaps for nanoelectronic
devices. The scientists, from the Institute of Organic Synthesis and
Photoreactivity (ISOF) at Italy's National Research Council and the Canadian
National Research Council's Institute for Microstructural Sciences and

Patently absurd. Too many patents could kill nanotechnology. Cosmetics
company L'Oréal Group hopes to make its products more colorful (patent No.
5,612,021). The U.S. Department of Energy wants to enable the long-term
storage of nuclear waste (patent No. 5,350,569). And the University of
California aspires to arrest the spread of HIV (patent No. 20,010,041,801).
All of these ambitious plans depend on a tiny molecule, the
buckminsterfullerene, or "buckyball" as it's known colloquially, discovered
in 1985 and named after the architect Buckminster Fuller, because its
spherical structure of 60 carbon atoms resembles Fuller's famous geodesic

The NY Times has an interesting article about a comparison
between the mouse and human genomes.

Similarities Found in Mouse Genes and Human's
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/05/science/05MOUS.html?pagewanted=print

Points of interest
- only about 1% (300 genes) in the mouse have no human counterpart
  despite 75 million years of evolutionary divergence.
- Mice have different/superior gene sets with respect to smell,
  pheromones, degradation of toxins in the diet, and immune defense.
- There may be as many as 4280+ non-protein coding "genes" (RNA genes) --
  a very unstudied area.

A personal observation suggests that with this amount of similarity
in the genomes with a 20-fold difference in longevity suggests that
the rate of aging is under the control of a limited number of genes
(probably hundreds or less).

Well, the solution is obvious.  Since witness recall
and the whole justice system is so flawed, let's just
stop punishing people for crimes altogether.  Besides,
many studies have shown that punishment offers little
in the way of deterrence anyhow, so is anyone really
being helped by locking up the bad guys?  (Besides
making certain people feel better?)  Besides, it
greatly inconveniences the criminals who, it must
not be forgotten, are people too.

Lee,
       I agree, certain people must feel almost as bad over criminals being 
imprisoned as over murderers being executed.  We really should stop punishing 
anyone.  Then when conditions get bad enough we could elect an ombudsman that 
had the power to imprison or execute anyone that had become too much of a 
public hazard.
       Alternatively we could do without any law enforcement what ever and 
leave it to private individuals to defend themselves.  The last time we used 
that system (in England) my ancestors did real well selling protection.

That may be true, but surely there are a great many other differences
between humans and mice!  The most obvious is size; we weigh hundreds of
times more than mice.  Then there is body shape, diet, behavioral habits,
gestation period, number of babies, not to mention intelligence.

It's hard to understand how such a relatively small number of genes being
different can lead to such enormous differences between the two species.
Longevity seems like only a small part of the picture.

One thing I'm finding confusing in the articles is just how different
the genomes are.  We used to hear that humans and chimpanzees were
something like 98% the same.  This article from last May,
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992352, says:

"Mice and men share about 97.5 per cent of their working DNA, just one
per cent less than chimps and humans. The new estimate is based on the
comparison of mouse chromosome 16 with human DNA. Previous estimates
had suggested mouse-human differences as high as 15 per cent."

But this article from yesterday,
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993147, says that 99%
of mouse and human DNA is the same.  The Times on the other hand avoids
such comparisons and just talks about numbers of genes.

Another curious discrepency comes from this article also from May,
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992253, which says,
"We'll have the rat [DNA sequence] by the end of the year."  While the
current press release, http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID=10005831,
says that the next mammals in line for sequencing are the chimpanzee,
chicken, cow, and dog.  Where'd the rat go?  Surely if they could say
in May that they'd have the rat by the end of the year, they must have
been pretty far along at that time.

It's also worth noting that despite the spate of publicity, the mouse
genome was actually published last May!  The flurry of press reports are
because only now did the event get into the scientific journals due to
publishing delays.  But if you look at some of the articles above from
last May you will see much the same commentary that is being recycled now.

It's strange how science goes, it's like nothing counts until it appears
in the paper journals.  It's a sort of mass delusion or psychosis where
people pretend that reality doesn't exist until it gets blessed by some
editor.  It'll be good to see those dinosaurs disappear in a few years,
because it will force people to face reality a little more squarely,
unprotected by pretense and convention.

Subject: Explain the ending of Deepness
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Vernor Vinge's Hugo-award winning novel A Deepness in the Sky has been
discussed here a few times.  I will assume that by now it has been read
by most people who are interested, so I will ask some questions about
the ending which I held off on before so as not to reveal spoilers.

A lot of stuff happens at the end very quickly.  Pham Nuwen is trying
to use his localizer network to stop the Emergents' plans.  They have a
ship over the Spider planet and are going to intervene in the incipient
nuclear war going on there to help the bad guys.  But Pham discovers that
somehow the genius Spider, Sherkaner Underhill, has taken control of
the Focused humans who are handling communication.  He and the Spiders
have to quickly learn to trust each other in order to stop the Emergents.

The point which is never explained in the book is how exactly Sherkaner
and the Spiders acquired this degree of control over the Focused.
The humans had perhaps tipped their hand earlier when they intervened to
break a code when Sherkaner's children were kidnapped.  I could see that
Sherkaner would be suspicious about the supposedly chance-in-a-million
good luck that led to the code breaking.  Then later we see him
fooling around with "videomancy", a disreputable video technology
(apparently the compound Spider eyes don't lend themselves to video)
which has connotations of fortune telling.  There are hints that this
is involved somehow in establishing communication between the Spiders
and the Focussed humans.

Can anyone present a plausible story about what happened here?  How did
Sherky confirm a possible theory about the existence of humans?  How could
he have started communicating with the Focussed - was there a two way
link set up?  The Focussed knew what he was doing, but how did he know
what they were doing?  And why was he able to not only communicate
with them, but in effect take over control of them?  And how was this
done without any hint to the Emergent overseers who were running the
Focussed communications people?  The Focussed don't seem to have the
mental scope to keep secrets and engage in conspiracies.

It made for a great surprise ending, but I was disappointed that Vinge
didn't go back and explain what had happened.  Or if he did, I missed it.
Maybe I'm just being a stickler for detail but it's hard for me to enjoy
a surprise ending when this many holes are left unexplained.

 How many computer viruses have escaped to run on a totally different
type of operating system from the one(s) they were designed to run on?
The natural environment is more complex and hostile to crude replicators
than a Microsoft OS is to simple program written for an Eniac. Would a
person who wrote a virus for an Eniac or an IBM 360 have been reckless
if he failed to simulate whether it could escape to run on a natural
information processing system such as a brain?
 I am talking mainly about a time period when there will be a small
number of specialized labs or factories with a carefully purified
feedstock that is needed to support assemblers that are as fragile as
the first stage of most new technologies. I expect that designing an
assembler to deal with thousands of different molecules it will encounter
in the wild without crashing is a lot harder than designing one that will
work when exposed to tens of types of molecules.
 If that's not enough, we can add an additional requirement that the
instructions needed to replicate be sent via an external signal and never
have a complete set of instructions stored in the assembler.
 What risks would quantum-level simulations deal with that the precautions
I've mentioned won't deal with?
 I'm not trying to claim that we can forsee an assembler on many desktops
being safe (the equivalent to having Microsoft OS's readily available for
replicators to spread on).

Hi!

As I've been trying to convince people working on aging, biology is highly 
hierarchical. For example, the few proteins controlling gene expression can 
regulate entire complex processes--and why not aging too? Check the work by 
the controversial Svante Paabo, for instance:

Enard,W., Khaitovich,P., Klose,J., Zollner,S., Heissig,F., Giavalisco,P., 
Nieselt-Struwe,K., Muchmore,E., Varki,A., Ravid,R. et al. (2002) Intra- and 
interspecific variation in primate gene expression patterns. Science, 296, 
340-343.

Apparently--I read this at ScienceDirect--, humans have the genes that mice 
use to build their tail; presumably, the reason why we don't have a tail is 
because a few developmental genes are turned off in humans. Now, regarding 
aging, the way I see it, aging is programmed into the genes--how else can 
we explain the 25-fold difference in rate of aging between mice and 
humans?--and a few key regulatory genes control the rate of aging in 
mammals. Now, the question is: which genes? I don't know. That's what we 
must find out, but my money is on the DNA repair/transcription complex and 
the changes in chromatin structure that involve proteins such as the Werner 
protein, Ku, the telomeres, etc.

I think the confusion is caused because you're actually comparing different 
things. For example, according to this latest paper, humans and mice share 
99% of genes. That is to say that if humans have 30,000 genes, mice have 
29,700 of these genes. Yet nucleotide similarity between mice and humans is 
somewhere around 80%. That is to say that if you align all human genes to 
mice genes you get an average of 80% positive hits. Now, regarding chimps, 
the latest estimates I read point to 95% genomic similarity in terms of 
nucleotide similarity. For baboons, it's about 90%. Yet this does not tell 
us anything about how many of the 30,000 human genes chimpanzees have. 
They're all nucleotide comparisons.

All the best.

I forgot to mention one interesting piece of data: Although we may share 
99% of our genes with mice, evidence suggests that as much as 40% of human 
transcription binding sites are not functional in rodents. Please see:

Dermitzakis,E.T. and Clark,A.G. (2002) Evolution of transcription factor 
binding sites in Mammalian gene regulatory regions: conservation and 
turnover. Mol Biol Evol, 19, 1114-1121.

That is to say: yes, mice may have our genes, but they might be turned off. 
One example I know of comes from UV-induced DNA repair, which is much more 
efficient in humans when compared to mice. Why? Simple, because although 
mice have the genes responsible for UV-induced DNA repair--called DDB--, 
one of these genes--DDB2--is not activated by p53 in mice, in contrast to 
what happens in humans. In conclusion, having the same genes doesn't mean 
we'll have the same gene expression or the same phenotype. Please see:

Tan,T. and Chu,G. (2002) p53 Binds and activates the xeroderma pigmentosum 
DDB2 gene in humans but not mice. Mol Cell Biol, 22, 3247-3254.

All the best.

So: when precisely does the branching happens?

QM does not determine the time at which the (supposed!)
branching happens. But the question above has a 'quantic'
nature. Hence we can expect its answer (if any) must be
probabilistic.

I would reject an answer like 'the branching happens
instantaneously' because this would mean that QM
can give a 'sharp' answer to the branching timing.

And also because the mathematical 'exact' description
of those splitted 'relatives states' (in the configuration
space) is not 'precisely' attained (in realistic, physical
cases). (This one is a big problem, because
the MWI was invented not as an interpretation but as
a metatheorem: 'the mathematical formalism of QM yields
its own interpretation'. But very soon Everett and de Witt
attached physical corollaries to that 'mathematical
formalism'....).

But in a very speculative way we can define a projection
operator "SPLIT" with the (eigen)value = 1 meaning "the
branching has happened", and the (eigen)value = 0 meaning
"the branching has not happened".

If Psi(t) is the state of (two) coupled quantum systems,
evolving fron t=t1 to t=t2, we can write
           P(t) = <Psi(t)|SPLIT|Psi(t)>
where P(t) is the probability that the branching happened.

And we can also write
           p(t) = <Psi(t)|[SPLIT,H]|Psi(t)>
where p(t) is the probability density that a branching
occurred between t and t+dt, and H is the Hamiltonian
of the coupled systems.

I can imagine that P(t) grows monotonically from zero
to one, while p(t) should be a 'bell' curve defining
the time at which the branching happens.

Sometimes de Witt, according to his postulate of complexity,
decomposes the world into systems and apparata. In this case
the branching takes places at a measurement. And we can
use the (SPLIT) model above, thus (perhaps) avoiding the
so called von Neumann 'cut' ('How does one define a
measurement? Where does a measurement take place?')
and the so called Heisenberg 'prohibition' ('We must
abstain from asking "in between" questions').

Sometimes de Witt presents the alternative possibility
that the branching takes place at any interaction. In this
case we can ask: how strong must be this interaction before
the branching actually occurs and the interference vanishes?

John Bell writes:" Thus the structure of the wave function
is not fundamentally tree-like. It does not associate a
particular branch at the present time with any particular branch
in the past any more than with any particular branch in the future.
Moreover, it even seems reasonable to regard the coalescence
of previously different branches, and the resulting
interference phenomena, as *the* characteristic feature of
quantum mechanics. In this respect an accurate picture, which
does not have any tree-like character, is the sum over all possible
paths' of Feynman".

.... at uncertain times and places, it is thus indeterminate 
and unpredictable, an aspect of random dispersion ...

That they draw funding from some of the same sources, particularly
overlapping in areas of Palestinian advocacy and combatting the spread
of American culture, something which recent surveys show score highest
in the muslim world and which also have triggered the largest numbers
of protesters in North America and Europe...

Tao.org, based in Toronto, is particularly a propaganda and
organizational epicenter and has served to help muslim radicals find
asylum in and enter the Canadian welfare system. In my own attendance
at antiglobalization and luddite rally planning sessions, which I've
been investigating, it is pretty much a tautology that the same
propaganda espoused by al Qaeda is spouted constantly by many at these
get togethers (and vice versa), and additionally muslims have a higher
than proportionate representation at such meetings.

THese groups are the core of the 'blame the US for 9/11' propaganda,
and Hollywood celebrities  and other public figures which are adamant
in their support of anti-globalization and other luddite causes also
promote this 'love islam/hate America' dualism...

I try to take the long view, past & future. And my point was a rejoinder to Damien's implicit absolutism 
(/bar bold rhetoric).

On rarity--time will tell. It is certainly the case that in the aggregate, in our happy Murkin (and 
probably EC) society, most of us rarely have such experiences, and this is good. Low-trust societies 
might have a different set of statistics; what of our ancestors' ritualized combat-of-champions in front 
of two tribes at the river (assuming the reports of such in some groups are not fabricated? What of cases 
(in the Pacific rim) where wives throw acid in their husband's mistresses' faces in plain sight of 
onlookers who know both parties? Which outlook is skewed, in the long run?

Are we "in violent agreement?" Ahem.

For me, I want "Felony" rolled back to what it was in ancent English times. A couple clear categories 
(murder and treason were the classics), a couple clear outcomes (death or banishment). We've gotten rid 
of "corruption of blood" for the most part--finish the job and get rid of "Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
v. Three Thousand Dollars" asset forfeiture cases.

And oh yeah, if the two (1898?) Supreme Court cases upholding that corporations are persons under the 
14th Amendment are going to be upheld, then I want corporations to be liable for felony convictions under 
the terms above (only severe things are felonies, death or banishment the only penalties). If that seems 
too hard on the shareholders, then make the corporate officers liable, the same way Yamamoto got strung 
up for atrocities committed by his subordinates in the Philippines about which all agreed he had no 
knowledge.

Hey, fair's fair.

I did some research and found the following sources investigating the
relationship between economic growth and life span.

<http://www.corp.aventis.com/future/downloads/PDF/fut0202/En_2_2002_health_a
nd_wealth.pdf>  - a short overview on the relationship between health (life
span included) and economic growth.  The article mentions work done by the
economists R.W. Fogel and Robert Barro.  Barro claims that a 10% increase in
life expectancy could translate to a 0.4% increase in econ growth.  For the
US this would mean an extra $400 billion (2001 $'s) for the coming year
(based on 2001 GDP according to the US Dept. of Commerce BEA -
http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn1.htm <http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn1.htm> ) 
 
Fogel wrote - A Theory of Technophysio Evolution, with Some Implications for
Forecasting Population, Health Care Costs, and Pension Costs - which has
some interesting documentation and speculation on the health/lifespan/econ
issue. http://www.ssri.niu.edu/dl/fogel.html
<http://www.ssri.niu.edu/dl/fogel.html> 
 
Barro's book (which I have read only a review of) seems to have some good
info too - "Determinants of Economic Growth: A Cross-Country Empirical
Study"

When I think about the possibilities of extreme life extension the economic
implications seem to be some of the most pressing.  It is promising to see
some substantial work being done that shows that increased life spans may
actually make us wealthier. 
Another question to consider - what is the maximum productivity for
unmodified humans, modified humans and which modifications will have the
greatest impact on economic growth.  Maybe forecasting the productivity of
potential modifications (calculating some expected rate of Return on
Investment) will help decide which modification to undertake first.  A
series of actual and hypothetical production possibility curves would be
useful - I have not found any work in this area but I think a well argued
paper on this subject would be a useful memetic tool for the transhuman
movement.

Subject: economic growth through longer lives?



A few months ago I was reading something that referred to a mainstream
economist who has posited that much of the economic growth of the 20th
century in the western world has come as a result of longer lives.  The
basic idea is that longer life has allowed greater worker accumulation of
skills and experience which have in turn benefited the economy.
 
Does anyone know which economist this is or have a reference to his work?  
 
thanks,

It is certainly also the case in the non-aggregate
temporal distilled mode that happy *or* unhappy (not
to say clinically depressed) Murkins/EC/PC/anon
cannot have any experiences that they are unaware
of, due to the personal and incidental nature of
experience itself.

And what not of it?  What not also of gladiator contests,
dreadnought diplomacy, risk, monopoly and the rest of
our temporally distilled entertainments and fascinations
(not to say obsessions)?

Yes indeed!  What *OF* them?

> Which outlook is skewed, in the long run?

I have been researching this question, and believe 
that a Machian perspective is manifestly required.
Two frames in relative motion within GR don't
entirely eschew temporal distillation, even in
those cases (such as the husbands') in which 
the ordinary physico-logical context distortion
is tantamount to cultural retrodiction, even to
the point of atavism.  More could be said, but
then (probably unfortunately) more could always
be said.

> Ah. So commonality equals accuracy, does it?

That depends on the frame of reference again.
The only commonality that can be skewed repeatedly
(as either an outlook or as introspection) may
Murkinize any kind of temporal distillation, as I
explained before.  Accuracy will therefore hardly
obtain in cases that Murkins evolve into, for
example, Munchins.

According to the testimony supplied by the aviators
who shot him down, or strung him up, whatever---Y
himself did not indeed have more than indirect,
virtual knowledge of the atrocities that he ordered.
Yet that does not exculpate him in my eyes.

       Aren't you talking about someone else?  As I recall we intercepted, 
via radio, and de-coded Yamamoto's itinerary.  We then sent a flight of P-38s 
to intercept him as he flew into one destination on his route. We shot down 
his airplane and killed him.
       Yamamoto was their best Naval officer and the mastermind of Pearl

While I do hope you are right, I believe that this could just be a case 
of, "Different tools for different jobs"

The body of a mouse is an other tool than a human body, so the "design 
decisions", the cost and trad-off's that evolutions has made, could 
probably explain the differences.

Just to be contrarian, how about aging being a function of damage due to
rate of energy processing? That doesn't have to be particularly genetic. I
seem to recall that most mammals go through the same number of heartbeats in
a lifetime (ballpark) irrespective of size. So you could do some math based
on scaled energy costs of circulatory systems per cell in the body, and you
could find that mouse/human is 25/1. Or more probably not, but I just wanted
to point out that biochemical/biomechanical stuff based on simple physical
laws relating to size and volume could be just as important.

(And someone here could no doubt point interested parties to scientific
papers showing just that, but I'm pushing my non-work time allowance just by
scribing this short e-mail :)

I am partial to the theory that the universe as we know it is a sort of
logical/mathematical structure or object, of the same class as numbers or
logical formulas or computer programs, but immensely more complicated.
We then add to this the principle that numbers and other such objects
have a sort of existence independent of human thought.  We don't invent
the numbers, we discover them, and likewise with other such abstract
structures.

So in this theory, all such structures exist in this Platonic sense,
and that would include our universe.  There is no meaning to the creation
of the universe, these objects all exist outside of time.

The reason we see our universe as having a beginning is because our kind
of life requires change and evolution.  That means that the universe must
be in a low entropy state at one end and high entropy at the other end,
and the direction from low to high entropy is what we call the passage
of time.  The dimensionality of the universe - 3 spatial + 1 time, has
been shown in some papers by Max Tegmark to be particularly well suited
to the mix of stability and variability that would seem to allow the
evolution of life.

So by combining the Platonic existence of mathematical objects, the
anthropic principle that we could only observe universes that are suitable
for the formation of life, and some rough arguments that a mathematical
structure with properties similar to those observed in the universe
would be well suited for life, we can put together an explanation for
the existence of the universe.  It's obviously pretty hand-wavey at
this point, but so would be any such theory given our present state
of knowledge.

"... the Japanese communicator selected the current edition of JN25--the most
widely distributed high-security code--in which to armor this information."

[...]

"Nimitz ... sought to minimize the danger [of the Japanese changing codes] by
following Layton's suggestion of a cover story.  This was to the effect that
Australian coastwatchers had radioed in the Yamamoto flight information,
probably getting it from friendly natives around Rabaul."

The question "Why does X exist?" is meaningful only
when it is conceivable that X might not have existed. 

The ultimate question about the cause of the universe
cannot pass this test for meaning because it is not
possible to conceive of the universe not existing. To
have a conception of any kind, one must presuppose a
universe in which one can conceive.

I agree.  This is a problem _with_ modern philosophy -- and this
includes even those who claim they don't have a philosophy.

I faced these arguments by one of the referees when I published my 
Experimental Gerontology paper earlier this year. My response to the 
referee was something like this:

"The rate of living theory was an old theory proposing an inverse 
correlation between metabolic rates and longevity. Yet there are so many 
exceptions that one wonders if the theory should not be the other way 
around. Birds, for instance, have higher temperatures and metabolic rates 
than mammals and yet age slower than same-sized mammals. Bats too age 
slower than expected from their metabolic rate. On the other hand, 
marsupials age quite fast for their low body temperatures. It is true an 
inverse correlation can be found between metabolic rates and the longevity 
of some mammals, but the rate of living theory, as it stands, cannot be 
accepted."

This is the most popular view nowadays and I don't think many 
gerontologists out there defend the rate of living theory. Also, I am not 
aware of any proof that mammals go through the same number of heartbeats 
throughout their lifetimes. I read that mice have about 350 beats per 
minute, or roughly 5-fold that of a human. Yet mice age 25-times faster 
than humans and live about 20-times less. Actually, I was looking for the 
murine heartbeat on the Net and found something even better to disprove 
your hypothesis: "Your dog's heartbeat should range between 60 - 80 beats 
per minute for a large dog, 80 - 120 for a small dog. Your cat should range 
between 110 - 130 beats" Yet I know small dogs live longer than bigger dogs 
and cats, in general, live longer than dogs. I actually remember reading 
about this in Hayflick's book, but it was together with the old myths of 
gerontology which are simply not true.

All the best.

I have read the book again a few times and also went many times back to find
out exactly what happened. At the end of the book there is a passage about
Trixia (already defocused) like "... and then it had been when she reached
down on the comms link and made herself known to Sherkaner Underhill"
(quoting by memory). There is no detailed description that I have found
earlier in the book, only some passages about unexplained radio interference
that the collaborators of Sherkaner had discovered, imemdiately after the
radio show.

This touches on one of the deepest questions, what "exist" means. I more and
more think that if something can be consistently conceived, it exists in
some TBD sense of the world. Or at least, quoting I think Egan among others,
if a "world" (that can be a simulation running on a computer or even an
abstract mathematical entity) contains conscious observers, it exists in
some TBD sense of the world.

Study Shows How Young and Old Recall Events Differently

Think back to your first kiss and try to remember exactly what happened.
If you remember precisely what your sweetheart was wearing, where you were
when you puckered up for the first time, whether your friend swooned or
giggled, and other specific details associated with the event, chances are
you're still pretty young.

Especially interresting when compared to:

(Hillarious!)
Is America the most dangerous place in the history of the world? It must
be, if you believe the increasingly hysterical reports issued by our
paranoid scientists, government officials, and big haired talking heads in
the news media. On a typical day last month (Ozone Warning Level: Orange,

Cloning technology may someday be able to give patients re-booted immune

multiple sclerosis, U.S. researchers said Thursday. Stem cells made from
cattle out-competed the animals older, native cells, researchers at a
Massachusetts biotechnology company told a conference.



Structure Of A Biological Clock Protein Determined For First Time
=================================================================

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/12/021205084633.htm

Biologists know that biological clocks play a critical role in most living
organisms including humans, but, despite an abundance of theories, they
don't really know why. Now, a research team from Vanderbilt, the
University of Wisconsin-Madison and Harvard Medical School has taken a
significant step toward answering this question. In an article published
the week of Dec. 2 in the online edition of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, they report having successfully determined
the structure of a biological clock protein for the first time.

### There was an explanation in the epilogue - basically, Tricia developed a
split personality as a result of being immersed in Spider culture and
language, and her Spiderized alter ego was no longer under the control of
the Emergents. She contacted Sherkaner on her own, and was never under his
control, but rather gave uncoerced cooperation to a friend. I think this was
a brilliant idea on Vinge's part - to set up a technology description
(Focussing - control of frontal lobe volitional centers), which has a
plausible but non-obvious flaw - development of secondary volition, a flaw
which plays a crucial and massively surprising role in the untangling of the
plot.

I'm not so sure of that.  It seems to me that you might
employ this reasoning to conclude that an individual
cannot conceive of his being dead, i.e., that the
universe goes on without him.

Well, if Rafal is right, then maybe it is "explained".  My beef is
that it was not described in the detail I yearned for.

Or even better, had given a day by day account as it was happening
of how the genius Spider Sherkaner slowly figured it all out.  I
felt cheated.  (Of course, I'm not really entitled to feel cheated
since (1) the rest of the book was so brilliant (2) the author is

But I have always wondered just what persuaded VV not to give

I was not talking about theory. I know that superiors are also *not* called to account "all the time"; far 
from it. There is also a spectrum of being called to account: "this will affect your chances of promotion" 
versus "pack your things, you're fired" versus getting indicted by a grand jury versus capital sentencing.

I know of more than one politician and bureaucrat has been qoted as saying "I accept full responsibility" 
and only got an ass-chewing from their boss or the media. It's a noise made with the mouth and a sad face 
pulled for the camera, and back to business as usual.

The theories of insincerity and immunity appear to be in good working order. Not bellyaching, just saying.

Since when is an author not "obligated to suit readers"?  They
are under a most important obligation: capitalism.  If they don't
suit the readers enough, they won't buy his next book.  Of course,
I agree that the rest of "deepness" was brilliant enough that I
would buy Vinge's next (and in fact I did buy the collection with
"Fast Times", in hardback even), but I too would have preferred
things a little more clear.

Of course, being fiction, one is also free to fill in the gaps
oneself, but it's always nice to have some glimpse of the author's
original thoughts.

Try it on yourself. You can conceive of the universe
existing without you, but you cannot conceive of the
universe not existing. 

I'm reminded of Anselm's classic ontological argument
for the existence of God, which states that because
God is a being than which none greater can be
conceived, and because it is greater to conceive of a
God that exists than to conceive of one that does not
exist, God must necessarily exist. Kant destroyed
Anselm's argument by pointing out that existence is
not a property of objects. We cannot imagine a
non-existent God because to imagine God is to imagine
a God that exists. 

The same kind of Kantian argument is true of our
conceptions of the universe. We can imagine a universe
in which some things are non-existent, but we cannnot
imagine a non-existent universe. It is therefore
pointless to ask why it exists.

Human ability or disability to conceive of a nonexistent universe is
irrelevant; and no matter, no energy, no space, no time and no laws of
physics does not contain any self contradictions that I know of. I think the
problem is that any potential answer in the form X exists because of Y
immediately brings an obvious question to mind.

I wouldn't say "aging" is programmed into the genes but genomes are
programmed with other features that result in aging.  So citing
some other examples in this thread -- mice have hair and are primarily
nocturnal animals so they do not really need extensive UV-damage DNA
repair systems (compared with humans who are primarily active in the
daytime).  Lacking such systems might tend to increase their cancer rate
(if say there are environmental toxins cause damages similar to UV
radiation -- pure speculation) and thus tend to shorten their lifespans.

It is much more complex than simple heartbeats.  As Joao points out the
rate-of-living theory has some significant flaws.

I think I've pointed this out in a previous message, but in case people
haven't read it, I'll point it out again.

One of the major problems is double-strand-breaks corrupting the genetic code.

Both radiation and free radicals can produce DNA double strand breaks.
When this happens you have 2 possible repair paths.  The first, homologous
recombination (HR), copies the genetic code from the sister chromosome and
can result in the copying of mutated/defective alleles or even incorrect
code (because of all of the similarity in the junk DNA in the genome).
This results in what is known as "gene conversion" and leads to cancer.

The second, non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ), involves deleting, or in some
cases inserting, random amounts of DNA, and sticking the broken chromosome
back together.  When this happens in the middle of a gene one is likely
to get a "broken" gene.  This produces a protein which will not fold
properly and as these accumulate in the cell an increasing amount of
the cells energy is devoted to producing and breaking down these
defective proteins.  I call this the "Energy catastrophe" hypothesis
of aging.

For the programmers on the list its simple --
  "The code becomes corrupted".

The only way we are going to solve this is to find ways to introduce
greater redundancy and/or ECC into the code maintenence processes.

Robert

Say someone owns all the farmland in a country.  A million people might give
him $10 for the right to grow food on his land.  Or $100, if he raises the
rent.  Does that person deserive the $100 million?  He's not doing anything,
he just controls the land.  Similarly Gates controls the right to copy MS

The issue here is not about human abilities, per se.
It is about whether the question itself has meaning,
i.e., does it make sense to ask what caused the
universe to exist given that we cannot even conceive
of its non-existence? I think the answer to that
question is no.

As Minsky is quoted at the URL posted here previously,
there is something wrong with the question.

I'm not sure I agree that it is contradictory to imagine that the universe
might not have existed.

There are really two questions: why does the universe exist? And then,
given that it exists, why does it have the properties that it does?

I assume that even those who say that we can't imagine a nonexistent
universe would agree that we can imagine that the universe might have
been very different from what we see.  We could imagine a 2-dimensional
universe, rather than a 3-dimensional one, for example.  That's not
logically inconsistent, is it?

And we could imagine a universe which is not capable of sustaining life,
agreed?  Obviously we wouldn't evolve in such a universe, but it is
still meaningful to ask why the universe didn't turn out to be that way.

If this is agreed, then we can push the envelope more, and imagine
a 1-dimensional universe.  The entire universe is just a line.
And then we can imagine a static universe, one with no time dimension.
And finally, perhaps even a 0-dimensional universe, just a point, static
and changeless.  Just that point exists.  Not much of a universe, but
at least it's something.

I'd be interested to hear how those who suggest that the universe must
necessarily exist would respond to the possibility that a simple point
would satisfy that requirement.  If it does satisfy it, then it doesn't
seem that this explanation for the existence of the universe is very
strong, since requiring just a single point to exist isn't that much
of an explanation for what we see.  If just a point isn't enough, I'd
be curious to know where this argument draws the line.  What kinds of
universes must self-evidently and "necessarily" exist?

You are confusing property rights to intellectual property rights.  I am not
disputing the validity of intellectual property right laws, I don't know
enough to comment on the issue intelligently, but under the presumption that
they are valid, I do not compare gates 'controlling the right' to reproduce
the product of his mind with a someone 'owning' all the farmland in a
country.  In what kind of situation could anyone ever actually own all the
farmland in a country?  A massive communist or socialist state is the only
place in which such a thing has ever happened.  

In whatever case, Gates is producing something and selling it to people who
choose to give him money for it.  Without restarting the whole bill gates
debates, replace him with any wealthy person producing a product, and to
remove the issue of intellectual property rights, consider someone who
manufactures lollipops, for instance.  Is he worth 10 million dollars?  Well
if 10 million people want to give him a dollar for his lollipops, who are
you to say that they can not?  And the only way you can say it is with the
threat of force.

The issue is whether or not a 3rd party has the right to dictate how much a
buyer can give a seller for his product.  If you believe they do, you
advocate socialist centralized economic control, if you believe they do not,
you advocate individual freedom.  People who complain that gates (or any
wealthy person) has too much money (excluding gates legal issues) are by
necessity implying that they have the right, by force, to dictate to me how
much I want to pay for the product of another mans mind.  That is
corruption, disrespectful of individuals, and as far from freedom as one can
get.

### Now, there might be some thinkers for whom it is in fact impossible to
conceive of the universe's non-existence, I however do not belong to this
group. Say, imagine the visible universe was cut roughly in half, and
spliced in on itself - conceivable, if not easily, isn't it? Imagine slicing
off little pieces of the universe, and little pieces of the sensory and
intellectual experience that makes our lives. No single step needs to strain
imagination, yet at the end there is nothing left. Why didn't it happen
today? Why is the universe as it is (as Hal noted) is just as valid a
question as inquiring why it exists in the first place.

Just as Hal does I subscribe to the notion that the universe exists in the
same way as numbers and other mathematical entities do, and this is all the
answer I need, when somebody asks what caused the universe to exist.

### This is incorrect. There were many despotic monarchies where the king
owned de iure all land, and merely rented it to his vassals. Smaller
countries were frequently owned by a single family. In socialist states
nobody owned land, which was one of the reasons for their downfall.

### This is like saying, let's stop talking about Mr. Dahmer, replace him
with a man who didn't kill anybody and ate beef only. The irrational,
economically ruinous use of copyright law is the main issue here, not the
exact amount of cash amassed by Mr Gates, to the detriment of the economy.

It appears to me that you and Hal are thinking of
abstract models of possible universes rather than this
*actual* universe in which we live. Mathematically, we
can of course construct a universe that exists only as
a line or a point. We can then even erase it, leaving
"nothing at all." But that is only playing with models
with pen and paper in the universe... it is not the
same as conceiving of our actual universe as
non-existent.

Another way to look at this: the universe is defined
as the totality of all things. The question of what
caused it is meaningless because if there were
something before the creation of the universe that
caused its creation, then that thing must have existed
in the universe -- and that is a contradiction.

It may be more difficult to see the economic benefit of rents, but
they exist nonetheless, and outlawing them would just make things
worse.  The owner by himself is unlikely to be able to produce
revenue from the land--he needs farm labor and expertise, etc.  So
if a farmer can produce $20 of revenue from a piece of land that
he can rent for $10, both benefit. If the owner arbitrarily raises
the rent to $100, then he just won't get any farmers to rent it and
it will lie fallow and unproductive. 

What often happens, of course, is that farmers save their money or
take out loans or pool with others to buy the land so they can save
the rent.  But that is also a risk: they must commit resources to do
that that might have come across better opportunities, so for many
farmers it's better just to keep renting.  For example, it makes it
much easier for them to change from one plot of land to another if
conditions change.

"Ownership" is just a means of determining allocation.  In a free
market, assets will tend to be used by those who can produce the
most revenue from them regardless of who owns them, because title
and rents will just get passed around until the most efficient
outcome is reached (modulo a few irrational actors).

Of course IP is a different beast entirely.  The owner and 100
farmers can all use the same piece of IP at the same time, and IP
law isn't about orderly allocation, but about protecting markets.

I am full of wonders.  Not only am *I* capable of

when I try imagine God, even though He does not
exist.  I will even, for a small fee, imagine

I agree that it's pointless to ask why it exists;
but not because we are incapable of imagining it
not to exist.  It is rather easier that imagining
measurable cardinals.

What came first:  space or time?

The Bible has from darkness there being light, in an area on a day.

Set theory and numbers would exist without a physical universe, it's 
possible to conceive of the numbers without a requirement of a physical 
universe.

Our equations model quite well our universe, it's safe to say:  without 
exception.

Our universe, a huge collection of galaxies, probably started in a Big 
Bang.  Yet, that doesn't explain the Universe being infinite and 
eternal.  What if the next infinitesimal probable event result distance 
in a Many-Worlds-Universe is some infinite distance away, or long, long 
ago?

I think the Big Bang is just among a neighborhood of universes within a 
cosmos or cosmiverse.

If something caused the Universe to exist, what caused it to exist?  
It's convenient to accept that it is or does.

Good question.

I'd like to hear more about it.

About the numbers, the numbers are a little simpler to synthesize, 
including all of them.

This is very non scientific, non technical , without basis in any fact
....  but doesn't
logic lead to the conjecture that the sum of all universe(s), matter, time
and dimensions ought to be zero.  The only way "something" could be created
from "nothing" is if
"nothing" could divide itself into "nothing" and "anti-nothing" by some
kind of internal or external destabilizing event or circumstance.  Call the
extra-corporeal superintelligence able to split time/space/dimensions "god"
or whatever, it does
make for the occaisional creepy feeling that "something is out there"?

I don't deny rents have benefits.

I also don't deny extreme economic concentrations might not be harmless.  In
the reductio case, monopolies are usually considered to be rather distorting
of 'free markets', and oligopolies may or may not be much better, depending on
complicated factors.  And the moral/social justification for a high
concentration of wealth seems lower for simple ownership/rent than for someone
who (reductio again) physically made each and every item he sold and happened
to sell a lot of items.

As for Michael Dickey's 
"In what kind of situation could anyone ever actually own all the farmland in
a country?  A massive communist or socialist state is the only place in which
such a thing has ever happened."

... uh, ever hear of feudalism?  The land reforms various Latin American
countries performed in their socialist periods were breaking up the huge
landholdings of colonial times and distributing them to the peasants who'd
been working them.

Of course Zimbabwe is busily proving that such things aren't always
beneficial, but I bet there are some other differences, such as a lot of
physical capital on the Zimbabwean farms, vs. practically feudal structures in
Mexico, worked literally by peasants.

I should ask you then what caused numbers and other

<<Set theory and numbers would exist without a physical universe, it's

I am guessing that set theory is the result of human neural integration and 
such organic features as opposable thumbs, hand eye coordination, the 
discovery and implementation of fire, and a host of other occurrences due to 
evolution.

Set theory may be recognized as something discernible in nature, but it takes 
a human brain to view this, Squirrels, Lowland Gorillas, Toucans, and 
Angelfish have no concept of set theory. Up until now it takes a specialized 
mammal, called human, to see this.

If the human brain didn't function as it does, there is no set theory. Unless 
some other intelligent specie evolves, some sophisticated computer A.I.; 
really set theory doesn't seem to exist. Set theory is the activity, then of 
humans comprehending mathematics, which itself, is a 
caused by a  complex set of neurons moving chemicals around, which conduct 
electrical pulses. Hence, even thought itself is material, in an identifiable 
way. Juices go squish-squish, and the neuron cells go buzz-buzz from 
electrons jumping.

Question? Do you hold math as a sacrosanct, non-material, part of the cosmos, 
even though it appears as a development of biological and cultural actions?

By saying aging is programmed into the genes I don't wish to imply that 
aging evolved for a purpose. I don't see any evidence that aging in humans 
or even mammals evolved for a purpose--as I point out in my Exp Ger paper. 
I do see great differences in rate of aging amongst genetically similar 
species, which makes me think rate of aging is a result of some small 
alterations in the genetic program.

I've read your NHEJ-based theory before. I'll tell why I'm not convinced by 
your theory and I'll tell you why I don't think free radicals cause aging 
either. Life has billions of years on earth, having to face UV, background 
nuclear radiation, free radicals, etc. I would say life had enough time to 
develop protections against these common sources of damage and, equally 
important, life had enough time to develop mechanisms to repair the 
damage--DNA repair mechanisms are the perfect example. In other words, if a 
yeast or a bacterial culture can divide eternally despite free radicals, 
UV-damage, DNA mutations, etc., why assume--and most gerontologists 
do--that our cells cannot cope with these processes? I think they do cope 
and I think aging is caused by something else. One good evidence of this is 
the huge amount of anti-oxidant protection in ALL--not just the ones that 
live longer--but ALL mammals [See the papers by Sohal].

Now, if damage does not cause aging, then what does? Well, something goes 
wrong in the genetic program. Hence aging is programmed into the genome, 
though not intentionally. And I also don't think the program gets 
corrupted. Why not? I've told you--Robert--before: clones. If there were a 
widespread accumulation of somatic mutations in cells, we wouldn't be able 
to clones so many animals--namely mice who have lots of cancer. That's why 
I think the accumulation of damage as we grow older is epigenetic; I think 
aging results from some sort of misregulation of the genetic program; the 
expression of genes goes wrong with time. Since we're both programers, I'll 
put my arguments in a programer's way: I don't think the program itself 
changes much during aging; I think the program is bugged in some way that 
the procedures and functions get out of control with time. Now, I have no 
idea what genes might be involved, apart from perhaps the Werner protein. 
Yet I think the key to understanding aging will be to understand the 
transcriptional regulation of mammals.

Finally, you can argue that the soma of multicellular organisms lost some 
protection against damaging agents and this causes aging. I mean, there are 
papers correlating the resistance to stress with longevity in 
mammals--though I don't think yeast H2O2 resistance is superior to that of 
a human cell. It could be and I keep my mind open to such possibility, but 
when I work with cells taken from a patient with Werner's syndrome, I see 
that these cells are less resistant to stress than normal cells. What this 
tells me is that one gene involved in DNA metabolism can make cells and 
organisms less resistant to several forms of stress and thus shows how 
multiple stress resistance might be a consequence, not a cause of longevity.

Anyway, I've been thinking of writing something along these lines and I 
could use some comments.

All the best.

Joao

Plagued by both pessimism and hype, can nanotechnology grow up?


Interesting article, because it touches on a strategy problem for us. We 
want to promote technologies that have a transformative potential, and 
we want to create a constructive discussion about what they can be used 
for beforehand so that we avoid Dolly-bans and misuse. But at the same 
time, claiming certain technologies are transformative and will have 
profound effects in the not-too-far future will either be seen as, or 
will cause, hype. And people disagreeing with us on the fundamental 
values of transformation can easily turn the hype into scaremongering. 
And when the technology doesn't arrive immediately many will also claim 
it was only hype and go back to ignoring it - only to be shocked a while 
later. 

There is a subtle balance here: we need to make good cases for these 
technologies and how they can be used well, but we have to avoid 
over-hyping them in the eyes of the mainstream. We have to counter the 
opposition with good social, philosophical and regulatory arguments 
before they even get started, and somehow make these arguments spread.

That's a neat trick, Lee. However you are fooling
yourself.

If I were to ask to describe the content of your
imagination when you are imagining that the universe
does not exist, your only correct reply would be that
there is no content to your imagination under that
circumstance. This is so because to imagine anything
is to imagine it in a universe that exists. This is
true even of ideas and of empty space.

Thus the content of your imagination while attempting
to imagine the universe not existing is no different
than had you not made the attempt.

And these laws are exactly where concepts of Natural Law are abstracted
from. Or do you believe that human nature evolved in complete disregard
of universal physical law?

They promoted a view that 100% of the troubles of their people were the
fault of others, that their people were to be perpetually a victim
class, and that they should emphasize this by adopting only those
strategies that do the most to portray them as helpless victims who
need rescuing.

In the end, they have both been proven quite wrong.

On the contrary, the peace movement actively worked to keep the US out
of WWI, thus prolonging the war and causing the unneeded death and
injury of many millions of people.

The peace movement before and during WWII were aware of the treatment
of the Jews by the Nazis and chose to actively work to keep the US out
of the war, to Germany's advantage, and the Jews disadvantage. 

The peace movement was also aware of the Japanese treatment of the
Korean and Chinese peoples, yet actively worked to keep the US out of
conflict with the Empire of Japan, to Japan's advantage, and to the
disadvantage of hundreds of thousands of Koreans and Chinese. 

The peace movement actively worked to deny the purges and executions of
millions of Soviet citizens, they worked against western efforts to
fight the Bolsheviks and portrayed the Bolshevik world as "The Workers'
Paradise".

The pacifists in the Truman administration refused to allow us to go
north of the Yalu River, to end the communist threat on the Korean
Penninsula once and for all. Millions of Koreans are dead and millions
more are enslaved and starving as a result.

The pacifists in the Johnson administration and in the US university
system actively worked against a US victory in Vietnam, the anti-war
movement and liberal media like Time Magazine is documented to have
been propaganda arms of the NVA.

The peace movement actively worked against Reagan's military buildup,
failing to win this once, and as a result, the USSR was toppled by a
bankruptcy Reagan forced them into (and which they have credited to
him). Why this couldn't have been done decades sooner is surely also
the fault of the peace movement.

The blood of millions is on the hands of the pacifists.

Is that only groups you sympathize with, or all groups? You yourself

whites, men, scientists, Libertarians, gun owners, Americans,
capitalists, Republicans, Objectivists and other Ayn Rand fans, among others....

What you illustrate there is the difference between math and mathematics.

We could expect any rational being to comprehend rational numeric and 
other mathematical relations, except for philosophers.  That is to say, 
any sufficiently advanced (alien) life form has a glimpse of math and 
probably socially understands some mathematics.

I was thinking about it, and thought that maybe prior to the existence 
of anything there was null.  Then, somehow, for any given reason, there 
was some infinitesimal "flaw" or anything different.  Then as soon as 
there was something different then all of the nothingness was polarized 
to anything and at that point there were equal amounts of something and 
nothing.  Then it goes spiral and then ying-yang and then on to fractal 
until the second bit of entropy happens, and so on and so forth, 
yielding everything with a sum of zero, or sum zero totality, or zero 
equals infinity.  Thus basically nothing or not nothing.

Yet still, that doesn't explain what causes the universe.  A unified 
field theory, or as they say "T.O.E.", may explain.

Well, that's pretty close!  You are getting warm, but
just as in computer science, there is a difference 
between the null pointer and no pointer at all.

This might help:  when I'm having any trouble conceiving
of a non-existing universe, I always imagine how it would
be for my uncle Fernando (blind and deaf since birth) to
be imagining the universe, or to think about what his
concept of an empty universe would be like.

Finally, when I've got that firmly in mind, I recall
that I don't really have an uncle Fernando, and at that
moment I perceive what a completely non-existent universe
would be like.

Really, though, this is very close to your concept of
a universe that did not exist, except that I'm admitting
it.

Of course, you can always use Hal's great approach of
slowly removing all the properties of our universe one
by one, and then in a final spasm of clarity, removing
the last so-called property, namely, "existence", even
if technically it Kant be done.

Ok, so we agree on that much.

I'd tend to agree with this as well, though it isn't clear the extent
to which small mutations can have a large effect.  The very mixed p53
story in mice (both shortened and normal lifespans depending on the
mutations in and expression of p53) is just one case in point.

And in some cases it has, e.g. Deinococcus radiodurans.  I believe that
D. radiodurans can repair up to 300 double strand breaks, most probably
through homologous recombination repair pathways (my speculation).
In contrast a human cell will commit apoptosis with only ~3-5
double strand breaks (mouse cells seem programmed to allow many
more which may be why they get cancer more frequently).  In a
multicellular organism it becomes a very interesting question
as to when the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
or the one.

It isn't that they can't cope -- its that they aren't tuned "just right".
If protein deamidation is functioning as a "molecular clock" that is
a signal as to when to recycle poorly functioning proteins, then
what is the probability that 30,000 proteins have the correct
molecular structure that signals cells to recycle a protein
just at the time it becomes dysfunctional?

I know.  We have great anti-oxidant defenses.  But they cannot protect
against a X/gamma ray going through the nucleus (producing DSB).  They also
don't seem to protect against the accumulation of undigestable cellular
metabolites (e.g. lipofuscin).

I can completely agree with "something goes wrong in the genetic program"
and "aging is programmed into the genome, though not intentionally".

(with the emphasis on the "not intentionally" part).

Ah, but we know how difficult it is to produce clones.  What is the
success rate: 1 in 50? 1 in 100?  One could have mutations accumulating
in developmental genes that have no impact on the viability of adult
cells that could easily explain why cloning is so difficult.  The
"abnormalities" that one finds in clones would be explained if they
were derived from cells with a non-fatal accumulation of mutations.

This is the dysdifferentiation theory of aging.  I'm not opposed to
this being part of the process.  If one gets double strand breaks
in the ribosomal DNA, then the homologous repair pathway may well
delete segments (due to the large number of repeats) resulting in
a decrease in the cellular protein production capacity.  I strongly
suspect that if you alter the total protein production capacity
of cells then the regulation of normal cellular functions will
begin change.

They didn't "lose" it -- they had to make a choice between tolerating self-repair
(that might cause cancer due to mis-joining double strand breaks) and removing
heavily damaged cells (hoping that stem cells may replace them).

You need to keep in mind however, that the yeast cell is out for
its own survival.  The cells in mammals however are out for the
survival of the organism.  They must have a program that says
to not kill the collective to benefit themselves.

The things to consider are that the Werner's syndrome protein is an
exonuclease (i.e. it chews up DNA) and the fact that p53 modulates
its activity.

I'd tend to disagree.  Stress leads to DNA damage, DNA damage results
in a corrupted code, a corrupted code results in cells that function poorly,
poorly functioning cells leads to aging.

It seems quite logical to me.  Proving it is the hard part -- though Jan Vijg's
work on the accumulation of mutations in transgenic mice seems to be providing
some supporting data.

Mike,
       Is it possible we have the various peace movements in the wrong?  I 
have long credited Ghandi and Martin Luther King as excellent tacticians that 
had a conflict they wished to win and chose their tactics as the best 
available to them that would win.  It had nothing to do with peace.
       You mentioned other "peace movements."  I have read David Horowitz on 
Vietnam and am aware that these other movements might well have had other 
goals than peace in mind.
       I am curious, have you ever looked at peace movements from that angle?

Without a one to one relationship between life expectancy and economic
growth, or else an indexing of the retirement age to the average life
expectancy, these numbers would actually result in a decreasing
standard of living over time.

Any increase in life expectancy does not increase the number of
productive years that individuals have to contribute to the economy as
productive individuals. All it does is delay the day when the
individuals wealth is confiscated by the tax man when s/he dies, thus
allowing for private capital to generate more growth before it is
stolen and wasted on government expenditures. 

Furthermore, since the individual is retired (and likely living off the
government dole) when they get to enjoy their increased life
expectancy, the amount of money that is stolen from productive
individuals (and therefore an increasing drag by government on the
economy) increases as well. The only cure for this vicious cycle is to
index the retirement age to the average life expectancy, say five years
below it minus half of any increase over time (i.e. if ALE is 75, you
can receive Soc. Sec. benefits at 70, while if ALE rises to 80, you
retire at 72.5, etc...).

The primary reason for the huge increases in government taxation in the
last century was not actually welfare for younger people, but increases
in life expectancy while retirement ages remained static. For example,
when the US SS retirement age was set to 65 in the middle part of the
century, average life expectancy was 62. ALE rose over the next couple
decades to 75 while retirement age remained at 65, causing a tenfold
increase in demand on government medical and social security
entitlements when the population only doubled.

This indexing is something I've been advocating since 1984, but
received little traction until the ARA was raised to 67 in the
mid-90's. It needs to rise more.

I got an interesting piece of mail last month from the SSA. It seems
that I've worked enough over the past 16 years that I have earned 38 of
the 40 credits I need to be able to retire if I become disabled (and my
income record is pretty thin, thanks to years of contract employment)
and I'm only 34. This would earn me $900 a month, apparently, in SS
benefits, which admittedly isn't much, if I were to live here in the US
(though this would be a six figure income equivalent in places like
Afghanistan). Perhaps by the end of this year I'll be fully qualified.
This is a bit early, isn't it, to be 'qualified' to receive SS
benefits, don't you think?

Mike, you and Samantha are always picking on each other.
You should be like two old friends who just disagree.

Peace movements are one of two possible strategies when engaging in a
revolutionary struggle. The other is the classic terrorist/insurgency
strategy, and each is useful in various contexts and applied
scientifically. While a number of top level peace proponents can be
generally said to have other goals in mind, it is my experience that
most of those involved are of the type Lenin described as useful
idiots, but which I would simply describe as victims of victimological memesets.

This, I see as our main problem here.  If most people agreed that
tranforming into something better was not only intrinsically desirable
but actually possible within our lifetimes (the classical view, not as
adjusted for future medical science or even such modern technologies as
cryonics and its promise for the future), then such technologies would
have a much easier time being introduced.

In that, I think the main problem is that people do not believe it is
possible to significantly improve themselves using today's technology.
Thus, they dismiss the value of improving themselves, which leaves
openings for anti-transformative memes to invade.  If we could find and
promote methods of self-transformation using stuff that is not five or
fifty years out, but which is available *today*, our beliefs would
immediately become a lot more central to the thinking of the masses.
Consider, for instance, the immediate popularity of essentially
self-service applications like Napster (et al) and the Web.  What of,
say, memory or ettiquite aids, which could record what was said for
later viewing (first version just gets the raw text, later on add an
option to distill it into the concepts and specific facts the person
needs to remember), and/or prompt with responses when someone is not
sure what to say in commonly encountered situations (especially affairs
of the heart, or in cases where a lot of money is on the line)?  Or
cheap (sub $10,000 total) CNC machines and CAD/CAM software, the closest
thing we have today to household replicators?  Et cetera.  Those are
possible without fundamental breakthroughs in science; it is up to us to
make and promote such devices, and more importantly, the potential that
their class holds.

With the peoples of India, this no longer seems to be the current mindset

is headed, or what the majority views are. Lots of various voices to

the deaths of 3000 Americans on 9-11, the Saudi complicity with the Khobar 
Towers attack in 1998, the attack on the US Cole, the attack on the US

involved in financing violence against non-Muslims, for the last 20 years or

Far more damaging then the Peace Movement, to American interests, is the 
American elite, including the President(s), and the US State Department, in 
supporting Saudi Arabia, and deliberatly looking the other way, while the 
Saudi Royals fund anti-Americanism, under the table to the madrassahs.

Thanks, Lee. You are correct. It was the wishy-washy concern in the
first Bush administration that the awesome 'hail mary' defeat of
Saddam's army, in "The Mother of All Battles" (he was right on that,
wasn't he, just not in the way he expected), especially the scenes from
the "Road of Death", would ignite massive negative reactions from the
milquetoast left which can't seem to stand the sight of blood.

I should also note that the primary proponent of this concern in the
first Bush administration has done the most to interfere with the US's
just right (under the UN Charter) to deal with Saddam ourselves, and
his agency, the State Department, is the same agency which actively
worked to keep so many Jews in the hands of the Nazi regime, to the
point of even refusing entry to refugee ships full of Jews.

I'll also note who was on which side during the Elian Betrayal. A
perfect opportunity to stand up to Castro, down the tubes. You'll
notice that another similar case came up in the last few weeks, yet no
news organizations outside of Fox News have reported anything on it,
specifically because the boy is far more likely to attain US asylum.

In europe, and around the world, it is those with the worst histories
which are expressing the most opposition to us, and the most support
for groups and individuals who have done the most to foster the
terrorist scourge. Whether it is Germany, from whence the 9/11 killers
launched their attack and where they found refuge for years, to Egypt
and Saudi Arabia, from whence most all of the 9/11 killers came from
and where they were taught to hate the US, to any other tin pot
dictator or socialist regime that fears that it is next on our list.
Only the guilty and the complicit resist.

I am currently reading L Neil Smith's novel "The American Zone", the
plot of which eirily reflects the events of the last few years. Smith's
characters, and the North American Confederacy they live in, resist
terrorist insurgencies far better than I fear our world will.

It wasn't violence that was the scourge of the 20th century, pacifism
was the scourge of the 20th century. The people of the West, inheritors
of the Enlightenment, lost the courage of their convictions, the
scrotal fortitude to do what was necessary to make the world right.

It looks like it may continue to be a scourge in this century.

Right, it Kant be done. To believe otherwise, as you
seem to, is to fall victim to an illusion of the mind,
as did many religionists of the past who wanted to
believe Anselm's classical ontological argument. To my
knowledge no philosopher of any repute has refuted
Kant's criticism of Anselm.

Because existence is not a property of objects, it is
not possible to imagine an object that lacks
existence. To imagine a thing is to imagine its
existence. This is what it *means* to imagine a thing.

Thus it is not possible (for clear-headed people, at
least) to imagine the universe lacking the supposed
property of existence. The best we can do is imagine a
universe in which some thing or things do not exist. 

Note that this does not preclude the possibility that
you may imagine yourself imagining a non-existent
uncle, as you did in your last message. You can quite
easily imagine yourself or others harboring the false
idea of your non-existent uncle. 

However you cannot imagine said uncle without also
imagining that he exists.

THinking over an idea based on something I picked up off a KeelyNet
list:

Assume a superconducting motor, operating in a vacuum, fed as much
power as it can handle indefinitely, bound by buckyfiber. At what point
does it's velocity rise so high that it's mass/energy quotient causes
it to implode into a black hole? Is this within the bounds of the
strength of buckyfiber to hold it together to this point?

Note that the mass of such a black hole would be so small that it would
rapidly evaporate (as predicted by Hawking) in a rather catastrophic
explosion, converting its mass to energy.

For Canada:

So the logical plan is to plough $ from  Government pension plan funds
into health extension  support and investments and solve the current
problem of future  pension unfunded liability by indexing full pension
entitlement age to average life expectancy based stats-X years.

CASE in point:
Borrow  33% of Canada Pension plan money  over 15 years to support
medicare and when the fund is drawn down increase the age for pension
from 65 to 70  (unless there is disability involved.)  For those wanting

fund into lifespan/healthspan enhancing technologies and their

Without a one to one relationship between life expectancy and economic
growth, or else an indexing of the retirement age to the average life
expectancy, these numbers would actually result in a decreasing
standard of living over time.

Any increase in life expectancy does not increase the number of
productive years that individuals have to contribute to the economy as
productive individuals. All it does is delay the day when the
individuals wealth is confiscated by the tax man when s/he dies, thus
allowing for private capital to generate more growth before it is
stolen and wasted on government expenditures. 

Furthermore, since the individual is retired (and likely living off the
government dole) when they get to enjoy their increased life
expectancy, the amount of money that is stolen from productive
individuals (and therefore an increasing drag by government on the
economy) increases as well. The only cure for this vicious cycle is to
index the retirement age to the average life expectancy, say five years
below it minus half of any increase over time (i.e. if ALE is 75, you
can receive Soc. Sec. benefits at 70, while if ALE rises to 80, you
retire at 72.5, etc...).

The primary reason for the huge increases in government taxation in the
last century was not actually welfare for younger people, but increases
in life expectancy while retirement ages remained static. For example,
when the US SS retirement age was set to 65 in the middle part of the
century, average life expectancy was 62. ALE rose over the next couple
decades to 75 while retirement age remained at 65, causing a tenfold
increase in demand on government medical and social security
entitlements when the population only doubled.

This indexing is something I've been advocating since 1984, but
received little traction until the ARA was raised to 67 in the
mid-90's. It needs to rise more.

I got an interesting piece of mail last month from the SSA. It seems
that I've worked enough over the past 16 years that I have earned 38 of
the 40 credits I need to be able to retire if I become disabled (and my
income record is pretty thin, thanks to years of contract employment)
and I'm only 34. This would earn me $900 a month, apparently, in SS
benefits, which admittedly isn't much, if I were to live here in the US
(though this would be a six figure income equivalent in places like
Afghanistan). Perhaps by the end of this year I'll be fully qualified.
This is a bit early, isn't it, to be 'qualified' to receive SS
benefits, don't you think?

The success rate is quite different with multicellular plants. For example,
one of the most robust plants in my country garden is a Fortune's Double
Yellow rose <http://www.rdrop.com/~paul/teas/fortunes.html >. Each of the
thousands of Fortune's Double Yellow now in existence is a clone descended
from a plant taken from China to England in 1845, at which time it was

### I agree that because time itself is valid only in the context of the
universe, the question about what caused the universe cannot be couched in
temporal terms. What Hal and I say is (the way I see it) is to provide a
conceptual framework for looking at the universe from an imaginary outside
perspective, to gain a pleasant, aesthetic sense of understanding, no
more.

With respect to cloning multicellular plants, I should add that my success
rate with roses is 50% to 75%. Higher with plants such as Ligustrum
japonicum Mentha species. Lower with certain trees such as Sophora
secundiflora. Lower still with annuals -- that is, plants that germinate,
produce flowers and seeds, and die within one growing season.

How could the existence of something depend on the evolution
of beings capable of recognizing it?  Okay, if you are right
then pretty close to the big bang it did not exist.  Then at
some point an evolved intelligence finally recognized it.
Did its existence *suddenly* spring up throughout the universe

light from the insipient source?

Yes.  A remote island on the horizon "appears only as a

So this would be a frictionless motor that we can feed energy into
indefinitely.  As we do so the effective mass rises and it seems that
it should become a black hole.

I don't think this will work, for a couple of reasons.  The Schwarzschild
radius for the entire Earth is only about half a centimeter.  Assuming
your motor is at least that big, you must give it an effective mass at
least as much as the entire Earth, which is about 10^25 kg.  So you will
need to boost your rest mass by about a factor of 10^25.  I think it's
obvious that buckytube fibers, while strong enough for a space elevator,
won't withstand forces 25 orders of magnitude greater.

More fundamentally, gravitation is more than just effective mass.
Relativity adds a gravitational version of magnetism (that is, what
ordinary magnetism is to electric fields, gravitational magnetism is
to gravitational fields).  When you achieve high effective masses via
relativistic velocities, the gravitational "magnetic" forces are just
as important as the static ones.  In short, I don't think you will get
a black hole by spinning even an infinitely strong object, because it
is dynamically unstable and wants to explode.  The outward forces are
always going to be greater than the inward ones.  What you'll get is
some kind of spinning region of spacetime in the vicinity of the motor,
but you won't get gravitational collapse.

Barbara,

The problem is that one has to be careful of the selection effect here.
As far as I know when one "clones" plants one takes a cutting that may
consist of trillions (or more) cells.  So amongst those cells there
may certainly be some with relatively "perfect" genomes that allow
the regrowth of a complete plant.  I believe this is related to
stochastic developmental processes and I think this is discussed in
"Chance, Development and Aging" by Finch and Kirkwood (I've heard
Finch speak about this once, though haven't yet read the book).

It explains why you can have identical twins and yet they may still
have some significant variance in the diseases they develop and their
age at death.

I would be very interested in the success rate of cloning plants
from single cells as it might contribute significantly to the debate
Joao and I have been having.

Perhaps we could get Doug to give up the fly experiments and
switch to plant cloning instead.... :-)

Exactly what is a superconducting motor? Your description sounds like
some kind of electrical device where electromagnetic fields are used to
accelerate the rotation of some part. In this case the answer is rather
clearly no: buckyfiber is far too weak to hold together macroscopic
objects rotating at relativistic speeds (it is limited by the strength
of molecular bonds), and you cannot make a black hole by increasing the 
angular momentum density in a region of space - the angular momentum 
causes frame dragging and other weird effects, but does not form a black 
hole. It follows from the Kerr and Reissner-Nordström metric that you 
can only get a black hole if a^2+e^2 < (GM/c^2)^2 where a is the 
specific angular momentum (a=J/Mc), e is the specific charge and M is 
the mass. Too much charge or momentum, no hole. Too bad. 

There is also apparently a theorem somewhere (I think it also easily
follows from the third law of black hole thermodynamics) that says you
cannot break a black hole by spinning it up with external fields. A
pity.

It would be nice if we could pull this off. Some kind of compression
approach, putting energy into cavity modes that have a singularity at
the origin (such as the Bessel functions of the second kind)? Piling
bosons on top of each other?

Mike, you are going to have to define what you mean by "superconducting
motor" to a greater degree.  I strongly suspect that the limit isn't
the buckyfiber.  I'm fairly sure that superconductors all cease to be
superconducting at some specific magnetic field level.  This is fairly
low in the HTSC but may be higher in more traditional SC.  So if you
keep pumping energy into the motor the field strengths are going to
go up until the point where the superconductor fails.  My impression
of what happens when this occurs is enough to make me want to be
several states away.  I think a fair amount of work may have been
done in these areas with high velocity flywheels back in the '70s
and '80s when we were looking for energy storage alternatives.

The typical figure used for diamondoid is something like 50 times
the strength-to-weight ratio of steel.  So buckytubes might buy
you great flywheel energy storage but I don't think they are
going to buy you black hole containment.

Now an interesting question would be what one can do with neutronium
and black holes.  But that is an Anders level question so I'm not
even going to touch it.

Interesting.  One would suspect that annuals would have less DNA
repair capacity -- they invest all of their energy into their
seed production and less into maintaining the "soma" of the plant.
(This is Kirkwood's "disposable soma" theory of aging.)

One would expect that plants bred to survive many years (e.g. roses)
would have better DNA repair and better clonability.  But at success
rates of 50-75% it shows that even with many cells one may not have
a sufficient number of "perfect" genomic copies to replicate the plant.

There really is a study that needs to be done here on "cloning" plants
from single cells.  I know the methods are developed for separating
mammalian cells into single cells and culturing them but I don't
know enough about plant structure to know whether or not single
cells can be used or a collection of cells of different types
is a minimal requirement.

It might be an interesting experiment Barbara, for you to see
if your success rate falls as you decrease the size of the
cutting.  That would seem to suggest that cloning "success"
is a numbers game.  (Mind you with the size of cuttings you
can actually "see", you are still dealing with millions to
billions of cells).

I keep hearing how, during the warning statement from Condolezza Rice, to the 
Saudi Ambassador, the President stopped by to invite the Ambassador out to 
dinner. This communicates an embracement, again, of the Saudi regime, by 
another American president.  Daddy Bush is a consultant to the Carlyle Group,

will state, the interests of Israel, are not  the same as the interests of 
the USA, then the interests of the  Saudis, must be even less, then the 
interests of the USA.  

My sense is that there is no campaign against the Saudi support of jihad, as 
you have indicated, but rather the desire of the President  to protect them 
from criticism from a bi-partisan Congress; including Senator Shelby from 
Alabama, Senator Lugar from Indiana, and Senator Graham from Florida--all 
members of the Senate Intelligence Commitee.

Spudboy,
       That is why I characterized what I said as a "diplomatic war."  In

Robert, as I have time to search more thoroughly, I'll see what I can find
on the Internet with respect to cloning
from single cells. Meanwhile, you might want to look at botanical tissue
culture techniques in general.
 For example,
 http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/tisscult/microprop/woodypl.html
.
The success of various tissue culture
techniques varies from species to species. In most cases, you're still using
more than a single cell.

Not at all. I do not doubt that it extends many light

I hope you are not looking *only* for a pleasant,
aesthetic sense of understanding. It's pleasant to
believe in the Tooth Fairy.

Please answer this question, similar to the one I put
to Lee: 

What is the content of your imagination when you are
imagining this universe to be non-existent?

Now, of course, most of us have heard of: 

Super Survivor Deinococcus radiodurans

http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/publicat/microbial/image3.html

But the above web piece is a real eye opener.  (The
very first web site on the list when I googled D.
radiodurans.) It gives a bit more detail than I've
seen up till now,  suggests that the genome has been
mapped, and generally gets one jazzed about the
possibilities.

I loved the graph comparing the radiation
survivability of humans, cockroaches, E. coli, and D.
radiodurans. At .5 kGy (whatever that means) of
radiation, humans, roaches, and E. coli are dead.  D.
radiodurans doesn't even begin to notice until 6 kGy. 
And then, check out this little note from the caption
of the graph:

"When older colonies of D. radiodurans are used, their
survival extends much farther, to around 17kGy (1.7
million rads)."

First, "Wow!"  Then, "What's that all about?!!"  Their
normal tolerance is upwards of twelve times that of
'regular' creatures, but in a pinch they can crank
that up by a factor of three to ~34 times the
resistance of 'regular' creatures.

And what role does the 'tetrad' structure play in
this?  Might it somehow provide a fourfold redundancy
in informational, ie DNA, backup?  Some sort of
bacterial "I'll show you mine if you show me yours"
kind of thing.  Bacteria have long been known to share
DNA in a 'fast and loose' fashion not typically (as
far as I have heard) associated with eucaryotic cells.

What a sweet little bug this is, with mysteries and
treasures galore!  

Best, Jeff Davis

I think that this sort of stuff is a given in the short term.

One can quite easily extrapolate from a dozen separate product lines that
deal with memory augmentation or knowledge delivery now into something like
the above.

One of my business-plans-in-waiting would involve a mobile device that can
usefully tap into a Google/Ask Jeeves type of thing in a way that can be
done fast and unintrusively during conversation. As anyone who has ever used
Google rapidly with one hand with being in IM in the other, it's a great
benefit to always be able to call up info on anything unfamiliar. Instead of
taking .5 seconds to type "?" in IM, you take 10 seconds to go to Google and
scan a synopsis.

I don't believe so. 

I believe the concept of numbers arose in primitive

of thinking and communicating about physical reality.

This would be interesting.  You may want to include PubMed searches to
see if anyone has attempted dealing with this.  [PubMed may not however

I suspected this would be the case (w.r.t. the success rate
and # of cells).  But there does appear to be a fairly direct
correlation between cloning in plants and mammals.  The only
difference to me seems to involve the process of nuclear transfer.
But the fundamental question of whether the nucleus contains
a "viable" genome would seem to be the same in both cases.

It is a fundamental question that needs to be answered:
"What fraction of an adult entities cells are incapable
of regenerating a copy of itself?"

This has some implications with respect to cryonics because
the regeneration of a body (for head-only suspendees) may
not be quite so easy as people might imagine.

A little known fact is that circa 1993, I made a trip
down to LLNL to their cancer/radiation biology group
and made a point of impressing on them the medical
and commercial importance of having the sequence of
D. radiodurans.  I think this may have made a strong
contribution to their placing the sequencing of its
genome high on their list.

And yes, the complete genome sequence is known:
Science 286(5444):1571-1577 (1999)
ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/data/d_radiodurans/

This is quite significant because prior research was
having a very difficult time understanding the radiation
resistance because it was so difficult to produce mutated
organisms which lacked this property.

A kGy is a "kilo-Grey" which is a measure of radiation dose.
To explain this gets into a very complicated discussion
of how radiation is absorbed by tissues.  It involves
some rather complicated conversions between "rads" and "Greys".

Actually it is more complicated than this.  I don't
think the redundancy is in the tetrad structure but
is instead within each cell.  Most people are aren't
aware of this but the cell division time for E. coli
is ~20 minutes.  But given a 4+ megabase chromosome
and the replication speed of DNA polymerase, the
chromosome cannot be copied in 20 minutes.  So in
order to achieve a maximum replication potential
E. coli has to be making multiple copies of the
chromosome at the same time.

I suspect that D. radiodurans is performing similar
tricks (i.e. each cell has multiple copies of the
genome).  This would allow one to sustain multiple
double strand breaks and still have valid copies
from which homologous recombination could act to
repair valid genome copies.

This is not to say that multi-cell genome exchange
(as Jeff has possibly proposed) is "impossible".
This has been suggested by scientists involved in
NASA's exploration of "nanobacteria" (i.e. no
bacteria has a "complete" genome but the "collective"
does).  It solves the problem that nanobacteria
cannot hold a "complete" genome given the structural
constraints on DNA.  I'm somewhat doubtful of this
solution however since it seems somewhat contrived.

But we have the genome sequence and perhaps as the
function of the proteins is determined we may indeed
discover that genome exchange is one basis for
preserving the program.  Even if it hasn't been
invented by nature we could imagine its usefullness
ourselves.  The problem remains however to know that
the genome being copied is a "perfect" genome.
One needs to deal with the error correction code
issue, which to my knowledge doesn't seem to be
a feature of natural genomes.

This is a rather thin argument, given that the Saudis completely
understand the arab concept of holding your enemies closer than even
your friends... which I'm sure Rice and Pappy Bush understand as well.

I see it as a good cop / bad cop play that is going on. The Saudis,
being authoritarians and educated at OxBridge, understand western
monarchy. They therefore would see the Presidency as a natural ally to
turn to and to receive honest and trustworthy advice and support. The
congress, being the instrument of the chattering masses, and in their
view, the Jew controlled liberal media and Democratic Party, as well as
bigoted conservative Christians, thus naturally fits into the role of
bad cop very well.
So long as the congress is raising hell at the Saudis expense, the
Saudis are going to depend on the Bush administration to not only stand
up for them in public, but also to give them constructive ideas in
private to reform themselves to improve their public image.

Hi!

First of all, thanks for your opinions. I appreciate it. As for your 
thoughts, I don't think our theories are that far apart. Basically, you 
focus on mutations while I prefer more subtle changes in the DNA.

I'm not just talking about mutations that alter the genome. When I refer to 
DNA damage, I'm including telomere shortening, chromatin structure--certain 
3D-formations alter transcription and allow for cancer, and perhaps, I 
speculate, aging too--, methylation, etc.

I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say. Are you suggesting 
that yeast are better tuned than human cells to deal with stress?

I understand cancer is one problem absent from yeast. Yet Drosophila and C. 
elegans, as far as I know, don't have cancer and still age. How do you 
explain them?

Best wishes.

It should be the goal of every adventuresome extropian to live in
an Anders Sandberg(tm) universe.  They are likely to be far more
interesting (as in "may you live in interesting times") than the
vanilla universe(s) we are stuck with now-a-days.

No, clearly not far apart.  I could easily accept the Guarante/Sir2
acetylation/deacetylation involvement with a bit more evidence.
Aging is clearly not going to be one single explanation as much as
humans would like to reduce it to that.

Agreed.  One has to "imprint" a function on the chromatin.  Maintaining
that over 100 years has to be pretty tricky (given that you have to recycle
the proteins).  But tortoises and whales seem to show one can do it for
longer than humans do.

> I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say. Are you suggesting

I'm not so sure you can compare yeast and human cells (and reach good
conclusions).  Yeast cells are designed primarily to divide.  Human
cells are designed to divide then for the most part to go into
"maintenance" mode.  As much as I like and respect Michael Fossil,
I think he may have done aging research a disservice by focusing
too much attention on dividing cells (and telomeres) in "Reversing
Human Aging".

Dividing yeast cells may be better tuned than dividing human cells
to deal with the stresses that they face (Deinococcus certainly
is -- see other recent ExI discussions).  There may be very large
differences in genomes tuned towards "self" survival vs. genomes
tuned towards "organismal" survival.

I'd put much of "aging" on the shoulders of incomplete genetic programs
in cells that do not replicate.  So we are back to dysdifferentation,
mitochondrial aging, lipofuscin accumulation, etc.

Humans may have the luxury of saying "if this cell is pre-cancerous then
lets delete it" hoping that a stem cell of the right type may move in
to replace it.  I doubt such programs are active in Drosophila and
C. elegans.  The fact that they may not be active indefinately in
humans may be part of aging.  (The question being can stem cells always
provide a replacement for a defective/deleted cell.)

The lifespans of Drosophila and C. elegans are so short that the cancer
risk is low.  But as one evolves to a larger and longer lived organism
the cancer risk increases significantly.  So as the cancer risk increases
so to must the genomic defenses against it.  So in the evolution of genomic
programs that are long-lived, one also has to evolve programs that manage
to deal with one cell that can turn against the collective body.  It is
a consequence of the larger number of cells and their longer lifetimes
(in which to accumulate mutations) that makes cancer a problem in
larger organisms.  You are always up against the wall -- how does one
extend lifespan while at the time reducing cancer?

But I seem to remember that solutions which are ring black holes are 
possible. If one can spin up one to become a ring, then one can surely 
keep this up until the ring is very thin? Or is there going to be some 
instabilities, like event horizont turbulence?

Make that "Michael Fossel".  (Always assume my spelling may be

It escapes those with the ideological perspective of the
New York Times that the rich always get the goodies first,
e.g., VCRs, big-screen TVs, and so on, and that the revenue
thus generated prepares the way for lower prices and mass
production.  Entrepreneurs need more reassurance than vague
promises or threats from the Central Committee.

Of course, to a liberal "promises" can mean nothing less than
perfection, and an implicit need for socialist control that
guarantees come hell or high water that everyone will be
"taken care of", if it takes violence or not.

Now comes the usual appeal to our heart strings:

All the usual corruption especially prevalent where
the press can't do a proper job (too few subscribers
and too little representative government) can always
be laid at the feet of the western imperialists and
their lackies.

Signal:  create more opportunities to rent to rich foreigners
(or, when you run out of them, the nouveau rich among the locals)

Again, perfection has not been obtained yet, and it can be
only the fault of the western imperialists, as usual.

All repressive cultural traditions would be liquidated if
this society were being run by the right sort of leftist.

Yes, you or someone else on this list has read The Mystery of Capital.  How 
many years did it take us to get our laws on property rights straightened 
out?  My estimate is that we finally got that settled around the time of our 
First Centenial Celebration.  Building a country is hard work.

I think there is a lot of weird turbulence-like instabilities here 
(just look at the animations of Brill waves 
http://jean-luc.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Movies/NCSA1999/BrillWaves/). 

But the real problem seems to be a topology theorem I have heard about
but not yet read up on, which (according to the GR theorist brother of a
colleague I asked) means that unless some energy conditions are broken
spacetime is locally connected - ring-shaped black holes are not
allowed. The way around this, since I can always arrange some stars into
a ring and compress them into a ring shaped black hole with my Stellar
Melasmifyer, is that the event horizon of the ring rushes inwards very
fast (it can move superluminally, since it is not really a signal or an
object, merely the region from which nothing can emerge) so that no
signal can get through the hole. So the ring collapses into an oblate
black hole which then "rings" away the anisotropy with gravity waves. I
promise to check this theorem when I get the time, because I honestly
don't understand how that works if the matter of the ring was originally
rotating faster than allowed by an extremal black hole.

Thanks! :-) I promise that once I get a good production line up and
running for my universes this list will get priority for them. 

I'm thinking of those Brill waves. Maybe we should base matter on them 
instead of particles...

You have that exactly right.  DeSoto chronicles the whole
process, which really wasn't complete until the end of
the 19th century.

How hard did you work?  I, for one, hardly lifted a
finger.  To put it mildly, I'm having a hard time
relating to your remark, and to the similar one in
the previous email.

(Unlike you, however, I'm sadly a man without a 
country, but do try to appreciate what I can.)

I'm unsure that the Americans worked any harder than
anyone else to keep their heads above water (as a
society), and probably had to work a lot less.  It
really helped them, the white ones at least, that
cunningly placed oceans made it almost impossible
for large well-equipped armies to ever invade them.
(Clearly the awesome exception to what I am saying
is the frightful tasks of 1776-1783 and 1812-1815
in warding off the huge well-supplied and very
skillful armies of the a then very great super-power.
But since then?)

> and even less of an idea about what it took to

You've really got that right.  But there are damned few
people, IMO, who appreciate (whatever their position on
the political spectrum) that it is *FAR* from obvious
just what it is that makes a country able to supply its
citizens with progressive government, a high standard
of living, and peace, i.e., to make that country great.

Evidently the best progress towards documenting such an
understanding can be found in the works of Hayek, De Soto,
and perhaps a brand-new (to me) author, Mancur Olson,
who in his books "Power and Prosperity (Outgrowing
Communist and Capitalist Dictatorships" is to me the
first "trans-Libertarian" author who has the most clearly
seen the limitations of libertarian thinking in the real
world.

The people of Western democracies can by no means be
said to have an understanding of the causes of their
prosperity; frequent polls always show that they'd
vote away their liberties in an instant if only the
mechanisms to do so were in place.  As for power, the
people of the West are slowing making their governments
more and more powerful, relegating even personal ethical
and safety concerns to their big-Mommy (elected) overlords.

    This is the 73'rd update of my fly longevity experiments. Average
temperature was 25.5 C during this run. Here mitochondrial
antioxidants/substrates are tested. I also recently found another source
for coconut juice, and with an eye to making (colorless) coconut juice a
standard addition I test out this lastest batch.
    The control had a very poor survival, possibly because of viral
contamination. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) by itself did nothing, and
inconsistent effects were obtained with lipoic acid by itself. However the
combination of ALC 125 mg & lipoic 25 mg yielded a more "normal" survival
curve. I've obtained large increases in survival before, but it has always
been when the control bottle showed poor results. I'm skeptical, but
none-the-less will try ALC, and lipoic acid again.
    The negative result with coconut juice was a big surprise, as this
type of fruit juice has repeatedly exhibited a survival promoting effect
in the past. However the coconut juice used this time is from a different
source, and possibly heat treatment may have deactivated the juice. This
coconut juice is looked at again in the next run.

The World According to Google
[Technology] By: maxm, 2002-12-09 11:41
http://www.msnbc.com/news/844175.asp?0si=-

In a bygone erasay, five years agoit would have been an occasion to 
burn shoe leather. A friend clued me in to an eBay item connected with a 
criminal case I was following. I didnt know who the seller was, and the 
district attorney on the case didnt know, either. Were looking into 
it, he assured me.



On Steroids?

The New York Times and The Washington Post are now flogging the latest 
drug crisisover-the-counter steroid precursors.



Scientists discover gene 'signature' for tumor's tendency to spreadphp
[Health] By: maxm, 2002-12-09 11:34
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-12/dci-sdg120602.php

Researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Whitehead Institute 
have discovered a pattern of genetic activity in several types of 
primary tumors that appears to predict the likelihood that they will 
spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body. If larger studies 
support these findings, this early indicator of life-threatening cancer 
spread might lead to a clinical test that would help determine 
appropriate treatment. The study will be published by Nature Genetics on 
its web site on Dec. 9.



The genetic basis for caffeine-induced anxiety discovered
[Health] By: maxm, 2002-12-09 11:31
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-12/acon-tgb120502.php

Individuals who have two linked genetic variations are far more likely 
to end up biting their nails following a jolt of caffeine than those who 
don't, reported Harriet de Wit of the University of Chicago on Sunday, 
Dec. 8.

In addition to providing new information on why this commonplace drug 
affects some people differently than others, the results validate a 
methodology that should be capable of identifying individual differences 
in how people respond to a number of major drugs, she said.



Solar cells aiming for full spectrum efficiency
[Technology] By: max, 2002-12-09 11:27
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993145

Solar power is set for a boost with the help of a material that can soak 
up energy from almost all of the Sun's spectrum. It should allow solar 
cells to jump in efficiency from today's best of 30 per cent to 50 per 
cent or higher.



Breast-cancer X-ray Could Double Up As Test For Heart Disease
[Health] By: max, 2002-12-09 11:24
http://www.lef.org/news/disease/2002/12/06/eng-fairfax/eng-fairfa...

Mammography screening, used routinely for the early detection of breast 
cancer in women over 50, could also be used to identify the risk of 
heart disease.

The finding was important because heart disease is the largest single 
killer of women in most developed countries and because about two-thirds 
of women who die suddenly of a heart attack have had no previous symptoms.



DNA microarray analysis can help identify aging-related genes
[Aging] By: max, 2002-12-09 11:18
http://www.lef.org/news/aging/2002/12/05/eng-newsrx/eng-newsrx_09...

New DNA array technology is useful for identifying genes associated with 
aging, biochemists in Japan discovered as they studied the effect of 
salivary gland function during aging based on gene expression.

Let's be clear about this. Do you agree with the following
statements?

1) The universe exists.
2) There is absolutely no reason why the universe exists.

If you agree with those, then my question is:

  Could the universe not have existed at all?

So far you have only argued that total nonexistence is
inconceivable. But the question now is whether it's
*impossible*. If you think it's impossible, then you do
have an answer to the question "Why does the universe
exist?" - "Because the alternative is impossible."

So it seems to me that to agree with proposition 2, you
must say that total nonexistence *is* possible, albeit
inconceivable. Otherwise, the existence of a universe
becomes a logical necessity, and the allegedly meaningless
question does have an answer.

My apologies, you are of course both correct.  So I should have said massive
socialist / communist states or states with corrupt despotic dictators that
do not respect property rights of individuals.  Of course this was a minor
point in my post, but thanks for rapidly correcting my error.

Damien, did these 'socialist' land reforms in Latin American countries grant
ownership rights to the peasants?

economically ruinous use of copyright law is the main issue here, not the
exact amount of cash amassed by Mr Gates, to the detriment of the economy."

There seems to be some dispute what the topic is and this thread has
frequently split between the validity of IP laws and the fact that one
person can be allowed to a mass so much wealth.  Damien's analogy
specifically compared property ownership with IP laws, I have said all along
that I can not comment to the validity of IP laws, I have heard a lot of
arguments for and against, but have yet to make up my own mind (having a
patent myself, I may be biased).  You think the main issue is copyright laws
because that is your area of concern, apparently, but that is not what I
have been arguing.  Please re-read the thread and youll see the different
discussions.  This discusion may not *to you* be about the ability of a
person to amass wealth, but it was to me and many other people in the
thread.  If you think a person has the right to amass a great deal of wealth
without IP rights helping him out, then we are in agreement and can have no
further productive discussion, if your intent is to debate the validity of
IP laws in relation to Gates amassing wealth, I have nothing productive to
add to that discussion either.  

For reference sake, the thread started with Alexander Sheppards email
'Replies to Ron h and John Clark regarding the nature of socialism,
capitalism'  (continue to read to see the origination of this thread, if
not, disregard the rest of this message)

Michael

     ------------------------

In which he said "(Reply) Capitalism, as in the modern system of
concentrated industrial control under capitalists (this is different from
pre-capitalist trade or "free markets" as advocated under Smith) has nothing
to do with keeping the fruits of a person's labor. Do you think the fruits
of Bill Gates labor is really all that $50 billion? Nor does socialism,
except possibly for market socialism, which is something an oddity, favor
such a thing. Rather it says (at least if is using self consistent concepts,
that is, libertarian 
socialism) that because the distribution of resources necessarily affect the
conditions of the individuals who use them, then if a person has decided to
produce excess resources, then those who are affected by the existance of
lack of such resources ought to able to decide for themselves if they need
them or not (in a way which is reasonably consistent with the needs of the
group)."

To which I replied In the first email titled 'RE: fruits of Bill Gates labor
worth $50 billion'

"Do you think the fruits of Bill Gates labor is really all that $50
billion?"

Do you think that the fruits of his labor are not?  If not, how much do you
think they are worth?  And how to you justify how much you think they are
worth?  Is it just an arbitrary whim?  If it is, why is it more valid than
the arbitrary whim of the millions who use the fruits of his labor for their
own productive gain?  If 1 million people all think his product is worth 10
dollars to them, then he now would have 10 million dollars.  What if 10
million people all think it is worth $100 dollars to them?  Who are you to
argue with them?  They chose of their own free will to value his product at
$10, or $100.  Would you point a gun at their head and force them to
de-value it?  

The only options here is a centralized group determining how much his
products are worth, at the end of a gun no less, or each individual deciding
of his own free will how much it is worth to them (by buying or not buying
his product)

   ----------------

At this point the discussion rapidly segregated into an ethical / unethical
debate of Gates behavior, where I was speaking specifically of an individual
amassing wealth.  It is clear from Alexander Shepperds first post that he
was not speaking merely of IP rights, unless he considers 'capitalism' just
another way of saying 'IP rights'

The following two messages of that thread were centered on the ability of an
individual to amass wealth, not IP rights.

Not more than a few messages later in that same thread, I specifically
stated (waaay back on 11/15)

"I have no doubt that many people dislike what Miscrosoft has done and is
doing and what it has done at Gates leading, but this is secondary to the
nature of question that Alexander implied, and I am not informed enough to
intelligently comment on the moral / immoral aspects of Bill's behavior.
Replace Bill Gates with any millionaire or billionaire and ask yourself the
same question that Alexander is asking 'Is his labor really worth $x billion
dollars' and that was the topic of this discussion."

This is exactly why I used the lollipop analogy.  This discusion may not *to
you* be about the ability of a person to amass wealth, but it was to me and
many other people in the thread.  If you think a person has the right to
amass a great deal of wealth without IP rights helping him out, then we are
in agreement and can have no further productive discussion.

I don't believe we can make any intelligible
statements about a cause (or lack of cause) for the
universe. 

(I refer here to causes rather than reasons, because
it is conceivable to me that the universe has always
existed for a reason, even if it was not caused.)

To say that a thing or event is possible or impossible
is to say there are circumstances in the universe that
allow or prohibit the occurrence of that thing or
event. Therefore it is meaningless to ask whether the
universe's non-existence was possible. Things can be
possible or impossible only in a universe.

Ah, but the real question may be does "Mitchell Porter" exist at all.
The simulation of this interaction would seem to be so much less expensive
if we just cut to the chase.

Is a way to judge a sim vs. a non-sim possible based on whether or not
they choose to conserve the energy resources? Do sims ever grow tired of
consuming energy to maintain a "lifelike" waste of energy?

       Just a quickie on the SIM universe theme. Have you ever noticed 
anything that could be considered a 'Matrix' Style glitch ? I have noticed 
quite a few unexplainable and unprovable glitches ranging from a tree I 
remember and saw every day for years only to find out it never existed or a 
neighbours doorway that had been there for 30 years and then had been bricked 
up without a trace.
       The strangest and scariest of all was the time I was walking home from 
work with a pocket full of money and the very next second, it was night time, 
my pockets were empty and I had no coordination and couldn't see properly. 
The only proof of this last event was the unmistakable smell of alcohol in 
the air. I think this must be a biproduct of a change to the matrix.

That's the reason that I can look at the approaching singularity with 
anything less than dread.  It seems as if it may well be less bad that 
the way things appear to be headed.  At least we don't know ahead of 
time that it's a choice between destruction and slavery.  And it MIGHT 
stop the onrushing centralization.  We may all end up dead, but that's 
one of the obvious directions that we're headed in anyway.  And we might 
not.

And this is the reason that friendly AI is so important.  It's one of 
the major things that could cause the singularity could turn out favorably.

I actually see more potential problem with oligopolies; a true monopoly
can never exist for long without forcible exclusion of competitors, but
a small oligopoly (for example, the tobacco companies or large media
companies) can offer the public much of the price and quality benefits
of true competition while still excluding newcomers, stifling innovation,
and controlling information flow.

As die-hard a capitalist as I am, I am not one of those who turns a
blind eye to the idea that concentrations of wealth and power--even
when acquired though entirely legitimate, even honorable, means--can
tend to corrupt those who hold it.  I think it's important, though,
to be restrained in exercising force against such corruption, and it
should be targeted in the right place.  For example, the suits
against Microsoft generally focus on some of its contract terms and
pricing which are not corrupt at all, since they are free choices;
but then they ignore the things MS has done that are actually wrong
and need fixing, like the breach of contract with Sun, and their
false claims of supporting public standards.  Sure, power can corrupt,
but let's not then fight power itself--let's fight just the corruption.

Feudal lands were generally acquired by force of arms, not purchase,
so there's more justification for the use of force to break them up and
put them back into the hands of the people.  Indeed, I think what
finally killed feudalism as a viable system is the crossbow--a relatively
inexpensive weapon that could be used by a farmer of ordinary strength
and could penetrate armor.  Feudal lords and tax collectors tend to
behave themselves more with the threat of a bolt in the chest.

I wonder if using the example of plants would be a good way to
argue the benefits of cloning.  Many, many, food crops are cloned.
Every navel orange in the world is a clone of a single plant, for
example.  I'm sure the luddite faction would just trot out "but
people aren't plants", but I think that's pretty easy to counter.
I'm just not sure if the PR value of plant examples is positive
or negative on balance, but I think it's probably positive.

### Sorry if I misinterpreted the meaning of this thread. I have absolutely

It follows from the Kerr and Reissner-Nordström metric that you
can only get a black hole if a^2+e^2 < (GM/c^2)^2 where a is the
specific angular momentum (a=J/Mc), e is the specific charge and M is
the mass. Too much charge or momentum, no hole. Too bad.
There is also apparently a theorem somewhere (I think it also easily
follows from the third law of black hole thermodynamics) that says you
cannot break a black hole by spinning it up with external fields. A
pity.

Perfect. Just to point out that the efficiency of transforming the
mass-energy of a *non* rotating Reissner-Nordström EMBH (black hole
endowed with e.m. structure) into particles-antiparticles pairs
(essentially a e+ e- gamma plasma) in the 'dyadosphere' region,
seems (after calculations at Livermore Red. Lab., by Remo Ruffini
and Jim Wilson) to be >> 50% and very close to 100% (!), for black
holes with mass between the mass of a neutron star and 10^6 M.
The e+ e- gamma plasma due to the vacuum polarization process
(Heisenberg and Euler, 1935) seems to be self-accelerating from
the horizon radius to the outer limit of the 'dyadosphere' region,
at least under astrophysical circumstances. Calculations for
a rotating Reissner-Nordström EMBH are on the way.

But let's be honest here...90% of the people who rant against Bill's
billions don't have the first clue /why/ they object, or what the
real moral foundation of their objection is.  They simply object to
the wealth itself, and /assume/ that there must have been some
immoral means used to obtain it, because their imaginations are so
pitiful they can't conceive of obtaining that kind of wealth by
purely legitimate means.  And of the remaining few who /do/ have a
specific objection to something he's done, it's probably something
that's perfectly legitimate in a true free market, like the tying
contracts or undercutting competitors.  I don't recall ever reading
an essay or a post condemning Bill for the legitimate reasons he
actually can be justly comdemned (except my own, of course).

Ah, found a fun paper:
http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0004/0004051.pdf

This explanation for quasars seems hopelessly optimistic, but has plenty 
of interesting details about toroidal stars and black holes. The theorem 
I was referring to earlier was the topological censorship theorem of 
Friedman, Schleich & Witt 1993. I still consider these beasts a bit 
unlikely, but what a wonderful universe it would be if they existed or 
we could make them!

Yes, this is very useful. But isn´t this extraction process only for the 
electrical part of the mass-energy? I thought it ended up with a boring 
schwarzschild hole after the charges had been neutralized.

Lee,
       I have heard various reasons for disliking Bill Gates:
1.  Personally in my view, he seems to be an unlovely person.
2.  Some people seem to dislike him due to their own greed or their coveting 
what he has.
3.  I keep hearing that this original problems with the Justice Department 
was due to a political shakedown.  Allegedly he didn't use to make campaign 
contributions but now that he has learned his lesson the politicians leave 
him alone.
4.  I would be interested in hearing what your "legitimate" reasons are.
       My basic position on Mr. Gates is that of an observer.

I said "many *seem* to do".  I was not pointing at you 
personally or even at this particular "war".  The first part of 
the sentence above is a bit more important anyhow.  The 
so-called "war on terrorism" will not decrease terorism if it 
involves endless war as Bush as proclaimed.  It can only 
increase lack of safety and deplete us in every way including 
economically.  This "war" is also being waged using means that 
decrease real freedom at home and aborad.  Attacks on freedom in 
the name of ending attacks on freedom make no sense.

A strategy that includes violations of several Amendments in the 
Bill of Rights is likely to "maximize peace"?  How so?  What 
kind of peace?   How will using great violence against say, 
Iraq, when Iraq has never been shown to have any real links to 
the 9/11 perpertrators or Al Qaeda, maximize peace?

I am pointing out that there is no reason to believe the current 
solution is viable and asking people to think again, especially 
to think about what they are lending sanction too and its 
possible very negative consequences.

The question of why this bubble of space-time came into being or 
how is not at all unreasonable to ask.  That we are dependent on 
its existence does not mean we cannot ask the question or work 
toward and possible find answer[s].

The complaints I have with Bill are (1) He actively advocates strong
copyright laws, even to the point of lobbying the US to enforce its
monopolies on foreign soil; (2) He signed a contract with Sun agreeing
to produce implementations of Java that passed conformance tests,
and willfully broke that agreement; and (3) he markets some products
by claiming to support public standards while actively subverting the
value of those standards (e.g. Kerberos).

Other than that, I have no problem whatsoever with giving away the
browser to put Netscape out of business (that's perfectly fair play
as far as I'm concerned), or with making exclusive contracts with
hardware suppliers forbidding them to offer alternatives (if Compaq
wants to sign a contract like that, it's their business), or any of
the other so-called "crimes" he is charged with.

You made the claim.  You offer the evidence you consider

There's nothing particularly inflammatory or even unusual about
calling Chomsky's political views nonsense.  Only a few of the
extreme left take him seriously at all since he made a fool of
himself as an apologist for mass-murdering psychopath Pol Pot.
His views on linguistics of course are another matter entirely,
and are still the received wisdom of the field, as they deserve
to be.  But just because he's a brilliant man, that doesn't make
him a decent human being, or make his ethical or political views
relevant or respectable.  He does get quoted a awful lot, though,
because he's also pretty good a spotlight-grabbing.

Yes, but of course it is not a foregone conclusion
that things won't turn around on their own.  People
may come to their senses, especially as the old ones
die off, and their stubborn imperviousness to new 
ideas dies along with them.

Why do you think so?  So far as I can tell, the
planet keeps getting safer and safer for humans.
Oh sure, we could have a few terrorist nukes
here and there, but even in Israel, cars kill
four times as many people as terrorists do.  (Yes,
yes, I know: cars don't kill people, bad drivers
do.)

And it may take several small nukes a year in the
U.S. to match the 30,000 dead annually from traffic
accidents.

That's right, so far as I can see.

A reasonable point Lee.  Since Barbara has raised the point that
we have been cloning plants for centuries the question becomes
"What is new under the sun?" -- and why is that objectionable?

Is it the process of nuclear transfer that is so objectionable?
Or is it the process of working with a nucleus that contains
a human chromosome set?  Who would get worked up if it were a
nucleus with a set of chromosomes to produce a rose bush?

This raises the issue that I don't think it is "cloning"
per se that raises the emotional ire of the luddites but
the fact that scientists are messing with human embryos.

I think the activity raises the quite reasonable fear that
we may be on a path towards "extincting" the current human
race.  That is bound to raise concerns towards the protection
of oneself and ones offspring.  (Also raises some interesting
questions with regard to whether "species preservation" is
built into genomes.)

It requires a significant shift to embrace the perspective
"evolve or become extinct".  Most species do not have that.

It is only on the extropian list where an individual with an IQ a couple
of standard deviations to the right of the norm (somewhat below Eliezer's
but not so much so that we can't hold a mutually educational conversation)
will encounter a statement (such as the above) where one is relatively
clueless with respect to the topic being discussed.

I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.  But it certainly
points out how the average person who reads their horoscope in the paper
every day is separated by light-years from the typical extropian.

Samantha,
       I didn't even say that all his views were nonsense.  I only said the 
one sample I read once upon a time struck me that way.  I indicated I was 
still willing to remain open minded enough to read further if you will give 
me a reference that is readily available.  I did indicate that given how I 
regarded the one samply I have read that I am not willing to put myself out

<geekmode=FULL>
Well, any metric-savvy person should be able to figure out that a kGy (whatever that means) is a "kilo"-
Gy (whatever a Gy is)--and the quoted text indicates that a Gy is equated to 100 rads. k is for kilo, 
check? So .5 kGy is 500 rads, which is indeed roughly the LD-50 for humans in the old tables. Check.

So far so good; that leaves a "Gy" as the mystery unit. 
http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/radrisk.html 
seems pretty useful. [Google is your friend]

This site says a Gray is 1 joule of deposited energy per kilogram of tissue. Sounds right to me. Not sure 
who this "Gray" is or was, but I bet a persistent person could find out.

Some search terms could be:

ABSORBED DOSE, ABSORBED DOSE INDEX, KERMA & SPECIFIC ENERGY IMPARTED IONISING IONIZING RADIATION

Tiny correction, friend Robert: rads and Grays are easy, they are both defined in terms of raw radiation 
"input"(joules per mass unit). Other units that try to indicate the contributed dose-as-*damage* are the 
complicated ones you are thinking of, such as the Sievert or the REM (Roentgen-Equivalent-Man).

Fair, enough.  It only took me 3 minutes with
the help of St. Google to find something
interesting.  I got it from
http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/index.cfm
and the whole site is devoted to his
writings.

The paragraphs that began to get my interest were

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The comparison between the Soviet and U.S. domains is a commonplace outside of culturally deprived sectors of the West, as
illustrated in earlier Z articles. Guatemalan journalist Julio Godoy, who fled when his newspaper, La Epoca, was blown up by state
terrorists (an operation that aroused no interest in the United States; it was not reported, though well-known), writes that Eastern
Europeans are, "in a way, luckier than Central Americans": "while the Moscow-imposed government in Prague would degrade and
humiliate reformers, the Washington-made government in Guatemala would kill them. It still does, in a virtual genocide that has
taken more than 150,000 victims... [in what Amnesty International calls] a `government program of political murder'." That, he
suggested, is "the main explanation for the fearless character of the students' recent uprising in Prague: the Czechoslovak Army
doesn't shoot to kill.... In Guatemala, not to mention El Salvador, random terror is used to keep unions and peasant associations
from seeking their own way" -- and to ensure that the press conforms, or disappears, so that Western liberals need not fret over
censorship in the "fledgling democracies" they applaud.

Godoy quotes a European diplomat who says, "as long as the Americans don't change their attitude towards the region, there's no
space here for the truth or for hope." Surely no space for nonviolence and love.

One will search far to find such truisms in U.S. commentary, or the West in general, which much prefers largely meaningless (though
self-flattering) comparisons between Eastern and Western Europe. Nor is the hideous catastrophe of capitalism in the past years a
major theme of contemporary discourse, a catastrophe that is dramatic in Latin America and other domains of the industrial West, in
the "internal Third World" of the United States, and the "exported slums" of Europe. Nor are we likely to find much attention to the
fact, hard to ignore, that the economic success stories typically involve coordination of the state and financial-industrial
conglomerates, another sign of the collapse of capitalism in the past 60 years. It is only the Third World that is to be subjected
to the destructive forces of free market capitalism, so that it can be more efficiently robbed and exploited by the powerful.

Central America represents the historical norm, not Eastern Europe. Hume's observation requires this correction. Recognizing that,
it remains true, and important, that government is typically founded on modes of submission short of force, even where force is
available as a last resort.

The Bewildered Herd And Its Shepherds

In the contemporary period, Hume's insight has been revived and elaborated, but with a crucial innovation: control of thought is
more important for governments that are free and popular than for despotic and military states. The logic is straightforward. A
despotic state can control its domestic enemy by force, but as the state loses this weapon, other devices are required to prevent
the ignorant masses from interfering with public affairs, which are none of their business. These prominent features of modern
political and intellectual culture merit a closer look.

The problem of "putting the public in its place" came to the fore with what one historian calls "the first great outburst of
democratic thought in history," the English revolution of the 17th century. This awakening of the general populace raised the
problem of how to contain the threat.

The libertarian ideas of the radical democrats were considered outrageous by respectable people. They favored universal education,
guaranteed health care, and democratization of the law, which one described as a fox, with poor men the geese: "he pulls off their
feathers and feeds upon them." They developed a kind of "liberation theology" which, as one critic ominously observed, preached
"seditious doctrine to the people" and aimed "to raise the rascal multitude...against all men of best quality in the kingdom, to
draw them into associations and combinations with one another...against all lords, gentry, ministers, lawyers, rich and peaceable
men" (historian Clement Walker). Particularly frightening were the itinerant workers and preachers calling for freedom and
democracy, the agitators stirring up the rascal multitude, and the printers putting out pamphlets questioning authority and its
mysteries. "There can be no form of government without its proper mysteries," Walker warned, mysteries that must be "concealed" from
the common folk: "Ignorance, and admiration arising from ignorance, are the parents of civil devotion and obedience," a thought
echoed by Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor. The radical democrats had "cast all the mysteries and secrets of government...before the
vulgar (like pearls before swine)," he continued, and have "made the people thereby so curious and so arrogant that they will never
find humility enough to submit to a civil rule." It is dangerous, another commentator ominously observed, to "have a people know
their own strength." The rabble did not want to be ruled by King or Parliament, but "by countrymen like ourselves, that know our
wants." Their pamphlets explained further that "It will never be a good world while knights and gentlemen make us laws, that are
chosen for fear and do but oppress us, and do not know the people's sores."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I wouldn't exactly call that nonsense, reserving
that term for Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky or the poetry
of T.S. Eliot and several others I could name.  What we
have here is (1) a typical denounciation of the U.S. for
everything that happens in its "domain", i.e., the part
of the world directly under U.S. rule, and (2) some
description of the "hideous catastrophe" of capitalism
in recent decades---well, okay, I guess that he verges
into nonsense here after all---, and (3) a rather good
description of the dangers (as seen from the point of
view of elites) of common people getting too much power
(i.e., government losing too much of it).

You could discuss that, or other things at
that site.  Chomsky is not short of words ;-)
---nor are they at all hard to find.

I agree with all the above points, but it seems to
me that this discussion and many like it tend to
confuse two meanings of the word "universe".  One
meaning is *everything* and the other is what fell
out of the big bang.

This confusion occurred before in the 'teens of the
last century, when "universe" sometimes meant what
we later came to call our galaxy.  It went away after
Hubble and others discovered the Milky Way.  Linde
and many others (see Guth's great book "Inflation")
try to place what fell out of our big bang in a 
wider context.  Of course, no one knows too much
about that yet.

[Non-member submission]

Looks like we have a clearly defined protagonist to carry the mantra for
the anti-immortalist, deathist elite.  I'm talking about Bush's
appointed bioethics advisor, the doggedly pragmatic Leon Kass. It seems
that Mr. Kass has it in for anyone who thinks that living forever is a
good idea.  Kass was in Toronto recently where he gave a lecture
entitled, "Why not Immortality?". in which he stated just how immoral
and selfish it would be to try and live longer than our grandparents.
Not only that, but he suggested we'd be so down right bored to tears
that we'd never to be able to enjoy another sunset again.

Thanks to Simon Smith and the Betterhuman's team for putting up the good
fight.  Smith and fellow staff writer, George Dvorsky, submitted a press
release to the Toronto media.  Also, Smith took the time to do an
excellent in-depth analysis of the topic while adding a few ideas from
myself.  So, before you go and write your congressman, take a look at
what we had to say.

Take Care,

What do American Airlines and the State of California
have in common?

Answer: they both have to make severe spending cuts
that aren't politically possible without declaring
bankruptcy (in one case) and near insolvency in the
other.  In each case, parties that will be hurt that
usually have to much political power to be hurt.
Maybe its the only way that these organizations
can survive.

I don't mean to suggest that our dependence on the
existence of the universe is reason for not asking a
question about its cause. 

I mean that we cannot conceive of anything less than
its existence, which makes questions about its cause
meaningless. 

Here is an example of a question we would all consider
meaningful: 

    "What caused the Hubble telescope to exist?" 

We can consider this question about the Hubble
meaningful because we can conceive of the Hubble
telescope not existing. That the Hubble exists, given
that it might not have existed, demands an
explanation.

The same is not true for the question... 

    "What caused the universe to exist?" 

We can conceive of the Hubble not existing but we
cannot conceive of the universe not existing. 

Non-existence of the universe = NULL. We can
manipulate "null" as a word, but the word has no
referent. We cannot have a null conception.

By universe, I mean the totality of all things. This

Not that I wish to question your's or Anders' or Eliezer's high IQ :-). But
let's assume that I with my pretty moderate IQ, had never heard about the
properties of a black hole before and did a google search and the first link
would lead me to a website where the achievements of Karl Schwarzschild and
the mass-energy relation were explained in the first paragraph, I could
easily formulate such a sentence as the one above and would sound
intelligent,
especially between the ears of a reader who reads it in context with *his
own* knowledge about black holes and would have a hard time imagining what
it's like to know nothing about this topic.

So, when he calls my question "intelligent" he actually celebrates his own
creativity, his thinking capacity and his knowledge that was inflamed by my
humble remix of another man's insider information delivered to me by Great
Gooogleymoogley's billionfold eyes within the split of a second.

A neglected form of intelligence and creativitiy that is not captured with
IQ measurement for example is the ability to jump down from the academical
horse and explain connections and causalities about black holes in an
everyday languange without involving three letter words and mathematical
formula so that Average Joe might get encouraged to lay aside his horoscope
papers and to reinforce this initial knowledge.

Yes, quite so.  Also, sometimes I wonder just how well people
understand things who cannot express what they know in every-
day language.  "Any scientist who cannot explain to an eight-
year-old what he is doing is a charlatan" ---Kurt Vonnegut in
Cat's Cradle.

"A witty saying proves nothing."  I used to believe the eight-year-old 
principle.  I really did.  Richard Feynman succeeded in explaining the 
theory of little arrows to me when I was nine (Q.E.D.), and I have on 
occasion tried to explain General Relativity to very small relatives...

...but eventually, things got complicated.

I think the universe is a deeper place than Kurt Vonnegut realized.  It's 
very easy to *think* you've conveyed understanding, when all you've really 
done is taught someone shiny new words that sound impressive to them but 
don't really connect to anything else in their minds.

I don't know how to convey understanding.  Sometimes people catch the 
pattern of what I say, or at least they seem to, but it seems more due to 
their own ability to fill in the tremendous gaps in what I say than to any 
writing ability of my own.  It works, sort of, a little, if all you need 
is for a few geniuses to understand what you say.  But how do I talk to 
anyone else?  I don't know.

I completely agree. Although sometimes it takes a *patient*
eight-year old, and they are rare. As Esaias Tegner put it, 
"what is murkily said is murkily thought" - being able to 
explain something clearly also implies that you can understand 
it clearly.

As for the sentence Robert took as an example, that was likely
murky just due to terminology, not concept (I hope). There is a
difference between relying on complex or specialised shared
concepts and having a complex train of thought. The sentence

	"In vertebrates, IP3Ks phosphorylate the second
	messenger Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) to produce
	Inositol 1,3,4,5 tetrakiphosphate (IP4)"

is of the first kind, a description of something fairly
straightforward but relying very technical language. 

	"The Einsteinian constant is not a constant, is not a
	center. It is the very concept of variability -- it is,
	finally, the concept of the game. In other words, it is
	not the concept of something -- of a center starting
	from which an observer could master the field -- but
	the very concept of the game."

is of the second kind, a complex train of thought whose value
cannot easily be ascertained despite being written in a far
less technical language (although some hidden jargon exists;
the above mess is likely only meaningful within a postmodern
context, and even there I am doubtful if it says something
relevant).

Computer viruses and worms live in the fast lane, propagating themselves 
through a network faster than even the most highly caffeinated techie 
can purge them from a system.

But Matthew Williamson, a researcher at the Hewlett-Packard laboratories

Questions about extraterrestrial life - whether it exists, what it would 
be like, how to look for it - generate very little scientific consensus. 
Some scientists enthuse over the Search for Extraterrestrial 
Intelligence, which listens for radio signals from alien civilizations. 
Others propound the Rare Earth Hypothesis, which states that an array of 
unusual factors allowed complex life to arise here, and that any life we 
find elsewhere would likely be as simple as bacteria.

The notion that we are better off with impaired police is widespread, 
particularly with regard to surveillance and databases. The recent 
revelation that the Defense Department has a project headed by John

It is time for Congress to defund the National Center for Complementary 
and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM.) After ten years of existence and over 
$200 million in expenditures, it has not proved effectiveness for any 
"alternative" method. It has added to proof of ineffectiveness of some 
methods, but we had that disproof before NCCAM was formed. NCCAM 
proposals for 2002 and 2003 promise no more. Its major accomplishment 
has been to ensure the positions of school faculty who might become 
otherwise employed - in more productive pursuits.

Vonnegut wants to provoke. Stephen Hawking recently announced he wanted to
publish a book next year where he explained modern cosmology for twelve year
old kids. I am not that optimistic, but then...I don't have the mind of
Professor Hawking. No one expects anybody to explain time dilation, cosmic
inflation or black hole singularities to a pre-teenager in a sufficient way.
Principally it IS possible to communicate the basic facts of a science to a
high school junior without using insider slang and academic talk that
frightens even some *regular* extropians. But it is hard professional work
though, to write a popular science book without getting too academic.

Feynman is a very good example.When I read his talk about those little
arrows it appeared to me that I understood quantum electrodynamics. As a
non-physicist I have to reread it every once in a while, but the principle
of adding little arrows got stuck in my mind since the first reading.

And then his wonderful three-step-formula :
1. An electron goes from A to B.
2. A photon goes from A  to B.
3. An electron emits or absorbs one photon.

If you tell a kid that these three fundamental actions explain everything in
the universe, all we eat and touch, see and smell, except the phenomena of
gravity and radioactivity, I believe this kid will ask you right away to
explain gravity and radioactivity to him. That's a great way to inflame
people and to boost their enthusiasm. But pleasant people like Feynman pop
up too seldom within one century.

I believe one way is to find out how many steps you leave out, when you talk
about a topic, tacitly assuming your dialogue partner has the same ability
to jump that you have. I guess one important point in failing to communicate
is that your partner does not have the guts to admit at what - probably
low - step he fails to get what you mean.

Persons who I found belong to the best communicators, are editors of
publishing companies. They want to publish your book, but they feel they
must really understand every sentence you said/wrote. Some top editors are
not afraid to admit the parts they don't understand. It is their business to
understand, so they have rejected the vanity of pretending to know and
understand everything from scratch. They uncover the thinking steps you
leave out and force you to rewrite passages and then they rewrite them one
more time.

When Stephen Hawking started to write his famous book and sent 3 new pages
from Cambridge, England to his New York editor, he received 6 pages of
questions in return from him. Hawking was used to skip 5, 6 or more
thinking steps that *he* thought were common place knowledge. And he was not
at all amused that he had to rewrite his whole book several times. His
editor kept asking persistently until he thought  that a moderately
intelligent human - like him - was able to understand it if only he
invested a little time and concentration.

It is this ability to put oneself in somebody else's place, daring to think
naive, and regularly talking to fairly intelligent people who are
self-confident and persistently enough to interrupt you - there are only
few, very few :-) - because they desperately want to know if Friendly
Artificial Intelligence must not have arms and legs to get around in the
world ...that you start to communicate in a different way, maybe.

Lee,
       I just finished reading several articles on that Chomsky page and I am 
still where I started -- the man has no substance.
       Well, there is one thing.  The folks in General Semantics say the map 
is not the territory.  After Chomsky we can add a charge is not proof of 
guilt or anything else.

This is very true Eliezer.  One could use "global warming" as a good
example for this currently.  It isn't clear to me whether it is so
complex that it can't be understood by a roomful of scientists or
whether we just don't have the abstractions that can turn it into
something that most people can deal with.

You always have to tie "understanding" to the foundation that exists
in the personal experience of an individual.  One of the problems with
one-to-many communication is that you have little knowledge of the
experience of each individual.  One has to speak to the common denominator.
Very difficult, IMO.

This is perhaps the true test of writing and communicating.  How does one
bridge the gap between people who have ones knowledge base (say the
extropian reading list -- which even I haven't read completely) and
the people who have no knowledge of the "culture" of that list?

This is related to the problem I think Eliezer may be speaking of which
seems to be more along the lines of how do technically adept people
communicate with those who are much less so?  Can one develop analogies
that bridge the gap?

Noam Chomsky and Cambodia

One of the best exchanges I have read on Noam Chomsky and his views on
Cambodia can be found here...

NOTE: There are a total of eight articles in this discussion. Of those, the
first seven were originally posted to alt.fan.noam-chomsky, a Usenet
newsgroup dedicated to the work of Noam Chomsky. Thanks are in order to John
Kenneth Rucell for granting permission to reproduce his posts on this topic.
Within these seven articles, there are a number of typos (and perhaps a few
factual errors). Inasmuch as Mr. Rucell did not have the opportunity to make
corrections in his posts, I have also left my own articles unmodified. There
are a few references to other articles which had been posted concurrently in
alt.fan.noam-chomsky and soc.culture.cambodia, but the material below is for
the most part self-explanatory. The eighth and final article contains a few
additional thoughts, written roughly five years after the original articles.


From: bruce@interaccess (Bruce Sharp)

Recently there has been considerable debate about various scholars and
whether or not they supported -- either actively or inadvertently -- the
Khmer Rouge. The definitive word on this subject has been provided by Sophal
Ear, who was kind enough to post his political science thesis on the subject
in soc.culture.cambodia. I'd like to add a few of my own thoughts on this
issue, examining Cambodia specifically, but also bearing in mind the
implications regarding the skepticism and gullibility of scholars in
general. I hope that this will not be mistaken for a flame; I'm not trying
to be rude to anyone.

Let me begin by addressing any questions which might arise concerning my own
qualifications for discussing this topic. Lest anyone doubt my credentials,
my work background includes four years of working in the food service
industry, along with some eight years of janitorial experience. Furthermore,
I should stress that when I say "janitorial experience," I am NOT using a
euphemism for the hands-off, remote work of property management. I refer to
eight years filled with solid, eight-hour days of picking up popcorn cups
and scrubbing toilets. (Hence my personal motto: "I've cleaned more toilets
than most people have sat on!") I also have a great deal of familiarity with
college, gleaned from one afternoon when I went to visit a friend at his job
delivering VCRs and overhead projectors to classrooms at Northwestern
University. In the unlikely event that there are lingering doubts about my
expertise, please allow me to recount an anecdote which may prove
illuminating:

Years ago I was working in a movie theatre which was being repainted. I was
asked to paint a large radiator in the women's washroom. I had just opened a
new can of paint, and a friend suggested that I remix the paint using an
electric drill. But I needed an extention cord. After five minutes of
fruitless searching, I finally asked a coworker.

"Why do you need the extension cord?" he asked.

"Because I want to use the drill to mix the paint, and the cord won't
reach."

He looked at me for a moment, then spoke very softly. "I have an idea," he
said. "Why don't you move the paint can closer to the wall?"

I tried that and it worked.

Bear my impressive intellectual pedigree in mind, then, as I outline some of
the mistakes prominent scholars have made in writing about Cambodia. A good
starting point is a book written in 1976 by George Hildebrand and Gareth
Porter: "Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution." Hildebrand and Porter
presented a glowing depiction of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, describing
the new government's "coherent, well-developed plan for developing the
economy." (P.88.) Brutality in Cambodia? No! "The evacuation of Phnom Penh
undoubtably saved the lives of many thousands of Cambodians... what was
portrayed as a destructive, backward-looking policy motivated by doctrinaire
hatred was actually a rationally conceived strategy for dealing with the
urgent problems that faced postwar Cambodia." (P.56.) Starvation in
Cambodia? Not anymore! "It is the offically inspired propaganda of
starvation for which no proof has been produced... Thus the starvation myth
has come full circle to haunt its authors." (P.86.) 

 What is most noteworthy about "Starvation and Revolution" is the manner in
which it was received by the far Left at the time of its publication. The
most prominent scholar to praise the book was the esteemed Noam Chomsky.
Chomsky described the book as "a carefully documented study of the
destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian
revolutionaries in overcoming it, giving a very favorable picture of their
programs and policies, based on a wide range of sources." He went on to note
that "it has not been reviewed in the [New York] Times, New York Review, or
any mass-media publication, nor used as the basis for editorial comment,
with one exception. The Wall Street Journal acknowledged its existence in an
editorial entitled 'Cambodia Good Guys'... which dismissed contemptuously
the very idea that the Khmer Rouge could play a constructive role..."

Does this indicate that Chomsky supported the Khmer Rouge? It is perhaps
also worth noting Chomsky's forward to "Cambodia in the Southeast Asia War"
by Malcolm Caldwell and Lek Tan, written in 1972, in which Chomsky predicted
that a communist victory in Cambodia would lead to "a new era of economic
development and social justice." (Brief footnote: Caldwell was later
murdered by the Khmer Rouge.)

Those are, certainly, supportive statements. But Chomsky's "support" for the
Khmer Rouge was not rooted in indifference to brutality. It was, I think,
rooted in naivete, gullibility, and poor scholarship. Having reread
Chomsky's comments on Cambodia, having heard him speak, and having seen the
documentary about the good professor, I have no doubt that he is a man of
honor and great integrity. 

However, he knows nothing about Cambodia.

No... that isn't true. The truth is much worse. He knows just enough about
Cambodia to sound knowledgable to all of the people who really don't know
anything about Cambodia. (Quick example, from the documentary: Chomsky
refers to the US bombing as ending in 1975. It ended in August 1973, over a
year and a half before the Khmer Rouge came to power.)

How could Chomsky have so seriously misjudged the nature of the Khmer Rouge?
One reason is what I would refer to as the "The Curse of the Generalist."
Chomsky writes about events all over the world. Can one person really
understand all of the intricacies of the politics and history of any one
country? Probably. But can one person understand the intricacies of ten
countries? fifty? two hundred? No. There are conflicting accounts of the
history of any country and any event. How can a person who does not have
specialized knowledge of a given country evaluate which of those accounts is
accurate? In Chomsky's case, he does not evaluate all sources and then
determine which stand up to logical inquiry. Rather, he examines a handful
of accounts until he finds one which matches his predetermined idea of what
the truth must be. He does not derive his theories from the evidence.
Instead, he selectively gathers "evidence" which supports his theories and
ignores the rest. Furthermore, he does not subject sources he regards
sympatheticly to the same rigorous critical scrutiny that he applies to
conflicting accounts. The book by Hildebrand and Porter provides a perfect
case in point.

The book is meticulously footnoted. The footnotes are worth reading. The
primary sources for the information on conditions under the Khmer Rouge? The
Khmer Rouge themselves. Of the 309 footnotes in the book's final chapter,
dealing with conditions inside Cambodia, roughly 125 cite as their source
Khmer Rouge government agencies and Khmer Rouge officials. Of the Western
sources cited in the final chapter, the majority allude to quotations which
Hildebrand and Porter use as examples of the "distorted" coverage by the
U.S. media. Apparently, the authors did not bother to interview even one,
single, solitary refugee who had fled Cambodia. If they did, there is no
record of such an interview reflected in the footnotes. Now, try to imagine
for a moment how Chomsky would have reacted to a book on, say, El Salvador,
if the author had relied on the ARENA party for over one-third of its
"factual" evidence... if such a book had cited a thesis by Alfredo Cristiani
in its analysis of the Salvadoran economy... if the author had not
interviewed a single refugee. Would Chomsky have praised its "careful
documentation?" Would he have noted the "success" of the right wing? Would
he have given a respectful nod to the "wide range of sources" consulted by
the author? It is cruelly ironic that it was precisely the lack of "diverse
sources" that Chomsky cited in his contemptuous, dismissive review of
"Murder of a Gentle Land," one of the early accounts of Khmer Rouge
atrocities. 

None of this, I must stress, is meant to imply that Chomsky is or was a
Khmer Rouge apologist. He isn't. But there is, I think, some justification
for the anger felt toward him by many of the scholars, journalists, and
human rights advocates who have spent years studying Cambodia. In addition
to his initial skepticism regarding the reports of genocide, he has also
misrepresented the nature of the media coverage during the years when the
Khmer Rouge were in power. In the documentary about Chomsky, "Manufacturing
Consent," much is made of the amount of news coverage given to events in
Cambodia relative to the appalling paucity of news coverage of East Timor.
But, as Sophal Ear has pointed out in related posts, concurrent coverage of
human rights violations in other right-wing regimes (specifically, Chile and
South Korea) exceeded the coverage given to Cambodia. Perhaps my memory is a
bit hazy... after all, these events were taking place during my "Dazed and
Confused" high school years... but to my recollection there was very little
written about Khmer Rouge atrocities until the Vietnamese invasion in 1979,
when war, famine and chaos sent hundreds of thousands of starving,
brutalized refugees into Thailand. It was then... and only then... that
Cambodia became a cover story in the mainstream media. William Shawcross, I
think, summed up the sudden flurry of interest rather nicely, dryly
observing that journalists could report on a holocaust after enduring
nothing more trying than a three-hour ride from Bangkok in an
air-conditioned taxi.

In the years since the Khmer Rouge were deposed, Chomsky has openly
acknowledged their crimes. However, to the best of my knowledge, he has
never publicly admitted his own mistakes. His frequent collaborator, Edward
Herman, seems intent on avoiding the issues through silly semantic games: in
an scowling critique of a review of Haing Ngor's book "A Cambodian Odyssey,"
Herman accuses the reviewer of "resuscitating an especially foolish
propaganda claim" ... specifically, that the Khmer Rouge "'tried to
exterminate... a majority of the population.'" He writes, "... if the Khmer
Rouge aim was 'autogenocide,' it was unable to come anywhere near meeting
its objective. The best overall survey of the period, by Michael Vickery,
estimates 750,000 excess deaths in the Khmer Rouge era from all causes... on
a population base of six to eight million." Apparently, as Sophal points
out, Herman's logic is this: Since a paltry 750,000 victims did not
constitute a "majority," then there was no autogenocide.

I will point this out to my wife, who is Cambodian, the next time she mourns
the loss of her father, her brother, her grandfather, or any of the other 20
relatives she lost during the reign of the Khmer Rouge. Don't cry, Srey...
it's okay, we've all been mistaken, it wasn't genocide after all...

Forgive me if my anger comes through from time to time.

Putting aside semantics momentarily, it's worth addressing the issue of the
estimates of the number of victims who died between 1975 and 1979. The
figure of 750,000 cited by Michael Vickery is by far the lowest put forth by
any serious Cambodia scholar. Other scholars suggest significantly higher
totals, based on substantial, detailed analyses. Why do Chomsky and Herman
choose to rely on Vickery's estimate? The answer, of course, is that a lower
estimate is more in keeping with their predetermined idea of what the
"truth" should be. The worst massacres, after all, are always perpetrated by
the superpowers. Or so the theory goes...

If, through honest errors, Chomsky had supported the Khmer Rouge, the final
question is: What constitutes redress? How does one atone for such mistakes?
There were many prominent scholars who openly supported the Khmer Rouge;
most have had the decency to subsequently admit their error. It is,
moreover, important to remember the context in which the Khmer Rouge came to
power. Given the haphazard manner of the US bombardment of the country,
given the violence and stupidity with which Lon Nol had ruled Cambodia, I
believe that it wasn't all that unreasonable to think that conditions were
bound to improve with the end of the war. Most of us are optimists at heart;
we hope for the best even when our better judgement warns us of our folly.
We all make mistakes. Hopefully, we learn from them.

And, hopefully, one of the things we learn is how to say: "I was wrong. I am
sorry."

Of course, it is only appropriate that I admit that my analysis here may be
wrong. I might be making a complete ass of myself by blabbering and drooling
incoherently across our valuable bandwidth. Maybe it's easy for me to say
this because my reputation is not on the line; after all, I'm just some damn
toilet guy, mindlessly searching for the Holy Grail, the Mother of All
Extension Cords...

Maybe I should just let all of this pass... maybe I should just ignore the
pomposity and the arrogance that cloud brilliant minds in a fog so thick
that they are blinded to the truth...

On the other hand...

Maybe Chomsky and Herman and Limbaugh and Gingrich and the rest of our
brilliant social commentators should spend less time talking, and more time
cleaning toilets. Lock them in the biggest, dirtiest movie theatre around,
isolate them from the minions and dittoheads who feed them the sound bites
and half-truths they collect to support their pet theories... Let them turn
their mental energy inward. Let them subject their own theories, their own
reasoning, even their own values to the relentless critical scrutiny to
which they subject the work of their detractors. This, the opportunity for
self-examination, is one of the gifts afforded by menial labor.

There is another gift, as well, when it comes to cleaning toilets.

It helps to keep us humble.

Actually there is a pretty clear correlation between poulation growth 
and economic growth.

The theory being that the poulation has grown at the same rate as food 
production.

I believe that casuality chain is:

more food -> more people -> more brains -> more inventions ->
more non food production time -> more food

And then we have society as of today, where food production is only a 
small part of society's economy.

It certainly is.  I actually spend several hours a week
either explaining physics and math to twelve year olds
or playing the instructor in a Moore-style point set
topology class to them.  Yes, Vonnegut vastly oversimplified.
But he had a great point.

I am vastly more experienced at giving chess lessons than
teaching math.  So I have known for decades just where the
student is liable to have difficulty, and am seldom surprised.
Teaching other things never goes so smoothly, for I am
constantly amazed at the way that some extremely intelligent
students have failed to see a particular point (in their case
it is exactly my fault that I skipped something).  This is
exactly what Hawking encountered as Hubert described when
his editor didn't understand something that Hawking believed
he had made perfectly clear.

The difference between a student and a typical person
is that the student is wagering that he or she should
concentrate and spend time to absorb the thinking of
a field or instructor or speaker.  Few of us are students,
and even then we are students only in a few areas.  I don't
have the time and patience to become an expert on 
post-modernism, for example, but I keep chugging away
at general relativity.  We most of us have to make our choices.

Casual readers of extropian materials will either be
drawn in or they won't be.  One can either try to explain
one's ideas or our ideas---ideas that took most of us
years to absorb fully---as one would try to explain to
a diligent eight year old, or one can unleash all the
non-technical ideas and hope that something appeals.

I am sure that such analogies can always be found.
Every good explanation is, in a sense, a good analogy.

While technically true, experience shows that oligopolies of fewer than 
around 10 companies tend to engage in collaborative price controls to 
maximize their profit.  After there are more than about 10 players, 
someone is too likely to break the agreement.  This, of course, depends 
on what the immediate benefits/penalties are from breaking.

Both parts need to be fought.  Centralizations of power are damaging to 
society in and of themselves.  OTOH, humans need a certain degree of 
stratification to be satisfied.  This creates a constant tension, and 
it's probably that no stable solution is possible.  But dynamic ones may 
well be.  Still, if one is to regard society as a pyrimidal structure 
based on some dynamic (money, status, power, etc.), then it is probably 
proper that each stratum be, O, 5% advantaged relative to the one below 
it, and that it be 5% as numerous.  This 20-way branching factor enables 
the total height of the tree to be manageable.  Now, clearly, no such 
carefully structured setup is either reasonable or desireable, but the 
social controls should be designed to encourage this kind of layered 
grouping (with fuzzy edges) rather than as currently where they appear 
to be encouraging an hour-glass shape, with a large bottom.  It is even 
possible, though I wouldn't say likely, that some such vision was behind 
the pyramid on the US great seal (it's masonic, so it means not just 
SOMETHING, but SEVERAL things).  So this may have been the original 
vision (mind you, the people envisioning it saw themselves at the top, 
and used both scheming and violence to put themselves there).

However, a twenty way fan-out (i.e., each supervisor has 20 supervised, 
each employer has 20 managers, etc) limits the amount of control 
exercised.  This has both good and bad effects, but generally good.  
Actually, a more beneficial structure would have lots of low pyramids 
that have a peak without supervision from outside.  These are called 
small businesses, and their disappearance under the current social 
controls is one of the most damaging features.  This is largely caused 
by the excess burden placed on small business by the immense body of 
regulations that they must deal with.  It's currently nigh unto 
impossible to run a business without a dedicated accountant, and a 
lawyer.  Also, insurance is usually a legal necessity.  etc.  These 
regulations are quite reasonable for a large company, but for a small 
business they are a crushing weight.

1) actually, most feudal lands were acquired by local armed groups 
setting up to defend the farmers.  This was quite necessary under the 
conditions of about 500 AD.  Over time, the descendants of the 
commanders became the barons.  There was no formal ownership of land 
originally, as there was no authority to recognize it.  But commanders 
decided which areas they would defend, and those who wanted protection 
moved there.  (Well, it was more complicated, but that's the basis.  
Sometimes the villagers hired mercenary troops, etc.  The end point was 
the same.)
2) In England the invading Normans routed the Saxons, and took over the 
role of military leaders, but they didn't replace the population, which 
continued to have rights to the land until the enclosure acts (quite 
late, and not feudal times at all).
3) Environment played a large part.  In England there was not as great a 
threat of an external invasion, so locals didn't feel as great a need 
for a strong military.  It needed to be good enough to keep out the 
Danes (Vikings), and that was about it.  So there was a strong class of 
relatively independant people (yoemen).  The Norman invasion subdued 
them, but didn't eradicate them.  Elsewhere, there was a greater threat 
of invasion, and the military took more power (and, of course, abused it).
4) The crossbow is a lousy weapon unless you are in a fortification.  
The longbow is much preferable.  It has greater range, more power, and a 
faster rate of fire.  But it takes years of training, where the crossbow 
can be picked up in a couple of months.  Also the crossbow requires 
machining, where the longbow can be hand made.  Thus the longbow was the 
preferred weapon of the independant yoemanry, while the crossbow was 
used by soldiers defending fortifications.

And what does any of this have to do with justification of monopolies?

Well, to me (in my manner of discourse, that is), you overstate
things so baldly.  "No substance"?  Now I will grant the logical
possibility that you are right; it may be that upon enough
investigation that there will be so many areas of *nonsense*
---as you wrote before---that I'll be forced to concede it.

But although practically no one on this list seems to agree
with me, I AM SURE that it's only a difference in fundamental
values that separates people who occupy different positions
on the political spectrum.  I wager that Chomsky makes perfect
sense to those who share his fundamental, basic, hidden, and
perhaps even unconscious assumptions.  Why, they even say as
much.

Given time to investigate, I would try to find out what those
assumptions are.  (I do not have such time.)  But here is a
typical one that I think you would find:

Living in the same world with the U.S., as a Canadian prime
minister put it, is like being in bed with an elephant.  You
just never see the end of references direct or indirect to
American culture or policy (the world's big question right
now is whether or when the U.S. is gonna hit Iraq --- it's
just like kids standing around at high school sort of hoping
there is going to be a fight).

So you end up rather early on liking or disliking America,
and that basic emotion then for years filters all you see
and hear, and your underlying feelings are hardened to the
point of solidification.  (This does not apply to strictly
*everyone*, but then practically no characterizations do.)

So just *one* of Chomsky's assumptions is that America is
the bad guy, and that a great deal can be explained from
this "fact".  To those who have this same perception, a
lot of what he says makes perfect sense.  To others, it
makes complete nonsense.

I stress that this is only *one* of Chomsky's assumptions,
and perhaps the least defensible one of the lot.

> Well, there is one thing.  The folks in General Semantics

Yeah, in the little excerpt I found, there was an implicit
charge that the U.S. is responsible for everything bad that
ever happens in the Western hemisphere.  Chomsky spoke of
the U.S.'s "domain".  That's probably another assumption,
but one that goes much deeper, and has all sorts of ramifications.
Who can really draw the line between influence and control in
an airtight logical way?  To me---well, I hold a precisely
opposite view to the conspiracy theorists:  the world is
a complex mess in which many stupid things occur, and no
agency is half as smart as to be able to control anything.
(Well, okay, almost anything.)

Thanks.  The article start off a little roughly, but then
settles for me into what are key paragraphs (paragraphs 9
and 10:

> What is most noteworthy about "Starvation and Revolution" is the manner in
which it was received by the far Left at the time of its publication. The
most prominent scholar to praise the book was the esteemed Noam Chomsky.
Chomsky described the book as "a carefully documented study of the
destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian
revolutionaries in overcoming it, giving a very favorable picture of their
programs and policies, based on a wide range of sources." He went on to note
that "it has not been reviewed in the [New York] Times, New York Review, or
any mass-media publication, nor used as the basis for editorial comment,
with one exception. The Wall Street Journal acknowledged its existence in an
editorial entitled 'Cambodia Good Guys'... which dismissed contemptuously
the very idea that the Khmer Rouge could play a constructive role..." <

> How could Chomsky have so seriously misjudged the nature of the Khmer Rouge? One reason is what I would refer to as the "The Curse
of the Generalist." Chomsky writes about events all over the world. Can one person really understand all of the intricacies of the
politics and history of any one country? Probably. But can one person understand the intricacies of ten countries? fifty? two
hundred? No. There are conflicting accounts of the history of any country and any event. How can a person who does not have
specialized knowledge of a given country evaluate which of those accounts is accurate? In Chomsky's case, he does not evaluate all
sources and then determine which stand up to logical inquiry. Rather, he examines a handful of accounts until he finds one which
matches his predetermined idea of what the truth must be. He does not derive his theories from the evidence. Instead, he selectively
gathers "evidence" which supports his theories and ignores the rest. Furthermore, he does not subject sources he regards
sympatheticly to the same rigorous critical scrutiny that he applies to conflicting accounts. The book by Hildebrand and Porter
provides a perfect case in point. <

Well, the author, Mr. Bruce Sharp, may be right about
"The Curse of a Generalist", but that cannot be the
whole explanation, because I'm pretty sure that you
could find an extremely knowledgable leftist scholar
on Cambodia who defended the Khmer Rouge to this day.

But Sharp is closer, IMO, when he says: "Rather, he
examines a handful of accounts until he finds one which
matches his predetermined idea of what the truth must be."

Exactly so.  This is the scientific method.  You will
find that scientists in reality already have a hunch
to what is going on, and look for evidence to support
it.  In the end, if they're right like Einstein, they
die but are acclaimed.  If they're wrong, like Lamarck,
then they die but are discredited.  (There is no such
thing as "The Scientific Method" as presented in your
junior high school class, and as believed by most bad
philosophers.)

Am I, or are we, really any different from Chomsky?
Well, it's easier for me to change my mind because
I don't have millions of fans around the world
depending on me to champion their indictment of
the West.  So, *sometimes*, especially after the
passage of years, I can admit that I was wrong.
Noam Chomsky cannot.

### What are your ideas about the best way to achieve control over such
power concentrations, while avoiding excessive and arbitrary use of force?

What would you say if the local violence monopoly could charge higher rates
for the protection of large entities (as measured by capitalization),
compared to smaller entities? So, a very wealthy individual (like Gates) or
a medium-sized corporation, would pay the same rate, but a very large
corporation would pay even more. The exact balance of rates would be
empirically chosen to maximize GNP. This approach would not be sufficient -
there would need to be some change of IP laws (abolition?), and others, but
it would be a good start to make large accumulations of power less likely -
but without introducing arbitrary or jealousy-based criteria.

Lee,
       I think there is a difference between what you said and what Chomsky 
says.  If you dislike or have reservations about America you at least offered 
evidence of what you felt that way.  If your evidence was inconclusive you 
were at least concrete enough we could discuss that if we wished.
       As an aside let me say I don't want to debate the US vs Canada.  I 
have close Canadian friends that have voted with their feet and stayed home.  
On the other hand I have spent a fair amount of time in the Toronto and 
Montral areas.  I really liked both but again I voted with my feet.
       On the other hand I don't read Chomsky as being nearly as concrete in 
his monologue as you are.  He also uses the technique of making so many 
charges that it becomes almost impossible to seperate them for possible 
refutation.
       However you make some good points on underlying assumptions.  Still, I 
have a final exam to prepare for and after that some material that is really 
interesting to study as well as a couple of threads I am very interested in 
discussing -- as to Chomsky I am going to cut my losses and quit wasting my 
time on him.

### I did write about the irrational use of IP laws, but I agree it is not
really an argument against Gates himself, who merely used them, but rather
an argument against the State which enacted them in the first place.

The congressmen who wrote the first copyright act two hundred years ago
probably thought of it as a tool for helping scrappy writers and composers
improve their meager income. They never imagined that words, in the form of
computer program, could become a tangible asset, even more important than
coal and steel. With such changes in the world it's no wonder that the law
is now working in a counterintuitive and destructive manner.

In 1979, 3 years AFTER the killing in Cambodia Chomsky wrote in his book
"After the Cataclysm":

  "If a serious study.is someday undertaken, it may well be discovered.that
  the Khmer Rouge programs elicited a positive response because they dealt
  with fundamental problems rooted in the feudal past and exacerbated by the
  imperial system.. Such a study, however, has yet to be undertaken."

Or consider that other Holocaust and the matter of Robert Faurisson, a rabid
anti Semite who has described the Nazi Holocaust as a "Zionist Hoax",
the diary of Anne Frank as phony, and "American Zionists" "and "the Jews"
were responsible for World War II. Chomsky wrote the preface for one of
Faurisson's books praising his "findings" and his "extensive historical
research." Then he said "I see no anti-Semitic implication in the denial
of the existence in gas chambers or even in the denial of the Holocaust."

I think the New York Review of Books got it right when they called
Mr. Chomsky "the Doctor Demento of American Political Commentary."

I have far more problems explaining concepts that an 8-year-old
/would/ be able to get easily but that stubborn 40-year-olds refuse
to accept because they don't jibe with long-held prejudices.

Piffle and poppycock.  Admitting error is indeed a fundamental
basis of the real scientific method, and the inability to do
so is a serious character flaw, not a mere reaction to
circumstance.  I have in the past argued for government
funding of the space program, for patent laws, for privacy
protections, and other things I now see I was wrong about.
If I find arguments to change my positions on other things,
I will change those too.  If Noam Chomsky "cannot" change his
mind, it's because he is a weak and immoral human being, not
because there are others who count on him--he's not accountable
to anyone or anything but his own values, and if those values
include maintaining positions he knows to be false, then he
is rightly judged by that choice.

I'm not opposed to a touch of cynicism, especially when talking
about political pundits, but I utterly refuse to be pessimistic
about the ability of human beings to be good and honorable and
honest and forthright.  People can be, and are, all of those
things, and will continue to be.

Ah, but relevant to *what*? Half the trouble in understanding difficult
discourse is knowing what interpretative frame to read it through. Consider
the citation above (from Jacques Derrida, although Anders politedly omits
this provenance): an impatient scientist (Sokal, let's say) might assume
that the writer is an idiot who doesn't understand the difference between a
constant such as the speed of light in vacuo and a parameter (let's say). My
reading, with a certain amount of hermeneutic charity toward its
poststructural frame, suggests that Derrida is referring not to *c* but to
the spacetime interval, where the invariant quantity is maintained despite
any number of variations in either space or time distances so long as they
are suitably coupled. Hence, Derrida says (playfully), while relativity is
founded upon an invariant, this cannot serve as a *center*, a Primum Mobile,
a godlike place without motion from which the entire field of play (of
reality) can be observed in a top-down, magisterial fashion. His error is
not in saying any of this, which is a commonplace of physics, but in
supposing that this insight can be imported directly and usefully into any
relativism salient to human culture.

But I have the mournful feeling that this attempted explanation of Derrida's
apparent obscurity will have failed Robert Bradbury's test and will itself
need explanation...

BTW, there are plenty of groups of smart people out there (mean 3 sigma,
say) who are not members of this club house. :)

### Since toothy predators have been around for hundreds of millions of
years, one might expect that life should have found a way of protecting
itself from their depredations. The conclusion is that tigers do not cause
death.

### This is not correct. If you take a single bacterial cell and let it
divide, randomly removing one of the daughter cells after each division,
sooner or later the bacterium will suffer a mutation (as a result of free
radical damage, most likely) and die without offspring. The "eternal"
division is only a feature of colonies where the occasional mutated cell
dies but the rest keeps going. As an analogy, a human society does not age
(at least not biologically), even though its constituent parts do.

No cell can truly cope with the processes you mention - they can only reduce
the probability of failure, but not the eventual outcome. The only way of
escaping biological death is through copying faster than the damage
accumulates, and removing the damaged copies by a selection process. The
same logic applies to multicellular organisms.

There is no doubt that DNA damage contributes to aging.

### The low success rate with cloning explains the problem - you need to go

one.

### It is quite possible that transcriptional misregulation does influence
aging, but ascribing to it an exclusive role is IMO missing the point
entirely.

### What types of stress are you referring to? Do you mean an increased
tendency for apoptotis? Is there any accumulation of mutations in the
Werner's cells? If so, then this would be a prefect example in favor of the
DNA-damage hypothesis - a pleiotropic effect of mutations on energy
production, reduced antioxidant defenses, and a proapoptotic state of the
cells.

Keeping in mind that "corrupt despotic dictators" aren't some historical

As far as I know, yes.  Or at least that was the goal.  Whether it progressed
fully, I don't know.  One complication would be the USA intervening to stop
the process.

Yeah, I was focussing on rent, and the rentlike aspect of IP.

Consider that if Bill Gates's market was restricted to Iceland he wouldn't be
very rich, even with the exact same product.  Given a piece of IP, you can be
much richer simply by selling it to a much larger market, without any extra
work.  I can hear the voices saying "that's fair, it's reward proportional to
the social benefit!"  But if we allow looking at social benefit, we can look
at possible social harms from vast concentrations of wealth.  The fact that
libertarians tend to refuse to even look at such things is why I'm not a
libertarian anymore.

Learn to take smaller gaps.

I wonder if there's any relation to programming.  Not that programmers are
magically better at explaning things. *cough*  But there's some saying about
computers making philosophy honest.  If you can explain something to a
computer -- write a program -- you understand _something_ concrete, at least.

I'm taking Group Theory Visualized from Hofstadter at the moment, where the
goal is to get an intuitive sense of group theory, with lots of pictures as
appropriate.  Most of us aren't math majors, and we've got a musician too.
For my presentation, on characteristic and commutator subgroups, I took lots
of little steps, often referring back to stuff we knew, or repeating myself
and pretty much avoided any big jumps.  It seemed to work pretty well -- at
the end of my half-hour, I think people actually knew what I was talking
about, as opposed to just having a definition.

Most of the books I'd tried looking at didn't have anything like that.  Most
were pretty crappy (half didn't even give a clue as to why commutators are
called commutators.)  One (Kurosh) gave me a lot of the clue I needed to
understand and pass on the material.

Course notes at
http://php.indiana.edu/~nccarter/m590f02/
if anyone wants to look.  My stuff isnt' there yet, might not be for a while,
I'm better at drawing pictures than making them on a computer.

### Another line of evidence supporting this idea comes from my boss' lab -
the work on cybrids by Davis Parker, Russell Swerdlow, Janice Parks, Pat
Trimmer, as well as other labs, Schapira, Mitokor, shows that mitochondria
from aged humans have a reduced activity of complex I (in Parkinson's
disease) and complex IV ( in Alzheimer's disease) if transplanted into cell
lines different from their original background, and the composite cells
(neutral nuclear background + aged mitochondria) undergo apoptosis somewhat
easier from controls. Since neurodegeneration is one of the most important
aspects of aging in humans, this is strong evidence that mtDNA dysfunction
plays a role in aging.

Rabbit genes /did/ find a solution to wolves: breed faster.  That
solution does little good for the individual rabbit, however.
Evolution found solutions for radiation and free radical damage:
produce the germ-line cells early on in the reproduction cycle,
protect them, and find mechanisms to reject damaged ones.  This
works quite well, but is similarly useless to the host.

On this score, I think my previously scorned proposal to launch a
product labeling campaign should take advantage of this. Labeling
'organic' food products which are the result of cloning as 'cloned
organisms' would bring the truth in advertising as well as the cloning
debate further along.

Hermeneutic charity! That's a great casual attitude! With a taste of bitter
lemon :-)
Reading Baudrillard, Deleuze, Derrida, Virilio...I do it for literary
reasons, not because I hope to gain higher insights on a philosophical or
even scientific plane. They are plain fun if you understand them as poets or
writers who are in love with language and of course with their own brains
more than with eternal truths. They play around with scientific knowledge
and you only get the joke if you don't take them too seriously. My humble
interpretation...

Even the most liberal sociologist can point to many studies which shows
that collective violence achieves its goals far more often than
non-violent collective action.

Non-violent collective action is only effective when the civilian
sector of the enemy population has a high degree of respect for such.
The only two real movements that successfully used non-violence were
Gandhi's campaign to turn British public opinion, and King's campaign
to turn northeastern American public opinion. Both target cultures have
had a history of christian sympathy for the downtrodden.

Nonviolence directed at the muslim world does not bear out any similar
degree of efficacy in turning public opinion. For example, during the
first Gulf War, Iraqi missiles rained down on Israel, and Israel did
not retaliate. Instead of sympathizing with Israelites, muslims around
the world danced in the streets at the suffering of Israel. Muslim
society instead regards nonviolence as weakness and dishonor, only
worthy of disgust and delight at the suffering of the non-violent.

More lies. Lorie McElroy, in her book published last year, presented a
very good case for real links between Iraq and Al Qaeda, which included
contacts between the lead hijacker and one of Iraq's intelligence
agencies while under the observation of the Czech government.

Furthermore, it is a historically standard approach in the US that
civil rights are restricted during wartime than during peace, and that
such help minimize the ability of the enemy to infiltrate the home
front. How, exactly, do you expect to prevent the next terrorist attack
here otherwise?

All actions have negative consequences, just as they have positive
consequences. Just because they do doesn't mean we should refuse to
act. Furthermore, I have yet to hear you propose anything that would
resemble a strategy which would be a better alternative. Your sniping
from the wings serves little purpose, and your lack of rational
alternatives demonstrates your lack of credibility.

Yes, there are those LPers who take the 'republicrat/demopublican'
concept too far, and automagically condemn anything the US govt does,
no matter who is in office, and no matter what is actually being done.
I'll bet that the day that a Libertarian sits in the White House, there
will be stories running around the LP Samizdat about the heinous crimes
against humanity and corruption of that individual. The LP doesn't need
an opposition party to play dirty tricks on it, it does the job on
itself quite nicely.

Agreed.  But with Feynman gone are they having much fun?

Robert

P.S. I have this story running around in my head about the parties that Feynman
used to attend where he and another famous physicist, presumably a Caltech
professor, would try to out-do each other with their mental jousting.  I've
tried googling it and didn't get anywhere.  Does anyone know who the other
physicist was and/or the source of the story?

It's fairly simple. Such people, esp on this list, who are Chomsky fans
I have also found to be highly anti-Israel, Pro-Arab, anti-capital,
anti-libertarian, pro-collectivist, anti-science/technology,
pro-luddite/green mysticism, anti-rationalist, pro-spiritualist.

I won't raise more hackles by applying a well known political label to
people who think this way, as I think it is rather plain-as-day, so
nothing further need be said.

Yep! Yes, as Bekestein noticed, the M-irr (the rest mass, minus
the gravitational potential energy, plus the kinetic energy
of the rest mass) is independent of the EM energy. So the
extraction process has to do with the total energy of the
EM field (including its gravitational binding energy),
that is to say with the term Q^2/2r, where Q is the charge,
and r is the radius of the external horizon of the EMBH.
If the total mass-energy M = (M-irr + Q^2/2r) > Q an EMBH
is formed.

> I thought it ended up with a boring Schwarzschild hole
> after the charges had been neutralized.

The pair creation process requires an electric field strengh
like (m^2 c^3) / (hbar e) where m and e are the mass and the
charge of an electron. But the key factor is that the number
of pairs (e+ e-) created is very high, something like
(Q x radius of the dyadosphere)/(e x Compton el. wavelenght).
This means that the density of pairs created, as a function
of the radial coordinate is so high (and the time so short) that
these pairs will leave the EMBH by creating an enormous pulse,
which expands relativistically out to infinity. Or, in a different
picture, the e+ e- plasma fluid expands, cools, and the pairs
recombine.

Is it possible to sketch a perfect EMBH engine based on
creation of pairs - expansion of plasma - compression -
annihilation? I do not think so because, imo, the EMBH must
lose some mass-energy, sooner or later.

Got the unpleasant feeling that all the above was 'murkily
written and murkily thought' :-)

The practice of forcing consumers to buy one product together
with another product is actually illegal in the EU and many
other countries.  The reason behind that is to prevent monopoly
situations that harm the public instead of benefitting them.

IMHO markets should be regulated so they benefit society as a
whole, not just the companies that are in power.

Mike, I believe in the U.S. the FDA has recently issued regulations
with respect to what can be called "organic".  Fortunately or
unfortunately, I think they have lumped a bunch of things together
to have this "label".

The points that Barbara, Lee and you make have caused me to reverse
somewhat my opposition to labeling (based on the fact that the
average consumer is pre-programmed to make snap judgements
with a poor information base).

I don't believe the FDA regulations even consider the question of
whether "organic" = "non-cloned" so you may be opening Pandora's Box.

If one could cite a long list of examples of "cloned" organisms
that we grow or consume on a daily basis then it might reduce
the anti-cloning perspective.  The only exception to this would
appear to be "cloning" via nuclear transfer but this may be a
technical detail that most people would not want to quibble over.

More importantly perhaps, from a transhumanist perspective is
whether we could advance this research agenda?  Many of the
people on the list are in educational environments.  How difficult
would it be to print up flyers and post them on local bulletin
boards?

Question: "What is the success rate cloning via nuclear transfer in plants?"
(Or to a lesser extent "what is the success rate of cloning via single
cells in plants?")

Its a fundamental scientific question.  One that to my knowledge
hasn't been addressed.  It has significant implications with
respect to the cloning question and aging in general (through
the study of what fraction of "adult" genomes are "perfect").

It costs very little to post these questions in an academic
setting -- a young student might just become interested
in the question and seek to answer them.

Robert

You forgot Florida, where they learnt to fly.

And Washington, whose burocrats gave the terrorists permission
to enter the US in order to learn to fly.

It's illegal here as well. I just said I don't believe it's wrong,
and I don't.  Tying arrangements are just good business; it's not
"force" if the consumer still has a choice of both or neither.
The fact that it doesn't give consumers a third choice that they
would probably like cannot be called "harm" by any rational
definition of the word.

In the case of Jean Baudrillard (pron: Boh-dree-are, and once incredibly
fashionable in chic salons), you're not missing much. Nor indeed with most
of these buggers. Here's a little aria from my book THEORY & ITS
DISCONTENTS, and apologies for any who've been this way before:

============

Walter Kaufmann neatly summarised Heidegger's lexical approach to the ground
(Grund) of Being: `He speaks of ergrunden (fathom) and Grundung (foundation)
and distinguishes between Ur-grund (primal ground), Ab-grund (abyss) and
Un-grund (bottomlessness?)... The piling up of words with the same root -
one of the most characteristic devices of Heidegger's style - induces a
spurious sense of illumination, an unfounded conviction that something has
been explained' (Kaufmann, 1960, pp. 345-6). Unsympathetic critics go
further. George Steiner (who is more generous, for reasons that fail to
persuade me) characterises their response to Heidegger's eccentric method:

	"[Even] a polemical discussion of Heidegger's method is merely futile. His
writings are a thicket of impenetrable verbiage; the questions he poses are
sham questions.... To try to analyse Heideggerian `ontology'... is to speak,
or to speak of, nonsense - non-sense, in the most drastic connotations of
the term.... [His influence] is nothing less than disastrous, both
philosophically and politically.... This is not, I repeat, a finding that
can be peremptorily dismissed or reduced to mere professional myopia. It is
a critique and counterstatement which should be kept steadily in view,
however problematic it makes the obvious dimension, the intense presence of
Heidegger's example and writings in current reference and sensibility."
(Steiner, 1992, pp. 4, 59)

	Contemporary theory, in many respects both a child of and a reaction
against Heidegger, carries over much of his method of linguistic
peregrination. To cite Steiner once more: `His punning - where "punning" is
too feeble a designation for an uncanny receptivity to the fields of
resonance, of consonance, of suppressed echo in phonetic and semantic
units - has bred, to the point of parody, the post-structuralism and
deconstructionism of today' (p. xiii). Let us muse for a moment on a long
paragraph of Jean Baudrillard. His essay America (1988) is described on the
blurb as the `most accessible and evocative book' by `France's leading
philosopher of postmodernism'. The textual surface, as usual, flares
appropriately like sun-blasted mica as he drives fast down the freeways of
southern American deserts `where humours and fluids become rarefied, where
the air is so pure that the influence of the stars descends direct from the
constellations' (p. 6). What follows is post-Heideggerian poetry, of a kind,
but what is it saying, if anything? If, indeed, anything definite or
assayable [...] can be found in its delirium:


	"Speed creates pure objects. It is itself a pure object, since it
multiplies surfaces and territorial reference-points, since it paralyses
time to annul space itself, since it moves more quickly that its own effect
and obliterates that effect by outstripping it. Speed is the triumph of
cause over effect, the triumph of duration over time as instantaneity, the
triumph of desire over the superficiality of the boundary and of pure
subjectality. Speed creates a time of closure which is never lethal; its
only rule is to leave some trace behind. Triumph of memory over forgetting,
an enriched, mnemonic intoxication. The profundity and irreversibility of an
attenuated object in the complex geometry of the desert. Driving like this
produces a kind of hypervisibility, opacity, or longitudinality in
signifiers, simply by permeating them. It is a sort of accelerated rebirth,
renewal by a compression of forms - the delectable form of their appearance
out of nowhere. Speed is the explosion of DNA. It is far from the mineral,
no reflected image, and it already evades catastrophe, any squandering of
time. Perhaps, though, its fascination is simply that of the plenum. There
is absolute seduction here, for seduction requires disclosure. Speed is
simply the rite that initiates us into saturation: an anticipatory desire
for forms to explode into motion, concealed beyond the very rarefaction of
their immobility. Akin to the nostalgia for geometry that haunts living
forms." (pp. 6-7)

	Now it is true that one intuits some remote glimmering of what Baudrillard
means in this deluge of words, a hazy grasp that the notion of `speed' has
become an agile signifier in his phenomenological circus. His enthusiastic
supporters, and there are many, would reject with anger and contempt any
request for clarity, for reductive intelligibility. What we have just read,
they declare, is `thinking the postmodern' in the mode of hyperreality, and
cannot be paraphrased or rendered into syllogisms with unambiguous
signifieds. To ask for lucidity is stupidly vulgar, not to say
embarrassingly uncool.
	One might wonder, though, if this plea is altogether convincing. Are we not
being called upon to take rather a lot on trust? Is this not just another
version of what Steiner dubbed, in the persona of a sceptic, Heidegger's
`mystical bullying' (Steiner, 1992, p. 12)? Suppose we try a simple
experiment and reverse the apparent polarity of some of these hectic
sentences. Would the new passage abruptly be less profound, less magically
poetic - even less self-evidently `true'? Certainly that would be the case
if we altered, say, `e equals m c squared' into `e equals m root c', or
`Sydney is the capital of Latvia' into its denial:


	"Speed creates pure objects. It is itself a pure object, since it cancels
out the ground and territorial reference-points, since it runs ahead of time
to annul time itself, since it moves more quickly that its own cause and
obliterates that cause by outstripping it. Speed is the triumph of effect
over cause, the triumph of instantaneity over time as depth, the triumph of
the surface and pure objectality over the profundity of desire. Speed
creates a space of initiation, which may be lethal; its only rule is to
leave no trace behind. Triumph of forgetting over memory, an uncultivated,
amnesic intoxication. The superficiality and reversibility of a pure object
in the pure geometry of the desert. Driving like this produces a kind of
invisibility, transparency, or transversality in things, simply by emptying
them out. It is a sort of slow-motion suicide, death by an extenuation of
forms - the delectable form of their disappearance. Speed is not a vegetal
thing. It is nearer to the mineral, to refraction through a crystal, and it
is already the site of a catastrophe, of a squandering of time. Perhaps,
though, its fascination is simply that of the void. There is no seduction
here, for seduction requires a secret. Speed is simply the rite that
initiates us into emptiness: a nostalgic desire for forms to revert to
immobility, concealed beneath the very intensification of their mobility.
Akin to the nostalgia for living forms that haunts geometry."

	Is this not, after all, as agreeable as the original? A devotee of
dialectical thought might be happy to concur that it must be, since all
propositions incorporate their negations. For the rest of us, I suspect my
demonstration deals Baudrillard's method a blow, perhaps a lethal one. For
if a proposition `A' strikes us as profound, beautiful and compelling, and a
moment later `not-A' has the same impact, it is worth checking to see if we
are perhaps intoxicated rather than persuaded.
	Some readers will dispute this account, claiming that Baudrillard's rich
paradoxes and non-sequiturs are merely parodied and banalised in my second
version. It is precisely because that second version fails to create
conviction in us that the buzzy insight of Baudrillard's own words is
confirmed. Perhaps so. All I can do, as a situated commentator within a set
of discursive values defended in this book, is to express my doubt that
either version makes much sense (aside from the cliches that neither
paragraph manages to avoid). By the way, the second version is actually
Baudrillard's original. I hope you found my own contrary version no less
profound, mysterious and hypertrue. But perhaps I have just lied to you, and
the first version is, after all, the correct translation from Baudrillard's
French. Can you tell, by re-reading the fragments, which of my claims is
more likely to be true? If you cannot, where does this leave us? (And what
have I proved if this is the case?)

But how much information is provided by the frame and how much by the 
discourse? Even the clearest, most self-evident statement needs some 
context framing (the ability to understand the language at least). And 
much of what we say requires a lot of frame which also implies that it 
carries with it built-in or assumed resonances that make discourses say 
more than just the intended message. But some interpretative frames seem 
to be so massive and filled with meaning themselves that they can take 
messages with nearly no information of their own and produce enormously 
more complex interpretations. Beside the problem of knowing which frame 
is expected, there is also the problem of deciding on how 
powerful/complex the frame should be to achieve some aim with the 
understanding. Is the goal just to get what the other person was saying, 
or understand the message/messenger more deeply, or to produce an 
interesting and relevant idea that may have little to do with the 
message?

Ribosomes have it easy.

I knew you would be lured out by a bit of Derrida :-) I was just hunting 
randomly for something apparently obscure, and found that quote in Sokal 
- I was actually hunting for Heidegger. BTW, politedly is a nice 
neologism. Pointedly but politely :-)

Thanks! Now the piece makes a lot more sense. I got confused both by
Derrida - who sounds like he is speaking about c - and Sokal, who
claimed it is about G_ij=k T_ij. Of course, I still think the interval
might be considered a centre, but a bit more like the cartesian cogito:
a single certainty, from which one might extend outwards an onion of
structure.

I seem to have acquired the right reading frame without undergoing too 
much humanistic schooling, so it is clearly learnable with only some 
effort. But it is likely on the same order of effort as learning the 
behavior of black holes.

I often find your explanations of postmodern concepts clear and helpful. 
Even when explanations of explanations grow exponentially longer, before 
fatigue sets in there is usually a point where the inherent structure in 
the exposition sets in and one can start to deduce and constrain 
meaning. From this point one can work backwards and learn what the 
original stuff was, as well as some of the surrounding context. It is 
not unlike learning a language.

Our treehouse is much better. And we have a soup-can telephone and an 
animatronic goat head.

I doubt most people have. But they aren't part of or originators of the
US-EU chasm, rather the humanities/sciences chasm (hardly the
originators, but to some extent part of the buttresses on one side
keeping it open). Their effect on the popular mindset is very subtle - 
it is there, it seems to be extensive but it is hard to point at any 
special thing and say "this is Deluzian".

My thought exactly. I can report that Stockholm is grey and frosty too. 
But we think we saw the sun today at 12.34, although a few of the
witnesses thought it was more likely a UFO.

Exactly. I think Damien has a good point about interpretative frames. 
Think of them as the ribosomes to transcribe the RNA of text into the a
mental protein. Now imagine that there are not just variants of the
genetic code but variant ribosomes that do different things - some might 
include extra amino acids according to some rule, others might even bind 
the emerging protein to other proteins. The poststructuralist ribosome 
is a very baroque and flashy entity, that probably isn't even very 
faithful to the RNA but is very good at producing interesting proteins 
with complex effects.

(OK, it is late and I have ribosomes on my brain)

Part of poststructuralist jargon is just a certain style of writing. 
Part of it is the usual "let's separate the ingroup who gets it from the
outgroup who wont" social exclusion trick. Part of it is real speciality
terms. Part of is poetic allusions and associations making the words
more alive and fun. When you speak cellbiologese or I speak neuronese we
do the same, although the proportions between the uses may be slightly
different.

BTW, this is a nice neologism, which seems to combine `Deleuze' and
`delusional'. :)

Mike:

Without debating in detail the merits of Chomsky's positions, couldn't we at least agree that, as rationalists, we should all be "anti-Israel?" Israel is a state whose premise is the inherent superiority of one religious group over others, certainly in terms of their rights within an area to which they claim ownership based upon a largely mythical world view. How could a humanist, secularist or rationalist ever be a supporter of Israel as it is presently constituted?

You also seem to use the term "collectivist' rather haphazardly. If one were truly "pro-collectivist," that would incline one toward supporting Israel, not the reverse, Israel being one of the more socialized nations, at least if you consider only Israeli citizens.

As far as being pro-Arab, I'd hope most people would consider themselves pro-human, which would certainly imply pro-Arab. But if by pro-Arab you mean tending toward a sympathy for Palestinians suffering and supporting measures to relieve that suffering and injustice, such sentiments would be implied by a rejection of irrational and fundamentally anti-humanistic Zionism. 

I haven't noticed anybody on this list who impressed me as being "anti-science/technology." Maybe I haven't been paying enough attention.

It's fairly simple. Such people, esp on this list, who are Chomsky fans I have also found to be highly anti-Israel, Pro-Arab, anti-capital, anti-libertarian, pro-collectivist, anti-science/technology, pro-luddite/green mysticism, anti-rationalist, pro-spiritualist.

I won't raise more hackles by applying a well known political label to people who think this way, as I think it is rather plain-as-day, so
nothing further need be said.

...and it's a shame he isn't the most significant figure in all
this postmodernist fluff, or we'd have the nice "Antedeleuzian" to

Well, yes, there are: Massachusetts, California, among others. I assume
you think that referencing Florida and DC would chill me somewhat. It
doesn't. Take Florida, whose residents can't seem to be able to vote or
count and who are the biggest economic drain on the rest of the
country. Then you've got DC, which didn't actually give the terrorists
permission to enter the country until months AFTER 9/11.

The problem, though, is that neither Florida nor DC would have been at
fault if european countries like Germany had not presented the
terrorists as bona-fide refugees and decent folk.

Cool!  Speaking of Sky and Telescope, the January 03 issue
is now on the newstands, as of yesterday.  The January
issue has the annual sky almanac, which is that hour-
glass shaped chart that shows when all the interesting
things are to see in the coming year.  One can learn a
great deal byjust studying that chart.  Its better than a
Playboy centerfold, so very pleasant to gaze upon it is.
I bought four copies, three as gifts for the others in the
astronomy mafia at work.

What is wrong with trying at least a *little* to be precise
in the use of words?  You do not think Noam Chomsky "rational"?
You do not think him "highly intelligent"?

It seems pretty obvious that when someone is sufficiently wrong
then it follows to a number of people on this list that they are
irrational and unintelligent.  WERE OUR PROBLEMS ONLY THAT SIMPLE!

Mike replies:

Yes, you have spotted the relevant correlations!  You have
described exactly the determinants or at least the (almost
always) inescapable signatures of belief, if there be 
deeper causes.  And yes, you have also accurately answered
Ron's question:  "why is Chomsky considered by many to be
well-informed".  In two words, ideological allegiance.

Let me construct the inverse, and show how it's exactly right
too (except for Ron's remarks about rationality and intelligence):

Anti-Ron writes

Anti-Mike answers

     > I have also found to be highly pro-Israel, Anti-Arab, pro-capital,
     > pro-libertarian, anti-collectivist, pro-science/technology,

(I confess my inversion fails here on "pro-libertarian",
"pro-science", and "anti-spiritualist".  But you get the
point---if not Limbaugh, well, then, me.)

It is NOT a question of rationality or intelligence.

My office-mate (for three more weeks), Valeri Dikarev, is one 
of the authors of the Saturn (front page) article in that 
particular issue. He will also be coauthor of some explanations
of orbits of Cruithne and other asteroids in a Sky and
Telescope issue sometime middle next year.
  
 (The BBC Science Web site writer David Whitehouse 
 still has not corrected the 'second moon of Earth' gaff, 
 even though our group and other astronomers wrote 
 messages to the errors page of that BBC web site and 
 asked them to correct that error. The S&T article 
 Valeri will cowrite will hopefully address these kinds 
 of orbit errors and misonceptions)

Not sure if someone has already answered on this, but I think the other 
physicist was Murray Gell-Mann. If so, the source would be one of the 
first Feynman popular books to come out: "What do you care what other 
people think", etc.

I still don't believe in the highly touted "scientific
method", and I also think that "character flaw" is putting
it a bit too harshly.  I will agree that those who can change
their minds about long-held beliefs are to be praised for
having the capability to do so.

All you can claim is that you will try.  Your brain
is composed of aging neurons, and your ability to
overcome ever more decades of belief will probably
continue to weaken.  It's obviously an admirable goal,
however.

> If Noam Chomsky "cannot" change his mind, it's because he

You were right to put quotes around "cannot".  What do
we mean by that exactly?  I'll agree with all your
extremely negative characterizations provided that the
subject in question has ADMITTED TO HIMSELF that he is
wrong, but for political or egotistical motives refuses
to publicly say so.  Alger Hiss knew all along that
he had been a Soviet spy, and simply lied about it for
political reasons.  Oliver North lied to congress.  Hiss
is dead, but I hope that North can admit that without
going to jail.

But there is another, and much more important sense in
which one "cannot" change one's mind.  It occurs when
one's facile intelligence, strongly influenced by emotion,
busily recasts and re-interprets what one has said and
believed in the past so that it can still be defended.
This is the speaking mode of an apologist.

I will assume that Chomsky's inability to recant about
the Nazi holocaust or about Pot Pol is of the second kind.

Amara do offer my complements to Dr. Dikarev.  That
Saturn article was very good.  Sky and Telescope
has improved greatly in the past several years.  I
once preferred Astronomy, but lately I think S+T has
become the better journal.  spike

Do you have any evidence that Derrida was trying to make
any kind of scientific statement like this?  Does it really
seem plausible that he had the spacetime interval in mind?
I ask, because in the introduction to the paperback version
of "Fashionable Nonsense" Sokal and Bricmont say

   "Although the quotation from Derrida contained in Sokal's
   parody is rather amusing, it is a one-shot abuse; since there
   is no systematic misuse of (or indeed attention to) science
   Derrida's work, there is no chapter on Derrida in this book."

It is a fact (attested to by Paul Johnson, for one) that
a number of passages make much more sense in French than
they do in English---he says something about how some
pieces just fall apart when an attempt is made to
translate them into hard, concrete Anglo-Saxon terms.
That might have something to do with it.

Meanwhile---however playful it is---and whatever it is 
attempting to communicate to a postmodern audience, it
still seems quite doubtful that it should be defended
on scientific grounds.

Like every country Israel has done some very bad things and I think the

anti Israel stance in relation to the Arab Jewish conflict then no, I don't
agree we should be anti Israeli. I might add that when Chomsky criticizes

I'm wondering, Lee, why you seem to think that the scientific method is

Here's someone who agrees with you:

=====

http://www.soz.uni-hannover.de/isoz/sokal/NYTREV8.HTM

from MICHAEL HOLQUIST
Sokal's Hoax: An Exchange
[..]
When, in reading Sokal's Social Text article, I first encountered this
paragraph, I was bothered not so much by the obscurity of Derrida's terms
"center" and "game." I was willing to suppose that these were terms of art,
defined elsewhere by Derrida. What bothered me was his phrase "the
Einsteinian constant," which I had never met in my work as a physicist.
True, there is something called Newton's constant which appears in
Einstein's theory of gravitation, and I would not object if Derrida wanted
to call it "the Einsteinian constant," but this constant is just a number
(0.00000006673 in conventional units), and I did not see how it could be the
"center" of anything, much less the concept of a game.

So I turned for enlightenment to the talk by Derrida from which Sokal took
this paragraph. In it, Derrida explains the word "center" as follows:
"Nevertheless,... structure--or rather, the structurality of
structure--although it has always been involved,
has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a
center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin."6 This was
not much help.

Lest the reader think that I am quoting out of context, or perhaps just
being obtuse, I will point out that, in the discussion following Derrida's
lecture, the first question was by Jean Hyppolite, professor at the College
de France, who, after having sat through Derrida's talk, had to ask Derrida
to explain what he meant by a "center." The paragraph quoted by Sokal was
Derrida's answer. It was Hyppolite who introduced "the Einsteinian constant"
into the discussion, but while poor Hyppolite was willing to admit that he
did not understand what Derrida meant by a center, Derrida just started
talking about the Einsteinian constant, without letting on that (as seems
evident) he had no idea of what Hyppolite was talking about. It seems to me
that Derrida in context is even worse than Derrida out of context.

6 Jacques Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human
Sciences" in The Structuralist Controversy, edited by R. Macksey and E.
Donato (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1972), p. 247.

========

Now of course it would be polite to read Derrida's paper first (which is
often seen as marking the end of structuralism, the opening sally of
poststruck thinking), and see if one could decide what Jean Hyppolite meant
in turn. Bear in mind that Hyppolite was not only an expert in Hegel's
phenomenology, but was trained as well in the history and logic of the
sciences.

 [Lee harrumphs at this latter phrase]

As against my previous citation by someone who didn't bother trying to see
what Derrida might actualy have meant, here's something that supports my own
reading (I had not read Dr Plotnitsky 's paper until now, FWIW):

http://www.duke.edu/web/FacultyForum/vol8/ffnov.htm

========

Another response to Lawrence Evans
--by Arkady Plotnitsky

Literature Program and the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Science
and Cultural Theory

"The Einsteinian constant is not a constant, not a center. It is the very
concept of variability--it is, finally, the concept of the game. In other
words, it is not the concept of something--of a center starting from which
an observer could master the field--but the very concept of the game [jeu]
which, after all, I was trying to elaborate [in the lecture]."

Along with other quotations accompanying Professor Lawrence Evans's
contribution ("Should We Care about Science `Studies'?"), The Faculty Forum
(Vol.8, No.1, October 1996) cites Steven Weinberg's comment on this remark
by Jacques Derrida. The remark itself was made famous by its incessant
recycling in recent discussions around the so-called "Science Wars" in the
wake of Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt's Higher Superstition, and then
"Sokal's hoax," both of which comment on it, as does Professor Evans.(1) I
complete Derrida's sentence in accord with the original, since the term
"game" or "play" (a better translation here of the French "jeu," which
carries both meanings) has a very specific meaning in Derrida's statement.
The concept of play is central in Derrida's essay "Structure, Sign, and Play
in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," an oral presentation of which at a
conference at Johns Hopkins in 1966 occasioned the discussion in which this
remark was made, as part of Derrida's reply to a question from the French
philosopher, Jean Hyppolite, who was also present.(2) Understanding how
Derrida uses this term in his essay and understanding what Hyppolite means
by "the Einsteinian constant" are essential for a reading of Derrida's
statement, especially if one wants to make a responsible claim concerning
it--say, considered as a statement on the philosophical implications of
Einstein's relativity.(3) If Derrida's statement is given without any
further explanation, it would be difficult to blame Professor Weinberg for
saying "I have no idea what this is intended to mean" (New York Review of
Books, August 8, 1996, p. 11), or Professor Evans for smiling at Derrida's
"absurd attempt to say something profound about Einstein's relativity"
(Forum, p. 1). A rather different picture emerges, however, once one
considers carefully Derrida's and Hyppolite's statements themselves and
their context. According to Hyppolite, then:

With Einstein, for example, we see the end of a kind of privilege of empiric
evidence. And in that connection we see a constant appears, a constant that
is a combination of space-time, which does not belong to any of the
experimenters who live the experience, but which, in a way, dominates the
whole construct; and this notion of the constantis this the center [i.e.
would it be, according to Derrida's argument]? (Languages of Criticism, p.
266, emphasis added).

Hyppolite's first sentence is somewhat obscure, which is not surprising
given the extemporaneous nature of his comments (on which point I shall
comment below). It can, however, be shown to be compatible with certain
aspects of special relativity, in particular with the idea that the
distinction between space and time depends on the observer. More important
here is the question of "the Einsteinian constant." The phrase may not
meanand does not seem to mean--a numerical constant, as virtually all the
physicists who commented on it in print appear to assume. Instead it appears
to mean the Einsteinian (or Einsteinian-Minkowskian) concept of space-time
itself, since Hyppolite speaks of "a constant which is a combination of
space-time" (emphasis added). Given the text, such an interpretation is more
plausible than seeing this phrase as referring to a numerical constant. This
alternative interpretation is not definitive, and perhaps no definitive
interpretation is possible here, in view of the status of the text as the
transcription of extemporaneous remarks given orally. Similar problems may
also arise in regard to Derrida's statement.(4) That said, however, it is
more productive to take these complexities into account, to sort them out to
the degree possible, and to give these statements the most sensible, rather
than the most senseless, interpretation.

In view of those aspects of Hyppolite's and Derrida's meanings that can be
established more definitively, and given the text of Derrida's essay itself,
the interpretation suggested here is both possible and plausible. The moment
one accepts this possibility and reads the Einsteinian constant as meaning
the Einsteinian concept of space-time, Derrida's statement begins to sound
quite a bit less strange. It acquires an even greater congruence with
relativity theory once one understands the term "play/game" as connoting, in
this context, the impossibility, within Einstein's framework of space-time,
of a unique or uniquely privileged frame of reference--a "center starting
from which an observer could master the field" (i.e. the whole of
space-time). Even if my reading of Hyppolite's term "the Einsteinian
constant" is tentative, the meaning I suggest for Derrida's "play" or "game"
[jeu] is easily supportable on the basis of his essay and related works. So
is the understanding of this concept as congruent with (I do not say
equivalent to) philosophical ideas of relativity.

With these considerations in mind, one might see Derrida's statement as
suggesting that, in contrast to classical physics, the space-time of special
(and even more so of general) relativity disallows either a (Newtonian)
universal background or a uniquely privileged frame of reference for
physical events (which become contingent upon the frame of reference from
which they are seen). In short, one might see Derrida's statement as
alluding to standard features and questions at issue in Einstein's
relativity--admittedly, in a idiom that is nonstandard, especially for
physicists. At the very least, both Derrida's and Hyppolite's remarks can be
read as consistent or, again, congruent with the philosophical ideas and
implications of relativity as they have been elaborated in traditional
scientific and philosophical literature on the subject. What Hyppolite
suggests here is that (part of) the conceptual content of Einstein's
relativity may serve as a kind of model for Derrida's concept of decentered
play and related ideas.

Of course, there has been much debate concerning the philosophical
interpretation and implications of relativity, and one could certainly argue
about how productive a Derridean framework could be in approaching
relativity. Such an argument would, however, be quite different from reading
Derrida's statement in a deliberately distorted manner, as in Sokal's hoax;
or from offering "criticism" of it that is clearly uninformed, as in Gross
and Levitt's book; or from other dismissive non-treatments of it on both
sides of the recent "science wars." Such an argument would also be different
from what one finds in Sokal's "serious" article in Lingua Franca
(disclosing his hoax): manifest philosophical naivete and ignorance of
philosophical literature, including literature on relativity and quantum
physics.(5) The question here is not whether Derrida's philosophical ideas
about relativity or his work in general should be criticized. The question
is at what level of intellectual engagement, knowledge, and scholarship such
criticism of Derrida (or of Hyppolite and others cited in those texts)
should take place.

Derrida's statement on relativity has been commented upon without any
consideration of its textual and circumstantial context, and without even
minimal attention to the meaning of its terms--even, sadly, by scholars and
scientists of extraordinary achievement, such as Steven Weinberg. Obviously,
most scientists are not familiar with the ideas and contexts that would
enable them to offer the kind of reading of Derrida's statement that is
suggested here. One might, however, regret a certain lack of intellectual
curiosity on their part and their evident unwillingness to consult scholars
familiar with Derrida's thought, or indeed--why not?--Derrida himself. At
issue here is not only the citation of Hyppolite's and Derrida's remarks out
of context but the ignoring of even the minimal relevant norms of
intellectual and, especially, scholarly exchange.

Derrida's quoted statement appears in the transcript of an improvised
response to Hyppolite's question following an oral presentation of his
essay. The essay does not mention relativity and the statement itself makes
no substantive scientific claims. Relativity, and specifically the idea of
the Einsteinian constant, are brought in by Hyppolite, not Derrida, who
responds to Hyppolite extemporaneously, in the context of his just-delivered
paper. It is curious that out of thousands of pages of Derrida's published
works, a single extemporaneous remark on modern physics is made to stand for
nearly all of deconstructive or even postmodernist (not a term easily
applicable to Derrida) treatments of science. Given the circumstances
described here, a responsible scholar, journalist, or other commentator
would be hesitant to judge or present Derrida's statement as representative
of his mode of writing or arguing, or of his thought on relativity,
mathematics, or science, or indeed of anything else. There is nothing
exceptional in the circumstances themselves. Such complexities of
improvisation, transcription, translation, and interpretation often arise at
conferences, and the circumstances that lead to them remain significant when
such exchanges are subsequently reproduced in conference volumes, as is the
case here and as is made clear by the editors of the volume containing the
Hyppolite-Derrida exchange (Languages of Criticism, xi-xiii).

Scholars in the humanities should, of course, exercise due caution as to the
claims they make about science. Correspondingly, scientists and other
non-humanist scholars should exercise due care and similar caution in their
characterization of the humanities, especially when they are dealing with
innovative and complex work, such as that of Derrida, and all the more so if
they want to be critical about it. In the case under discussion, however, no
criticism in any real sense--not even a dismissal that can be taken
seriously--has been offered, at least not yet. A serious engagement with
Derrida's thought on the part of scientists is possible, however, and we
might yet see it. Then, perhaps, we will also have a better understanding of
why "the Einsteinian constant is not a constant, is not a center," why "it
is the very concept of variability," and why "it is, finally, the concept of
the game"or, if that is the case, why it is none of the above.

That would indeed be shocking, but is it true? Consider the following rather
interesting sentences from

http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/canadian/canadian-jewish-congress/hdt-06.htm
l

< It should therefore not surprise us that Holocaust denial is also
anti-Zionist. >

followed shortly by

< Chomsky has described the Holocaust as "the most fantastic outburst of
collective insanity in human history". Yet this did not lead him to prevent
a piece he had allegedly written purely to uphold the right of free speech
from being used as an introduction to one of Faurisson's books. It also did
not stop him from giving Guillaume publication rights in France to one of
his important books. As Professor Werner Cohn has pointed out in his
pamphlet "The Hidden Alliances of Noam Chomsky", Guillaume's publishing
house is a very obscure one and, if it has any credibility at all, it has it
in good measure as a result of the connection with Chomsky. >

This is indeed very peculiar behavior from a liberal standpoint, but it
might make a bit more sense from a libertarian or anarchist one. Certainly
it is plain that one can't simultaneously `deny the Holocaust' while
describing it as `the most fantastic outburst of collective insanity in
human history'. So John Clark has not *really* said it all; more remains to
be said. (And of course it has been said, but it's late...)

Hi Olga!

First, I dispute that there really is anything called
"the scientific method", or, if there is, that it is
anything practiced regularly by human beings.

>From http://phyun5.ucr.edu/wudka/Physics7/Notes_www/node6.html#SECTION02121000000000000000

1. Observe some aspect of the universe. 
2. Invent a tentative description, called a hypothesis,
   that is consistent with what you have observed. 
3. Use the hypothesis to make predictions. 
4. Test those predictions by experiments or further observations
   and modify the hypothesis in the light of your results. 
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are no discrepancies between
   theory and experiment and/or observation. 

Ahem, well, I don't believe that the history of science
(or of anything else, for that matter) supports this 
idea of how science is done.

Nobody does that!  Scientists are like bookkeepers, detectives,
brick-layers, auto mechanics, and good historians.  They run
across things, either out of interest or necessity, and either
want to explain them or put them to use some way.

Then they do accomplish something like (2) above, but that
description is way too high falutin'  (now that Damien is
back he can give me the proper comeuppance for appealing
to "plain folks" ;-)

Nobody does that.  They get some kind of hunch, usually non-verbal,
about what is happening, and never formalize it into an hypothesis.
It's only after years that someone has failed to prove something
they badly wanted to, e.g., Cantor's continuum, that it gets called
an "hypothesis" out of sheer frustration.

As for (3), sometimes people verbally articulate what they
expect to happen, and sometimes they don't.  If they can't
expect anything, then their brain is broken.

As for (4), yes, the brick-layer will try out a new way of
mixing mortar than a co-worker suggests, a housewife will
fall for a new product advertised on TV that she thinks might
be the ticket to solving some problem she has, and the prize-
fighter will try out a new punch that she's seen in a Kung
Fu movie.

BIG DEAL.  Apes try out new things, and even kittens do.

So in conclusion, the scientific method is a humbug.

To replace it?  We just keep trucking, trying to concentrate,
trying to think, trying to keep an open mind, trying to admit
(especially to ourselves) when we have been wrong, and trying
to keep on living.  Even if it means getting frozen.

But what the hell--let's throw in an url, and a fragment. Christopher
Hitchens reviewed all this back in 1985. Search at

http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/index.cfm

for `Holocaust' and you'll find the essay.

======

In the early stages of this process, Chomsky received a request, from his
friend Serge Thion, that he add his name to a petition upholding Faurisson's
right to free expression. This, on standard First Amendment grounds and in
company with many others, he did. The resulting uproar, in which he was
accused of defending Faurisson's theses, led to another request from Thion.
Would Chomsky write a statement asserting the right to free speech even in
the case of the most loathsome extremist? To this he also assented, pointing
out that it was precisely such cases that tested the adherence of a society
to such principles and adding in a covering letter that Thion could make
what use of it he wished. At this stage, only the conservative Alfred
Grosser among French intellectuals had been prepared to say that Faurisson's
suspension by the University of Lyons set a bad example of academic courage
and independence. Chomsky's pedantic recitation of Voltairean principles
would probably have aroused no comment at all had Thion not taker rather
promiscuous advantage of the permission to use it as he wished. Without
notification to Chomsky, he added the little essay as an avis to Faurisson's
pretrial Memiore en defense.

[...]

I wouldn't accuse any of the critics listed here of deliberate
falsification. But it is nevertheless untrue to describe Chomsky's purloined
avis as a preface, as Fresco does on almost a dozen occasions and as Mayer
does twice [...]

Ah ha!  I *thought* I remembered that!  Here Sokal's
self-admitted "one-shot abuse" is about something that
Derrida said off the cuff in response to a question.
There is a limit to how much criticism he should get
for that.  Why, just the other day, the soon to be
Majority leader of the American Senate said at a
birthday party [never mind]

Oh no.  I had even forgotten that part!  The phrase wasn't
even Derrida's.

Ah, sad.  We should all try to rise to the standard of thought
referred to earlier this evening by Lee Daniel Crocker, and
admit our mistakes (and our ignorance) freely.  Poor guy.  He
couldn't bring himself to say, "what is the Einsteinian constant"
because he feared that he might look like an ass to people more
scientifically knowledgeable than he.

> It seems to me that Derrida in context is even worse than

A different kind of "sin" altogether, if you ask me.  Before
it was an alleged misuse of science, and now it is just CYA.

Hmm.  No, doesn't push my buttons, for some reason, even
though I just finished a rant against "the scientific
method".  The "history and logic of the sciences" strikes
me as just a harmless allusion to ready familiarity with
a lot of scientific concepts and arguments.

But "Hyppolite" was trained in the history and logic of
science?  How strange that he should use a phrase like
"the Einsteinian constant"; maybe it made more sense in
French.

[www.futureport.dk/news] Summary - 2002-11-12 (8 articles)


Not much interresting today, but come rain, come snow, the news must go out.

regards Max M Rasmussen, Denmark



NASA creating synthetic planets
===============================
[Space] Found by: maxm
http://www.msnbc.com/news/845677.asp?0si=-

Somewhere between reality and the unknown, science fiction has always 
flourished. The best sci-fi authors rigidly adhere to one principle: 
Make it as real as possible, given whats known. Now, as if lifting a 
chapter from an Isaac Asimov novel, NASA plans to create hundreds of 
synthetic planets that might represent real worlds orbiting faraway stars.



Open Source and Its Enemies
===========================
[Politics] Found by: maxm
http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&CID=1051-121002D

It should surprise nobody to learn that Bill Gates is not a fan of Linux 
or open source software [OSS], for roughly the same reason that light 
bulb manufacturers might resent sunny days. What ought to be surprising 
is that many libertarian writers have recently launched a series of 
vehement attacks against OSS, and especially against proposals to 
preference open software in government procurement.



Plant-derived drugs hit crossroads
==================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.msnbc.com/news/843716.asp

In Kentucky, tobacco plants are turning into cancer-fighting drug 
factories. In Virginia, corn is being harvested to treat cystic 
fibrosis, and in Nebraska, researchers are hoping that fertile farm 
fields will yield part of a cure for AIDS. From fields of barley in 
Washington state to Hawaiian sugar cane groves, scientists are 
cultivating agricultural advances that have nothing to do with food and 
everything to do with finding cheaper and faster ways to treat a range 
of human ailments.



Be Afraid - Michael Crichton is very, very afraid of technological 
progressagain.
==================================================================================
[Sceptiscism] Found by: maxm
http://www.reason.com/rb/rb121102.shtml

Over the weekend, I read Prey, Michael Crichton's latest 
screenplaysorry, novel.

The techno-thriller effectively fictionalizes Bill Joy's notorious Wired 
article, "Why the Future Doesn't Need Us." Joy, a chief scientist for 
Sun Microsystems, warned, "Our most powerful 21st-century 
technologiesrobotics, genetic engineering, and nanotechare threatening 
to make humans an endangered species." Crichton doesn't leave the 
didacticism to the novel itself; he provides a self-important 
introductory essay on the dangers of new technologies that makes it 
clear he wholeheartedly agrees with Joy.



Energy Needs May Limit Size, Ability Of Quantum Computers
=========================================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.spacedaily.com/news/chip-tech-02l.html

The energy required to create an accurate quantum computer may limit the 
ability of scientists to make these novel devices small, fast, cheap and 
efficient, says a University of Arkansas researcher.



Patent policy flaws complicate commercialization of federally funded 
university discoveries
===========================================================================================
[Politics] Found by: maxm
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-12/du-ppf120602.php

The process of commercializing university research discoveries is beset 
with complex problems: excessive secrecy, inadequate government policy 
and inappropriate patent law that affect academe, government funding 
agencies and industry, according to a new study published in the 
December 2002 issue of The Milbank Quarterly.



For Improving Health, Most Americans Approve of Reproductive Genetic 
Technologies
=================================================================================
[Health] Found by: maxm
http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2002-12-10-1

A survey of American attitudes on reproductive cloning, genetic testing 
and genetic modification shows that despite divisions between men and 
women and the religious and secular, most people support using genetic 
technologies to improve health.



Human or Computer? Take This Test
=================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/10/science/physical/10COMP.html

As chief scientist of the Internet portal Yahoo, Dr. Udi Manber had a 
profound problem: how to differentiate human intelligence from that of a 
machine.

If Corbin doesn't defend his statement, I will: the scientific method is a 
formal and social approximation to rationality, knowably inferior to 
rationality in specific ways.  Science is probably the best approximation 
to rationality that can be incarnated *as a social process*, but it's 
still not rationality.  There are many rationally knowable truths which 
are not scientifically knowable because of restraints on science which are 
necessary to make science work as a social process; analogous to the way a 
police officer may know perfectly well that so-and-so is a Mafia head, but 
be unable to produce evidence which meets the deliberately higher 
standards imposed by the judicial process.  Science only works because the 
real humans underlying the social process are free to use full-strength 
rationality in inventing theories to test.

What I object to is not the existence of science, Belldandy forbid, but 
rather the way in which science is sometimes mistaken for the substance of 
rationality.  Reality has no a priori bias to produce truths which can be 
proven by the standards of science at any given point in history; it is 
even possible that there are certain kinds of truths which can be 
correctly deduced from confirmed theories, but which are not testable even 
in theory - i.e., observable aspects of our universe's very early history 
lead us to deduce the existence of causally separated regions of the 
universe.  If so, the correct statement would be that these truths are 
rationally known, but not scientifically known - they would not meet the 
deliberately tougher requirements of proof that define the social process 
of science.  Some people would say that such untestable extrapolations are 
irrational, untrue, or even nonsensical; and *that's* what I object to.

David Horowitz is one of the most vocal Chomsky critics Ive read, here is an
article of his detailing much of what some people would consider 'nonsense'
by Chomsky.

     -----------------------

The Sick Mind of Noam Chomsky

http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=1020

By David Horowitz
FrontPageMagazine.com | September 26, 2001

Excerpts - 

According to Chomsky, in the first battle of the postwar struggle with the
Soviet Empire, "the United States was picking up where the Nazis had left
off." 

According to Chomsky, during the Cold War, American operations behind the
Iron Curtain included "a 'secret army' under US-Nazi auspices that sought to
provide agents and military supplies to armies that had been established by
Hitler and which were still operating inside the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe through the early 1950s." 

According to Chomsky, in Latin America during the Cold War, U.S. support for
legitimate governments against Communist subversion led to US complicity
under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, in "the methods of Heinrich
Himmler's extermination squads." 

According to Chomsky, there is "a close correlation worldwide between
torture and U.S. aid." 

According to Chomsky, America "invaded" Vietnam to slaughter its people, and
even after America left in 1975, under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, "the
major policy goal of the US has been to maximize repression and suffering in
the countries that were devastated by our violence. The degree of the
cruelty is quite astonishing." (6) 

According to Chomsky, "the pretext for Washington's terrorist wars [i.e., in
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, Guatemala, Iraq, etc.] was self-defense, the
standard official justification for just about any monstrous act, even the
Nazi Holocaust." (7) 

In sum, according to Chomsky, "legally speaking, there's a very solid case
for impeaching every American president since the Second World War. They've
all been either outright war criminals or involved in serious war
crimes."(8)

Thanks Mike. I'll revise my internal description of extropians as a

She seems to be saying that to avoid being bogged down with details, it 
has been common to select a point, somehow defined (I believe center of 
mass is common), and use that as a stand-in for the object, thereby 
avoiding dealing with the structure of the entities involved.

No.  It was on selecting Limbaugh as an opposite that the failure

There certainly isn't a "the scientific method", there are, instead, 
several, each adapted to particular fields of study.  They do, however, 
have certain features in common (necessary, but not sufficient).  And no 
individual human practices it.  It is rather a communal process, 
depending on social stuructures and feedback systems.

Step 4 is limited to the experimental sciences.  The "further 
observations" is merely a loop back to step 1, without a loop exit 
termination condition.  Step 4 is more properly "Evaluate your results 
until you are satisfied."
Step 4.5:  Publish your results.  This is a crucial step, as without it 
social critiques are not possible.  Here "publish" has a specific 
meaning, i.e., write about you observations/theories in sufficient 
detail that others CAN (at least in principle) evaluate them and 
reproduce them.  (If it isn't reproducible, it isn't science.  It may be 
a fact, but it isn't science.)

Step 5 never reaches completion.  It you test the voltage of a battery. 
the voltage changes.  etc.  And one must expect unpredicted errors.  
What one can do is refine things so that the magnitude of the errors 
decreases, or is at least itself predictable.

And the engineering arts also develop in a cumulative process.  But 
bricklaying is constrained to only consider bricklaying.  Thus 
engineering is a creative art, but bricklaying is a craft.  (Now a 
bricklayer could also be an architect, but that's a separate matter.)

Umnh... a hypothesis is a sort of a first stab at a theory.  You can 
have a hypothesis before you even go looking for evidence.  If you want 
to translate it into common english, the best word would probably be guess.

Nope.  Hypothesis is the very first thing it gets called.  You probably

Even were I to grant your statements along the way... the proof of the 
pudding is in the eating.  As a result of a **blend** of science and 
engineering we now have cars (thermodynamics), tv sets (quantum theory), 
etc.  Mind you, plain engineering gave us plumbing, but it was chemistry 
and biology that explained why you shouldn't make pipes out of lead 
(plumbum).

Too much is made of grand theories.  I'll give you that.  Most of 
science is a relatively mundane piecing together of minor facts, pieces, 
and theories, like assembling a complex jig-saw.  But the combined 
effect is major.  And it's a social process, not an individual process.  
I can't think of any single person that ever practiced it.  But I can 
think of groups that do.

People aren't good about admitting, even to themselves, when they have 
been wrong.  Otherwise science wouldn't be as important.  But people 
don't change just because they see other people making mistakes.  Newton 
believed in alchemy and astrology until his death.  And he knew how to 
test ideas.  And he knew that many of his most respected associates 
thought that he was being silly.

Science is engineering applied to the realm of ideas.  That's the best 
one sentence definition that I can give.  And it may be important enough 
to either kill us all or save us all.  Mind you, which it will do 
*ISN'T* a scientific choice.

So the method is humbug because while scientists are doing it
they don't call things by their formal names or use the numbered
steps in order?  That's a pretty silly objection.  While I
certainly agree that 90% of working scientists aren't consciously
following a method-like-a-recipe, that doesn't mean the method
isn't there.  Descriptions such as the above are meant to
capture the essence of which scientific practices work and
which don't with some philosophical rigor.  The fact that many
scientists may not think in those terms is irrelevant.  The
fact is that they /do/ form hypotheses and they /do/ create
falsifying experiments and the /do/ rely on things like
statistical tests and earlier methods and results that also
used these methods.  And of course those who apply for grants
better be able to describe their work in more formal, rigorous
terms if they expect to get funded.

Further, the codification of the method is not meant to be a
revealed truth from on high or anything--it's just a hypothesis
in its own right about what works, and is being tested all the
time.  But it's important to have an underlying philosophy of
science because sometimes it's not clear what a result means or
how to interpret it, or what tests would further enlighten.

Yes, it may at first appear that scientists are just "trying
things out" in naive ways that even children and animals can
do, but children and animals often make bad conclusions: if a
child always gets a cold in the winter, he'll think they're
actually caused by cold weather; if he takes an herb and his
cold goes away, he'll think the herb cured him.  People have
been "trying things out" informally for thousands of years,
and that's given us shamans, faith healers, accupuncture,
ayurveda, and piles of dead bodies.  For over 10,000 years
of human history, a kid with lukemia died 100% of the time,
no exceptions.  Because of modern science, now /most/ kids
with lukemia survive.  And that science was, both imformally
and formally, based on the philosophical foundations laid
down by Bacon, Popper, and other philosophers of science.

/Something/ is different about what scientists are doing
today, that works, and what they had been doing for 10,000
years, which didn't work.  Calling that difference "scientific
method" is a good way to identify it.  Do you have a better
term?

I don't see how his actions can be defended from a libertarian standpoint.
Chomsky signed a petition that called Faurisson a "respected professor"
called his racist rant "extensive independent historical research" and
complaining that the poor man has been subjected to "slander" and
"intimidation". If I call Faurisson a moral imbecile that is not slander
that is a fact, and if that crypto Nazi finds my words intimidating then
he'll just have to cry himself to sleep tonight.
By the way, this is my moral IQ test, there are only 3 questions:

1) One group lost thousands of people when another group hijacked 2
airliners and crashed them into the two largest civilian office buildings on
Earth. Which group were the bad guys?

2) In total did the Khmer Rouge do more harm or good?

3) Who was responsible for World War 2, the Nazis of the Jews?

I'm sure you find these questions easy but they totally confused
Mr. Chomsky, he got every one wrong.

    > Certainly  it is plain that one can't simultaneously `deny the
    > Holocaust' while describing it as `the most fantastic outburst
    > of collective insanity in  human history'.

Not true, people make contradictory statements every day especially
intellectuals when they talk about things outside their area of expertise.
Chomsky said he didn't know anything about Faurisson but then calls him
"a relatively apolitical liberal", he did not say how he knew this. He also
said this about a man he claimed to know nothing about "I see no hint of
anti-Semitic implications in Faurisson's work". So there is not a hint, not
even a hint, of anti Semitism in saying Anne Frank is a phony; we shouldn't
be surprised, there are some other strange things he can't see anything
wrong with "I see no anti-Semitic implications in denial of the existence of
gas chambers or even denial of the Holocaust. Nor would there be
anti-Semitic implications, per se, in the claim that the Holocaust (whether
one believes it took place or not) is being exploited, viciously so, by
apologists for Israeli"

After the shit hit the fan when he wrote the preface to Faurisson's book he
tried to weasel out by saying he didn't really support everything in it.
Ironically Chomsky now says the entire controversy came from his poor
understanding of language! "My mistake stems from my having made an error in
English. I believed that the word "findings" meant "discoveries," whereas
its meaning is "conclusions." "

That's probably a reference to the CIA.  A lot of german nationals were 
recruited after the war.  von Braun wasn't the only one.  Many of them 
were intelligence operatives.  So, allowing a bit for a double-dose of 
hyperbole (once from Chomsky [I didn't read the original] and once from 
Horowitz) it may well be describing something "real".  (Were they 
Nazis?  Who knows.  They were German military under Hitler, so they must 
have professed naziism, but wanting to stay alive and not be invaded 
doesn't really make you the kind of sicko the SS and Gestapo [Homeland 
Security] were.)

That could certainly use a bit of explanation.  It could be a revulsion 
against napalm, or any of many other things.  Great rhetoric, though.

It's a matter of record that the US maintains training camps where 
foreign nationals are taught "interrogation techniques", and that these 
techniques include methods for which torture is not an inappropriate 
description.

I *STILL* don't know why we invaded Vietnam.  Not even yet.  Stupid is 
the kindest thing I can say about it.  But I really doubt that this is 
the reason, and I doubt that this was the purpose.  I also doubt that 
Chomsky claimed that the purpose was to slaughter the people of 
Vietnam.  This sounds like an extraction out of context.  (Still, it was 
the policy of the US for some period of time after the war to cause the 
people of Vietnam to be unhappy with their government, even if it meant 
that the US suffered extra so that they would suffer more.  So this 
isn't total nonsense.  [We were *very* upset about loosing, even if what 
we stood to gain isn't clear.])

Listened to George Bush lately?  This one sounds dead accurate.  The 
claim to the right to first strike with nuclear weapons as an act of 
defense???  In Public!!   I've got to think that ... well, read Sigmund 
Freud on his experiences with cocaine addiction.

That's true.  In fact, if you are a strict constitutional 
constructionist (which I consider myself to be) feeling pissed off at 
the president for having won is sufficient grounds.  All you need to do 
is convince enough representatives to go along with you.  The reason is 
totally unimportant, except as a public relations justifier.  Ditto for 
the Senate to convict him.

What, in your opinion, is the substance of rationality? (not to detract from
your statement about science being only a subset of rationality, with which
I of course agree)

I do not know enough to comment intelligently on many of your other replies,
but I consider myself reasonable well informed on the Indochina wars.  I
know enough to consider 'invaded' an innacurate term of those events.  The
fact was that North Vietnam was being supplied military equipment and aide
from the soviet union to be used to invade the west friendly merchant based
South and 'unify' vietnam as one big happy communist empire.  The North
invaded the south, we did not invade Vietnam (as 'Vietnam' did not exist
until after the North completed its invasion and overthrow of the south)
this depends on your definition of 'invade' obviously, but mine doesn't
normally include helping one country defend itself from the invation of
another, especially when that other country is being supplied by a known
oppresive aggressive statist regime.  There were no US tanks rolling over
Hanoi, but those sure were Soviet tanks rolling through Saigon. We had just
come off from succussfully fending of the invasion of South Korea from the
Soviet Supplied North Koreans, and today South Korea has a wonderfull
economy and high standard of living, it recently hosted the olympics, after
all.  North Korea, on the other hand, was allowed to follow its chosen path
of poor peasant communist farming (advocated often by Chomsky) and low and
behold, its still a dirt poor communist peasant farming country, even poorer
now since the support of the Soviet union is gone.  Compare the memorials of
the Vietnam war with the korean war sometime and youll see a significant
difference, even though both were fought for the same reason.  

US troops were in fact never allowed to enter North Vietnam until the later
part of the war, so again I do not see how 'Invaded' is an accurate term of
our involvement in that affair.  

Whether or not we should have been involved at all is a fundamental moral
issue, that is, should a powerfull free state help defend a less powerfull
free state from the invasion of an oppresive aggressor state supplied by a
powerfull oppresive despotic state?  

I say yes, I cant convince myself that it would have been acceptable for the
communist north to trounce the south and kill a significant portion of its
population, and then force the rest to be poor peasant farmers.  But thanks
to the liberal activists and non-interventionists, they finally were able
to.

To be fair, though, I believe the fact that the Vietnam war was the first
'televised' war made a significant difference in the outcome of this event,
since it was the first time the voting public became aware of what war
actually is.  And there were definitely many poor decisions made in the
operation of the conflict, but it was IMHO for a just cause, even if it was
executed poorly.

Regards,

Michael

Clearly.  And it raises some interesting questions this
holiday season.  Sasha is gone, but not forgotten.

I have very clear images in my mind of Spike, Amara and Mike
from Extro 5.  And I do have some vague memories of Sasha
from Extro's 3 & 4.

How do we recreate the spirits of those no longer breathing and
extend the vector of their will into the world?

Is that not the least that we can do for our friends?

Robert

The most recently published book containing that story is
"True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier" by Vernor
Vinge, published by Tor Books; ISBN: 0312862075; (December 2001)
It is still in print, and should be available in many bookstores.
I have a copy at hand if you just want to verify something.

It was first published in "True Names and Other Dangers", by
Baen Books; ASIN: 0671653636; (December 1991).  This is now out
of print.

Depends whether you want just 'True Names', or 'True Names and Other Dangers'
(the latter of which which included several other stories).

It's an epistemological problem, to me.  What they are doing
is no different from what everyone else does, and it should
not be touted as such.  Doing so gives rise to scientism,
and a stupid mystique that has bad effects on everyone, 
even the scientists who enjoy it.

This definitely should not be used to put them in a class
apart.  I will agree that the term "scientist" can be a
good one, and used to effectively communicate.  But it
can be used quite badly, and the silly "rules" of the
so-called scientific method---nothing more than an afterthought
by philosophers, really---never do anyone any good when 
enshrined in a list and gloriously entitled.

That's all quite so.

don't forget to mention all the wonderful inventions of ancient

consider the difference between Roman engineers designing and
building elaborate siege engines and physicists working on
atomic weapons.

Choke.  Gasp.  You cannot be serious!  These worthies
did nothing but document and explain what was happening
in their respective cultures.  They have utterly no
effect whatsoever on progress, (except to those few
of us with academic interests who consider literature
and good explanations to be a fine hallmark of progress).

Yes, I do.  It's called accumulated knowledge.

Here's the core of our disagreement, I think: you seem to think
that there is no difference in kind between what the ancients did
to create such things as agriculture, writing, masonry, and so on
and the "modern" techniques of science, and that what scientists
do is no different from what, say, engineers or detectives do.

Perhaps the difference is more one of degree than kind: a detective
or an ancient bridge-builder can afford to take shortcuts and make
bold inferences and work with likelihoods, while the modern
scientist has to be more careful and comprehensive to eliminate
all the possible bad hypotheses.  But I still think /something/ is
different in kind about rigorous critical epistemology and ordinary
human reason, even when the latter is used with care.  While I agree
that identifying that thing, whatever it is, with a particular
description of "the" scientific method may lead to dangerous
dogmatism, I still think there's something there, and it's related
to self-honesty and self-criticism.

Let me add yet another:

http://cognet.mit.edu/Books/chomsky/5/5.html

This is the section from Robert Barsky's "Noam
Chomsky: A Life of Dissent" dealing with the "The
Faurisson Affair".  

The entire book, available online full text at:

http://cognet.mit.edu/Books/chomsky/index.html

appears (I just discovered it and haven't read it yet)
judging from the 'Faurisson' section, to be an
appropriate place to seek clarity regarding the
difference between the frothing hogwash from Chomsky
demonizers and 'what really happened'.  

Interesting 'ebook' structure, too.

Best, Jeff Davis

Damn straight!  First, try to get yourself signed up, and
everyone who will listen to you.  Second, hope that Tipler's
theories (or some variation of them) are correct.  Third,
do---as you are---everything that seems feasible or
practical to advance the Singularity, and fourth, spread
the word that the loss of every human life must be regarded
as an irreparable tragedy.

If enough people embrace all the above with revolutionary
ardor, death will be defeated.

Lastly, appreciate and celebrate the greatest moral revolution
since cryonics, "The Hedonistic Imperative" www.hedweb.com .

All the best,

Lee Corbin

Yep, I missed that entry.

First publication, but probably also the hardest to find now ;-)
Depends what sort of reference this was intended for, I suppose. For
ease of location, the latest collection would of course come out ahead
of any of the earlier editions. Looks like four to choose from... There's
also a copy of the text online, at http://members.tripod.com/erythrina/

Bein aggressive about looking for disproofs of a cherished hypothesis is *very* much a part of the 
difference, and a key marker for distinguishing pathological science (and plain ol' jumping at 
conclusions) from the better sort.

There are a lot of people with advanced degrees who seem to give lip service. This is natural, it's 
*hard* to get good at that kind of intellectual honesty. And even the perfectly honest search for 
*worthy* criticism (sadly) tends to eliminate the unschooled and the autodidacts--"have you *read* the 
*literature*?"

The question has a point, bt it *is* also used as a club (in both senses). Used badly, it blinds one to 
epistemological news-of-difference. I suspect we agree on all of this, I'm just butting in to ask if 
anyone besides me thinks Feyerabend was as delightful as Derrida and Lacan are tedious? (Hmm. As worded, 
that would include someone who evaluated both functions as zero or negative values. English is a funny 
thing.)

Some of you may have noticed that I haven't done much
posting of late.  There have been various reasons.  My
experiment with multiple personalities has us all
confused, (Not me!) altho my love life has certainly
improved.

However, one underlying reason is that it now takes a
full minute to load the list title menu, since it went
from displaying the past 3 months to displaying a full
year.  As the library system that I typically use does
not allow the option of opening everything into a new
window, this means that each time I return to the
list, there is another full minute wait before I can
access it.  

Since I'm working from a very high speed connection -
which is why I use the libary computers, this tells me
that most people will be waiting for several minutes
just for the list to load.  Assuming that a purpose of
the list is outreach, this seems to miss the point. 
Of course, I could go back to having the new posts
sent to an email address, but then I would be back to
spending 30 minutes a day just deleting stuff I wasn't
interested in.

One solution might be to format the list itself to
always open a new window, taking control away from the
browser options.  Meanwhile, we certainly have plenty
to do on our own here...

Back on August 19th I posted my original report on
this for the benefit of those who might be tempted to
risk life and limb for the thrill of the wind in the
face.

Here is a follow-up, with perhaps a few lessons
implied:

As I mentioned originally, the guy who rear-ended my
bike on the 55N fwy apparently was a cop or a
"sergeant" of some kind anyway.  I contacted my
insurance company - Pacific Specialties - immediately
on the assumption that they would want to be kept
informed and also because my uninsured motorist
coverage might be involved, as I had no ID from this
"sergeant."

I sent in the form that the CHP gave me, together with
a check, but no report was forthcoming from them
either.  After a month, I finally got the form and
check back with a note from CHP saying that I also
must include a copy of my driver's license, nowhere
specified on the form.

Before I could reply to this, I was contacted at work
by phone by the CHP officer's supervisor, who was
verifying their report.  He was shocked to hear that I
had not received a report, indicated that in fact
there was no requirement to send a copy of my license,
and promised to send one to me free of charge.  He
said that he was also concerned over any "special
treatment" the "sergeant" might be receiving.  

Meanwhile, Allstate Insurance - the "sergeant's"
company finally contacted me and assured me that
everything would be taken care of.  Their rep advised
me to get an estimate on my bike and that they would
provide temporary transportation (rental car) and pay
for all my other expenses consequent from the
accident.  I told them that I was concerned about
losing the bike, as it would certainly estimate at
more damage than any book value, and if they declared
it totalled, I would be left without transportation.

So, I began looking for replacement transport.  

Meanwhile, Allstate called me several times, their rep
being super-sweet and reassuring.  Finally, she called
and asked if I would give them a statement for their
records.  I had no problem with this and did so.

As soon as I had finished giving the statement (which
two attorneys I contacted later said I should NOT have
done) her whole attitude changed, starting with her
announcement that THEIR client - the "sergeant"
thought that I was at fault.

to be continued....  (it gets a LOT worse from here
on)

Rafal,

It seems Hugh Hefner's business manager was
eavesdropping on our conversation.

Dec 11, 2002
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - For almost 50 years, Playboy
founder Hugh Hefner has made a living selling the
dream of his lavish lifestyle featuring the opulent
mansion, decadent parties, and beautiful women. 

Now the company has signed a deal to offer video game
junkies the chance to don Hef's fabled smoking jacket
and slippers and stroll through the legendary love
den. 

Playboy Enterprises Inc. (NYSE:PLA - news), which
oversees the internationally-known Bunny brand, on
Wednesday said it has entered into a licensing deal
with privately held game developers Groove Games and
Arush Entertainment for a series of titles. 

The companies said the first game, targeted for a 2004
release on all major game platforms, would let players
take a crack at building the Playboy empire and
"living the ultimate Playboy lifestyle." 

Citing market research, Playboy said its readers spent
more than $300 million on video games in the last
year. Video game hardware and software sales are
expected to top $10 billion in the United States in
2002. 

"The game will probably be getting an 'M' rating,"
Donald Case, a spokesman for Scottsdale, Arizona-based
Arush, told Reuters. 

An "M" rating, as assigned by the Entertainment
Software Rating Board, means that a game is not
intended for anyone under the age of 17. 

"It most likely will not feature full frontal
(nudity), but it will contain topless stuff," Case
said. 

He said it has not yet been decided if the player will
actually take the role of Hefner or a Hefner-like
character. 

Case added that while the license is exclusive for
simulation-type games for seven years, Playboy still
has the right to license its brand for other types of
games.

This topic came up at the most recent Transhuman Atlanta, during a 
discussion of whether the Santa Claus legend is mostly bad (teaches kids 
to believe in order to get rewarded) or mostly good (learning that Santa 
Claus is a big fat lie is a valuable lesson in skepticism).  In Germany, 
according to Sabine, Santa Claus is more feared than adored - he puts the 
bad kids in the sack.  This got us to thinking about what kind of legend 
Newtonmas should have, and while I've heard of Solar Cause, the Newtonmas 
patron proposed at >H ATL was the Fairy of Doubt, who brings presents only 
to children who don't believe in him.

It was proposed that someone dress up as the Fairy of Doubt for Newtonmas, 
but the reply was that the Fairy of Doubt's existence should be asserted 
but never supported by observation.

This year, tell your little children about the Fairy of Doubt, who brings 
presents only to those children who don't believe in him; and be sure to 
relate the heartwarming story of little Sally, who almost started 
believing in the Fairy of Doubt, but was saved from an unhappy Newtonmas 
by the Competing Hypothesis.

I don't know if Chomsky has said in so many words that the Jews were
responsible for WW2 (although it wouldn't surprise me if he did) but
Faurisson certainly did and according to Chomsky Faurisson is a "respected
professor" doing "extensive independent historical research" with not even a
hint of Anti Semitism. Thus Chomsky would get very low marks on question
number 3 of my moral IQ test and on the first two he would get zero. Alan
Dershowitz is not normally one of my favorite people but he did write an
interesting article about Chomsky and Faurisson at

There is a lot of modern science, it seems to me, that proceeds
by bold hunches and torpedoes be damned.  I'm thinking right now
of attempts to isolate a particular nucleotide sequence, or the
development of some new techniques in that area.  It does seem
true, though, that the extreme care and comprehensiveness of 
which you speak---and which, in your last email you mentioned
by way of statistical analyses---does not find a ready counter-
part in ancient science.

Still, Euclid and the philosophers were pretty penetrating when
it came to eliminating bad hypotheses.

Do you mean that modern science often shows signs of "rigorous
critical epistemology", or just that the practitioners are
often rigorously critical?  I don't quite see it.

Scientific examples of that elude me.

Say a few more words, and I might see it.

Well, I don't think that anything at all has changed since
the time of the Greeks on that score.  I mean, the Greek
philosophers were as sophisticated as are we about that,
basically.  Yes, you are right about science:  they didn't
seem to be critical towards their scientific pronouncements,
and indeed that is what *does* characterize the last few
hundred years of Western science.  Maybe that's what you
are talking about---maybe it's this renaissance attitude
that is carried on today in science that people are trying
to refer to by "the scientific method".

But if that's all it was, then I'd say that it was about
time that the scientists started acting like the medieval
architects, boat builders, and all the other people that
got anything done  had been doing for some time.

I find two things egregiously wrong with the sentiment
expressed here.  One is that no one has any obligation
whatsoever to stick to a subject they know something
about.  One of the delights of a forum like this is
that people are and should feel free to spout off about
anything they feel like.

Provided only that they do it in good taste.  Which
brings me to my second point.

Does anyone here really need to tell anyone to shut up,
and moreover to use abusive or profane language to convey
the suggestion?  Let's keep to our rather excellent
civility, overall.

Q. What were some former highly successful world superpowers?

A. Roman Empire 100BC-400AD, Mongol Empire 1200-1400, Spain
   1450-1700, Great Britain 1700-1918.

Q. What about superpowers later on, especially the the second half
   of the twentieth century?

A. The USSR: 1943 - 1989
   The USA: 1918 - 

Q. What happened?

A. The two world superpowers fought a nasty *cold* war (bless them)---
   American imperialism at every turn was countered by Soviet imperialism
   and vice-versa, until the collapse of international Communism in 1989,
   which left American aggression a clear field.  Finally, the Americans
   were totally unopposed militarily---just what they had been waiting for.

Q. What would you have expected to have happened then?  That is, what
   would Rome, or Spain, or Great Britain have done?

A. 1991:  U.S. Army invades Mexico and Central America and sets up American
          colonies, demands light tribute from Japan and Europe.  Former
          Communist countries and UK lackey are excepted, but all other
          countries in the world (who can do so) are also required to pay
          nominal sums in "protection" money.

   1992:  U.S. institutes Marshall plan for Eastern European countries
          to enable them to eventually be able to pay tribute too.

   1993:  Ultimatums issued to all South American and African countries
          to adopt free market economies, eliminate corruption, and
          begin showing a profit.  Or else.

   1995:  Nuclear destruction of Ascuncion, Paraguay, and Bangui,
          Central African Republic as object lessons to the remaining
          South American and African countries not complying with market
          and property reforms.

          Threat of total war forces nuclear disarmament of Pakistan,
          India, and China.  Sino-American war avoided at last moment,
          at enormous U.S. financial cost.  India and Israel forced
          to abandon socialist practices, and to improve their economies.

   1996:  U.S. Annexes Canada and Australia, creating states 51-58.
          Arrest of most prominent Canadians and Australians on charges
          of anti-American subversion.

   1997:  Ultimatum issued to Russia to improve economy or else.
          Hydrogen bomb devastation of three more small African nations.
          Nuclear disarmament of Israel, South Africa, France, and
          Russia obtained at considerable U.S. expense.
   
   1998:  Increased tribute requirements result in rebellions in
          Poland, Indonesia, Egypt, Israel, and Morocco which are
          savagely suppressed.  Germany and Scandinavian countries
          forced to drop socialist programs and increase tribute.

   1999:  Atomic bomb detonations on U.S. soil results in the destruction
          of Chicago, Denver, and Atlanta.  In retaliation, thirty-one
          cities in the middle east are H-bombed, including the 80 megaton (!)
          annihilation of Tehran.

   2000:  All nations paying tribute are deemed adequate except Russia,
          Romania, Poland, Israel, France, New Zealand, Namibia.  Stern
          warnings issued.

   2000:  Except for sporadic terrorism, ongoing repression and
          arrest of numerous dissidents---and minor rebellions
          here and there occasionally suppressed by atomic attack,
          Pax Americana complete in most respects.

Q.  But that didn't happen.  Why?

A.  Dunno, exactly.

*Some* of the best science, e.g. the work of Darwin
or Einstein, was furthered by the scientist in question
having just this attitude.  In order to be right, he
wisely subjected his hypotheses to extreme skepticism.

But it's probably too hasty to dismiss those scientists
not so inclined  as being involved in pathological science.
A lot of terrific contributions have been made by people
who prefer to let others play the role of skeptic, and
who are only interested in advancing their own ideas.

I don't consider such a demand to be part of a 
"perfectly honest search".  I agree that often
I don't have time to entertain the musings of
some people, but putting them down with that
remark does not constitute an argument---even
when justified, it's definitely not part of the
science.

Extropes,

This post has required reading.  Cliff notes and
politically motivated creative musings will not do.

Read the petition (cited below), and Chomsky's
'preface' to Faurisson's book, to be found at:

http://aaargh.vho.org/fran/chomsky/NCprefaceeng.html

--- John K Clark <jonkc@att.net> wrote:

Fortunately you are not the god of libertarian thought
control.

> Chomsky signed a petition

For those who like a little fact with their discourse,
here is the exact text of the petition in question:

"Dr. Faurisson has served as a respected professor of
twentieth-century French literature and document
criticism for over four years at the University of
Lyon 2 in France. Since 1974 he has been conducting
extensive independent historical research into the
"Holocaust" question. Since he began making his
findings public, Professor Faurisson has been subject
to a vicious campaign of harassment, intimidation,
slander, and physical violence in a crude attempt to
silence him. Fearful officials have even tried to stop
him from further research by denying him access to
public libraries and archives."

The above and below was taken from:

Robert F. Barsky, Noam Chomsky, A life of dissent
http://cognet.mit.edu/Books/chomsky/5/5.html

"Was signing the petition on behalf of Faurisson
therefore a mistake? In light of the principle
involved, Chomsky would say that it was not. What does
it mean to sign a petition? Chomsky notes that
included in many petitions for Salman Rushdie was
praise for his banned book, The Satanic Verses:
"irrelevent on a freedom of speech statement, and
improper, since many of the signers (I'm one) hadn't
even looked at [the book]." So why sign? 
Because if one were to sign only statements that are
formulated the way one thinks proper, no one would
sign anything, except the author. It's understood that
a signature means support for the general gist of the
statement, not the specific formulations." 

>... that called Faurisson a
> "respected professor"

Which he was.  Of French literature.

> called his racist rant "extensive independent
> historical research" 

Wrong, John.  And perhaps a lie, if one cares to hold
up to judgement an assertion offered with biased
indifference to its truthfullness.  Read the petition
again, John. It's a simple thing.  Just one simple
sentence, John.  It reads, "Since 1974 he has been
conducting extensive independent historical research
into the "Holocaust" question."  What anyone--you, me
Chomsky, Faurisson--does with their research is an
entirely separate matter.  Let me spell it out for
you, John: F-R-E-E-D-O-M (of speech).

Here we have the ranting of someone caught with his
facts down and his bias exposed for all to see, trying
to dance his way out of his credibility problem.  

And what is that bias?  It's that although John Clark
talks a lot about libertarianism and freedom he still
doesn't understand what Chomsky understands and what
the petition was all about: that freedom of speech
must extend to those who have something to say that
John Clark doesn't approve of.

I declare you fact-challenged.  So why dont ***YOU***

Blah, blah blah.  Who gives a shit?  You're just
dancin' here, John.  Plain truth: you were wrong,
John.  Chomsky never denied the holocaust.  Repeat:
you were wrong.  You need to get your facts straight.
That's the problem.  You.  You being wrong.  Chomsky
didn't deny the holocaust.  Get it in your head.

Are you saying that Chomsky has no expertise in
American culture and foreign policy, or just babbling
away cluelessly in support of your assertion.

[By the way John, have you read anything by
Faurisson--I just read my first snippet yesterday, as
part of my studying up for this post--or is it a case
of someone just talking from pure virginal ignorance,
"about things outside their area of expertise"?]
  
> Chomsky said he didn't know anything about Faurisson

Wrong again.  You're nothing if not consistent.  What
Chomsky said, and I quote: 

I have nothing to say here about the work of Robert
Faurisson or his critics, of which I know very little,
or about the topics they address, concerning which I
have no special knowledge. 

(The above is from:
http://aaargh.vho.org/fran/chomsky/NCprefaceeng.html
Or, alternately:

)

But the stuff below, this stuff I've found.  And maybe
it's John Clark getting it totally wrong again, or
maybe it's an innocent misattribution, or maybe it's
me that has read it wrong.  You all take a look and
decide.  

In "Pierre Vidal-Naquet: On Faurisson and Chomsky" 

at: http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/VidalNaquet81b/
  
in a very close and detailed look at the language of
the petition  Vidal-Naquet (I think him writing for
himself and not him quoting Chomsky) writes: 

            ----start quote-------

My mistake, he contends, stems from my having made an
error in English. I believed that the word "findings"
meant "discoveries," whereas its meaning is
"conclusions."

             ----end quote-----

Compare that to what John attributes--that is what the
quote marks mean isn't it?--to Chomsky below:
  
> Ironically Chomsky now says the entire controversy
> came from his poor
> understanding of language! "My mistake stems from my
> having made an error in
> English. I believed that the word "findings" meant

Is this bogus or what?

Tell you what John, why don't you, from now on, read
everything/something Chomsky has written or said on a
particular narrow issue, and everything/something his
critics have said in response before you weigh in. 

Better yet.  Don't ever talk about Chomsky again.

Best, Jeff Davis

We opened officially this last Friday and had our first guests arrive all the way from Dickinson, Texas.  When they felt crushed that we did not have cable television(we do as of today) I recommended they enjoy the view of nature's wonders from their porch. lol!  They were a friendly married couple who upon leaving told me they had a very nice time with us and would stay here again for their next visit to relatives in the area.

It has been a long road to getting where we are now.  David Pizer's "castle in the sky" has been made reality to a great extent.  Now it's time to make money and gather our strength for what will be coming next.  What we have is currently only phase one of his farsighted vision for the eventual creation of the Ventureville community.   

Last night the Mayer Chamber of Commerce had a mixer at in our main lodge building great room.  We had expected only about forty people but three times that number showed up!  Marilyn, the sweet representative from the Chamber, gave the opening remarks to thank her volunteers and then she turned things over to David.

He shared his love for the place and described all it had to offer.  Quite a bit of humor was included about some of the ups and downs we had in getting to this point.  Dave definitely won over his audience with his remarks.  At a certain point he put his hand on my shoulder and introduced me to the people of Mayer as his manager-in-training.  I felt very proud at that moment and had a lump in my throat.  Dave also gave a great deal of credit to his wife and the gentleman whose company did a good job building the lodge.

After his talk he and I divided up the crowd and took them on tours of the place.  I lead quite an exodus to the cabins below and received numerous compliments about what they saw.  

I am not a natural "schmoozer" but I will learn in time.  I did my best to make people feel welcome as I got to know those attending.  I was fortunate to have Jerry Searcy, an Alcor volunteer and friend of ours to help out in this matter.  One of the best contacts I made was with the marketing representative from Arcosanti.  This is an experimental community not far from us which sponsors various excellent concerts and lectures.  

The entire evening was a success beyond our wildest dreams.  Obviously people wanted to see what we had to offer and I believe they really liked what they saw and heard.  A bond is developing between us and the local people which will help as we move forward to seeing Ventureville take root.  

The Cryofeast is coming up!  I truly hope to see many of you there  and I promise Dave and Trudy know how to show folks a good time.  You will never have attended one of these events in such upscale and naturally beautiful surroundings, I promise you!  Holes have even been dug so those who wish to can plant "time capsule" trees which will be living reminders of the promising present and the possible glorious future we are moving toward.  Please come and join us.  

By Thursday night John deRivaz and I should have pictures of Creekside posted on the Venturist website.  I realize many of you are impatient to see if it is as nice as we claim.   

YEE-HAA!!!  I may just wear my cowboy hat for the cryofeast. : )  

best wishes to all,

John Grigg
Manager-in-training
The Creekside Preserve/Ventureville
  
P.S.  Where do you people find the time to read and write all these posts? LOL!  I remember fondly the days when I had lots of free time.

Do you want to fill out the forms, or do you want to trigger the action
that happens when you submit a filled-out form?  The two are different,
and the latter is a lot more common.  Do a google for "CGI HTTP" (to
distinguish it from other things CGI stands for) to get the lowdown on
the spec that browsers use when you submit a form.

Also, please double-check what you are doing or have been asked to do,
and make sure it isn't writing spambots (for instance, writing automated
registration scripts).  The world has enough spambots, and tend only to
cause trouble and damage, despite their users' sincere beliefs that
their only effect is to create wealth (they don't; at best, they shift
money around by suckering people, while burning up useful qualia - good
will, honesty, bandwidth, and so forth).  I ask because this is far and
away the most common use for automating the process etc. as you stated.
There are other uses, but they are rare.  (And if you don't know how to
do it, you probably don't know about the abuses - and specifically how
you can be tricked into contributing to these abuses.  Which can do bad
things to your career, by being tarred by working for those who would
abuse.  I've managed to avoid this myself, but others have not been so
fortunate.)

During the .com boom there where some companies offering new prices 
every hour. The idea being that you came to their website and saw their 
commercials, while guessing for price money.

Well I have a friend who wrote a programme that answered these online 
multiple choice quiz'es automatically.

Many of the questions were repeated, but when the programme was in doubt 
it guessed a random answer.

So I helped him out, and wrote a little programme that could guess 
multiple choice questions far better than random.

I sat next to him in the office, and couldn't help but smiling every 
time he got an email that he had won a price.

Talk about applied AI for automatically making money ...

So there can be good reasons for automatically filling out forms. For 
fun and profit ;-)

# newsgroup quote:

I have written this little Python program that usually raises a few
eyebrows. It answer multiple choice questions.

It is very simple. ie.

question = 'What is Python'
choices = (
                'a programming language',
                'a tv series',
                'a snake'
                )
It then queries google with:

"What is Python a programming language"
"What is Python a tv series"
"What is Python a snake"

and chooses the result that gets the most hits.

Simple, but far better then random.

Well it's not of much use, but kind of fun and very low budget AI ...

As far as I am concerned, Santa Clause is a fairy tale. It is a piece of 
fiction. By principle I believe that there should be no limits to 
fiction at all.

Being a die hard sceptic I still find immense joy in christmas, horror, 
ghost and vampyre stories. Don't know why, but I do.

I also enjoy telling my children about santa, and the little "nisse" (a 
kind scandinavian christmas gnome) we have living in the attick. He 
writes them letters, and they reply to them. Which is a fun christmas 
activity. Sort of a christmas RPG.

And the fact that children so villingly gives up believing in Santa is a 
good sign. It gives an important data point for a comming sceptic, when 
they realise that there is no santa.

In fact my 10 year old son just became convinced this year, that there 
is no santa. As he received a present from the "nisse" he told me to 
thank the "nisse" and gave me a knowing wink. He didn't say anything, as 
he didn't want to spoil the fun of belief for his little sisters.

So Santa is a little bit of harmless fiction. A game played between 
children and adults. There is no reason to make a big fuss out of it.

You have a problem with the scientific method?

I'm surprised to hear that.

Well, not surprised, but I didn't expect extropians to be against the 
scientific method.

The point of the scientific method is that you can prove your 
conclusions based on empirical evidence.

(Heh, two bits of entropy, but why?)

The scientific method is the best method that we s humans yet have, 
along with Clifford algebras, to predict subatomic mechanics.  Happily, 
Clifford or geometric algebras have predicted subatomic mechanics.  That 
is to say, even yet, humans can use mathematics to predict their 
understanding of physics.

(Heh, two bits.)

We were introduced to the scientific method, however familiar it may be 
to any rational person, in high school chemistry, where we kept lab 
books.

The scientific method is happily rational.

The "Bogus medical claims" thread (from November) offered a great deal of 
information about growth hormone(GH) treatment for adults. Appropriateness, 
dosage, monitoring and contraindications were examined at length.

Still, the issue remains unresolved.

An article in the New York Times on December 1st provides an excellent 
summation of the debate.
==============================================
To Stop Aging, First Stop Fighting
By FRED BROCK

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/01/business/yourmoney/01SENI.html?ex=1040642897&ei=1&en=d1355fe951c1fd10
<snip>
Results of a clinical study published last month in the
Journal of the American Medical Association showed that
human growth hormone did increase lean muscle mass and fat
loss in test subjects, but that the gains were accompanied
by adverse side effects in nearly half the cases. The side
effects included pre-diabetes, diabetes, aching joints and
swollen tissues.
Dr. S. Mitchell Harman, director of the Kronos Longevity
Research Institute in Phoenix and an author of the study,
says he believes that medical science may someday be able
to take 20 years off your age. "But we sure as hell can't
now," Dr. Harman said. "Anyone who says they can is of the
P. T. Barnum school."
Dr. Tom Perls, an associate professor at Boston University
Medical School and director of the New England Centenarian
Study, hopes the human growth hormone study will be the
"death knell" for the hormone's use as an anti-aging agent.
"Before this, we didn't have that much armor to attack
these guys," he said.
But Dr. Ronald Klatz, president of the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine in Chicago and a leading proponent of
human growth hormone, contends that the side effects of Dr.
Harman's study were hyped. He said they were a result of
doses of the hormone that were too big.
"They used inappropriately high doses that were two to
three times higher than they need to be for anti-aging or
rejuvenation purposes," he said. "With our lower doses, we
see almost none of these side effects; when we do, we
adjust the doses down and the side effects go away."
Dr. Harman responded: "You know, it is possible they are
right. Reduced doses and more frequent dosing could dilute
out the adverse effects and still produce some beneficial
effects. But the problem is, no one has studied this. There
are no data. There are just the anecdotal reports of these
clinics and the people they serve, or disserve, as the case
may be."
He added that he planned to propose that some of these
clinics allow him to study their patients to find out if
what they're doing really works. But he said he doubted
that the anti-aging doctors would cooperate. "They never
get back to me," he said. "They don't want to know."
Dr. Klatz responded with an unprintable expletive.
I'm
not sure how keen these dueling doctors may be on taking
advice from someone who flunked college biology, but here
goes: If there's any hope that this stuff can work at lower
doses, then stop fighting and get together and test it.
History is rich with stories of new ideas and treatments
that had a tough time getting past establishment
resistance. It wasn't so long ago that surgeons scoffed at
washing their hands before operating on people. The doctor
who linked blood levels of homocysteine to heart disease in
1969 was virtually booted out of Harvard Medical School
only to be proved right years later. The Atkins diet,
nearly universally condemned 25 years ago, now has a degree
of mainstream medical acceptance.
RAY OLSHANSKY, an epidemiology professor at the University
of Illinois at Chicago and a critic of anti-aging medicine,
said many doctors confuse the manifestations of aging with
aging itself. "Even if we cured heart disease, cancer and
stroke, we wouldn't have altered aging," he said. "The
cellular process of aging will continue and people will get
old and die. But research scientists are on track to alter
the biological rate of aging. We think it's going to happen
in our lifetime."
Professor Olshansky agreed that the dosage controversy over
the hormone should be tested using standard scientific
methods. "But the anti-aging proponents will be critical of
anything that comes up with conclusions that are not
consistent with what they're doing," he added.
I warned you that this was a nasty battle.

Growth Hormone and Sex Steroid Administration in Healthy Aged Women and Men
A Randomized Controlled Trial

Conclusions  In this study, GH with or without sex steroids in healthy, 
aged women and men increased LBM and decreased fat mass. Sex steroid + GH 
increased muscle strength marginally and O2max in men, but women had no 
significant change in strength or cardiovascular endurance. Because adverse 
effects were frequent (importantly, diabetes and glucose intolerance), GH 
interventions in the elderly should be confined to controlled studies.

Growth hormone, sex steroid combination 'not ready for prime time'
"This study makes the important point that because adverse effects were 
common in response to growth hormone administration, individuals, 
particularly those who are elderly, should not use hGH outside of 
controlled investigational studies. Growth hormone has not yet been 
demonstrated to be of clinical utility as an anti-aging intervention," said 
Stanley Slater, M.D., deputy director of the NIA's Geriatrics and Clinical 
Gerontology Program. "Nonetheless, there were significant changes in body 
composition and cardiovascular endurance, which were augmented by the 
addition of testosterone in men. This remains an interesting area for 
further research."

Side effects of GH treatment:
In the initial clinical trials composed primarily of adults with AO-GHD, 
when starting doses of GH were higher than those now recommended, the most 
common side effects were...
Of note, these symptoms most commonly occurred at the outset of therapy, 
and most resolved within 1-2 months while therapy was continued...
GH induces transient resistance to the actions of insulin...

These Clinical Guidelines from 1998(9pages) are thorough and objective, but 
would be even more valuable once they are updated.

"Good taste?"  Now there's something the scientific method would not be able
to get a grip around.  I understand what you're trying to do, Lee, but
sometimes ... well, let me give you an example.  I'm currently reading a
book about Billie Holliday.  It tells of instances of how some people were
prone to walk out of her nightclub performances when she sang "Strange
Fruit" - her famous rendition of the evocative song about lynching.  They
thought the *song* was in bad taste.  Never mind that lynching was the REAL
obscenity.

Certainly we can (and should) feel free to spout off, here, and that's what
both Jeff and John have done.

Lee, I understand and appreciate your sentiments regarding keeping civility
but, again, one can be ingratiating as hell and still be the real "abusive"
(as with one's facts) and "egregiously wrong" culprit (i.e., John).

As to "profane" language?  I thought that Jeff's "... or shut the fuck up"
was like a breath of fresh air (in its context)!  Remember, too, that
"profanity is a victimless crime."  ;-)

If you do this with the legend of Santa Claus I'm going to get
really concerned about how you handle Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

And then of course there is Mickey and the Krell machine.

Some fairy tales are best left untouched.

Adrian,

	Since you spoke up about GURPS Alpha Centauri on ExI, I thought I'd
mention this to you. GURPS AC is now shipping. If you already know about
it, great. Let me also ask how the Singularity Card Game is going. Any
action?

### As a practicing scientist, let me provide you with my perspective: what
the ancient were doing, and what detectives do, is to use common sense. Now,
science is nothing more than common sense, but well-organized and directed
at a select type of tasks.

While the ancients kept their secrets, scientists are organized in formal
and informal groups that share knowledge, which allows for criticism. The
system for storing and validating knowledge, inherent in modern science, is
much better organized than the oral lore of our predecessors, and stacks of
papyri. And finally, the restriction of interest to features of the world at
large that can be tested or analyzed repeatedly and from various angles (as
opposed to the one-time events the detective focuses on) allows finding much
more reliable, and widely applicable answers.

Science *is* different, even if the difference is nothing but an extension
of common sense, and a humble restriction of scope.

Rafal

Damn straight!  First, try to get yourself signed up, and
everyone who will listen to you.  Second, hope that Tipler's
theories (or some variation of them) are correct.  Third,
do---as you are---everything that seems feasible or
practical to advance the Singularity, and fourth, spread
the word that the loss of every human life must be regarded
as an irreparable tragedy.

If enough people embrace all the above with revolutionary
ardor, death will be defeated.

Spot on, Lee, spot on. I have mentioned Tipler and immortalism to dozens and 
dozens and dozens of people, at parties, in conversation - and talked about 
Drexler and extropians and transhumanists - and put up many posters and so 
on - I never allow ignorance to be a barrier to conversation, though there 
is always an appropriate time and place for things.

Since there have been lots of posts on Iraq, I thought I might put up a copy 
of a letter of mine. This has absolutely no bearing on my personal views on 
war, violence or any conflict in Iraq. It is purely an assessment. Also, I 
am fully cognizant of oil politics, Venezuela, etc. I might also add that I 
am certain that many western countries, Australia and Japan included, could 
have minor nuclear weapons capability within several hours of an 
"emergency", whatever their official stated governmental positions.

=======================

The impending US-UK war with Iraq is not primarily due to oil, terrorism, 
biological or chemical weapons, human rights, dictatorship, punishment (for 
the invasion of Kuwait) or revenge (for Saddam Hussein's survival of the 
Gulf War) - however influential these factors have been from the sidelines.

The Iraqi war is due to the non-Western nuclear arms race.

Aerial bombing has already nullified Iraq's current nuclear weapons 
production programme (beginning with the Israeli bombing of its nuclear 
power plant in 1981 and continuing through Gulf War and post-Gulf War US-UK 
air strikes).

However, the only non-Western nuclear power (China) has already been joined 
by two others, India and Pakistan, with between several and several dozen 
atomic bombs each.

The "Axis of Evil" was and is next in line. Iraq, Iran and North Korea have 
all attempted to construct atomic weapons. This process is a continuing one 
in Iran and North Korea, and has halted for the moment in Iraq.

The US has belatedly realized the danger of having allowed the Indian 
sub-continent to enter the atomic arms race which had stabilized in Western 
countries. Unlike South Africa, these countries will not voluntarily rescind 
their nuclear weapons acquisition programmes. The US has convinced the other 
Western nuclear powers that action is necessary.

The invasion of Iraq is a demonstration of will intended to intimidate Iran 
and North Korea. If it does not succeed in disturbing their acquisitions 
programme, it is highly likely that an aerial campaign will be fought 
against Iran and that China will be placed under enormous pressure to 
acquiesce to similar action in North Korea. They will be picked off one by 
one by the West.

Many commentators would judge such a possibility to be ridiculous, given the 
risks involved. However, these risks are not military risks at the strategic 
level. It is likely that unmanned US fighter planes will be joining unmanned 
US surveillance planes in the skis above Iran and North Korea.

Finally, having dealt with the "Axis of Evil" the US will not allow Pakistan 
to retain its nuclear capability. India may have achieved a fait accompli 
and joined China as a permanent nuclear power, due to its sheer size. The US 
will however be reluctant to allow India, an unstable marginal democracy 
only tentatively allied to the West, to add to the non-Western (Chinese) 
nuclear arsenal at a time when the US and Russia wish to reduce their own 
overall weapons numbers. (An uncontrolled non-Western nuclear arms race 
could in itself easily double or treble the numbers of non-Western nuclear 
arms, raising them to a thousand and altering the global strategic balance.)

The September 11 attacks have demonstrated to America that a rogue State 
driven by ideology (Afghanistan) is capable of ruthless tactical attack 
despite the inevitability of retaliation. From a military perspective the US 
believes it must prevent State-level atomic attacks from occurring. Apart 
from invading Afghanistan (punishment for September 11) and developing 
anti-ballistic missile systems, this entails halting the non-Western nuclear 
arms race by force, following the "demonstration" of consequence about to 
play out in Iraq.

A lie?

    >historical research into the "Holocaust" question."

Ah, pardon me but exactly what am I wrong about? You seem to be reading the
same line I am. By the way, I wonder why an expert in language feels the
need to put the word Holocaust in quotation marks. And what is the
"question"?

     >Let me spell it out for  you, John: F-R-E-E-D-O-M (of speech).

I agree, Faurisson and Chomsky have a absolute right to say anything their
tiny little minds vomit up, and I have a absolute right to call them
ignorant immoral disgusting pigs for doing so.

    >Chomsky never denied the holocaust.

"I see no anti-Semitic implications in denial of the existence of
gas chambers or even denial of the Holocaust. Nor would there be
anti-Semitic implications, per se, in the claim that the Holocaust (whether
one believes it took place or not) is being exploited, viciously so, by
apologists for Israeli"[...] "I see no hint of anti-Semitic implications in
Faurisson's work"

    > Are you saying that Chomsky has no expertise in American culture and
    > foreign policy

Yep.

    > By the way John, have you read anything by Faurisson

I've read a little but not much because after 3 or 4 for sentences I feel
dirty and need to take a shower.

    >>  Me:
    > > Chomsky said he didn't know anything about Faurisson
    > > but then calls him  "a relatively apolitical liberal",

> Wrong again.

Wrong? Wrong! Are you saying Chomsky didn't make such a despicable comment?
If so then you are once again dead wrong.

    > Chomsky said, and I quote:
    > I have nothing to say here about the work of Robert
    > Faurisson or his critics, of which I know very little

It is quite true that Chomsky did say that, and then he started to catalog
all the wonderful virtues of Mr. Faurisson, a man he claimed to know nothing
about.

    > John, why don't you, from now on, read  everything/something
    > Chomsky has written

When I die and go to hell because God sentences me to eternal damnation my
punishment will indeed be to read everything that man has written, but until
then life is short and I think I've read enough of the vomit and political
ramblings of our Mr. Chomsky.

Invade may have been a poor choice of words, but I can't think of a 
better.  The original invasion wasn't military.  It was installing a 
puppet government after the sabatoge of the Geneva Convention (I forget 
it's real name).  This was justified by the current at that time 
anti-communist hysteria (and again, I can't think of a better word).

It seems to me clear that if given any chance Vietnam would have been 
glad to have been an ally if we hadn't actively driven them away.  The 
Chinese were their traditional enemies.  (This is long before the 
escalation that started after Johnson was elected.  By then it was 
probably too late for us to do anything reasonable.)  But the us 0wn3d 
the government of S.Vietnam during the days of the "Vietnam incursion", 
and we faked the justifiers used for sending in the troops.  (The Gulf 
of Tonkin resolution.)  (N.B.:  by "we" here I mean parties unknown 
operating within the US government.)

It's probably true that once the war really got going whichever side won 
would have inflicted massive damage (many deaths) on the side that lost 
(do you really think the govt. of the South was any better than that of 
the North?).  But our participation dates back to the original partition 
of the country.  And from that point forward we acted to prevent any 
reasonably peacable solution.  And to achieve no goal that I have been 
able to discern.  (Please don't try to assert that the govt. that 
supported, e.g., Papa Doc, was acting out of humanitarian motives.)

Hypothesis:
It's because the US is primarily a commercial empire, and only 
secondarily a military one.  The commercial parts of the US empire have 
already begun sweeping in the rest of the world.  (See the WTO, etc.  
Also McDonalds.)

And there's just not that much money in destroying someone.  Especially 
when you can buy them, and turn a profit.  Also, since this commercial 
group is a large oligarchy, foreign firms are welcome to join, provided 
they play by the rules.  Which can be difficult, as they aren't written 
anywhere, but one of them appears to be "squeeze your customers and 
employees for every possible dime".  The rules don't appear to penalize 
fraud by corporations, or extortion by corporation, or ... well, any of 
numerous activities provided that 1) it makes money, and 2) the 
perpetrator is a corporation.

And, I will admit, that even this is an oversimplification, and that the 
actuality is much more complex.  But destructive as it is, the corporate 
empire doesn't yet come close to a war.  Even a "conventional" one.

I'm all for keeping existing mythology intact, as well as for
creating more.  The question, though, is whether ot not a myth
retains its value when it is told honestly, /as a myth/.  Certainly
the literary and emotionally evocative value of Achilles' heels
and Procrustean beds and screaming Cassandras is not lessened by
knowing that they are creatures of fiction.  Is, then, the Santa
Claus legend of some value even when children are told up front
that it is fiction?  I can imagine it might serve as a simple way
to understand the concept of reciprocity: be good and you get
rewarded.  I don't see how acknowledging that the rewards actually
come from parents changes that lesson.

Charles,
       I remember this lesson from English 101.  It was the lesson on using 
"loaded language."  First you used the word "invade" where factually it is 
totally unjustified.  When I called you on it you evaded me with an excuse.  
       Then you ignore that the South Vietnamese government basically had its 
justification in the many people that fled there to escape the government in 
the North and in the treaty that the government of North Vietnam freely 
agreed to giving South Vietnam separate existence.  This was done freely by 
the Northern government although about five or six years later they suddenly 
decided that the Southern government was illegitimate despite their word 
given in treaty.
       Then you continue in that vein ignoring treaty, ignoring history and 
ignoring common sense.  If you wish to prove that the North was right and the 
South Vietnamese with the Americans were totally wrong then I suggest you 
take this argument to an arena where free speech isn't allowed -- otherwise 
your tactics will be shown for what they are.

That's the best excuse I've seen yet.  It may actually be the real one!

Thanks for the quotes.  I don't like them either, but that's mainly for 
their internal politics.  Our external politics are no better than 
theirs.  Still, even having one nation in the world with nuclear 
capability is insanely dangerous.  Having several ... if we live though 
this time we've been quite lucky.  (Another reason to hope the 
singularity hurries.... perhaps.  The new dangers may be no better than 
the old ones.)

This wasn't belated.  We were against that all along.  Except when it 
looked like China was going to be a problem, and we couldn't afford to 
divert attention away from Russia.  But as long as we were balanced 
against Russia, we didn't dare do much.  (Good?  Bad?  Whatever.  India 
was seen as an ally against China.  Pakistan saw India as a dangerous 
neighbor.  Etc.)

Possibly.  Or possibly North Korea might be pressured into placing 
itself under Chinese control and supervision.  (I don't think we'll 
really be able to coerce China into anything it doesn't want, but I 
doubt that they are all that happy with having a nuclear armed North 
Korea next door.

To me the risks seem immense.  But they are immense whichever way we 
turn.  I wouldn't opt for a military approach, but our present 
government...  Read Freud on his experiences with cocain addiction.

This is true whatever actually happened.  Official history has been 
created, and now we officially know what officially happened.  But there 
*may* have been good reasons.   If you weren't a victim.

This is clearly something that needs to be prevented.  And clearly our 
government is only able to contemplate one general approach.  It strikes 
me as an extremely risky approach, but probably a lot better than doing 
nothing.  (I'd have preferred expanding NATO into a world power, and 
allowing all countries to join, under strict conditions.  That would 
probably have created less opposition along the way.  But this is 
probably better than just hoping for the best.)

It's a pity that the United Nations structure didn't lead to a world 
government, but with the security council having a veto, the general 
assembly giving all nations equal weight, no income except voluntary 
dues... there's no way that could be made to work.

Honestly, I find these answers lacking. 

What Robert was asking about wasn't whether some future technology
could abolish death of some future super-technology could resurrect
the dead, but how to keep the vision of dead transhumanists alive
today. Invoking the Omega Point or admonishing people to sign up
won't bring back the understated humour of Sasha. In fact, it is an
evasion from the real issues facting us.

Back to the original question, I have been thinking about Sashas
writings. Many had great ideas that still have not been developed
throughly or been extended in the light of new information. What
about creating a collection of his best essays and posts, together
with comments and extensions by us? I envision a kind of web
anthology (although it would be good on paper too) aiming for
recognition of his ideas.

I don't really know much about Chomsky.  However, does it seem
odd to anyone else that Mr. Clark seems to not be reading the
very passages he quotes?  I don't want to be drawn into any
argument about Chomsky's merits or demerits, as I have nothing
to say on that matter. I've left without further comment the
specific parts to which I refer:

(references to 'Me' refer to Mr. Clark.

This segue from AI think tankers is appropriate.  All too often we erase 
work done by those in the back room, or ideas of those buried somewhere. I
don't think this is entirely intentional, but more random occurrences that
are the offshoot in discovering a new aspect of something already in effect.

In deference to Sasha, FM and others who are not alive, it's a welcomed
responsibility to keep their ideas breathing.

How can we do this?  One way is by creating an anthology.  ExI is taking on
such a task.  By compiling essays and ideas of extropians who have been
spearheading and putting it in book form, I hope that we can help keep
Sasha and others, - alive and not alive - regenerate in the central axis of
transhumanist extropic thinking.

Further, there is no reason why this cannot be added to ExI's website.

Best,

Natasha

I've been following this thread for a while and the polarization here seems
to be overly intense.  I read the Chomsky piece (Some Elementary Comments on
The Rights of Freedom of Expression) that prefaced Faurisson's book (Memoire
en defense) and it seems quite clear that Chomsky is defending Faurisson's
right to speak and not the content of Faurisson's speech.  From the title
and the first few paragraphs Chomsky indicates a focus on issues of freedom
of speech and disassociates himself from the exact content and quality of
Faurisson's work.  This quote seems to sum things up well:

"Before I turn to the subject on which I have been asked to comment, two
clarifications are necessary. The remarks that follow are limited in two
crucial respects. First: I am concerned here solely with a narrow and
specific topic, namely, the right of free expression of ideas, conclusions
and beliefs. I have nothing to say here about the work of Robert Faurisson
or his critics, of which I know very little, or about the topics they
address, concerning which I have no special knowledge."

I'm not sure how he could make himself any more clear than he does above. It
may be important to remember that the original intensity of this debate was
born in France where ebay is not allowed to sell any Nazi related items.
Their reactions to uncomfortable ideas can be extreme and in the process
Chomsky was accused of all sorts of deeds for which there was little
evidence in fact.
I have seen interviews with Chomsky, one of which can be found on the video
Manufacturing Consent and he explains the circumstances surrounding his
actions and the uproar that followed.  I am no Chomsky expert but I have
never encountered a comment by him, in any source I consider reliable, where
he denies the fact of the holocaust.  In the same video mentioned above he
explains at some length that he does believe that the holocaust took place.
I'm not sure what hope we have of moving forward if we can't come to some
level of consensus on issues like this.  In threads like this I wish that
the process of debate would move toward increased formality so that some
conclusions could be reached.  Polling the community might be nice.  When
intense debate like this begins a new phase could be opened - each side
would lay evidence on the table giving whatever level of support they feel
necessary(actual references would seem appropriate).  From there we would
decide on a few questions:

Do you believe Chomsky denied/denies the holocaust?
-Yes
-No

Do you believe Chomsky supported(s) Faurisson in his access to freedom of
speech only?
-Y
-N

etc....

This way we the forces that are defending/opposing Chomsky (on the Faurisson
issue only) can determine where they stand within the scope of popular
extropian opinion.

That is a ridiculous argument and it's easily disproved: tigers, unlike 
free radicals or UV, evolve. So when preys find a way to protect themselves 
against a predator, the predator also evolves. As far as I know, 
ultraviolet radiation, except perhaps now due to the Ozone problem, has 
remained constant for millions of years. Curiously, I remember reading 
about teeth evolution and how the teeth and jaws of modern animals have 
evolved so much since, say, the dinosaurs. So unlike the assumption in your 
argument, toothy predators have evolved a lot in the past hundreds of 
millions of years.

If you read my original message, I mentioned "bacterial culture", not 
"bacterial cell". Sure, individual cells are not immortal. Yet a bacterial 
culture, even when some cells suffer DNA mutations, survives. The question 
I ask is: why do we assume a multicellular organism can't cope with DNA 
damage? Why do we assume that DNA mutations accumulate in human cells when 
they don't in a bacterial culture? You can argue that non-dividing human 
cells can accumulate damage, but most cells in the body can be replenished 
by stem cells--even neurons.

>There is no doubt that DNA damage contributes to aging.

I have doubts about everything we think we know about aging.

>### Isn't "damage" the same as "something going wrong with"?

No. Although when a system is "damaged", there's "something wrong with it", 
there could be "something wrong" with a system without it being "damaged". 
If a car runs out of fuel, there's something wrong with it, but it doesn't 
mean it's damaged. In the same way, if a cell, for example, overexpresses 
p21waf, the cell cycle is blocked but it doesn't mean the cell is damaged.

>one.

True, but--as I pointed to Robert, though probably off-list--you also need 
to go through hundreds of fetal cells to clone animals. Yet according to 
the theory, fetal cells should not have DNA mutations. My conclusion when 
both controls (i.e. fetal cells) and adult cells have a low chance of 
yielding viable cloned animals is that something is wrong in the process of 
cloning and not with the cells themselves. See the papers by Michael West 
and there's a few papers by a Korean team too.

Oxidative stress of many kinds, UV, even other cytotoxic compounds such as 
ethanol.

No, I mean the concentration of, say, H2O2 necessary to kill 50% of a 
culture of WRN cells is much lower than the H2O2 necessary to kill 50% of 
normal cells human.

Yes, there is an increase in chromosomal abnormalities, though I'm not sure 
about somatic mutations.

Indeed, Werner's syndrome is probably the best evidence in favor of 
DNA-damage as a cause of aging.

All the best.

Hmm, let's see. Charged black hole blasts out e+/e- pairs until its
charge has been neutralized. The pairs mostly recombine into gamma rays,
which are absorbed by a standard Dyson and used for useful work. The
excess charge ends up on the dyson shell which now has the same charge
as the black hole did. The now neutral hole does not notice anything
since it is inside a equipotential Faraday cage. The Dyson engineers now
start to throw charges into the black hole using an electron gun. The
first electron is easy - no resistance. The second has to be thrown
against a one electron charge potential, so now a bit of extra energy
has to be added. And so on; the final electron has to be given a huge
energy to overcome the dyadosphere before it ends up in the hole. The 
total amount of energy used is equivalent to the one gained by having 
the dyadosphere release the charge as pairs, so this is just a 
reversible operation (leaving out that the hole would like to flash as 
soon as we get enough charge on it). Seems pretty useless, but might be 
useful if we have charge in other stable particles than electrons - drop 
a proton into the hole, get back an electron in the end.

Not really. I understood it. Which might imply I am correspondingly 
murky :-)

Nice, good arguments.  But I'm not really supposing that the strategy is 
as rational as you are arguing for.  I see it as basically 
opportunistic.  But if you plan to attack some county that contains a 
lot of resources that you currently control, then you stand to take a 
big loss, so it acts as a definite check.  Still, it's only a check.  
And if the resources are controlled by a competitor, you might weep 
crockodile tears were they expropriated/destroyed.  (I don't see 
countries acting as unities, but rather as being controlled by competing 
gangs with greater and lesser degrees of power, and under slightly 
varying sets of rules.)  So chance plays a large role here, and "who's 
on top?" and various negotiations and games, that are too complex to 
understant.  (Well, even simple game theory fits that description, but 
you know what I mean.  This is n-person game theory of games of 
partially hidden information with probablistic outcomes.  Where none of 
players are even initially of equal strength.  And where strengths exist 
along a multitude of dimensions with payoff matricies rather than scalars.)

This is unfair, as I cannot remember the name of my own sources 
(probably newspapers), but could you refer me to your sources?  Your 
description of the history doesn't match my recollections, but these 
were mainly shaped by newspapers, and so are of dubious validity.

And I still don't have a better term than invade, though I would 
definitely admit that it's use is metaphoric rather than literal.

The theory that I support can be found at FreeRepublic.com. It's
along these lines: The anthrax in the post-9/11 letters came from
Iraq, and they know this in the White House. They also know that
it represents a credible threat to kill millions, against which
they are presently helpless. They therefore do not dare to attack
Saddam head-on; that's what his doomsday threat is meant to deter,
it's precisely the circumstance under which it would be used. There
will, therefore, be no war unless and until something upsets the
new balance of terror between the USA and Iraq. Instead, the weapons
inspectors will be used to blunt the threat, by locating WMD
facilities and overseeing their destruction in a UN-mandated fashion,
just as they did during the 1990s.

I don't think there's anyone knowledgeable in the matter who
seriously believes the Anthrax letters weren't made and sent by an
American.  Iraqis wanted to kill Tom Daschle?  Give me a break.
They were the work of an oportunistic American dissident who saw
the chance to fool the public into thinking Arabs did it, and he
may be right that most of the public still thinks they were the work
of Arabs, but I don't think US law enforcement was fooled for long.

And contrary to another public belief, Anthrax is a pretty shitty
bio-weapon, and not a serious threat.

Then we are talking about totally different "things".  I don't 
think a quesiton about why our universe exists is talking about 
why the union of all that exists exists.  That would be indeed 
be utterly silly.  The question is only reasonable (and 
answerable) in the more limited sense of this space-time bubble 
or perhaps the larger "structure" such "bubbles" form in.

The question is not in the least meaningless.  If it were then 
our dependence on the universe would be a reason for not asking. 
  You can't have it both ways.

My personal bias is that I don't trust governments generally. 
The US government has done or condoned/supported the doing of a 
pretty considerable list of unsavory and even internationally 
criminal things.  It is not alone in that. Nor is its record of 
support for human rights at home without considerable tarnish. 
Being pro-freedom/pro-progress does not mean I have to be pro-US 
government.  IMO, the US government is a large and active threat 
to real human freedom and advancement.

Huh?  Looks like that paragraph is an attempt to explain why the

There are also various other groups of pro-freedom folks who act 
as if any mention of what should be condemned that the US 
government does is automatically suspect as being anti-freedom.

This is [un]fairly simplistic.  "Such people"?  Do you really 
believe we can be talked about meaningfully as a monolithic 
group?  Chomsky is sometimes very right-on about the problems of 
seriously interventionist policies of the US and the effects. 
He is usually, imho, wrong about many of the causes and 
especially about what a cure would be.  I am "anti-Israel" in 
that Israel is behaving largely like a rogue state and we are 
pouring billions into aiding it doing so.  It has broken an 
order of magnitude more UN resolutions than Iraq has yet we 
still support it almost blindly.  That is idiotic imho.  I am 
not pro-Arab.  I am pro-sovereignity and self-determination for 
individuals and nations (although I have a bit more problem with 
the latter generally).  I am not anti-capital [sic], am 
pro-Libertarian, anti-collectivist, pro-science/technology, 
anti-Luddite but pro serious consideration of consequences of 
deploying various technologies, pro-rational and pro-spiritual 
(spiritualist is something else again).

Yep, you need say nothing more to show your discerning intellect

It is true and documented that we incorporated several Nazi SS 
officers and other intelligence people in our own post WWII 
intelligence operations.  Some of those operations were highly 
questionable in their legality and legitimacy. That has been 
detailed in part before Congress.  I don't know about remaining 
secret armies though.  I haven't heard even rumors of supporting 
evidence of that.

It is documented that we did engage in industrial espionage, 
assasination, incitements of riots, economic espionage and so on 
in Latin and Sout America in that period.  "Extermination 
squads" is going too far though.

Our actions in Nicaragua were terrorist by our own definitions 
and were soundly condemned in the UN as criminal and terrorist 
three times.  Some of our actions in Iraq are unilateral and 
while not "terrorist" as such are certainly not strictly legal. 
  I can dig up dirt on the others that we would call terrorist 
if performed by any nation other than ourselves (or maybe 
Israel).   So no, this one isn't (unfortunately) proof that 
Chomsky is a fruitcake.

As a Libertarian I would agree although the grounds of the

violation of their oath to uphold the Constitution.

Extropes,

The following demonstrates why it is so difficult to
have a rational discussion of these sorts of things on
this, or for that matter any, list.  The underlying
knowledge base--the supposed truths about the
world--are completeley different from one person to
another.  To me this means that one person's truth is
corrupted, ie it is not truth at all, while another's
is the real thing.  (To be a bit more generous, I
might say everyone has some degree of error in their
set of facts.)  Adding to the problem--perhaps the
decisive element--is the pre-programmed resistance to
modifying one's belief set, the human tendency to
refuse the truth in favor of what they already
believe.  

Ron h absorbed his world view in the era of
McCartyism, and never looked back.

I will deal with the above passage--the "invade"
issue--at the end of the post.

The "South Vietnamese" Govt never had any legitimate
existence, as it was created in clear violation of the
Geneva accords:

Article 14

(a) Pending the general elections which will bring
about the unification of Viet-Nam, the conduct of
civil administration in each regrouping zone shall be
in the hands of the party whose forces are to be
regrouped there in virtue of the present Agreement

         -------end excerpt---------

The idea that a separate sovereign govt in the south
was "justified", as Ron puts it, by "the many people
who fled there to escape" is the usual hysterical
rhetoric -- 'the commies are coming, the commies are
coming!  Run for your lives!-- that reached peak
intensity in the McCarthy era and echoes in the words
and minds of Ron and others to this day.  Then and now
it was emotional manipulation/hogwash/propaganda.

The real justification for the creation of the
'Republic of Vietnam' is to be found in the agenda of
the foreign policy people of the US, who created
it,...in violation of the Geneva accords.  

It has been said that "the devil is in the details",
and that is clearly the case here.  The Geneva Accords
peace agreement was between the French and the Viet
Minh, and, as noted parenthetically in the copy cited
at the first link above:

(The Geneva Agreements theoretically ended the war
between French Union forces and the Vietminh in Laos,
Cambodia, and Vietnam. These states were to become
fully independent countries, with the last-named
partitioned near the 17th parallel into two states
pending reunification through "free elections" to be
held by July 20, 1956. The United States and Vietnam
are not signatories to these agreements.)

Note the last: "The United States and Vietnam are not
signatories to these agreements."

Neither the US nor the French-created Vietnamese Govt.
signed onto the agreement.  Thus by one arguable
interpretation, neither was bound by the agreement.  
I leave it to the judgement of reasonable people to
determine whether this was a 'valid loophole' or a
back door for international mass murderers. 

Ron continues:

> and in the treaty that the government of
> North Vietnam freely 
> agreed to giving South Vietnam separate existence.

Clearly this is incorrect.  A 'north' and 'south'
Vietnam cannot be made real or otherwise legitimized
by merely prepending these words to "Vietnam".  The
intent of the agreement was clearly for a
***temporary*** partition for the purpose of
disengaging the combatants, with reunification clearly
intended, stated, and scheduled, and to be effected by
the conduct of free elections.

Here Ron continues, but is merely carrying forward his
earlier mistake of accepting as legitimate that which
is not legitimate: a separate and sovereign "South
Vietnamese" govt.  This original error then corrupts
all that follows, giving us a cascade of nonsense..
 
> Then you continue in that vein ignoring
> treaty,

Look at the treaty.  Your interpretation of events
fails because you don't look at the treaty.  And
consequently you don't know what you're talking about.

Now lets deal with the use of the word "invade".  

I encountered it first from Chomsky, and I've never
been comfortable with it.  As, Ron points out it is
"loaded" as well as apparently factually unjustified.

But if you look at the peace agreement: the clearly
intended and specified temporary partition of the
country for the rational and pragmatic orderly
disengagement of the combatant parties, the plan for
free elections for the purpose of creating by
peaceful, lawful, and internationally-approved means a
single Vietnamese government legitimized by "the
consent of the governed", and at 
Chapter III of the peace agreement, CHAPTER III-BAN ON
INTRODUCTION OF FRESH TROOPS, MILITARY PERSONNEL, ARMS
AND MUNITIONS, MILITARY BASES, and compare these to
the actions taken by the US and its 'South' Vietnamese
puppet government, then the word "invade" begins to
look more and more applicable.  In the end, it is not
unreasonable to conclude that all the misinformation
(and here the term 'disinformation' could be used to
emphasize the intentionally deceptive nature of the
information) people had been fed had 'predeceived'
them.  It is on this basis alone, on the basis of an
entirely false--prefalsified and memetically
'installed'--view, that the term "invade" seems
inapplicable.  In light of the truth however, "invade"
seems parsimoniously precise.  But only in light of
the truth, which leaves us with the same problem we
started with, the unfamiliarity with or outright
refusal of the truth.

invade

1. To enter by force in order to conquer or pillage.
2. To encroach or intrude on; violate: "The principal
of the trusts could not be invaded without trustee
approval" (Barbara Goldsmith).
3. To overrun as if by invading; infest: "About 1917
the shipworm invaded the harbor of San Francisco"
(Rachel Carson).
4. To enter and permeate, especially harmfully.

First State Department foreign policy people went in,
then the cia went in, then the military equipment went
in, then the declaration of sovereignty, then the
signing of military alliance (SEATO), then the 
military 'advisors', then the war of the puppet govt
against its own people, then the foreign (US) troops
went in.  Every one of these acts an overt violation
of the peace agreement.  Then millions were killed. 
Sounds a whole lot like an invasion to me.

Folks get their panties in a twist about holocaust
deniers, even as they deny the holocausts they have
perpetrated.  Go figure.

Fifty-four years I been on this planet.  Fifty-four
years I've had to listen to lieing, thieving,
murdering scumbags, lie to me--after they've lied to
and deluded themselves--about how they're on the side
of the angels defending me against the (gay, black,
red, yellow, atheist, liberal, etc, your choice)
menace.  To the tune of millions dead.  As far back in
time as you want to go.  The responsible parties? 
Fudamentalists.  The ruling class.  Conservatives. 
Reptiles.  Cannibals.  Selfish, greedy, vicious
killers.  Your boys, Ron.  

The truth is always "loaded".

Palm Beach County, Florida, is the immediate link between the
hijackers and the anthrax. It's where almost half of them were
based at some point, and it was where the anthrax first showed up.
There were social links between hijackers and people associated
with the targeted newspaper. One of the hijackers was treated in
Fort Lauderdale for a skin lesion resembling cutaneous anthrax.

As for the Iraqi connection, the grounded plane south of Baghdad
where defectors say hijacking teams were trained is in the same
district (Salman Pak) as the former center of Iraqi bioweapons
research, to which anthrax was central. Saddam's son Qusay has
been said to be in charge both of WMD development/concealment
and terrorist liaison, so my guess is that the hard work of
preparing the 9/11+anthrax plot was done in facilities in Iraq
that are ultimately under his control (in Salman Pak, and
wherever the anthrax labs are based now).

Why Daschle and Leahy? Iraq might not have a particular grudge
against them, but Al Qaeda might, and Al Qaeda would have had
final control over target selection. Leahy heads the Senate
subcommittee in charge of aid to the Egyptian government, and
Al Qaeda is full of Egyptian Islamists who have been persecuted
by that government. Bin Laden's number two, Zawahiri, has said
that the overthrow of Mubarak is a central strategic aim. The
very date, September 11, is the pre-Islamic ("Coptic") Egyptian
new year, and therefore symbolic of Egyptian apostasy.

>bio-weapon, and not a serious threat.

It was serious enough to kill people just by being squeezed
out of a sealed envelope by a mail-sorting machine. If I'm right,
it's a mistake to view the letters as an attack. It was more of
a deterrent warning, like a nuclear test ("THIS IS NEXT"), with
Iraq being careful to supply Al Qaeda only with a demonstration
sample.

       I remember in the late 50s how the North agreed to the DMZ to put a

of Laos.  They didn't want anyone over there they would know what was going

       I lived through that "communist hysteria" and remember well that the

Continued....

At the point that the Allstate agent informed me of
her client's position that I was somehow at fault, her
entire position regarding compensation also changed. 
She still wanted me to get an estimate, but gone were
any offers of temporary transport, etc.

Since her position was that I might be partially at
fault, I contacted my insurance company to get their
reaction.  They maintained that I was not at fault at
all.  Of course it was also clear - which they and the
attorneys with whom I discussed the issues - verified
- that if I accepted ANY settlement money from
Allstate, then that would be equivalent to an
acceptance of the terms and conditions, implicitly
agreeing to Allstate's assessment of my joint
responsibility.  Naturally, Pacific Specialties - my
company - would be happy to deny any responsibility on
my part, as otherwise they would have to fork out for
the damage to the "sergeant's" RAM.

It was also clear that if Pacific Specialties refused
to pay, then I was next in line.  Since the Dodge RAM
was worth a lot more than my motorcycle, then I could
end up owing money to the "sergeant" for his
rear-ending me.

Ultimately, I got a copy of the CHP report, which
clearly and unequivacably listed the "sergeant" as
being at fault for driving at an unsafe speed for
conditions.  I'm sure that Allstate has a copy as
well.  However, I then received a letter from Allstate
informing me that after finally talking to the one
witness, they had determined that the accident was 50%
my responsibility.

So, at this point, I am still riding my wreck.  If I
even turn in an estimate to Allstate, I fear that this
may be taken as an agreement to their assessment.  I
spoke with a state insurance person who basically
verified my assessment of my predicament.  

Since the total damages to date on my side may be 
less than $5,000, that means that I am stuck with
Small Claims Court.  I.e., the only way an attorney
will represent me is if I pay them up front, which I'm
sure that Allstate fully grasps.  If I do go into
Small Claims Court, I will be trying to sue a likely
cop.  I haven't been able to contact the witness that
Allstate cites, and they aren't saying what he said to
them.

Of course, I don't know how much the bills for the
medical are at this point either.  My wrists are still
bothering me, as well, and I was unable to get the
therapy that my Blue Cross specialist recommended
because the travel distances were too great for the
wreck to reliably handle, and the strain of the ride
would probably offset any positive effects anyway.  If
I switch medical groups now, I might be able to get
therapy close to home.  Then the medical bills would
be a whole lot bigger, perhaps pushing the liability
into the regular court range.

Isn't the system wonderful?

Perhaps I'm being a little paranoid about dealing with
an apparent cop in court, but I recall when a lady
rear-ended my previous bike in San Francisco.  Her
insurance company fell all over itself to take care of
me, and I was careful to minimize the damage in
dealing with them.  If I had tried, I could have
gotten $10K.  I settled for $2k.

This time, seven years later, I am amazed at how
viciously Allstate is behaving.  Their agent makes no
pretense of hiding her hostility, now that they think
they have me under their thumb.  And the only ace they
have in their hole, as far as I can see, is the
official position of their client.

So far as I have ever been able to tell, "rational"
is to you an adjective describing people who subscribe
to your political ideology or who accede at once to
the truth as you present it.  Those who cannot see this
truth, well, you have other words for them.  People who
present inaccurate renditions of events are told to "shut
the fuck up".  It would be libelous of all leftists to
suppose that this is their general behavior---but
sometimes I have to wonder if there isn't a slight
correlation.

Yes, insofar as ideological "truths", e.g., whether the
U.S. invaded Vietnam or was invited into south Vietnam.

You knew that that wasn't right as you were writing it.
First, both parties may turn out to be deeply in error,
and second, good epistemology dictates that we always
hold the truth as conjectural, not *certain*.

Another person's *may* be the real thing, but only provisionally.

Exactly so.

and you have systematically deposited layer after layer
of filtered beliefs yourself decade after decade.  I do
understand and appreciate that you have changed your
mind on some things over the years, but it would be
pretty amazing if a deep psychological study revealed
you to be more open to unwelcome revelation than other
members of this list.

I'm about 10 days behind on this list, but my Mail.app search of the 
emails doesn't show any mention of this.  Upon inspection of the link, 
I'd be very, very surprised if this slipped under your collective 
radars.


(via BoingBoing.net)

  Building the transhumanist temple
Timeship: a grandiose project to build an extropian temple of 
life-preservation and transhumanism.
The design of the Timeship Building, a six-acre structure that will be 
the world's largest facility for life extension research and for the 
cryopreservation of DNA, biological tissues, and over 10,000 human 
patients, has been completed by architect Stephen Valentine with both 
its functional and its symbolic importance in mind.

We see the Timeship as the "Fort Knox" of biological materials. DNA, 
tissue samples and cryopreserved patients will be housed in Timeship, 
and their safety and security against all threats, both natural and 
human-made, will have to be maintained for hundreds of years. Timeship 
has been designed to provide that security at every level, from defense 
against terrorist attack, to sea level changes due to global warming, 
to interruption of energy supplies due to any catastrophe.

You write this in the spirit of "if only everyone would
just read those documents, then we'd all see nearly eye
to eye, and my truth would be clear to all".

persuade you of that.

You go on,

I doubt if you will be able to read that paragraph
without your own filters on, and of course you cannot
read it with anti-Communist filters on.  Those of us
who are anti-Communists understand what kind of elections
happen in countries without long traditions of democratic
government.  It's all about brutal power grabs, whether
by the left or the right.

That's right, but it's irrelevant.  In countries without
democratic traditions, a free press and other institutions,
the only choice is what kind of dictatorship it's to be.

Listen, a Communist takeover is no laughing matter,
Jeff, whether it's in East Germany, North Korea,
South Korea, Vietnam, China, Russia, Cambodia,
Cuba, or any of ten other nations I could name.
People go to the wall.  Lots of them.

Now then, it can be truthfully stated that takeovers
by *any* dictator, e.g. a right-wing one, are pretty
serious affairs too.  Indeed, all opposition leaders
are rounded up and imprisoned or shot.  But there is
a huge difference between the totalitarianism of the
left and the autocracy of the right, but it would
take a long time to explain to you why the concept
"totalitarian" exists.

> or a back door for international mass murderers. 

What are you thinking about here?  The U.S. or the
party it supported in Vietnam killing as many people
as the Communists did?   That didn't happen, as you
should know.

Until you can internalize what Communist regimes were really
like---thank goodness only two prominent ones remain)---you
will continue to be reality-challenged on these issues, Jeff.

Not that it needs my stamp of approval, but this is a Good Idea. Article
collections are the most popular sections of my web sites, and I think
they're a very good way of getting the message across to those people who
want to go further than sound bites and summaries.

I can't currently think of a good, accessible central repository of
transhumanist op-ed, essay and vision-statement writing from different

who do maintain very good repositories of tranhumanist material --
"accessible" in this case pretty much means this narrower content focus and
a single navigation tree of only one or two levels). So I think this would

The opposition candidates were 'supported' by the
Reagan/conservatives/US.  Just as the opposition
terrorist military force operating out of Honduras and
Costa Rica had been 'supported'.  So the 'free and
fair' electoral choice faced by "his citizenry" was
(1) an end to the war if they voted against Ortega, or
(2) more slaughter funded by the
Reagan/conservatives/US if they voted for him.  Some
choice.  Get real.

You mean by means of a broadly-supported popular (as
in "of the people") revolution, overthrew a
Reagan/conservatives/US supported, un-elected dictator
who received his military training in the US.  Get
real.

Baloney!  I challenge you to support the above
nonsense with anything not from the clown school of
jingoistic crapola.  You can't, because it ain't true.

The Contras killed between 10,000 and 30,000, 

(depending on the source cited:
http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat4.htm) 

mostly civilians. 

(You know, soft targets--but who can blame them? 
School teachers, health care workers, and agricultural
workers can be ambushed, tortured, raped, and killed
with a lot less inconvenience than soldiers.) 

Now if you take into consideration that the total
population of Nicaragua at the time was 3.2 million
(http://www.unchs.org/habrdd/conditions/centamerica/nicaragua.htm),
then the suffering inflicted on them by the
Reagan/conservative/US warmongers was between 292 and
876 "9/11 equivalents".

"9/11 equivalent" is my new unit of inflicted human
suffering.  On 9/11, 3000 Americans were killed out of
a total population of 280 million.  About one out of
every 100,000.  Americans--the people of the
non-Muslim world generally, but Americans in
particular-- consider this to have been a very bad
thing.  A definitively bad thing.  An acutely and
personally felt bad thing.  Perhaps even something
which we could use in future as a standard of human
suffering. 

On that basis 10-30,000 killed out of a total
population of 3.2 million--the death toll/suffering in
flicted on the Nicaraguan people by the
Reagan/conservatives/US--comes to between one out of
every 320 and one out of every 107 persons in the
country.  Per capita, that's between 282 and 876 times
the death toll/suffering inflicted on the US on 9/11.

By conservatives.  That's your boys, Ron.  "Have you
no shame, sir?"

Good post Avatar!

My own realization of many of your points made me into
a strong proponent of missile defense and openness.  The
doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction was predicated upon
the notion that the adversary that fired the missile had
something worth destroying.  Looks to me like anyone
can smuggle or bribe their way into Afganistan with an
ICBM and fire away without fear of retaliation.

Unless we can somehow rid this planet of all weapons of
mass destruction, we face mass destruction.  spike

Actually, a nearby supernova could cause a significant spike in
UV radiation (by causing a depletion of atmospheric ozone).  It
is currently thought these would have to be in the vicinity of 25-100
light years so they don't happen very often.  Its more than millions but
perhaps less than billions of years.

Considering entities such as saber toothed tigers and wooly mammoths
I'd say that the evolutionary time scale for the evolution in the
predator-prey relationship is of the order of thousands to millions
of years (not hundreds of millions).  However considering how close
the human and mouse genomes seem to be, there is a lot less selection
pressure on genes that are somewhat less critical to survival.

It could (cope with the damage) if the genomic program were designed for
it (as say the Deinococcus genome seems to be).  Bacterial cultures are
always subject to selection effects -- mutated genes and you are asta
la vista baby (sp?) [unless of course the environment has changed to
prefer those genes].

I would disagree with the statement that "most cells in the body can
be replenished by stem cells".  It is only those cells normally exposed
to wear and tear that have reasonable replication capabilities (skin, gut, to
a lesser extent endothelial cells, fibroblasts replacing damaged tissue, etc.)

While there is some evidence that some parts of the human body can
be re-invigorated by stem cells (bone marrow transplants being the
key example) the evidence for other tissues is much less clear.
I'd cite any major "mature" organ system (brain, kidney, heart, etc.)
These systems may not be structured such that stem cells can effectively
repair them.

This is a key point.  We have to get out of the framework of saying aging
is "this" or its "that".  Cells (and organisms) have a set of hazards
they have to deal with.  Genetic programs are designed to optimize the
survival chances of a cellular "collection".  (Or more importantly they are
designed to optimize the survival chances of copies of cellular collections).

A program that causes more cells to undergo apoptosis when detecting
multiple double strand breaks (the condition that seems to be true
in humans vs. mice) is helpful in preventing a single cell (and humans
have many more than mice) from killing the organism.  *But* unless you
complement it with a program that allows the continual renewal of tissues
with stem cells (that must have *very* good DNA repair) it is only
effective at preventing cancer and not at extending longevity (or the
production of copies of cellular collections).  So I think it is
critical to view all genomes as "under construction".

I may have missed this.  It would be nice to see some replicated work
in this area (there is a lot of rumor floating around in this area
and it would be nice to see us move into an environment where we can
at least all agree on the data).

I did post a very concrete reference a few months ago about how
high the mutation rate is in embryos.  All one can say about fetal cells
is that they work up until one harvests them.  That doesn't tell you
anything about whether "is this a 'perfect' genome" or not.  It depends
entirely on what fraction of the genome is essential prior to the "harvesting"
vs. what fraction of the genome is essential after the "harvesting".

Actually, it is unclear to me that "fetal cells should not have DNA mutations".
I would agree that it seems less likely that they should have mutations than
an average adult cell.  But to answer this with certainty we would need to
know the DNA repair gene expression profiles, DNA copying error rates, etc.
for the "average" fetal cell and the "adult" cells from which cloning
statistics might be derived.

I'll cut short this message here.  I may review and comment on some of the
additional comments at a later date.

It is, as always, a stimulating discussion given my interests.
Robert

I can't take any of you guys to one of my neighborhood
block parties.  My area is full of Vietnamese, many of
whom fled the communists and many who lost it all or had
family members slain by communists.  There are those who
risked it all to get on a riverboat and put out to sea to
escape Vietnam.

If anyone even mentions the word communist at one of those
parties, they soon start telling their stories.  The result
is bone chilling, scary.  They mean it.  Listening to them
gave me a whole new view of the Vietnam war.  spike

Lee, I am not under any illusion that John or Ron or
you will alter your "deep ideological" convictions. 
That will not happen because you suffer from American
holocaust denier's disease.  I offer it up because The
Truth is out there, and here it is.  Look at it.  Know
that others see it and understand it for The Truth
that it is.  And that even though the guilty may cover
their eyes, those same murderers and their brainwashed
supporters can nevertheless been seen for what they
are: the agents of a continuing 'conservative'
holocaust.

Talk about your filters, Lee.  This is very thin.  The
brutal power grab and murderous holocaust that
followed were inflicted by the country with the long
self-congratulatory tradition of 'democratic'
government.  

The Viet-minh could have taken the whole country then
and there.  The French were beaten.  It was they who
sued for peace.  They who were desperate for a
face-saving way out.  Then the Russians and the
Chineses persuaded Ho to settle on the terms offered. 
Terms which were unilaterally violated, not by Ho and
his people, but by the conservative power elite of the
country with the long self-congratulatory tradition of
'democratic' government.  

Time to get real, Lee.  Anti-communism in its
fudamentalist forms is a sickness, a pathology of
ruthlessness as monstrous (more monstrous if you
consider the record of crimes committed) than the
worst that socialist totalitarianism could ever offer
up.

This is justification at its most forced and absurd. 
They couldn't be allowed to vote--to choose for
themselves--because they wouldn't choose correctly. 
Oy!  That's not the way it works.  You vote, you
choose, freely, and then you live with the result,
good or bad.

But this rebuttal, and your objection are misguided. 
The unhappy circumstances of a people ruled by
communism is not the reason the Conservatives/power
elite initiated that war.  "Saving/rescuing the
Vietnamese people from the 'horrors' of communism was
the ideological jerk-around offered up to the American
population so that the Conservatives/power elite could
pursue their own goals for their own purposes.

If this discussion were face to face, you would not
have gotten this far.  I would not have let you
embarrass yourself.  This anti-communist dogma is a
sickness used to justify mass murder.  It is the
madness of killing someone in order to 'save' them. 
It is as ridiculous as anything the Taliban or Thuggee
could come up with.

Try freedom instead.  Let people make their choices
and live with their mistakes.

I disagree.  And not respecfully.  You've had a
lifetime as long as mine to get at The Truth.  You've
been shown where to find it.  Yet you still deny the
holocaust.  Why should you be respected any more than
those other holocaust deniers?  Read the documents,
Lee.

'Better dead than red" says it all.  Kill the patient
to cure the disease.  This is NOT rationality.

Read the documents.

Best, Jeff Davis

Lee,

Two and two is four.  The holocaust either did or did
not happen.  There is truth.  All the sophistry in the
world can't change that. Get over it.

You're wrong, and now you trying to hide from it.  Get
over that, too.

Solve your own problems.  I've helped you enough. 
Stop wasting my time.

In my annoyance, I told John Clark to "shut the fuck
up".  I was wrong.  I apologize.  Now get over that as
well.

I would ask anyone with magazines, books, papers, videos, tapes or any other form of media on the subjects of cryonics and transhumanism to please consider bringing them to the Cryofeast to be held in Mayer, Arizona at the Creekside Preserve Lodge.  The owner, David Pizer(former Vice President of Alcor), is building up a cryonics/transhumanism archive and so we would welcome any new contributions.    

thank you,

John Grigg

Jeff,
       He is talking about those conservatives in formerly communist 
countries that can't give up communism.  You should know by now that we did 
not conquer the soviet.  They fell of their on weight due to the sickness 
inherent in their inept and brutal philosophy.

Jeff,
       First you complain that we can't have a rational discussion, then you

       If you stop the personal attacks and stick to a version of history 
close to what those of us that lived through those times witnessed we can 
discuss rationally enough.

(Taken from a Cryonet post by David Pizer)
A few notes on the CryoFeast coming Sunday, Dec 15th at the Creekside Preserve Lodge in Mayer, Arizona.

1.    We now have several people who are bringing deserts.  We can use something in the other fields below;
    Salads,  cold veggies
    Bread - rolls, bagels, 
    Side dishes (potatoes, beans, hot veggies) 
    Beverages (pop, juice)
    
2.    Drop me a line ( pizer@cox.net ) and let me know what you are bringing, so I can coordinate.

3.    Even if you are too rushed to bring anything, that's ok, but drop me a line and let me know how many in your party so I can get an approximate count and know what to supply and for how many.

4.    Also, if you think you *might* want a room Friday or Saturday night, or Sunday night, let me know.   

5.    If you play an instrument - bring it along.  

6.    If you don't have transportation, call John for the shuttle schedule - they will drop you off at our parking lot and pick you up the next day or so?  I don't know how they run on weekends, call John and he will give you the numbers of the shuttles that go from Prescott to Phoenix and back.  John is at the Creekside  928  632-0777

7.    If you need a ride and can't make the  shuttle, email me and I will try to find you a ride with someone who is driving up.


For those who come up Saturday evening, we can decorate the lodge Great Room and the Cryomas Tree and if it is not too cold we can have a bon fire at the fire pit area.  Bring your jacket and scarf just in case.

Don't be shy if you have never been to a cryofeast, they are a social gathering just like going home for the holidays.  

You don't have to live in Arizona to attend.   

Look forward to seeing old friends and making new ones.

David, Trudy and John.

Spike,
       You are right on the spot.  One of the things I did in my life was to 
teach Vietnamese our language.  For another I live surrounded by ex Soviet 
citizens.  
       I feel sorry for those folks.  The marks that have been left on their 
souls by those regimes will mark the people for life.  On the other hand it 
is wonderful to watch their children raised out from under the communists as 
they grow into adults.

I don't really think so, Mill died in 1873. However in Mill's day the words
"liberal" and "conservative" had almost exactly opposite meaning they do
today. Back then a liberal was somebody eager to try new ideas and was in
favor of more personal freedom, a conservative believed in the divine right
of kings.

The lady three doors down escaped by bribing her way
out of Vietnam.  She came to America as a teenager with
no knowledge of English.  Now she teaches math at the
local community college.

My coworker's wife was rescued nearly dead at sea after
having gone 5 days without food.  She was 17 at the time.
Today she is a controls engineer at Lockheeed.

One neighbor has a lot of animosity toward another.
I asked why and someone who said her family
had collaborated with the French.  I dont know
why that is bad, but several of the neighbors
have a tude about it.

It was after I learned this that I suggested
a few months ago that perhaps the way to peace
was to forget all political history, forget it
all, dont teach it.  Several including Greg Burch
convinced me of the folly of that suggestion,
but it does seem tempting at times.

My comment about not being able to take the
extropians to one of the block parties was
my way of saying I didnt know if I could trust
us to not speak, only listen to their stories.

Get real.  Mysterious insider information not shared with the 
people when the people are expected to fund the escapade to the 
tune of hundreds of billions and 250,000 troops?  Even if your 
information was credible this would be soundly against any sane 
free country model.  As it is, the investigations showed pretty 
conclusively this was US military lab made Anthrax.  There is no 
connection to Iraq here whatsoever.  And, as others have 
mentioned, Anthrax is a pretty ineffective bio-weapon.  It

To John Clark and the list:

In my contribution to the Noam Chomsky and Cambodia
thread, I got worked up and called John Clark a
"misogynist flake".  This was very bad behavior on my
part.  Uncalled for, and I regret it, and I apologize
for it.  

Most of all it was unfounded, is unfounded.  I need to
make that clear.  My mistake completely.  Sorry, John.
 In the heat of the moment, got you confused with
someone else.  Totally my bad.

Best of the holiday season to all.

Jeff Davis

Hi-Tech vs. Low-Tech Threats
============================
[Politics] Found by: maxm
http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/defensewrapper.jsp?PID=1051-350&CID=1051-121202A

The Bush Administration has repeatedly raised the specter of evildoers 
armed with exotic weapons - from Al-Qaeda's "dirty bombs" to Saddam's 
biotoxin-spraying unmanned planes. But the recent attacks in Kenya 
underscore a simple truth, defense experts say: terrorists hardly ever 
use high-tech gadgetry. Instead, they rely on low- or no-tech methods to 
help pull off their missions.

Especially interresting in the light of this paper by Nick Bostrom on 
"Existential Risks".

Fish's re-grown heart gives hope for humans
===========================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993178

A brightly-coloured fish used for studying the function of human genes 
can completely re-grow its heart tissue after major injury, a US team 
has discovered. This remarkable finding could lead to human cures for 
the damage caused by heart attack or heart disease.



Herbicide fights malaria in people
==================================
[Health] Found by: maxm
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993179

The first human trial of a herbicide that can kill the malaria parasite 
has been successful, a German team reports. The drug cleared the 
parasite from 23 sufferers in Gabon, Africa, in an average of 48 hours 
and caused only mild side effects.



Progress in Multiple Telomerase-Based Cancer Therapies
======================================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.lef.org/news/disease/2002/12/11/bw/0000-0526-ca-geron.html

Geron Corporation reported positive data from its telomerase-based 
cancer treatment programs at three scientific meetings in early December.

The key developments presented at the meetings show progress on the 
development of GRN163, a potent and specific telomerase inhibitor, and 
on Geron's in vivo therapeutic vaccine and oncolytic virus.



Researchers Discover Gene that Controls Learned Fear
====================================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.hhmi.org/news/kandel3.html

Researchers have discovered the first genetic component of a biochemical 
pathway in the brain that governs the indelible imprinting of 
fear-related experiences in memory.



Observing proteins and cells in the wild
========================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-12/ru-opa121202.php

Imagine if molecular and cell biologists could watch proteins and cells 
at work in their natural habitat in the same way that wildlife 
biologists observe animals in the wild. They'd sit back and witness 
first hand their microscopic subjects' daily routines, interactions and 
movements, and the places they prefer to be.

Exoskeletons that amplify physical ability could be available within a 
decade, thanks largely to work by the the US military.



Transhumanist Association to Transcend Financial Woes in New Year
=================================================================
[Transhumanism] Found by: maxm
http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2002-12-12-3

The World Transhumanist Association has been promised regular funding 
from a UK charity, putting the organization in the new position of

Tim O'Reilly - The continuing controversy over online file sharing 
sparks me to offer a few thoughts as an author and publisher. To be 
sure, I write and publish neither movies nor music, but books. But I 
think that some of the lessons of my experience still apply.

Some 100 tons of spores clandestinely dusting a sleeping large city under
optimal conditions could kill a bignum of people.

Forgive my ignorance if I am displaying some here but...

I sometimes see messages on the board that I do not see on the mailing list.
I sometimes send messages to the mailing list, only to never receive them,
but see them posted to the board.  And other times I will not receive my own
sent messages until well after other people have responded to them.  Does
anyone else have problems similar to this, and if not, what might I be doing
wrong?

Thanks All

Michael

I noticed this showed up on the BBS, but not the mailing list.  Since I saw
no replies to it's points, and they seemed to be good ones, I thought I
would make sure it had shown up on the mailing list for those that do not
check both.

   -----------------

I must take some issues with your interpretations of the 1954 Geneva
Accords. For starters, I cannot see how anyone can rationally argue that the
government of South Vietnam (already recognized by 30 nations and up for UN
membership at the time of the conference) should have submitted to an
election to unify the country with the North when one considers that
population alone would've guaranteed the Communists victory. With a
population of 17 million to the South's 13 million, the Communists simply
could've herded more unwilling participants to the voting booth to insure
victory. Forgive my skepticism regarding the North's intentions, but perhaps
you could provide an example of a fair and honest Communist election?

Another problem I have is your contention that the United States 'sabotaged'
the Geneva Accords. Given that the Accords were nothing more than a victory
lap for the Soviet/Chinese proxy communist entity of the North, it is not
surprising that neither the U.S. or South Vietnam ratified them. As I've
noted, the Republic of Vietnam was already recognized by 30 countries and up
for UN membership, so that in my mind gives them the right to determine
their own political future. You are strangely silent, however, on the
blatant violations of these 'sacrosanct' agreements by the North Vietnamese.
One of the few provisions agreed to by all parties in the Geneva Accords was
the assured neutrality of Cambodia and Laos. This neutrality was respected
by the United States and South Vietnam, but was constantly trampled on by
the North Vietnamese. Worse yet, as illustrated by David Chandler and
others, the North Vietnamese created the rebel entity known as the Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia that would eventually lay waste to that nation. 

You also suggest that somehow the United States was responsible for making
the lives of the Vietnamese people miserable, thus somehow undermining the
legitimacy/authority of the North. The US was not the one behind Ho Chi
Minh's class driven 'land reforms' of the mid 50's that led to the deaths of
30,000 Vietnamese peasants. Additionally, is it not more realistic to assume
that the persecution of religion by the Communist North was responsible for
the mass exodus of 100,000 northerners to the South during the 300 day
period of 1956, rather than some mass CIA plot? For comparison, one only
need look at similar migrations from Hungary, Poland, and East Germany
(where 3 million out of a population of 18 million fled before a certain
Wall was built to keep the rest in.)

I must also take issue with the way you cavalierly dismiss the role of the
Communist Chinese in the success and ability of the North Vietnamese to wage
war. Mao's aid was essentially in the development of logistics, and supply
of men and materiel. It would've been impossible for Ho Chi Minh to achieve
victory at Dien Bien Phu without the Chinese.  The French severely
underestimated the VietMinh's capability, specifically because they weren't
aware of the supplies provided by the Chinese. 

The reason the United States intervened in Vietnam is obvious. To prevent
the spread of communism. Considering the horrors that befell the peoples of
Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam following the short-sighted extrication of
the US from Indochina in 1975 by the US Congress, I would think the nobility
of the cause should be obvious too. No one is suggesting that the regime of
Ngo Dinh Diem in the South was perfect. It wasn't, it was an authoritarian
regime ripe with nepotism. But is was no worse than the regime of South
Korea's Syngman Rhee in 1950 that the US saved from a communist invasion.
Compare the South Korea of today with its' Northern communist neighbor. I
cannot believe anyone could argue with a straight face that the quality of
life is better in the communist North than in the democratic South.

Such an emotionally charged event as the holocaust is a poor thing to 
pin this discussion on, but:
Umnh... remember that language is inherrently ambiguous.  Something 
happened.  Some people call what happened "the holocaust".  Other 
people, perhaps having a slightly different definition of the word, may 
not agree that the term applies (originally, I believe, that it meant 
that instead of holding a barbeque, the entire goat/bull/whatever was 
destroyed by the flames of the altar, i.e., instead of just giving the 
blood to the flames, the whole thing was burnt [cf. hologram]).  So it 
is not necessarily an argument over facts (though, of course, it 
frequently is:  "holocaust deniers" generally means people who don't 
accept the movies coming from the concentration camps as valid, a clear 
dispute over facts).

Still, there's a big difference between "I read in the paper today 
that...", or even "Today the president said..." and actuality.  One is 
history, the other is fact.  I've seen things with my own eyes that, on 
closer examination, weren't really there.  It's one thing to assert "The 
truth is out there!" and another to assert that we can both know it, and

Sorry, but here I remember that Pot Pol was officially a "socialist 
totalitarian".  I may not believe that they actually were socialist, but 
they did bear the label.  And noone that I consider a true socialist 
would be in favor of any totalitarian government, so for the only 
meaning of "totalitarian socialist" that I can envision, they qualify.  
And they were much worse than Stalin, on a percentage basis.  I heard, 
but still don't believe, that the Pot Pol routinely killed about 90% of 
the people living in the areas that they conquerored.  Nobody elsewhere 
that I am familiar with since the Mongols has been quite that devastating.

This is a difficult one.  Internal freedom in a weak country surrounded 
(well, boardered) by a powerful advocate of one system, who, as it 
happens, are also your traditional enemies.  Aieee!  I can't see the 
election as having been free without considerable promisses dependably 
made by outside guarantors.  Whee!  And they'd just kicked out the 
French, the Germans had just been beaten in war, ditto for Japan (even 
if there were considered less of a problem...they weren't).

That election couldn't have been free.  No way!  But it could have been 
a lot better than what developed.  If the US had guaranteed to stand 
behind the victor (assuming that their poll watchers validated the 
election), then it would have had a chance.  Instead we refused to allow 
it, because everyone knew that Ho Chi Minh would have won any fair 
election.  And, though he was quite willing to ally with the US (see 
above for reasons), the US wasn't willing to have a communist ally.  
(That's the same attitude that later drove Castro into the Russian 
camp.)  If they had been allies, the US could, had it choosen, 
ameliorated the worst of the excesses.  Well, that's assuming that those 
were the real goals of the US govt.  I haven't seen any convincing 
evidence that those were the purposes of the US govt. even then, when we 
were newly come to "MAJOR POWER" status.  Since then, of course, the 
purposes of those in power have either become more obvious, or even more 
corrupt.

This was the habit of military conquerors as far back as Alexander.  
Sometimes they supported the prior government, if they were certain that 
they could control them as satraps, but more often they just killed 
them, to avoid loyalist insurrections.  Still, there's a big difference 
between killing the leaders and killing a major fraction of the populace.

Totalitarianism is totalitarianism.  Once you get a totalitarian state, 
any philosophical justifications are quickly dropped.  "The goal of 
power is power."  I don't remember who I'm quoting, but it seems apt.

He may be remembering some reports of Pot Pol.  If so, then he's not 
exaggerating at all.  He may be understating his case.  But projecting 
the atrocities of Pot Pol onto any other government is like suggesting 
that all elected governments are like the Nazi's.  Yes, the Nazis won a 
reasonably fair election (fairer than the most recent US one).  But that 
doesn't make all elected governments mass murderers.

While John Stuart Mill is correct, it's useful to consider the reasons 
why this might be their most reasonable course of action.

It sounds as if we lived through the same period, and had access to the 
same sources of information.  Given that, I feel that my interpretations 
agree better with what I believed was happening.  It's true that part of 
the time my news sources were controlled by the military (my father was 
stationed in Japan, and only the military broadcast in English), but I 
doubt that they would have seriously corrupted my understanding in a 
pro-communist direction.

It is, however, true that my actual knowledge of the history of VietNam 
is reconstructed.  I don't really remember the current news from the 
mid-fifties, except for particularly impressive events.  So I didn't 
start hearing about the history of VietNam in current time until Kennedy 
was president.  But no one that I encountered at the time could give a 
coherrent history justifying the actions of the US, so I suspect that 
even the adults of the time hadn't been following closely.  I did hear 
both pro- and anti- VietNam speakers (using several different meanings 
of the term), but nobody could satisfactorially explain to me why we 
were even involved.  The closest was a speaker (Kissinger?  Dulles?)  
who used two justifications.  1) It is our duty to contain communism.  
And 2) Our honor is at stake. 

These may actually have been one combined reason, I was never quite 
clear on either.  If he had said that people have a right to be allowed 
to choose their own government, it would have made sense.  It was only 
later that I understood why he didn't mention that (it was used as a 
justification in many other interventions).  If he had said that we 
needed to honor treaties that we had agreed to... well, I'd just been 
reading some of the history of our government and the Indians, so I 
don't know how I would have reacted.  But it also later became clear why 
he didn't mention that, despite the unfortunate weight that the 
constitution puts on that (treaties [to me is seems that if treaties are 
to be allowed to overrule other parts of the constitution, then they 
need to go through the same ammendment process as any other ammendment, 
but this isn't clearly spelled out, so it's been ignored]).

As to the rest... I suppose that I am tempermentally an isolationist, 
though I do understand the fallacies inherrent in that approach.

Isn't that what the mean?   (In essence, I mean.  A liberal is someone 
eager to try new ideas, and a conservative is someone who wished to 
stick with the ideas that he already "knows how they work".)   That's 
the way I always interpret them.  (Perhaps this is a part of why I feel 
the new is lying so often.)

As some of you know, I think I made the point at Extro 3
so very long ago (5 years now), that the long term survival
of any intelligence was limited by its hazard function.
And further, that the only "being" that could minimize its
hazard function was a "distributed, replicated intelligence".
(As much as Damien might like to maintain "there can be only
one", it just doesn't work in the long run.  You have to
be distributed in space to avoid point source failures.
Interestingly this may mean there is a tradeoff in longevity
vs. intelligence.)

Some numbers from the a recent New Scientist article:
"Counting the number of asteroids we see in the sky suggests
that over the past 250 million years, Earth should have been
hit around 440 times by asteroids larger than one kilometre
across."

http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993171

That (potentially) is our hazard function.  (As I mentioned
in a previous post supernovas should not be ignored as well,
though they may be less frequent.)

Now, to be realistic, the short term hazard function is much
higher.  Be it risks from bioterrorists or for example John Grigg
crawling around in canyons in Arizona.  But I do not believe that the
average person on the extropian list really thinks they might
live even one million years and "walks the talk".  (Being realistic
at current accident rates, ones non-aging lifespan is probably
limited to a few thousand years.)

So the question(s) in my mind become should we fix this and how
do we do so?  (Or do we punt and say the "singularity" will take
care of everything?).

Robert

Yes, but that's missing the point of a bioweapon.  A good bioweapon is 
difficult, but not impossible to cure.  At least difficult to prevent.  
Asymptomatic until after the infectious cycle is well under way.  And 
slowly fatal, with the first step being the degradation of the decision 
making process.  (Sort of like a combination of cocaine addiction and aids.)

P.S.:  Note that hiv is not, itself, fatal.  It depends on a weakened 
immune system to create the horrific effects.  If it were more 
contagious (say, also by coughing or sneezing), and a bit faster, it 
would be a nearly ideal...

Well, anthrax doesn't come close!  (Smallpox, now, that has 
possibilities.)  I did hear a report that Iraq had been working on a 
camelpox weapon, since many Iraqui already have immunity.  (O, yes, an 
ideal bio-weapon should be one that you are immune to, but which you 
enemy isn't, and can't easily come, immune to.)

Extropes,
Because I think it eloquently explains how US Americans think about
ourselves and others, I'm posting the lyrics of a Saturday morning
educational song for US kids. It was played a lot during commercials
in between cartoons that I watched in elementary school.

The song is called "No More Kings" and is performed by a music
group called (appropriately) SchoolHouse Rock.

You can buy it at www.amazon.com at:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DGSW/qid=1039799312/sr=2-1/ref=
sr_2_1/104-2225461-9151116 or download it with WinMX at www.winmx.com.

                                          - Bill.

P.S. I do not intend to argue about whether the views expressed in
the song  are accurate or anything else.  I am just interested in
aiding understanding of the US to anyone on this list who is interested.

Rockin' and a-rollin', splishin' and a-splashin'
Over the horizon, what could it be?
The pilgrims sailed the sea to find
A place to call their own.
In their ship Mayflower they hoped
To find a better home.
They finally knocked on Plymouth Rock
And someone said, "We're there,
It may not look like home,
But at this point I don't care."
Oh they were missing Mother England
They swore their loyalty until the very end.
"Anything you say king, it's OK king,
You know it's kind of scary on your own.
Gonna build a new land the way we planned
Could you help us run it till it's grown?"

They planted corn you know,
they built their houses one by one.
And bit by bit they worked
until the colonies were done.
They looked around, yeah, up and down,
and someone said, "Hurray!"
If the king could only see us now,
he would be proud of us today.
They knew that now they'd run
their own land,
But George III still vowed
he'd rule them till the end.
"Anything I say, do it my way now,
Anything I say do it my way.
Don't you get to feeling independent,
Cause I'm gonna force you to obey.

He taxed their property,
he didn't give them any choice.
And back in England,
he didn't give them any voice.
That's called taxation without representation,
and it's not fair.
But when the colonies complained,
the king said, "I don't care."

He even has the nerve to tax our cup of tea
To put it kindly king, we really don't agree
We're gonna show you how we feel,
we're gonna dump this tea
And turn this harbor into the
biggest cup of tea in history.

They wanted no more Mother England,
They knew the time had come
for them to take command.
"It's very clear you're being unfair, king,
no matter what you say we won't obey.
Gonna hold a revolution now, king,
and we're gonna run it all our way."

With no more kings
We're gonna elect a president
No more kings
He's gonna do what the people want
No more kings
We're gonna run things our way
No more kings
No one's gonna tell us what to do
No more kings

Rockin' and a-rollin',
splishin' and a-splashin'
over the horizon what could it be?
Looks like it's going to be a free country.

Whoa, not so fast, bucko. Assuming I'm the Damien in question, all I've ever
said is that personal identity is more or less continuous and bounded. We
each have/am an `I' that isn't a unitary identity atom (like a medieval
angel) but a composite construct in ceaseless dancing action--so in a sense
we're *already* distributed. Once you can add external modules to provide
redundant backup in light-speed-realtime two-way contact with your basic
identity-node, all's well for the extended being, more or less. The self
might lose some memories when the Centaurian Ugh take out a node or two with
a relativistic bomb, but then memory is always volatile.

>From the point of view of the *rest* of the universe, of course, nobody
cares which instantiation of Robert lives or dies; we're just happy to see
the emails rolling in. It's like a flaming brand in a dark cave; the more
torches you can fire up some , the less chance all of them will be blown out
at once. The flame is distributed and replicated. But then, the dance of the
flame has no inner life. It doesn't *care* if any particular torch goes out.
*We* would, from the inside here, if we were conscious flames; we'd resent
it bitterly, in our last dying moments.

But if all we're after is any Robert the rest of the world can relate to, we
can *do* that. We have the technology. Well, eventually.

Nah, I think we're all safe from the John Grigg short term hazard function.

charleshixsn@earthlink.net writes: And noone that I consider a true socialist 
would be in favor of any totalitarian government, 

Charles,
       I compare socialism to a river.  It starts somewhere and it moves.  
Eventually it empties itself into a river, a lake or an ocean.  
       If you look at the book Heaven on Earth you can witness a 200 year 
history of socialism.  Your movement has had several hundred socialist 
communities and several dozen socialist countries.  There is enough history 
for us to form some general rules.
       One of those rules is that you seem to normally start with bright 
hopes and often with good intentions insofar as an outsider can judge.  
However in every case that I know of the socialist community or nation 
matures into increasing difficulties brought by what many believe is its own 
ineptitude founded in its basic theory.
       Sometimes you turn to dictatorship under one guise or another.  The 
dictators either turn more and more brutal or they are forcefully removed 
from office.  Once in a long while one is voted out of office as Daniel 
Ortega was -- those countries seem to be the lucky ones.
       Sometimes you seem to gradually fade into poverty and from there you 
disband.  I suppose those are lucky also.
       But no where do I know of a socialist government that has matured and 
still maintained a high standard of living for its people.  Here in Chicago 
it is no problem at all to find Swedes that have voted with their feet.  If 
one has the time the ex-Swedes will relate the evils of Sweden.  I can and 
have gone over the border to Canada -- while there I have watched and 
listened.  On the surface it is a beautiful country with a beautiful people 
but as I plumb beneath the surface there is no way I can live there.  And so 
it goes, on and on.
       The problem with the concept "true socialist" is that there is no true 
socialist.  You are people that have stepped into a river, you have entered 
the flow and try as faithfully as you can, eventually you have to adapt to 
the forces of the river.
       This brings me to my greatest fear concerning socialism.  
       In HS I was an amateur boxer, later I was in the military.  Those two 
professions or pursuits contain a very high percentage of people that are 
devoted students of their vocation -- there are others.  I have enjoyed 
listening to those people analysing their craft.  They really dig in to learn 
and to learn their weaknesses as well as how to eliminate their weaknesses.
       Yet, this is something I never hear the socialists do.  They seem 
always to start with the presumption that they know how to build Heaven on 
Earth.  But, an analysis of their 200 year history, their several hundred 
socialist communities and their several dozen socialist nations demonstrates 
that they don't know.

The main opposition to genetically modified food comes from the Greens,
people who call themselves liberal. School vouchers are a new thing to try
but it's opposed by liberals and endorsed by conservatives. Lowering taxes
would give individuals more freedom by letting people use more of their
money as they see fit but today's liberals don't want to hear anything about
it. I wouldn't be insulted if you called me a liberal, in the 19'th century
sense that is.

Not surprised, if it were truly new, it would've hit your radars far 
before mine.  :)

My roommate actually found it before I did and asked if I'd heard about 
"some extropian/transhumanist building for cryonics?" -- and I 
immediately thought of John Grigg and the Creekside Preserve... so I 
was surprised when it turned out to be something different.

Dear fellow Extropians,

What is the point of extending life or even eradicating death, if all you 
going to do with these opportunies is bring along the same old negative 
baggage that you had before. 

By this I mean, rudeness, intolerance, censorship, bickering, violence and 
exclusivity?

Just some thoughts, thank you,

Those are some of the most fun things in life, in the proper context
(for example, consensual violence, voluntary censorship, non-violent
intolerance, etc.)

What's the point of life at all if not to experience /everything/ in
it and not just some watered-down children's-book fantasy of
sweetness and light?

While I was in crunch mode this week, analyzing Earth rocket booster slag
particles and natural micrometeoroid debris for an ESA-related project,
a rocket exploded.

This is a rather special rocket -

Wednesday, December 11, 2002
http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/space/12/11/ariane.rocket.reut/

"The explosion was the fourth failure of an
Ariane-5 rocket in its 14-mission history.
The failure could halt Ariane-5 flights for
an indefinite period. "

This is Bad Bad Bad news  !!!

The Ariane 5 is supposed to carry the Rosetta spacecraft to be
launched *mid January*. There is only a two week window for that launch,
for the spacecraft to make its intended target (comet- landing,
orbit.....)

Now those plans are up in the air. (There is a dust instrument
and an infrared instrument and many more. I think every European
planetary scientist and many many U.S. planetary scientists has been
involved to some amount with Rosetta during the last 10-15 years in
this Rosetta mission. This is a major effort in the worldwide
planetary science community.)

Other Ariane explosions:

June 4, 1996 Ariane 5 destruction (first flight, carrying Cluster)
http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9606/04/rocket.explode/
(other Ariane failures have occured after this one)

Anava 000 quoth:

Dear fellow Extropians,

What is the point of extending life or even eradicating death, if all you
going to do with these opportunies is bring along the same old negative
baggage that you had before.

By this I mean, rudeness, intolerance, censorship, bickering, violence and
exclusivity?

### This is a profound and subtle point.  Unfortunately, the persons who
don't get it are generally very confident in their ignorance while exulting
in the illusion of their "freedom and individuality".

I wish I had time to do a write-up on the related concept of "victimless
crime".

You don't have to have a point in being immortal (apart from making a
point by being immortal). But yes, I agree. It's best to do it in style.

Immortal implies posthuman. Soon, at least. So, I don't think you'll have 
to worry. We might be monsters; but at least we'd be monsters way beyond 
of what mere humans can grasp.

Damien, you can assemble the words with much more flourish than I
(sometimes I wish you would just "stick to the facts").  But at
any rate if one is distributed over a large enough distance the
concept of "continuous and bounded" starts to become a bit iffy.
How often does you left hand not know what your right hand is doing?

Yes, but not sufficiently so to avoid point-source failures

Agreed.

Oh, now you are going all romantic on me.  If Damien is distributed across
the entire solar system such that it takes him an hour to respond to my
communications, then I'm probably getting much better response time than
the current ExI list.  Now, if on the other hand there are multiple copies
of Damien distributed all around the solar system then it gets pretty
interesting when I get a dozen replies over a couple of days with similar
but somewhat different contents.  It raises an interesting question (perhaps
similar to what may go on in our minds currently) of who gets to be the
"Speaker" for Damien.  What part of your brain gets to control the words
that you speak (or type???).

This may be the fundamental point where you and I differ in our opinions.
(Which is what gives rise to the opportunity for provocative discussion.)

Agreed.  But it will require uploading and mind "dispersal".  Some people
may not wish to go through that process (esp. if it makes one less intelligent
as I have suggested).  It raises some interesting questions of how good
ones "intelligence" is that one could remain "concentrated" for much of
the time but then disperse when the hazard function increases.  It raises
the question of whether mind "dispersal" could place a fundamental limit
on longevity because you would reduce your intelligence below that necessary
to predict ones hazard function with sufficient reliability.

I think this is a novel concept as I haven't encountered it in any of
the aging/longevity literature previously.  It raises an interesting question,
"How smart do you have to be to live forever?"  (within the bounds allowed
by the structure of the universe).

Less so than you might think.  I've got pictures upstairs that John sent
me of him hiking around in the Grand Canyon.  (Many many years ago in my
teenage days I hiked across the Grand Canyon, so I'm familiar with the
trek.)  One has to ask given the "vitality" of extropians, what is the
probability that they might get together and go on such a hiking trip,
then what is the probability that someone might slip and fall and end
up possibly on top of oneself (causing some injury), then the probability
of being rescued from such a remote location in time to receive proper
medical attention?

In a non-uploaded, non-distributed state I think our odds at more
than a few thousand years are quite grim (unless we develop the
technologies to deal with this).  I do not think there are many
people thinking about these problems at this time so the prospects
do not seem good to me at this time.

Oh, oh.  I used those words recently, and I want to make certain they're not
misunderstood.  "Victimless crime" in my post was tied to "profanity" - and
why profanity is a "victimless" crime is that there is no Big Spook ("BS")
up in the sky who may be offended if one of his imperfect, mortal
made-in-his-image lackeys down on planet Earth dare use BS's name in vain
(for which act they are certain to be severely punished for eternity).
That's why - though I rarely use "emoticons" - I put the little  ;-) symbol
at the end.  I supposed - maybe mistakenly - that nontheists on this list
may have heard that phrase ("victimless crime") before.

While gods don't exist, people do.  So, by definition, people cannot be
"victimless" of a crime committed against them.

Hope that clears it up.

### There's nothing at all wrong with those activities if they're considered
recreational and in the proper context as you say.  They are undeniably part
of our human nature.

On the other hand, I think that many of us find that sort of acvtivity
increasingly unfullfilling, typically after indulging it in our earlier
(more "childish") years.  After a while, we begin to feel that "the point of
life" has more to do with growth.

"Watered-down", and "sweetness & light" are straw men that no one was
suggesting.

There are many examples of "victimless crimes" and on a strongly libertarian
list one can expect a strong defense of such.

Profanity in itself can be useful for clearly expressing certain feelings.
And as Olga pointed, very few of us on this list are likely to think there's
a god who can be offended by our choice of words.

As I tell my kids, it's not the words that are bad, but the attitude behind
them can be harmful.  Some may argue on the basis that it's childish to
value civility, and that real grownups are rough and tough and say it how it
is, and revel in the pure energy of the exchange.  In my opinion this
accelerates regression to the mean, or worse, and *we all* are poorer for
it.

Ah, but people can be, and often are, irrationally offended by things
that do not harm them in any other way, and which are therefore
none of their damned business.

It's the question of the doggie pack intelligences in Vinge's A FIRE UPON
THE DEEP, and `The Blabber'. I don't know that he dealt exactly with this
issue, but it's latent there.

A very very good question Anava.  One we should discuss more often.

This is sent to the response Jef sent to Anava's question but is
sent to the points that both made.

I was commenting offlist to Spike yesterday about how bad things
could get (his onlist posts gave some view of that).  As most of
the people on the list are in the U.S., E.U. or other "first world"
countries.  There is a very general lack of awareness of how bad
things can be (for most list members).  So I wish to take issue
with some of Anava's points (which are quite valid for people
who may be new to the list.)

Rudeness -- yep, we get short with each other.  We should try to fix that.
Diplomacy is a learned art.

Intolerance -- not so much, there may be opinions that are out-of-favor
but most of the people on the list would agree that they should have
their hearing.

Censorship -- no, except under very limited situations where the list volume
has become too high and volatile there is no censorship.

Bickering -- yep, there is a fair amount of that.  It is due to different
philosophies and perspectives -- but that may be part of the extropic
process.  How does one get to the "truth" if one doesn't debate it?
What all list members may need to do is examine whether or not they
are debating it in a "professional" fashion.

Violence -- not that I'm aware of (unless you are speaking of verbal
"rudeness" -- and that runs into some very sticky freedom of speech issues.)

Exclusivity -- perhaps -- to participate effectively in the Extropian list
there is a "body-of-knowledge" that one may require.  We try to point out
the books one may need to have read (the Extropian reading list, my list
of books I've read, Anders extensive web site, Greg's web site, etc.)
We can't make the barriers much lower without having the ability to
transfer knowledge directly into your mind -- and that might be fairly
unextropic.

I hope that deals with these points.  People who have been on the list
for a while are well aware of these potential problems.  They have learned
to deal with them while hoping that we might evolve better solutions for
them.  The canvas isn't completely painted yet -- we still have much work
to do.

> ### This is a profound and subtle point.  Unfortunately, the persons who
> don't get it are generally very confident in their ignorance while exulting

This may not be a comment by either Jef or Anava.  But let us not confuse
"freedom and individuality" with "personal experience".  One person's
"ignorance" is another person's "experience".  You can *never* invalidate
another person's experience -- the best you can do is to argue that it
may not be relevant in specific situations.  I cannot stress this
enough.  There is no "ignorance" -- there is only an expression of
what "works" based on their knowledge base.  Knowledge bases are not
universal (though we might like them to be).

So much of what may show up on the extropian list as rudeness, bickering, etc.
is really a conflict in knowledge bases.  I'm moderately certain if the
knowledge bases could be exchanged "instantaniously" that much of this
would go away.  Unfortunately we cannot easily do this using current technology.

> I wish I had time to do a write-up on the related concept of "victimless

It would be interesting to see this -- I have many thoughts related to
this area and it would be interesting to see an extropic paper related
to this concept.  I'm fairly certain the Journal of Evolution and Technology
would be interested in publishing papers on this topic.

Regards,
Robert

I have written extensively in support of my
claim that as an *ideal*, we should indeed
reify The Truth.  The mathematical/physical
arithmetic fact you refer to is so certain
that we can drop the "conjectural" bit, and
say, yeah, it's the truth.  Whether the Nazis
killed 14 million people in their concentration
camps is another matter, but is not still not
denied by the vast, vast majority of reasonable
people.

(Charles Hixson notes: Remember that language is inherrently ambiguous.  Something happened.  Some people call what happened "the
holocaust".  Other people, perhaps having a slightly different definition of the word, may not agree that the term applies... So it
is not necessarily an argument over facts (though, of course, it frequently is: "holocaust deniers" generally means people who don't
accept the movies coming from the concentration camps as valid, a clear dispute over facts.")

which now has the effect of alerting me to
the idea that you might not be meaning what
I thought.

Anyway...

I totally agree with you that "there is truth,
and all the sophistry in the world can't change
that".  But, Jeff, the whole question revolves
around how one regards one's own knowledge of
the truth.

I'm afraid that the way that you throw the term
"The Truth" around is one reason why many
philosophers are wary of such reification:
they rightly fear that it will be badly
misused by too many people.

> You're wrong, and now you trying to hide

Such silly pronouncements are definitely beneath
the intellectual integrity of this list.  You
might as well say "Nyahh, nyahh, nyahh" for
all the real content of your outburst.

> Solve your own problems.

Here is the greatest problem *you* have:  you
WILL NOT verbally admit to yourself the existence
of your own ideological blinders.  Why?

I admit my own ideological blinders, and work
(many times not so hard as I should---I admit)
to see beyond them.  It is *not* easy, and it
is a gross mistake for people to think that
it *is* easy.

I also think that most other serious participants
to these discussions will admit to their own
biases, and will confirm the probable existence
of subterranean processes in their own minds.

It is high time that you also admit it.

The biggest impediment to your own search for
the truth is that you are absolutely convinced
that you already have The Truth.  You have
said so over and over.  This kind of rigidity
will definitely kill you intellectually.

> In my annoyance, I told John Clark to "shut

Thanks very much.  Most of us (definitely
me included) lose our tempers from time
to time, but hopefully your high-minded
admission here will help turn around the
recent tide of incivility on the list.

> Now get over that as well.

Done!

Lee

No, but you might punt and say:  "Given that the payoff of any mental 
efforts invested will be post-Singularity, we may as well wait until after 
the Singularity where mental effort of vastly higher quality will be much 
cheaper, unless exploring these issues is likely to lead to important 
concepts which can be reused for pre-Singularity issues, or unless there 
are issues that affect pre-Singularity strategy."

Pers'nally, I'm a believer in curiosity.  Trying to grok post-Singularity 
issues often *does* lead to critically important reusable concepts, nor is 
it fully predictable in advance which avenues of curiosity will be 
productive or unproductive.

No, I *meant* Vietnam, and specifically those killed
by the North Vietnamese (even though, of course, 
the South Vietnamese were excessively brutal by
Western standards).  In the mid-fifties, there 
occurred a "collectivization" of agriculture in
the North, and, as always in collectivizations,
certain elements needed to be liquidated.  This
time it was only a few tens of thousands (well,
Vietnam is a small country).  When the country
was effectively partitioned, a lot of refugees
moved both ways.  Ninety percent of them headed
south (mostly, I think, because the Communists
were so into religious persecution).

The U.S. killed a lot of North Vietnam soldiers,
but when comparing civilian deaths, the Communists
were just ruthless.  About 6000 people died at
Hue alone, and you have to chalk that up against
about one-twentieth of that at My Lai, and that's
typical.

Right.  But speaking of "fair elections", 
the North Vietnamese held one in 1956.
Guess what?  The Communists won by 99%.
Amazing, isn't it, how well they had
captured the hearts of the people, 
collectivization and all!

P.S.  The last sentence was heavily
sarcastic.

This is interesting (if rather disturbing). Glad they got

For my own part I have been forced to learn to laugh 
at the suggestion I am in fact really a communist!
  The lady in question hails from Bosnia, and (as she spent
the first 21 years of life there) was in fact a member of
"Tito's Pioneers" (which as I understand it was basically 
the Yugoslavian Communist Youth Party) . I have been 
forced by her beauty and  intelligence to repeat the
phrase "We are Tito's, Tito is Ours" in Serb-Croat
so she can laugh at it. She then calls me a Commie.
(mjoe mali komunist!)
  Perhaps I am really a Communist. Or perhaps this
is what happens when you sleep with the enemy.
  Not sure.   :)
  I would like to encourage the single men on the list to

In that post, people, Jeff was writing principally of a purported and
continuing *American* holocaust, inflicted as state policy on a number of
nations. People seem not to have noticed that this was his intended meaning,
or to have shied away in revulsion from the very idea. But really it would
help to pay attention to what he's actually *saying* (as it helps to pay
attention to what Chomsky or Derrida actually said, and to whom, and for
what reasons, and under what circumstances, etc, before running about like
chickens with their heads cut off).

Michael Dickey forwarded some remarks in this thread
from MaxPlumm from the bulletin board.  Thank you for
the submission Michael.

Let's take a brief look at the points offered by
MaxPlumm.

> I must take some issues with your interpretations of
the 1954 Geneva Accords. For starters, I cannot see
how anyone can rationally argue that the government of
South Vietnam (already recognized by 30 nations and up
for UN membership at the time of the conference)
should
have submitted to an election to unify the country
with the North...<

No, there was no "South" Vietnam.  There was only
Vietnam, an "associate state" of the French Union. 
The territory of this state was the combined area of
the 'north' and 'south'--the area associated with the
Vietnam of today.  The whole country.

A short summary of who, in the period 1945-1954, had
what part of indochina and when--cast of players here:
French, Vichy French, Japanese, Nationalist Chinese,
British, Ho & Co., French again--can be found at:

http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0861793.html

Note the following excerpt:

In Mar., 1946, France signed an agreement with Ho Chi
Minh, recognizing Vietnam as a free state within the
Indochina federation and the French Union. ...
However, differences immediately arose over whether
Cochin China [the southernmost of the three
regions--Tonkin, Annam,  and Cochin China] was
included in the independent state of Vietnam; in June,
1946, France supported the establishment of a separate
republic of Cochin China.
<snip unnecessary stuff> the French in 1949
reinstalled Bao Dai as the ruler of Vietnam, of which
Cochin China was then recognized to be a part.

   -----end of excerpt------

I direct your attention to that last bit: "...Vietnam,
of which Cochin China was then recognized to be a
part."  So from 1949 to the onset of the Geneva
Conference, Vietnam was all of Vietnam, the combined
regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China.

Now the prior error pretty much invalidates everything
that follows--anything premised on separate north and
south prior to the accords--but regarding the
election, you must take note of the fact that
representatives from India, Canada, and Poland made up
the International Control Comission, charged with
carrying out the peace agreement, and woulda, shoulda,
coulda been there to oversee the elections.  In
addition there ain't no one on the planet not being
spoon fed in an Alzheimer's ward who doesn't
acknowledge that Ho, as the dominant political
personality and the 'hero' who won independence for
his country, was going to sweep those elections. 
Fairly.

This is just anti-communist dribble.  Ho was an
authentic Vietnamese nationalist and the north was not
'the north' at the time.  Whether or not he was
communist, how much, and of what sort, well, it's all
irrelevant.  Unless anti-communism self-justifies

Again, ain't no South Vietnam at the time.  

However, an interesting note.  The Geneva Conference
began in May and ended on July 21, 1954.  In June, in
the middle of the conference, France declared Vietnam
a completely independent nation, free from the legal
strictures of membership in the French Union.  Can you
guess why, boys and girls?

I'd have to see some documentation.  I've seen a lot
already, but nothing about this, except for the Soviet
and Chinese recognition of the Democratic Republic of
Vietnam.  I suspect that the writer of this piece
would not view with favor *those* recognitions.

Again, the North and South don't exist at this point
in time.  There is one Vietnam, and free and fair
elections, as provided for in the Accords, are the
internationally accepted norm for determining a
nations "own political future."

"Blatant" violations?  Absent facts, crank up the
rhetoric.  Fine.  I can do facts *and* rhetoric
simultaneously.

The writer rejected the accords when it suited him,
rejected them based on error.  Now he wants to use
them.  OK.  Let's see what he's got.

Oh, yeah, riiight.  Bombed the livin' shit out of
Laos, so that it's a hell hole of unexploded ordinance
to this day.  Concurrently, the CIA overthrows the
govt of Cambodia replacing Sihanouk with Lon Nol,
bombing the living shit out of Cambodia, bringing war
with the Khmer Rouge, and then the Khmer to power.  

Yeah, that's respect for their neutrality.  The same
way the writer respects the truth.  And the same way I
respect the writer.  I've heard enough.  He's outta
here.

<snip the remaining dribble, go take a shower>

That's it Michael.  Thanks again. 

Anti-communism tortures the facts till they conform to
dogma.  Intellectual (not to mention moral and
political) integrity embraces the facts and constructs
a world view based thereon.

Read the documents.

Actually, aerosolized anthrax is probably the best bio-weapon
available.  Pneumonic plague is also impressive, but the agent is
not robust.  Smallpox is a terrorist's wet dream but difficult to
procure and too dangerous to use in a rational manner, so I would
hope no state-sponsored stockpiles exist.

There are of course inherent problems with B and C weapons, and
their widely recognized ban is likely due to their lack of military
usefulness in the first place.

(end)

Based on my sources I get the impression the Timeship project IS moving forward steadily due to the financial powerhouses Saul Kent and Bill Faloon.  The key matter now to those behind it is where to put it and supposedly a location near Disneyworld is a very strong possibility.  

I find it interesting that for a time the Timeship website was actually password protected, but now it appears fully open again to the general public.  

There has been considerable debate on Cryonet as to the wisdom of building this modern-day "shrine" to cryonics.  On the one hand it may provide much needed infrastructure and publicity, yet on the other it may be seen domestically and especially abroad by some as a symbol of American/cryonicist austantaciousness and wastefulness.  It might even be targeted by terrorists for those very reasons which makes me very nervous despite claims by its designers that it will be well fortified against attack.  

I admit although I have my reservations about the project, that the descriptions of the place as it may be built make my heart skip a beat with excitement.  I just would not want to be stored there!

Whatever the case may be it appears by about 2007 the place will be up and running...

The Creekside Preserve/Ventureville community will not be as flashy, but will still be a great, low-key place to either visit or live.  The "mundane" beauty and normality of what we are building will be one of our greatest strengths.  I hope you can all eventually visit us to see firsthand what we have to offer.     

best wishes for the future,

John

Chess and GO no-brainers?
Scans suggests intellectual games miss 'g' spot.
12 December 2002

HELEN PEARSON

Chess has lots in common with IQ problems.
© alamy

The board games chess and GO take practice, not intellect, brain scans of 
players suggest1,2 . Intelligence areas appear inactive when people puzzle 
over game strategy.

Amateur chess and GO players do not use an area that is believed to house 
general intelligence, sometimes called 'g', US and Chinese researchers 
have found. "It's a provocative claim," admits team member Sheng He, who 
is based at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

The result goes against common sense. Chess is considered one of the most 
mentally taxing of pursuits. And the Chinese game GO, in which players use 
stones to ring-fence territory on a grid, is thought to be on a cerebral 
par.

The challenges involved in the two games have "lots in common" with IQ 
problems used to measure 'g', argues John Duncan, who studies intelligence 
at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, UK. He wonders 
whether technical hitches obscured activity in intelligence areas in the 
scans.

Sheng He concedes that expert players, or those with money riding on a 
game, might stretch their minds more. In the test, players pondered the 
best move in a non-competitive scenario.

Alternatively, practice and expertise may actually account for a lot of 
winning moves. "Most of the stuff we think of as smart is based on 
experience," says psychology expert John Gabrieli of Stanford University 
in California.

Mind games

Sheng He and his colleagues also tested the assumption that chess 
exercises the mind differently from GO.

Chess players select from a limited array of possible moves. By throwing 
huge amounts of silicon at the problem, computer programmers can build 
powerful machines that rival humans: Deep Fritz drew with world champion 
Vladimir Kramnik in October.

Most of the stuff we think of as smart is based on experience
John Gabrieli
Stanford University

But when it comes to GO, where players can make any move across the 19x19 
board, man leaves machine trailing. The game is thought to require more 
instinct or 'human' strategy: "Sometimes a move just feels more 
threatening," explains He.

Brain scans did little to unravel these differences. As expected, GO 
players use the right half of their brain, which works out position and 
orientation, more than the problem-solving left half used by chess 
aficionados.

Otherwise, the mind's tactics look similar. GO must use "different brain 
mechanisms we don't understand", concludes He.

Wow. I didn't know that it was so bad. 4 failures out of 14 flights is one
of the worst rate I have ever seen. The previous Ariane model, Ariane 4,
has a 97.3% success rate (3 failures out of 114 launches). What's going on
at ESA?

The first one was caused by a relatively minor software error.It's too
early to know why the auto-destruction kicked in, and they better find out
quickly!

I have noticed that this is a normal viewpoint for tranhumans. I have it 
myself to some degree. But after thinking about it, it has really 
started driving me up the wall.

The argument goes: "After the singularity, we will be so intelligent and 
different that we will be impossible to understand for mere humans".

What I hate about it, is that it is exactly the same kind of mystiscism 
that religions use. It's dogmatic and un-scientific. It cannot be tested 
in any way. It's no different than saying that "after death we will all 
go to heaven." Wich cannot be tested either.

Perhaps we can't understand it, but we should at least try to. We should 
at have some theories that could be tested.

I know that there are ideas about Borganism's vs. Jupiter brains, but 
after that there are hardly any theories. These cannot be the only two 
topologies that are possible.

If we don't develop some theories that are plausible and testable, we 
really have a poor argument for wanting to develop superintelligence.

I don't think that "We want to become super intelligent, because then we 
will experience what it is like to be super intelligent." is a good 
enough argument.

Any objections ;-)

If it drives you up the wall, don't think about it, then ;)

It's not an argument. It's a statement. It's not even entirely accurate, 
because some beings will be _less_ than a human.

That's okay. Science is not about culture. No chimp science is going to 
make her predict superchimps' Ulysses (the space probe, not the book).

There are some aspects of future existance which might or might not be 
predictable. In fact, we spend a lot of time on this list pushing the 
envelope of predictability (to put it less politely, shooting the bull).

I don't speculate in topologies. But there are some constraints of 
computational physics and physics in general which make some things appear 
more likely than others. The kind of substrate alone doesn't say much 
about the culture inhabiting it, though.

Who wants to develop superintelligence? Not me. I don't even know what 
'superintelligence' is.

It's not an argument. It's a statement. And an obviously true statement, 
imo.

Much of today's effort to build quantum computers, which would use the 
attributes of atoms and subatomic particles to carry out blazingly fast 
computations, is focused on finding the best way to make quantum bits, 
or qubits, the basic building blocks needed to represent and process 
information using the quirks of quantum physics.



Fractal Magnets May Fracture Old Technologies
=============================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://sci.newsfactor.com/perl/story/20248.html

Plastics with fractal magnetic fields "may provide ways to store a high 
density of information" in a very small space because of their intensely 
ordered structure, explained Arthur Epstein, director of the Center for 
Materials Research at OSU.



Virtual world will run on real cash

A cunning statistical study has exposed scientists as sloppy reporters. 
When they write up their work and cite other people's papers, most do 
not bother to read the original.



Flaxseed inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in murine model

http://www.lef.org/news/nutrition/2002/12/12/eng-newsrx/eng-newsrx_093129_4168846094214019955.html

Nutritional scientists in Canada report that when they added 10% 
flaxseed to the diet of mice with human breast tumors, tumor growth and 
metastases were reduced.

Dabrosin's group found "supplementation of 10% flaxseed, the richest 
source of mammalian lignans, to [the mice] reduced tumor growth and 
metastasis. Moreover, flaxseed decreased extracellular levels of VEGF, 
which may be one mechanistic explanation to the decreased tumor growth 
and metastasis," they said.



Digital divide encompasses more than technology

Access to information technology and training in IT skills are supposed 
to level the economic playing field for women and low-income minorities, 
but two Penn State researchers say acquiring that expertise alone 
doesn't automatically lead to upward mobility.

Scientific misconduct is not unique to industry, for the professional 
pressures in universities, nonprofit organizations, and federal

I argue in "Naturalism and Skepticism"
http://www.markalanwalker.com/natu.htm that it is possible to test the
conjecture that we can create higher intelligences even if we cannot
understand in detail the cognitive life of higher intelligences.  According
to at least some definitions of  'posthuman' or 'higher intelligence', it is
a necessary condition that their cognitive lives transcend our ability to
fully understand. Presumably you have another definition in mind, otherwise
your exhortation to understand such entities makes no sense. What does not
follow is that, if we cannot understand in detail the cognitive lives of
higher intelligences humans, we cannot verify their existence. To think
otherwise is to subscribe to some version of the dogma that if some subject
S verifies the truth of some theory or proposition P, then S must understand
P. In other words the dogma is that , understanding or comprehending P is
necessary for verifying the truth of P. A simple example shows this dogma
false: S is a child aged 7. She asks her physicist mother if the proposition
'E=mcc' is true. Mum says yes. S has verified that P but has very little
compression of what P means. No doubt you can see where this is going. We
may stand in the same relation to higher intelligences. We may be able to
verify that the conjectured higher intelligences are indeed higher
intelligences. Imagine such a being writes down an enormously complex
equation of the universe that we cannot even begin to understand. To show us
some proof that this equation shows a better insight into the nature of
reality the higher intelligence puts on a display by re-arranging the stars
in the night sky to form the outline of the comeback Elvis. Surely as you
stand there in your backyard looking at the outline of Elvis in the night
sky you would have to think there is some reason to believe that you have
witness an impressive display by a higher intelligence. Of course the
discouraging part might come when the higher intelligences say to us that
their most impressive achievements are not appreciable by us anymore than a
chimp can appreciate our  intellectual achievements when we pass them copies
of  The Critique of Pure Reason, or The Origin of Species.

I agree in general with the idea of testability. It seems extremely
improbable to me, but I think we should bear in mind the empirical
possibility that higher intelligences cannot be created. As an analogy,
there are limits to how high a bird can fly no matter how much we reengineer
them--at some point the air becomes too thin for any amount of flapping to
be useful. Perhaps we stand at the top of what is intellectually achievable
by any species (carbon or silicon). As I said, I think this is extremely
unlikely, but it has to be left open as an empirical possibility. Suppose
anything smarter than a human reaches a "critical mass" of some emergent
property and the intelligence explodes. Is this possible? Yes. Is it
probable? No.

Spike, what you saw was probably "Immortality on Ice" which originally came out about five years ago.  While it may have appeared "balanced" with what little you saw at the end, I felt it was ultimately slanted against cryonics.  Every time a cryonicist in the program made a good point, they would have a "real world" cryobiologist just shake their head and essentially say "it just ain't so!"  Of course the cryobiologists never took into account the possibility of mature nanotechnology coming down the road in the next fifty to one-hundred years due to the avalanche of technological advancement which humanity has been having.  

I was thrilled at the time to see a mass media program about cryonics, but it could have been much better.  I will have to send you my copy of it so you and Shelley can see the program in its entirety and then dislike it as much as I do. lol!

best wishes,

John

Not really, one of Eric's nanocomputers has the capacity of between
100,000 and 1 million human brains and its up against the power supply
and cooling capacity of known physics.  So it isn't "impossible" to
understand.  Its simply way beyond current capacities.  But I can grok
10^6 people -- its somewhat smaller than the population of Seattle or
Boston and I've lived in both of those places.

There are distinct differences between architectures and the capacities
of Jupiter Brains and Matrioshka Brains (I designed MBrains to deal with
a larger spatial distribution and some of the possible cooling problems
that JBrains might have).  Anders has discussed several other possible
architectures in his JET paper from a few years ago (though he has
to depend on some pretty creative physics if I recall).  Both Michael
Frank and Seth Lloyd have done some interesting work over the last
few years regarding the theoretical limits.

I thought Eliezer, the Singularity Institute and some of the work by
Ben Goertzel and Peter Voss were going exactly in these directions.
The post today regarding the differences between how the human mind
looks at Chess and Go was quite interesting.  The problem is that we
just don't understand what "intelligence" is effectively at this time.

We will never be able to explore the vectors of "intelligence" completely
(even with an MBrain).  The phase space of what can be constructed using
robust nanotech is simply too large.  The best we will ever be able to
do is pick some promising directions and try to explore those as best
we can.

I picked up the December National Geographic at the train
station today, and it has a long feature article about the Hawaiians.
("The Hawaiians" by Paul Theroux, December 2002)

"A century after Hawaiians lost their kingdom and much of their
culture, a new generation is discovering its roots,
and some of them want their islands back."

The article focused on just them (the Hawaiians), and didn't discuss
anything about the dozen or so other ethnic groups who share the same
small space in the Hawaiian Islands.

Overall I liked the article. Even though Hawaiian history was poured
into our young minds for several years in elementary school (in
addition to learning ukulele, hula dancing, poi balls, etc.) in the
60s and 70s, I learned a few  historical aspects about the culture
that I didn't know before, and I learned how the U.S. came to have
possession of the islands in the  first place: this was definitely
_not_ taught in school when I was growing up there-- at school we
learned how wonderful the missionaries were to teach and civilize
the Hawaiian people and give their language a written form for the
first time... According to one of the persons featured in the
article, the U.S. came into possession of the Islands when Queen
Lili'uiokalani was overthrown and imprisoned in 1893 at the
instigation of a group of American businessmen, and then islands
were illegally annexed in 1898. (Other sources on the web above
describe what happened in 1959 with the U.S. president, the U.N. and
how the vote about Hawaii into the Union did not permit the vote of
the indigenous people living there.)

The article also hammered home one aspect of the Hawaiian culture as
a  sea-faring people. I grew up as a water child because of my sailing
family (not Hawaiian) and our life on our boat, but I had forgotten
that sailing was implicit in the life all around the islands, and a deep
part of the Hawaiian culture.

---------

I am terribly curious why sea-faring is not part of every culture
that develops on an island. One would think that, if a human can see
another land mass on the horizon separated by a body of water, that
the human would be drawn to learn what was 'over there', and learn
how to build boats and sail. However this is not at all true in the
Canary Islands.

The Canary Islands are an archipelago of many volcanic islands/islets
(principal islands: Tenerife, Grand Canary, La Palma,
La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura) that are similar
in size and separation from each other as are the Hawaiian Islands.
On Tenerife on a clear day you can see easily see Gomera -- it is as
close (10 nautical miles) as Molokai looks to someone standing on
windward side of Oahu.

Yet the original populations of the Canaries were ignorant of the
art of navigation, and developed in isolation of each other, and at
different rates of cultural (religious and technical too) evolution,
based on different population triggers that brought the different
peoples to the islands in the first place.

This leads to the question of how the people arrived in the Canary
Islands in the first place- in Hawaii, the migration looks pretty
clear to the historians, (from Tahiti, Samoa, etc.), but it's not at
all clear the case in the Canary Islands. The Guanches, that is, the
original people in the Canaries, arrived with their animals: goats,
sheep, dogs, with them as if colonizers, and these people dedicated
themselves totally to agriculture and pasture, and not to the sea.

Even though there is not alot of information available about the
Guanches, there is _something_ and the archeologists and historians
have pieced together some aspects of the life,and are still actively
trying to find answers. In the little book below that I found in a
archeological museum in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, last year, I read
the following about the marriage customs on the different islands that
made me smile, so then a smile for your Saturday:

<begin quote, pg. 66, 67>

"In Grand Canary, men were monogamous. Wives were subjected one month
before matrimony, to a fattening diet, to strengthen them, so that
later they would have strong and robust children.

During the wedding night, the woman could, if she wished, sleep with
a noble of her liking, and if as a result of this union a child was
born, he would be named "Caballero" (gentleman).

The legitimate husband, meanwhile, waiting for the news of a
pregnancy brought about by this irregular union, was not permitted
any carnal contact with her.

In La Gomera, things were easier. There free love existed and so
there were few problems encountered in finding an ideal partner,
either for the man or the woman.

The sacredness of the conjugal condition was not felt here as it was
in the other islands, and in fact there existed a strange custom
called "hospitality of the bed" in which any husband could offer the
delights of his wife to house guests.

It seems that this usage, which it must be said is sometimes found
towns of other nations was also found Grand Canary.

In Lazarote polygamy was normal, and so women there had three
husbands, who alternated each month in their marital duties.

During the abstinence period, the other two husbands were obliged to
revere and serve the wife in all her necessities and desires.

In El Hierro, marriage was contracted by the delivery, as payment,
of a certain quantity of cattle to the parents of the wife.

It is a fact that in almost all the islands a quasi-matriarchy
existed, which made the condition of being a woman always most
favourable.

Respect for women was so high among these people that, on meeting
one in your path, you were obliged to wait until she had passed. You
had to avoid speaking, or look at them without permission. Insulting
a woman was considered a crime worthy of punishment of the utmost
severity."

In ops (bit flux), not in total bits stored. Nitpick not applicable to 
this particular statement; yet handy to keep in mind when using Drexler's 
estimates for 'how many people in a glass of water' arguments. One 
person/glass of water at the very least. One person/sugarcube? Maybe, 
maybe not. Besides, these are current, skinny people. A future person (if 
indeed there is an organization hierarchy level comparable with today's 
people) could be cubic meters, or cubic kilometers.

Right, no one mess with physics of computation. It's as real as science 
gets.

Behaviour is evolution in configuration or state space. Which is pretty 
much damn infinite, yes. Flagging it all 'intelligence' is missing the 
mark wildly.

Researchers sent out equivalent resumes, with commonly white or black first
names; white names were more likely to be asked to interview.  Also, response
to white names was more sensitive to listed qualifications.

An interesting project I intend to undertake if all
goes well and I'm still alive post-Singularity is
to simulate the world with me having a different
skin color, and see how it goes.

The best way will be to mess with the simulated
(not emulated) people's visual areas so that Lee
looks like he's a different race to them, and see
if he end up with some people being cold to him,
and others oddly warm.  It'll get a little touchy
when poor Lee has to participate in discussions
about race, but I'm sure that I'll think of ways
around such obstacles.

It'll be very interesting to see how certain 
profound friendships develop differently, and
I'll finally be able to write a better book
than "Black Like Me".

This is a follow-up to messages a couple of weeks ago.

Roy Walford is doing well.  We enjoyed an evening watching his videos -
artistic interpretations of his time at Biosphere - and catching up.  

He said that is it a known fact that he has ALS and that his condition has
not improved, but seems to be in a state of stasis.  He continues to write,
however, and work on videos.

Anyone who would like to suggest ways of dealing with ALS, - alternative
treatments -, please email me privately and I'll send your messages to Roy.
(If you make these suggestions on the list (Robert, I think you did),
please resend them.  I know Roy would appreciate this.)

Thanks,

Natasha

Subject: FC: Hurrah for Total Information Awareness!

[The below essay is posted through an anonymous remailer. I have a
queue of other TIA replies I'll post later tonight or
tomorrow. Briefly, the essay highlights two different ways to protect
your privacy: (a) Maintain control over your information and use
technology to limit disclosure and linking with past behavior. See,
for instance, Stefan Brands' work I wrote about nearly three years
ago: http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,34496,00.html or
(b) Allow the Feds and companies to collect your information and rely
on laws and government forbearance to protect your privacy. David
Brin has written about some of the problems with (a) -- though I do
not find his arguments persuasive -- and TIA shows us the problems of
(b). Laws can change in a moment at the whim of Congress or the
courts; technological methods won't. --Declan]

For years we cypherpunks have been telling you people that you are
responsible for protecting your own privacy.  Use cash for purchases, look
into offshore accounts, protect your online privacy with cryptography
and anonymizing proxies.  But did you listen?  No.  You thought to
trust the government.  You believed in transparency.  You passed laws,
for Freedom of Information, and Protection of Privacy, and Insurance
Accountability, and Fair Lending Practices.

And now the government has turned against you.  It's Total Information
Awareness program is being set up to collect data from every database
possible.  Medical records, financial data, favorite web sites and email
addresses, all will be brought together into a centralized office where
every detail can be studied in order to build a profile about you.
All those laws you passed, those government regulations, are being
bypassed, ignored, flushed away, all in the name of National Security.

Well, we fucking told you so.

And don't try blaming the people in charge.  You liberals are cursing
Bush, and Ashcroft, and Poindexter.  These laws were passed by the entire
U.S. Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike.  Representatives have
the full support of the American people; most were re-elected with
large margins.  It's not Bush and company who are at fault, it's the
whole idea that you can trust government to protect your privacy.

All that data out there has been begging to be used.  It was only a
matter of time.

And you know what?  It's good that this has happened.  Not only has
it shown the intellectual bankruptcy of trust-the-government privacy
advocates, it proves what cypherpunks have been saying all along, that
people must protect their own privacy.  The only way to keep your privacy
safe is to keep the data from getting out there in the first place.

Cypherpunks have consistently promoted two seemingly contradictory
ideas.  The first is that people should protect data about themselves.
The second is that they should have full access and usability for
data they acquire about others.  Cypherpunks have supported ideas like
Blacknet, and offshore data havens, places where data could be collected,
consolidated and sold irrespective of government regulations.  The same
encryption technologies which help people protect their privacy can be
used to bypass attempts by government to control the flow of data.

This two-pronged approach to the problem produces a sort of Darwinian
competition between privacy protectors and data collectors.  It's not
unlike the competition between code makers and code breakers, which has
led to amazing enhancements in cryptography technology over the past
few decades.  There is every reason to expect that a similar level of
improvement and innovation can and will eventually develop in privacy
protection and data management as these technologies continue to be
deployed.

But in the mean time, three cheers for TIA.  It's too bad that it's the
government doing it rather than a shadowy offshore agency with virtual
tentacles into the net, but the point is being made all the same.
Now more than ever, people need privacy technology.  Government is not
the answer.  It's time to start protecting ourselves, because nobody
else is going to do it for us.

I'm using an old Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 3200C, slow, one page at a time. It
runs a free bundled OCR program (HP PrecisionScan LT) that's about as crappy
as anything I've dealt with: for starters, it drops out all the tabs and
runs the text together without par breaks. I'd appreciate advice from anyone
who knows this stuff and can help me find a free or cheap better
text-scanning program for this machine.

This is so off-topic for the extropes that I think it would be best to email
me direct. Thanks.

Gene, this view seems a Leitl too narrow.  {8-]

How about choice (c) intentionally confusing the
picture by inserting absurd or contradictory information
into that virtual profile.  For instance, you and I
could trade e-mail @s and autoforward each other the personal
notes for a few weeks.  Then trade @s with someone else.

We could set up our machines to repeatedly log onto
arbitrary websites all night every night.

Or search on google with the following:

tree OR automobile OR republican OR wine OR mexico OR wiffenpoof

Google finds 867000 sites.  One of you code jockies could
write us a screensaver-like script that will begin every
time the computer is idle and patiently start googling down
the list of websites.  Or write a script that randomly
chooses two words, googles them, hits on the last dozen
sites, repeat endlessly.

I defy human or machine to comb thru all the resulting
records to figure out what our faves really are.  This
intentionally corrupts the signal with noise, the way a
whiffenpoof obscures tracks in the sand.  No lying or
cheating required, just creating intentional digital
camoflage and piling it high.

Invite extropians to your home often, give them your
password and let em run wild with your email account.

I may or may not have written this.  Maybe.  spike

p.s. My notions of openness are only for volunteers.
I myself wish to be profiled, so that my junk mail is
more interesting: stuff about science and math and
futurism and motorcycles and cool stuff such as that.
I dont want any junk mail from Martha Stewart.com
or Whiffenpoofs-R-Us.  I also want those who wish
to maintain their privacy to do so.  With improving
information handling technology, everyone can win. s

The virulent form of Ames strain (which is what was in the letters)
is known to have been shared with labs in Canada and the UK as well.
Last I heard, there were about half a dozen labs known to have
cultures, and genomic analysis had been unable to narrow the field
further than that. And Iraq has every reason to try to acquire Ames:
for several years it's been known that the US Army's anthrax vaccine
is much less effective against Ames than against the Vollum strain,
which Iraq is known to have acquired from a US repository. Iraq is
also on record as having tried to obtain Ames from the UK as long
ago as 1988 (although that may have been a nonvirulent substrain,
I can't tell).

Why would the Bush administration not shout from the rooftops that
it was Iraqi anthrax, at a time when they need public support for
a war against Iraq? I don't know how reliable the journalist Bob
Woodward is, but in his new book "Bush At War" (pp248-249) he reports
a conversation from a National Security Council meeting last October,
in which Cheney, his chief of staff, and CIA head Tenet discuss the
anthrax. They agree that it was probably Al Qaeda and probably
state-sponsored. Tenet says he won't bring up state sponsorship in
public, and Cheney says "It's good that we don't, because we're not
ready to do anything about it."

How do you mobilize a society to deal with a threat so great
that surrender is by far the easiest option? You frame it as a
hypothetical risk. You say it is imperative that rogue states not
be allowed to arm terrorist groups, and you keep 'em guessing as
to whether that already happened last October. You have the FBI
publicly hunt for a domestic anthrax terrorist, while not even
mentioning the Florida case (with its embarrassing proximity
to the hijackers) on its Amerithrax homepage. You play up vague
reports of contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda, and you have
anonymous intelligence officials deny repeated assertions from
Prague that Mohammed Atta met there with an Iraqi spymaster.

A good case can be made for Iraqi sponsorship of earlier episodes
of terrorism in the USA (see the work of Laurie Mylroie and Jayna
Davis), so maybe there's also something darker at work. Maybe the
intelligence agencies tried to deal with those earlier attacks
covertly, but their opponent was only emboldened. However that may
be, I think the strategic dilemma I've just sketched is in itself
sufficient to explain why they'd prevaricate.

Your question is beyond my programming competence for
sure.  I stick to JavaScript and HTML.  One very good
place from which I've gotten a LOT of good answers and
pointers, however, as a professional in-house web
designer (site up to 450+ pages now, all hand-coded,
at least fifty major keywords on page 1 of Google.) is
siteexperts.com. They have been around for quite a
long time in web years, and cover every topic.  

SiteExperts.com is a user/programmer dominated site. 
Anyone can join.  Beware of one guy (?) - goes by
"holophrastic."  He is very competent and
knowledgeable and has a nasty habit of coming down
really hard on people who ask beginner questions or
worse, questions that are not properly phrased or too
ambiguous.  He likes to be mean.  Apart from him, the
crew there is generally quite cordial and very
competent.  I've worked my way through LONG projects
in JavaScript design with them on several occasions.

would have a "real world" cryobiologist just shake their head and
essentially say "it just ain't so!"  Of course the cryobiologists never took
into account the possibility of mature nanotechnology coming down the road
in the next fifty to one-hundred years due to the avalanche of technological
advancement which humanity has been having.

If "knowledge base" is just another name for everything the 
person knows, believes, is programmed with and so on then this 
explanation explains nothing.  Could you say what you mean a bit 
more precisely?  There is, for instance, ignorance of the kind 
that is not merely misinformed or uninformed but willful refusal 
to see and integrate information for whatever *reason*.  I 
cannot invalidate someone else's experience but the conclusions 
they have drawn or failed to draw can certainly be less than 
correct or reasonable.  There should be a distinction made, I 
believe, between what really works and what one has simply not 
been killed by yet.  :-)

I don't think you can explain it all like that.  There is real 
rudeness and bickering present that doesn't have anything to do 
with the knowledge base except being either evolutionary 
programmed patterns or learned patterns that have not been 
overcome even when time after time they are shown to be 
inappropiate and counter-productive.

It is time the American people reminded our government of their 
sworn oath to uphold the Constitution, including the Fourth and 
Fifth Amendment.  This kind of snooping obviates the need for 
further searches since everything is always searched in real 
time!  Please tell me enough of the American people understand 
the evil of this to raise bloody hell.  Oh yeah, I forgot, no 
one, especially in government, understands or takes the Bill of

>From a brief glimse it seems that massive consolidation of data from all
sources
could well set the stage for doing global scale simulations and creating

"virtual earths".   The question is who would do this and for what end.

Weather and climate simulations are common.

Human activity simulations are a long way away because of the massive
computational resources and cost .  The day when one or more AIs can
access sufficient resources to do these will mark the beginning sign of
"the singularity".
The danger is that simulations may become so good that "big brother"
might want to manage human activity and even human life and death to
duplicate a simulation in real life.

The key is consent.  If  a country state with 1 million citizens
wants a certain end scenario to life at a point 10 years in the future
and sufficient
simulation power can create it , is it wrong to prevent the scenario
from being
managed into reality?

The world no longer has an "australia" to send its rejects and opt-outs.

Global scale miscalculations are a danger.  Keep the screw-ups as small
as possible and the
sucesses as widely spread as possible.

Lifespan extension from say a 120 year threshold to a 1.2 million year
lifespan would make it more
acceptable to engage in numerous simulations which for the most part are
undo-able.
There concieve-ably could be competition for resources between sims and
efforts to create new post-singularity technologies.  Sims could be an
opiate of the masses or a "grey goo" which could reduce intelligent life
forms to primordial pond scum.  The "Great Link" on ST-DS9 is a simple
representation of a post singularity simulation.  Those wishing to leave
the simulation to
have un unplanned life , as ODO did will be the revitalizing energy
which keeps the simulation renewed.

The british TV program "the prisoner" which I saw years ago  seems to
be  a simplistic but near to the subject  study on this subject.

'Nuf for now.

In less complex entities, say moths, most of the knowledge is
preprogrammed into the genome and we would generally call it
"instinct".  In more complex entities, say humans or elephants,
most of the knowledge base is gained from experience.

Well we have to split some hairs here.  "Misinformed" could well
be "beyond our control" -- the goal of a free press (not commercial
press as we have more and more in the U.S.) is to hopefully prevent
people from being intentionally "misinformed" by self-serving people.
"Uninformed" could be due to a lack of motivation (which could in
turn be genetic or experiential) or a lack of access to information
sources (most 3rd world people) or a lack of time to become informed
(because one is simply dealing with the day-to-day struggle for survival).

"Willful refusal" can be intentional (in which case the person is
just simply being bad [at least from an extropic perspective] or
it can be because their mind can simply not grok the concepts.
Typically I think this is because a concept sets up such
cognitive dissonance that they have to reject the evidence they
are being presented with or develop a split personality disorder.
Holding onto concepts that tend to disagree with each other is
not an easy thing.  [This is one of the reasons I very much dislike
the wave/particle duality of light in physics.]

I look at it like -- "If I'm alive everything I know must have
worked and so therefore it must be right -- if you are telling
me something that contradicts what I *know* then I either have
to flip (your strategy is better than mine at promoting my
survival) *or* I have to reject what you are asserting to be
true.

The alternate path is to believe that we could both be "right".
You are right within your experience and I am right within mine.
So now a debate becomes a more interesting activity as its really
about figuring out which set of experiences may be more relevant
to the topic under discussion.  In that case all parties may
discover that they are "right" and be enriched because the
learn a new set of rules that should be applied in specific
circumstances.

Agreed.  If they are dead, then they got it wrong (at least if survival
was their goal).  If they are alive you may assume that at least some
of them just got lucky.  The more interesting question (at least to me)
is figuring out when they got it right and how do you learn from their
different set of experiences.  This is presumably what human story
telling and fairy tales are all about.  I might be generally uninterested
in stories of UFO abductions but I just might might be interested
in stories involving the survival of UFO abductions.  Lacking the
ability to absolutely prove UFO abductions are false I should
reasonably consider whether knowledge of how to survive UFO
abductions would be useful.  Of course if I'm smart about it
I might place information about how to survive falling into
a lake (if I can't swim) or how to time starting a business
as somewhat higher on my priority list.

There is a book about the history of Maine that my mother showed
me once.  In it I believe it described "down-mainers" (as they
are known) as "just plain ornery".  My mother observed that that
described my father (descended from a long line of down-mainers)
*exactly*.  I don't know whether this is a genetic Bradbury trait
or one we have just learned over many generations.  I'd simply
observe that you can take a Bradbury out of Maine but you can't
take the down-mainer out of a Bradbury (at least not very easily).

But in social species (e.g. humans, dogs, etc.) there is a
time for peace and a time for war.  The entities here today
span a distribution range from from those that lean one way
to those that lean the other (because their ancestors evolved
to strike the correct balance and pass it along either through
genes or experience).

Hope this makes some of my thinking a bit clearer.
Robert

Yes.  But it certainly highlights the necessity of poll watchers from 
outside the area of control validating any election held in an area 
where an autocratic government is in control.  If there aren't a lot of 
checks, you can't trust the results.
--(Which brings to mind:  Did you notice that the new electronic voting 
machines have no audit trails?  And that the code in secret?  There 
won't be any moreembarassing investications of voting irregularities!)--

Elections like that remind me of the one the Nazi's conducted in 
Chechosovakia before WWII (though I'm not sure they got an entire 99%).  
Also a bit about the recent Iraqi elections.  Usually, though, more 
civilized areas manage to control things by just crafting the rules so 
that the power controllers win no matter which side gets elected.  
(Which is, I admit, much more humane...but not much more honest.)

Commenting on Mark's nicely explanatory comments to Max, I'll
simply state that physicist Fotini Markopoulou Kalamara is
most definitely a "higher intelligence".  I state this with
the authority of someone who studied physics and did very
poorly at it (so my opinion should not be considered
"authoritative").

Background:
http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=0007E95C-9597-1DC9-AF71809EC588EEDF

I think this discussion might best be summed up in those
infamous words of, I think, a supreme court justice who
regarding pornography said something to the effect of
"I know it when I see it".  That's probably how we will
view higher intelligences.

My main answer is at the end, but:
Socialism has been around for a lot longer than 200 years.  It is a 
basic part of tribal humanity, and has existed in all cultures.  Most 
modern cultures tend to suppress it in the name of central authority.  
But calling a political party Socialist doesn't make it socialist.

All governments being formed start that way.  If they didn't, then they 
couldn't be formed.  I just deny that socialism is a style of 
government, at least for anything larger than a *small* tribe.

Dictators are dictators, what ever the story they tell you to get you to 
accept them.  The story is irrelevant.  And they aren't always brutal 
and oppressive, though they certainly do have a tendency to be that 
way.  This is as true of Julius Caesar as of the more recent dictators.

Are you asserting that the US ex-patriots don't find reasons that living

Sweden?  Or???
(Not that I consider Sweden a socialist country, merely a Socialist one

There are many true socialist groups.  But they don't get large.  They 
can't.  The organization doesn't scale.  (To be honest, it depends on 
all members being willing to contribute to the success of the endeavor.  
If it includes those who are disabled, then they must also be willing, 
and obviously attempting, to conribute their "fair" share.  And here 
"fair" is based on the communal judgement of the group.

The people that you are talking of are political partisans.  And I have 
heard them.  They do analyse what they are doing.  (Ineffectively, 
fortunately.)  But what they are doing has nothing to do with 
socialism.  It has to do with politics.  It has to do with rhetoric.  
Possibly even Rhetoric.  (Check out Cicero's rules of rhetoric.)

There is much truth here.  But...
All forms of centralization tend to totalitarianism in one form or 
another.  The purpose of the constitution was not only to create a 
government (replacing a free-er one with a tighter one), but to build 
bulwarks against the drift into tyranny.  It was successful for a long 
time, but each war has caused the centralists to gain more power.  And 
they don't release it when the war is over.  So the US has been drifting 
into a totalitarian state.  With luck, it will be held off long enough.  
Without luck...not.  Long enough is until the rate of change is 
increasing quickly enough that the govt. can't stop the approach of the 
singularity.

I recognize as socialist only certain small groups of freely associating 
people, who choose to combine their efforts to mutual gain.  I know of 
no way to scale this social sturcture.  Once money (quantitative 
accounting) is introcuded into the group, it rapidly changes into some 
other kind of entity.  With care, it can transform into, perhaps, a 
cooperative, or a closely held private corporation.  This takes both 
luck and skill, and the laws of the US make it quite unlikely to 
succeed.  (The social endeavor must usually proceed in a sub-legal 
fashion.)  (Note:  These groups are not theoretical.  I have 
participated in a few of them.  They do, however, have a tendency 
towards being temporary.  Someone starts sponging, and the group either 
fragments, splits into pieces, spits them out, or disintegrates.  I'm 
never observed the choice "spits them out" being taken, but with the 
formal rules as loose as they tend to be, the process would probably be 
traumatic enough to damage the group's long term stability.)
N.B.:  This is not similar to an owner controlled small business, even 
if the owner is considerate of the employees' needs.

The large groups that you consider socialist, I don't.  There are 
Socialist (note the capital "s") political parties in Scandinavian 
countries that might legitimately be considered analogs on a larger 
scale of socialist activities.  But they aren't the same thing.  Neither 
the Communists nor the Nazis had any sensible relation to the real 
meaning of the word, though I believe that Karl Marx had some idea that 
he could scale it up successfully.  (It's been many decades since I 
bothered to read any Marx, so I may well be totally misstating his 
intentions.)  Anyway, Marx's relation to communism is mainly PR.  Lenin 
may have been, or at least started, as a Marxist, but no leader since 
then.  (And a true believer reads into a work what he wants to see.)

My understanding is that the evidence pinned the Anthrax down to 
the US labs (iirc one specific lab) only.  It is a far shot to 
get Iraq using that specific batch and only that and then very 
ineffectually and small scale.  At the most that would tip their 
hand with nearly zero gain if (a very large IF) they had any 
real capacity to produce this grade of Anthrax.  Even then, the 
way Anthrax works makes it still very poor as a bio-weapon, 
relatively speaking.

There is no such threat.  If you believe there is then prove it

Would you consider a state that threatens preemptive strikes, 
commits assinations within sovereign nations they are not at war 
with, bombs civilians within the borders of other nations at its 
sole discretion on suspicion  a "rogue state"?  I certainly do.

Why do you keep the people whose representative you are supposed 
to be, who pay your salary, and whose blood and money will fuel 
your [mis]adventures "guessing"?  We should demand at all times 
a strict accounting in such matters.  Freedom, if we still 
believe in it and wish to regain it and keep it, demands it.

A far simpler explanation is that they want increased powers 
around the world for the own ends and that the people will be 
fed whatever lies and half-truths allow them to proceed.  We 
cannot afford to be in the dark about such a committment, its

OK, suppose I agree to raise bloody hell.  I carry a sign
that says...  what?  Down with Total Information Awareness?
Samantha, what do you have in mind?  Our bill of rights was
developed before the internet, so we need to propose privacy
rules and get very specific.

I propose a rule:  anyone has a right to conceal or reveal
any human interaction in which one has direct involvement.

Sounds simple, right?  If you are involved in a transaction
with another person, you have the right to conceal it, and
so does the other, but either has the right to reveal all
she knows and all she has witnessed, which effectively outs
the other person involved.

Nondisclosure agreements can still be signed, as before,
and still would work the same as always.

Does that work?  Is it in accordance with the Bill of Rights?
Which provision is violated, if any?

True, but as a lot of research has shown recently, neurons can be 
replenished under special circumstances--e.g. spinal cord damage. Even 
cardiac muscle can be repaired if damage occurs and heart cells can 
replicate. Please see:

I maintain my statement that all tissues in the body can be repaired and 
replenished.

All the best.

an excerpt

"When War Gets Personal"
http://www.free-market.net/spotlight/iraqwar/

"An insight into President Bush's motivation may have
been provided by the president himself during a
fundraising speech. He pointed out that Saddam
Hussein "is a guy who tried to kill my dad at one time."

While George W. Bush certainly has every right to be
angry over Hussein's botched post-Gulf War contract
on the first President Bush, there's no excuse for
nationalizing a personal score. Even the cleanest
military operation is likely to cost many lives on both
sides.

Of course, President Bush's remark may have been
simply an off-hand comment. But in the continuing
absence of evidence that Iraq poses more of a threat
to the U.S. than any of a host of other backwater
dictatorships, people should be forgiven for suspecting
that the country may go to war to settle a family
grudge.

After an Iraqi vice president challenged President Bush
to settle his differences with Saddam Hussein in
personal combat, more than a few pundits snickered
that a duel might be preferable to military mobilization.
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., the head of the Ludwig von
Mises Institute, suggested, "Choose your weapons,
fellas, and leave the rest of us out of it." "

There are different classes of bioweapons. The single misanthrop or an
extremist group have different requirements than a deployment in the field
by 'legitimate' (scarecrowed as 'legitimate' used adjacent to 'bioweapons'
does look rather strangely) troops against enemy civilians or combatants.

The misanthrop or the extremist group would want something which achieves
sustainable burn and is impossible to cure -- something combining the
properties of influenza and HIV. Legitimate warfare in the field would
want to transiently incapacitate, but not to kill. A strangelovish last
resort weapon is to make the aggressor pay, so it will try to inflict the
maximal amount of damage possible.

> Asymptomatic until after the infectious cycle is well under way.  And

Autoamplification (whether in a fast burn with hemorrhagic viruses or slow
stealthy propagation with engineered viruses) is only a required property
by nutty/desperate people. It is very difficult to create a sustainable 
burn weapon of this kind, so it will be limited to groups commanding large 
resources; these have no interest in actually deploying this.

It depends on the intentions of the developers. MDR anthrax is actually
pretty optimal from a nutter point of view if you have the deployment
infrastructure and a lot of the agent (which nutters typically don't 
have, thankfully).

I'm generally aware of the neuronal work (though I haven't read the specific
papers you cite).  I think there is a lot of potential with respect
to the repair of motor neurons -- with regard to cognitive functional
areas I'm less optimistic (this may involve key developmental gene
expression and brain functional organization processes).

Regarding myoblast repair, I'm more well informed.  Aeiveos Sciences
Group was one of the first organizations to culture avian myoblasts
in order to investigate avian oxidative stress resistance (this was
in 1996-7 though the work was never published).

So yes, in general I agree that stem cell abilities can compensate
for some, perhaps many of the declines that occur with aging.  But
I would argue that they are not a universal solution.  Mammals simply
do not have genomic programs that have the organ (or at least limb)
regrowth properties of the genomic programs of lizards, lobsters, etc.

But I would argue that other, perhaps older, genomic programs
may have solved some of the problems of organ renewal to a
better extent than the mammalian program has.  In mammals
it only seems to be really effective in the liver and in
the blood cells (to some extent).  That leaves a lot of other
organ systems that can fail and cause a "premature" death.

Whether or not those programs have been developed in various
species, there is no reason to believe that one could not
select a relatively "perfect" genome and regenerate an organ
within an individual.  Sequoia trees manage to do it for
three or four thousand years.

At one point in history, some conflicts were done
this way.  The biblical story of David and Goliath
was an example.  Opposing armies would line up,
shout insults at each other, then each side would
send up its biggest and baddest dude, who would go
at it mano a mano.  The demoralized losing side
would generally run off with little actual bloodshed.
Ah, the good old days.

I propose we do likewise today, except with mechanized
battlebots.

Anders writes that some of us, including Avatar Polymorph and I,
missed the point of Robert's question about Sasha's writings,
namely how it could be possible for us to keep alive his "spirit"
in the sense of his visions.  That is so.  I over-react whenever
anyone speaks in such a way that makes it sound as though a
person can be kept alive by means of books he or she wrote, or
by children that he or she may have had, or by other legacies.

To the main point, then, as Anders did carefully rephrase it:

I did manage in 1988 to write down a succinct list of 15 or so 
fundamental beliefs I had which I called "Lee Corbin's Manifesto".
(I should dig them up, but I don't think that there is anything
on that list that would be especially provocative to regular 
readers of this list, or to extropians who make much effort to
keep themselves up to speed.)  When I mentioned that I haven't
had any new *fundamental* ideas for about the last 15 years, it
was that list to which I was referring, and about which Eliezer
mentioned that this was the saddest thing that he'd ever read
on Extropians, or some similar words to that effect bemoaning
that this was such a long time for one to go without having
new ideas.

The nice thing about such a format, however, is that it very
*concisely* exhibits ideas.  Can we essay such a numbered list
of Sasha's ideas which could be then "developed or extended in
the light of new information"?  I stress that each item most
desirably should be limited to exactly one sentence, if at all
possible.

Some random musings with no particular cosmic meaning.

In times of crisis, one often hears the phrase "Lets
just take one day at a time."  There is even a
quasi-religious song to this effect, first recorded
by country singer Tammy Whinette, whose name literally
means, small female whiner.

In the latest family crisis someone utter the phrase,
at which time I immediately wondered, aloud, I fear:
how many days at a time we should take it when things
are going well?  If the crisis deepens, do we take it
in smaller time subunits?  Would the ultimately bad
situation force us to take it one chronon at a time?
Would that represent the worst things could possibly
get?  Or just the most we can take?  Would then crises
be quantized at the finest scale?  Would the smallest
quantum subdivision of a crisis then be a crison?

On the other end of the crisis scale, what if
nanoclause or singularityclaus comes along and
solves our every problem beyond our wildest and
most optimistic expectation.  How many days would
we take at a time then?  Could things ever be so
good that we take an eon at a time?  If we identified
and solved every last crison, would we take eternity
at a time?  If we decide to take more than one day
at a time, could we *cause* things to get better?
Take it where?  What is at a time?

I have reluctantly concluded that I am not the
best person to have around in times of crisis.

    This is the 74'th update of my fly longevity experiments. Average
temperature was 25.3 C during this run. Here I retest the latest batch of
coconut juice, which had a null effect in the last run. I also retest the
(now aged) rice protein, originally used to good effect in runs with poor
overall survival (#56 & #57). I also check to see if adding a little extra
water further improves survival.
    This run shows that it was no fluke that the current batch of coconut
juice doesn't work at increasing fly longevity. It is not a high priority,
but I will have to test various different brands of coconut juice in
future to see if there are consistent differences.
    Rice protein also turned out to be inactive. However this is the same
batch of protein originally used in runs #56 & #57. Possibly "aging" of
this protein removed its beneficial property. Someday I'll have to buy a
fresh batch of rice protein, to see if there are any differences with old
protein.
    The fact that adding extra water to the rice protein had a null result
is not surprising, since the flies did not live long enough to experience
any dehydration stress. In any case I now add a little extra tape to the
cardboard sealer on the bottles, so late life dehydration is less of a
worry.

I was out shopping for lead shot, not to blast
hapless beasts or even hapless flying ceramic
targets, but merely to use as a vibration damper
for the handlebar of a certain antique motorcycle
which I am still torturing into reluctant service,
much to the dismay of PETM.  Filling the bar with
lead shot dampens out high frequency vibration, an
old Indian trick taught to me many years ago by
Chief Sitting Bullshit.

I went to a number of sports shops, only to learn
that one can no longer purchase lead shot.  The
state of Taxifornia, being overrun by wild Gaians,
has banned lead shot.  Evidently the wild ducks
and geese have been devouring the lead pellets,
causing their offspring to be born with three
bills, not unlike Blinky the fish, born just
downstream of the Springfield nuclear plant.

As an interesting sidelight, I noticed while at the
sporting goods store that paintball guns are now called
paintball markers.  Evidently the wild Gaians
were not at all pleased with the notion of two-
legged devils running around in NATURE trampling
bugs and such, blasting each other with paintball
guns.  Legislation was introduced to have these
devices banned, but fortunately, unfettered capitalism
came quickly galloping to the rescue and instantly
converted their entire product line from paintball
guns to paintball markers.  These are tools, you see,
for marking things, such as constuction sites with
enormous splats of flourescent paint which, in a system
analogous to international sign language carry a specific
meaning to construction workers, such as "work over here."

It isn't the manufacturers fault should proles run
wild in NATURE blasting each other with their
paintball markers (which were never ever intended for
that purpose) any more than Black and Decker would
be liable if chainsaw wars were to suddenly break out
(as they already have on Mars, involving astro-marine
Duke Nukem.)

Anyway, this ad, from page 6G, San Jose Mercury News,
15 December 2002 actually says:

"EXCELLERATOR"  5.0 Electronic Paintball Marker
-LCD Display
-Improved Trigger Response
-Increased Rate of Fire
-Expansion Chamber
-Volumizer & More!

Only 199.95!  (was 239.95)

A photo shows the traditional CO2 cartridge and paint-
ball ammo holder (which must have been present even in
the grossly unimproved 4.0 paintball marker (which in
those primitive unenlightened times, were actually called
paintball guns.))

A number of questions come to mind.  What is electronic
about a paintball marker?  What does the LCD display
actually do?  Trigger response was improved over what?
Did it fail to mark before the improved 5.0 version?
Increased rate of fire?  Should it not be increased
rate of mark?  Expansion chamber?  Is that what we
4.0 users once called a barrel?  Volumizer?  I am at a
complete loss for an explanation.  & More?  Why are they
dragging Max and Natasha into this?

Finally, it occurred to me that all this pointless debate
over gun control could be easily put to rest simply by
having all firearms renamed markers, for there are no
marker control laws.  We could have fully automatic
markers, zip markers, shot markers, hot glue markers,
marker shows, son of a marker, etc.  A whole new
industry would be born, just reprinting billions of
bumper stickers: They can have my marker when they
pry it from my cold dead fingers, etc.

Just think of the possibilities.

Bullets would be used only to mark things, such as
targets, old cars at the junkyard, dead criminals, etc.
It would have an international meaning, not unlike
the universally recognized figurine which symbolizes
the women's restroom, for instance.  A bullet hole
would carry the universally-recognized definition:
"I shot this."

What is so interesting about it is that Chomsky, along with many left
wing sociologists, have come to define collective violence by the right
wing as 'insane' or 'irrational' while defining collective violence by
unionists, anti-war demonstrators, Palestinians, leftist
revolutionaries, etc as entirely rational (see "Collective Violence",
Barkan and Snowden). Similarly, they avoid studying state terrorism, as
well as other state conducted forms of collective violence.

Chomsky's other problem is the left wing attitude of not judging
proponents of discredited ideologies and agendas (such as those of
Holocaust deniers), of holding to the absurd belief that just because
we all have free speech means that all possible opinions or inane
absurdities deserve a fair hearing, and not just one, but repeated fair
hearings long after such have been tested, judged, and tossed into the
dustbin of history. He believes that as long as there is at least on
more rube out there willing to entertain any foolish idea, that anybody
willing to spout them should be published and promoted.

Of course, there is a self interest motive in his attitude. So much of
his own beliefs have been relegated to the dustbin of history, yet he
still thinks that we are all entitled to his opinion.

Doug Skrecky, I sincerely commend you, pal.  You are a
classic example of the traditional scientist, using the
time-honored scientific method, prodding nature for answers
to her most perplexing problems.  You have been patiently
collecting and organizing data on these fly experiments
for at least as long as I can remember, trying this and
that, enduring tasteless wisecracks from the peanut gallery,
forging on and on with undaunted patience and courage.  We
are proud to be associated with you, bud.

May you someday be inducted into the scientist hall of fame.

I missed Anders' comments and Lee's response.  Catching up...

I was *not* thinking about a Tipler-ian Omega Point kind of
scenario (with lots of math involved).  I do think the idea
of keeping the ideas of transhumanists alive and extending
them is a very good one (it could help in the scenario I
was actually thinking of).  What I was really going for was
whether the recreation of a resonable facsimile could be
managed?  I could see a few possibilities.  One would
be a nanotech based assembly of a body & brain.  Difficult,
but not I think impossible.  Another might be a nanorobot
imprinting/recreation of the specific neural network of
an individual.  The third might be the recreation of the
individual in a VR that could interact with humans (ala
the Turing test).  The fourth might be recreating the
individual in the uploaded world (e.g. the Matrix but
with no external instantiation).

Being the pack rat that I am I have a lot of "documents" (financial
records, *lots* of files of various projects I worked on, etc.)  Other
people write a lot from a "professional" standpoint (speaking to the point
Anders and Lee may be making).  Still others keep journals or diaries.
Now-a-days we certainly have the ability to sit down and do video taped
interviews. For example, Greg's recordings at the various Extro
conferences or as Natasha mentioned, Roy Walford's work documenting the
Biosphere experiences.

The point is that as we go forward during this century we are going to
have an increasing understanding of the fundamental processes for how
human minds work and a much greater capacity for simulating a human mind.
I was trying to get to the question of what more might be done to have a
sufficient record that it becomes feasible to really "recreate" someone?
At least to the extent that they walk, talk, act and may actually "think"
like the original.  I can hear Damien B. screaming now 'but its not me!'.
True enough -- but it might be close enough that it could turn out novels
that Damien B. *would* have written. What problems does this solve?  Two I
think.  First it may provide some comfort people who lose a loved one.
Second, it may be able to effectively extend the work (knowledge base) of
the original in the event that they suffer an accident.  That sounds
pretty difficult I know but considering the increase in computational
capacity we can expect it might be worth thinking about.

I won't provide any spoilers, but it is to some extent what StarTrek
Nemisis is about.

Chomsky has, in fact, tried to claim, like other Holocaust deniers of
the 'lite' variety, that denying that there were gas chambers and ovens
doesn't detract from the heinousness of the Holocaust. 

On the contrary, if you can disprove that Jewish internees were not
systematically exterminated by chemical means, then you are only a step
away from claiming that those that died in the camps did so from a)
excessive labor (for which there is no international agreement
prohibiting), b) sickness and lack of medicine (which is the allies
fault for blockading the Axis powers, and otherwise is not a crime), or
c) starvation after the camps were abandoned by the Nazis and before
they were taken over by Allied troops (which is also obviously not the
fault of the Nazis and not a war crime).

Ergo, by lending credence and legitimacy to the opinions of the
deniers, Chomsky aids in the legitimizing of genocide, as he has
already done with regard to Cambodia, and is thus a serial apologist
for genocide.

Frankly, Jeff, I am not disconcerted at all (nor, I am sure, is John)

Actually, they are. First off, you have the UCC, the Uniform Commercial
Code. Secondly you have GATT, which has been around since the early
20th century. Thirdly, you have regional rules, like NAFTA, EUCC, etc.

On the contrary, the US has had such rules since the 1930's, and a
number of other countries have them as well. Incorporating only limits
the liability of stockholders, not of officers of the corporation who
violate the law.

There have been notable exceptions to this. Under the British, the East
India Company took over by force the subcontinent of India, after
acting for years as just commercial agents in a few ports and
commercial centers. The US has also waged war for corporate interests
in central america, specifically Nicaragua and Guatemala, in the early
20th century.

It could also be said that the drug war in Columbia is a war to protect
the domestic US market for consumer intoxicants from cheap foreign competition.

Quite. Furthermore, anything done by individuals to themselves, or
between consenting individuals, which pretty much covers all
'victimless crime'.

THere are, however, frequently externalities that are not considered,
which I've illustrated before. For example: if I have minor children to
care for, and am legally responsible for, then in intoxicating myself I
am abdicating responsibility for them while I am intoxicated. If I
become addicted to an intoxicant, I have physiologically and
psychologically abdicated the ability to make responsible decisions
free of the influence of the addiction.

While I frankly don't care what people do to themselves or between
themselves as consenting adults, doing so while responsible for kids is
as much an act of externalizing costs onto others as driving drunk or
high, or polluting other people's air or water.
 
If you are insured against potential damages to others from such, fine,
go to it, have fun and let me know how to contact your insurance
carrier. If you aren't, then I have a problem with your behavior,
unless you can post some other sort of bond.

I dont' wish to attract numerous rude flames from those on the list who
are militantly pro-drug to the point of flaming anybody with a rational
libertarian argument such as that above. If you don't agree with my
opinion, so be it, but don't think that your posting rude responses is
going to change my opinion (I'm only saying this because that was the
response from a few individuals the last time I made the above statement).

Not me screaming. The fractal and commodious `memory box' you describe has
also been described by Rudy Rucker (and others) and has many merits. In fact
I recently agreed that just such a copy/emulation of Robert would allow us
to enjoy his continuing output long after he's been run down by an angry

Some of his ideas have been implemented in the past in various internet
startups he worked for. These were essentially ideas in the realm of
intelligent agents, reputation brokering, etc. which are now embedded
in the reality of the internet that most of us use them every day
without stopping and noticing how they have been rendered into code and
web pages.

I frankly doubt that you've been so bereft of ideas. I have noticed
that some of my best ideas come to me either in my sleep or just as I
am going to sleep (I've called this 'Dream CAD' in a few posts in the
past). Remembering them, or conciously getting up to write them down
has been the main hindrance to doing anything with them. I had one such
the other day as I was falling asleep and got up and typed it into my
laptop....

I'll bet you are in a similar situation. I have heard of techniques to
train yourself to get up when you have a dream or idea in your sleep...

I recommend contacting Extropian Simon Levy to get in touch with his
ex-wife and his son, who currently have his writings that are not still
available on the web. Simon is not on this list, but I am sure that Max
or Natasha knows how to get in touch with him.

Isn't this called fair-weather libertarianism?

I believe there's a maxim along the lines of: `If they come for [X] in the
morning and you do nothing the prevent it, even if you despise the son of a
bitch, don't be surprised when they come for you in the afternoon.'

OK, I stand corrected. My apologies to Lee and Avatar (and Robert)! I
still think it is better to look at the here-and-now, since we will have
to do without Sasha for many many years to come even if supertech comes
around. If we just have to base our emotional handling of loss by the
invocation of hoped for technology, we are no better off than someone 
invoking divinities to do it.

All the information we leave behind us can in some sense constrain a
model of ourselves, it is just that some of it is awfully hard to use.
My messy desktop tells a complex story of my various projects, habits
and occasional actions, but it only tells part of the whole story.
Similarly for my emails - they tell a bit about my mental state and what
I may think and believe, but not the whole story. 

A whole mind is around 10^16 bits or more, and may change over the
passage of a lifetime. If we assume that one second differences are the
same "moment" we get around 10^9 such slices, or a total information
content of 10^25 bits to encode a lifetime. That is roughly the number
of degrees of freedom we need to constrain. A picture of a person taken
at a certain point would constrain the mind in that slice to some extent
- given the orientation of the eyes and the place, we could deduce the
input to the visual system to some extent, lets say around 10^6 bits at
best. An email like this would be the result of a few minutes mental
effort, likely constraining my frontal lobes and speech centers over 600
slices (it would be great here with an edit history) with a few thousand
degrees of freedom, also ending up with around 10^6 bits. So maybe we
could assume (in this happy dance of handwaving and picking numbers from
the air :-) that each piece of information on average produces 10^6
constraints (MRI scans provide a lot more, a messy desk a lot less). So
to get a total constraint we need 10^19 pieces of evidence. How many can
we actually get? I imagine that an ordinary person leaves one piece of
evidence every hour or so (government records, surveillance camera
images, work, photos, email, surf logs). That would produce around
600,000 pieces of evidence over a lifetime; totally it would be 6e11
bits, just 10^-13 of the degrees of freedom. That is unfortunately not
even enough to constrain one mental slice (our real goal). If we assume
one piece of evidence every second, then we get roughly enough evidence
to constrain a slice at the end. That sounds like a highly documented 
life.

I guess a "good enough" simulation is far easier. After all, I would 
estimate that a simulation of me more like the real me than any other 
existing person would be "good enough". That means it belongs to the 
10^-9 fraction of state space (2^10^16 states or so) closest to me right 
now. That is nearly 2^10^16 states (the division hardly changes 
anything), and the 6e11 bits of information I might leave behind is 
enough to constrain the model to be within this cluster.

[I can't tell who wrote the text Mike Lorrey quoted, but felt it needed
to be included for context anyway]

Lorrey, you really know how to take a strong case and turn it into a
strawman.  Relative to the cases you cite above, the holocaust is
singularly insane and evil.  Leftists are often guitly of ignoring the
mass violence of communism, or of excusing it relative to that of
right-wing socialists, but the violence done by Palestinians, for
example, doesn't even begin to hold a candle to that of the Nazis or the
Communists.  Sheesh.

Spike,
       I suspose everyone on this list has heard the story already but if not 
I'll tell it any way.
       Back in the sixties computers were huge installations that required 
their own rooms, power supplies, air conditioning, etc.  Corporations sat up 
special computer committees to approve or disapprove purchases of computers 
and computer services.
       Then came the pocket calculators that might just as easily been called 
computers.  When I asked why they were called calculators I was told it was a 
marketing ploy.  If you called it a computer it would possibly have to go 
before the corporate computer committee to buy a single calculator.

This still happens today. A note to software publishers... I've found myself
hampered in the past by having to go through approval processes to buy
software. However, I've always been able to buy a book, and install any
software that comes with it on the CD. When targeting government and maybe
corporate customers, you might be able to sneak in by bundling your software
as a book, with CDs included; this is true especially where you think the
interested parties will be smaller areas in organisations, maybe run by
technical people,  that have their own budgets, but have to abide by
corporate wide restraints. This probably has it's limits however; I can
imagine that a 10K book that comes with 10 CDs and 3 months consulting and
installation might start to raise a few eyebrows...

Do George W and Saddam each have to build their own battlebots, no outside 
advice allowed?  That would be... interesting.  I wonder who'd win.

Personally, I think that George W and Saddam should duke it out in piloted 
battlemechs, but I wouldn't ask them to build the battlemechs themselves.

Would such alleged or actual practices make it your (or the

The above is supposted to be an argument against "drugs" as some

  There are drugs and there are drugs.  People getting high and 
not hurting anyone is none of your business.  You do agree to

The last time, iirc, you made a much more inflammatory statement

depending on whether or not you think it justifies any part of 
the "War on Drugs".

A good friend who knows of my interest in Cruithne is Chief Scientist 
at the Exploratorium.  (http://www.exo.net/~pauld/)  He was attending 
the American Geophysical Union meeting last week 
(http://agu.org/meetings/fm02/   Apparently Cruithne counts as Geophysics.)

My friend said he talked to the people who are into Cruithne, and the 
"plausible" justification for calling it a moon is that Earth isn't in 
the gap of the horseshoe orbit that Cruithne follows. (!)

If you plot Cruithne's orbit in a frame of reference that co-rotates 
with Earth (which you have to do to see the horseshoe) it turns out 
that there is a gap in Cruithne's orbit, and Earth's position isn't in 
the gap.  Cruithne's orbit is highly inclined to the Earth's, which is 
why they can still miss one another.  I don't see why that makes 
Cruithne a moon, but that's the justification that was given.

Continuing Spoiler thread...

I thought Sherkaner was merely in communication with the Focused.  This
allowed him to encourage them in their off-the-books activities.  My
interpretation was that the videomancy was a cover story that Sherkaner
used for his communication with the Focused.  I didn't see any
indication that he thought it was hocus pocus, or that he thought he
was in communication with supernatural beings.  There was no indication
of how the communication moved from the intervention during the code
breaking to a two-way street, but I didn't mind that.

I thought there was an indication that the Focused had some amount of
independence, particularly if they could convince themselves that it
was during a dream-like state.  In that state, they could tell
themselves that they weren't violating orders, and could be more free.

I loved the story, even though I was ready to give up on it until I was
more than a third through it.  Pham's ignorant old man guise had me
seething, and I didn't see how Vinge was going to get him out if it.
But he did a very convincing job of it.  I was expecting a deus ex
machina, but I thought the conversion was a completely fair twist in
the story.

Does anyone see any obvious holes in my interpretation?

I just wanted to share what a success the Creekside/Ventureville Cryofeast was.  A nice, intimate group gathered together in our beautiful facilities for fascinating conversation and good food.  

At the appointed time we gathered outside and planted trees to be living time capsules/markers so as the years pass by we can recall the growth of the place as compared to them.

One of our most interesting guests was Harry Braun, a nationally recognized expert in alternative power sources.  David Pizer and I learned so much from him that in time a high-tech windmill may be seen on our property due to his influence! lol

For many hours we just sat in the main lodge great room and discussed many fun and exciting subjects.  This was may first Cryofeast, so it was especially cool.  I hope the next time we have one even more people will come.  If you happen to talk to a person who did attend you will be in the presence of someone who will endorse what I have said here.

best wishes,

But I was not questioning wether a "higher intelligence" could be 
created. Because that is obviously possible. Simple improvement that 
cold be suggested and understood allready today::

     - Total photographic recall, both senses and feeling

     - Perfect math skills, knowing results just by thinking of problems

     - Improved logic, built in expert system for aplicable problems

     - Mood improvements, creating "a lust to know"

But these are all pretty banale compared to how much more intelligent we 
could imagine a SI.

I was wondering how it would be like to be a higher intelligence. How 
their lifes would be, compared to ours. I wanted some examples on why 
posthuman is better than human. I wanted a reason to become posthuman.

In that process I want to "understand" Super Intelligent posthumans. And 
I am not shure that the "we will understand them as little as a dog 
understands us" argument applies.

It is not hard to imagine that there is a sharp divide between animal 
intelligence and human intelligence. But perhaps a super intelligence 
isn't capable of understanding anything more than us. Given enough time. 
So perhaps, given enough time, brains, and good ideas, we can understand 
what it is like to be an SI.

However, I don't really believe that I can understand a posthuman, if it 
is Super Intelligent, but I do believe that it is in the best scientific 
tradition to try. Even if it's difficult, bordering on the impossible.

I don't want proof that it can be done. Just some heureka! insights will 
do. ;-) I need better arguments.

No, it counts as a planetary object for a planetary science meeting.
The AGU is a good planetary science meeting as well as a good
meeting for solar physicists.  The AGU and the DPS (division of
the planetary sciences of the American Astronomical Society)
are normal meetings for planetary scientists to attend (this Spring
it will be in Nice, France, co-sponsored with the European counterpart:
the European Geophysical Society: EGS). It's an extremely
large meeting- not my favorite because there are about 10,000 people
there, and it's sometimes hard to meet the people that you want
to talk with. The advantage is that you can mingle in fields outside
of your own- I usually attend a lot of time-frequency methods
talks when I'm at the AGU, because the geophysicists are the most
expert with those techniques.

This object is an asteroid. (Yes I know about how horseshoe
orbits look)

Cruithne moves about the Sun, the minimum distance to the Earth is
40 lunar orbital radii, *well outside the Hill's sphere*. This
distinguishing characteristic is well known in celestial mechanics
and astronomy, it is the surface of zero velocity, based on gravity
and used to distinguish between satellites and independent solar
system bodies.

I am not keen on your friend's explanation. It is attempting to
explain this object with how its orbit "looks" (say, epicycles?),
rather than the physics that govern the objects actions (gravity).

I couldn't find alot on the Web about Hill spheres (starting
with the three body problem might be better)- you need Danby or
some other standard Celestial Mechanics text for a good explanation
of Hill spheres.  But here's something:

As I see it, when it comes to the questions "Who sent the anthrax?"
and "Why the focus on Iraq?" there are three theories doing the
rounds. Theory A, the public consensus, says: we don't know who
sent the anthrax, and Iraq is all about preemption. Theory B says
the anthrax was sent by an insider, and Iraq war fever is being
whipped up for reasons unrelated to national security. Theory C
says the anthrax came from Iraq, and Iraq is being targeted
because of that. There are other theories possible (the anthrax
came from Al Qaeda but not from Iraq, it's all about Bush family
pride, etc.), but those three are illustrative of the possibilities.

I regard Theory B as implausible, because of the Florida
connection. I regard Theory A as implausible, because the US
government is clearly choosing not to highlight the Florida
connection. That leaves Theory C.

Iraq used Vollum, sought Ames in 1988, probably has it now

History of Iraq's biological weapons program
http://www.iraqwatch.org/wmd/biological.html

The anthrax letters look ineffectual only if you think they were
meant to kill lots of people. They make much more sense if they
are read as a *threat* to kill lots of people, many more than on
9/11, with a little actual anthrax enclosed as proof of concept.
They were ineffectual only in that they failed to halt the attack
on Afghanistan. But I note that there hasn't been an attack on
Iraq yet, despite months of predictions that it's just around
the corner. This is why I think, even if the inspectors turn up
a "material breach", there will be no war, only the destruction
of the exposed facilities.

And I don't understand why people think anthrax is a poor choice
of bioweapon. It kills, you can disperse it in public and people
won't notice, and by the time the symptoms develop it's usually
too late. If the 9/11 hijackers had instead each flown an
anthrax-loaded cropduster over a major city, there could easily
have been a million casualties.

Two worst-case anthrax scenarios:

1-3 million dead in Washington DC (p54)

1 million dead in the Bay Area

I can't tell which conspiracy theory you're criticizing - the
theory that 9/11 had a state sponsor, or the theory that Bush
et al have covered up the evidence of this. The evidence of
state sponsorship is circumstantial but multiple: Palm Beach County
links the hijackers and the anthrax, and Iraq is known to have
liaised with Al Qaeda and to have anthrax weaponization knowhow.
This could have been discussed in public and in detail long ago.
It has not - not by the White House, at any rate. So I conclude
that someone decided not to do so, at least not yet. The question
then is why. I see three possibilities:

(1) They've judged that circumstantial evidence will not be good
enough in the court of world opinion. Maybe they're not even
absolutely certain themselves.
http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/transcripts/2002/sep/020918.ydstie.html

(2) They've decided that it's best to hide the truth for some
strategic reason - the public would make rash demands for
retaliation or capitulation, the world would realize that you
can blackmail a superpower with a handful of dust, or whatever.
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/772794/posts?page=27#27

(3) They're covering up something politically embarrassing -
previous cover-ups of Iraqi-sponsored terrorism, covert 1980s
assistance to the Iraqi weapons programs.
http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-mylroie052902.asp

>So in effect you throw up so much chaff that the people rubber stamp 
>whatever insanity you wish?  That is not acceptable.

First and foremost, this is just my guess as to the facts, it's
not an apologia for war or an endorsement of the alleged cover-up.
If you think "Iraq did it", of course that makes the case for
war seem a lot stronger, but then if you think that the anthrax
threat is real, most of the pro-war talk seems a little naive.
And I do have some sympathy for the paternalistic possibility (2),
even though it makes a mockery of democracy, because the prospect
of massive bioterrorism *is* grim and terrifying, and it would
be tempting to spare people that fear as much as possible. The
main thing to be said against such a policy of deception is:
surely the people have a right to know that fighting this war
runs the risk of such retaliation. But I think they know that
by now anyway.

Finally, although I do think that the immediate cause of the
stand-off with Iraq is the anthrax, I agree with the original
post in this thread that there's a global strategic dimension
to it as well. WMD proliferation is getting worse and worse,
there was always a potential for someone to cross the line and
use it via terrorism, and Iraq crossed the line first. Iraq
may ultimately be isolated, destabilized, and defanged, but I
doubt that the situation can be reversed entirely. We may end
up with a world in which the larger, older powers (USA, EU,
India, China) have conventional armies and defenses against
unconventional threats, and in which a host of smaller countries
develop chemical and biological weapons as defensive deterrents
which only occasionally see offensive use.

I will shed some light on these questions for you.
modern paintball markers are now controlled by microprocessors. These actuate 
3-way, 5-way and even 14-way solenoid valves that fire the Gun, oops sorry 
'Marker'.
The rate of fire and efficiency of the Gun, ooops marker is controlled by 
electronics rather than mechanics. This makes them highly efficient giving 
upto 1300 rounds from one gas fill, firing at 300 feet per second at rates of 
up to 20 rounds per second.
In addition, The Hoppers (ammo holder) and Gas systems on high end markers 
are also electronic.

The LCD indicates the state of the 'Ultra slaughtering death sprayer' oops I 
mean marker and also indicates all the variables that can be set, like Dwell, 
Rate of fire, etc. The expansion chamber in the marker you saw is because it 
runs on CO2. This must be in gas form in order for the marker to use it. The 
CO2 in the gas bottle is liquid so an expansion chamber is used to expand it 
to a gas before use.
The volumiser is a small expansion chamber that increases the amount of gas 
behind the valve. This reduces drop off in pressure when the marker is 
rapidly fired.
The trigger has been tuned for a shorter lighter pull, which increases rate 
of fire and accuracy.

The technology level of paintball markers is far beyond any other firearms 
and this level of marker is designed for mid level tournament use rather than 
the stereotypical woodland battle. Paintball is rapidly moving out of the 
woods for several reasons. One is the environmental aspect of 'nutters with 
guns' trampling the forest, but the main reason is that nearly all Paintball 
tournaments are now held in flat fields full of inflatable geometrically 
shaped barricades. The highest level tournaments are held at sport stadiums 
or arenas.

I think the whole Gun/Marker argument is just a bit of Anal PR spinning. 
Technically Markers are just airguns. I think normal firearms should be 
called "Remote perforation delivery systems"

As you state correctly, there are many more possible answers. But simple 
deductive logic is not appropriate until one knows all N possible 
answers and has negative proofs for N-1 of them. Therefore, your logic 
is faulty.

From: Jeff Davis [mailto:jrd1415@yahoo.com] 

"Michael Dickey forwarded some remarks in this thread
from MaxPlumm from the bulletin board.  Thank you for
the submission Michael."

Thanks for your comments Jeff, It is interesting to see both sides of this
discussion.  I just had some comments on what you wrote in response to
MaxPlumm.

In response to MaxPlumm's comments 

> I must take some issues with your interpretations of the 1954 Geneva
Accords. For starters, I cannot see
how anyone can rationally argue that the government of South Vietnam
(already recognized by 30 nations and up
for UN membership at the time of the conference) Should have submitted to an
election to unify the country
with the North...<

You said 

"No, there was no "South" Vietnam.  There was only Vietnam, an "associate
state" of the French Union.  The territory of this state was the combined
area of the 'north' and 'south'--the area associated with the Vietnam of
today.  The whole country."

And

"I direct your attention to that last bit: "...Vietnam, of which Cochin
China was then recognized to be a
part."  So from 1949 to the onset of the Geneva Conference, Vietnam was all
of Vietnam, the combined regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China. "

And then point to thise site
http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0861793.html.  However, this site also
says 

"Two Vietnams

As a temporary expedient after the Vietnamese defeat of French forces,
Vietnam was divided into two parts along a line approximating the 17th
parallel (lat. 17°N). North Vietnam, where the Viet Minh were the strongest,
went to the Communist government of Ho Chi Minh, while South Vietnam was
placed under the control of the French-backed government of Bao Dai. Freedom
of movement between the two areas was to be permitted for a period of 300
days, thereby facilitating the regroupment of Communist forces in the north
and non-Communist forces in the south. During this period some 900,000
people, many of whom were Catholics or individuals fleeing the land reform
program initiated by the Ho Chi Minh government, migrated south. The
unification of the country under one government was to be effected through
general elections, later scheduled for July, 1956. These elections, which
were considered likely to favor the Communists, were never held; the South
Vietnamese government refused to participate on the grounds that it had not
signed the Geneva agreements and was therefore not bound by them."

How can you state that there was 'no south vietnam' and then reference this
site which seems to clearly indicate the existence of a south vietnam?  I
suppose it depends on what your definition of nationhood is.  

The Geneva agreements, it seemed, allowed a communist country of 17 million
to vote out of existence a non-communist country of 13 million in a 'free
election'.  Not surprisingly, the south didn't go for this.  I can
understand why, this would be like 10 of my neighbors signing an agreement
that they can hold a 'free election' to kill me and distribute my money
among them.  Even though they would let me cast my vote, is that something
you consider a 'free election'?  Perhaps I am just missing some facts here,
but how can you call that a reasonable action and support it, or conversely
object to actions taken in opposition to it?

Given the fact that 900,000 north vietnamese fled and I believe only some
10,000 south vietnamese migrated to the north when the boarder was open, it
seems many more people preferred the south over the communist north.  

That same site continues

"A few months after the partition of Vietnam in 1954, South Vietnam withdrew
from the French Union and thus attained complete sovereignty. In a
referendum held in Oct., 1955, the electorate deposed Bao Dai as chief of
state and approved the establishment of a republic with Ngo Dinh Diem as
president. The republic, proclaimed on Oct. 26, 1955, was recognized as the
legal government of Vietnam by the United States, France, Great Britain, and
other Western powers. "

So south vietnam was recognized as an independent entity by 30 nations,
including the US, France, Great Brittian and many others, but it wasn't
recognized by China, North Vietnam, or the Soviet Union.  So what do you
consider nationhood to be?  How many countries must recognize a nation
before you consider it one?  It seems you keep claiming that the south was
not a state because the north signed a document that said the south is part
of the north in one unified vietnam?  (or rather, a 'free' election would be
held in which the North would be allowed to determine the destiny of the
south)  Yet the south, and many western nations never signed.  

It continues

"North Vietnam, meanwhile, continued to be dominated by Ho Chi Minh, who
maintained good relations with both China and the USSR, receiving enormous
aid from both countries while skillfully protecting the independence of his
country. A three-year economic rehabilitation program (1958-60) and a
five-year plan (1961-66), financed with Soviet and Chinese aid, were aimed
at improving both industry and agriculture. ... Much national effort was
also devoted to the support of Communist insurgents in South Vietnam (the
Viet Cong), who operated under the leadership of the National Liberation
Front, an organization alleged to be indigenous to South Vietnam."

The north was receiving enormous aid from both China and the USSR and was
supporting forces intent on overthrowing the government of the south, which
was recognized by 30 nations and up for UN membership, and you think it
unreasonable for the US to act in the favor of the people of the south?  You
claim to be a seeker of the truth, yet you reference this site that seems to
completely contradict what you hold the truth to be?  I am not sure I am
following your reasoning here.

"Now the prior error pretty much invalidates everything that
follows--anything premised on separate north and
south prior to the accords--but regarding the election, you must take note
of the fact that representatives from India, Canada, and Poland made up the
International Control Comission, charged with carrying out the peace
agreement, and woulda, shoulda, coulda been there to oversee the elections.
In addition there ain't no one on the planet not being spoon fed in an
Alzheimer's ward who doesn't acknowledge that Ho, as the dominant political
personality and the 'hero' who won independence for his country, was going
to sweep those elections.  Fairly."

I am not sure what you mean by 'prior error'  considering that site says

"As a temporary expedient after the Vietnamese defeat of French forces,
Vietnam was divided into two parts along a line approximating the 17th
parallel (lat. 17°N). North Vietnam, where the Viet Minh were the strongest,
went to the Communist government of Ho Chi Minh, while South Vietnam was
placed under the control of the French-backed government of Bao Dai."

It seems to me you are saying that the elections would have been 'free' due
to representatives from Canada, Poland, India and others, and that everyone
would have freely voted for a unified vietnam, and that since this vote
never took place and the fight for a free south was supported by the US,
that the US was in the wrong for supporting a independent free southern
vietnam?  Considering 900,000 North Vietnamese fled to the south, do you
still consider it a reasonable assertation to believe?  And these were only
the people who had the ability to up and move to the south.  I am sure the
30,000 peasants killed during the land reforms would have moved as well, had
they not been killed.  I still don't understand how someone, let alone a
person who might consider themselves an extropian, could ever consider it
wrong to fight for freedom of the individual.  It seems that you think the
south *wanted* to be part of the communist north in a whole unified country,
and that the US blocked that every step of the way.  If that was the case,
why wasn't there a mass emmigration into the north by people in the south?

"This is just anti-communist dribble."

One could just as easily say your comments 'are just pro-communist dribble'

"Ho was an authentic Vietnamese nationalist and the north was not 'the
north' at the time.  Whether or not he was
communist, how much, and of what sort, well, it's all irrelevant.  Unless
anti-communism self-justifies
anything it does. (Like say, Wahabism.)"

Given the track record of communist governments (mao, 30 million killed,
stalin, 10 million) I don't see how you could *not* fear the spread of
communism, assuming you prefer freedom and life over non-freedom and death.
The fact that Ho was communist could hardly be considered 'irrelevant'
considering that it entails the enslavement and murder of a good portion of
the population (which had all ready occurred under Ho rule in the norht!)
Compare your statement to "Ho was an 'authentic nationalist' so it does not
matter if he was a Nazi."  You seem to assert as long as a person is a
'nationilist' it matters not that he supports a totalitarian collectivized
state which did and will likely result in the slaughter and enslavement of a
good majority of the population.

"I'd have to see some documentation.  I've seen a lot already, but nothing
about this, except for the Soviet
and Chinese recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.  I suspect
that the writer of this piece
would not view with favor *those* recognitions. "

Consdiering the track record of Communism, which you seem to not take into
account, I can understand why *any* reasonable person who prefers freedom
and life over enslavement and death which prefer a country be supported by
the US over China or Russia.  If South Vietnam was indeed recognized as an
independent state by 30 other nations and up for UN membership, would this
meet your criteria for 'nationhood'?  If not, what would?  What if 15
nations recognized it as part of the north, while 30 recognized it as its
own independent entity?  (How many did recognize it, btw, I am sure there
were at least 3, the North, China, and the Soviet Union, but where there any
others?) Is nationhood based on how many other countries recognize / do not
recognize your independence?  Is it based on the population of those
countries?  The military might?  What?

> so that in my mind gives them the

"Again, the North and South don't exist at this point in time.  There is one
Vietnam, and free and fair elections, as provided for in the Accords, are
the internationally accepted norm for determining a nations "own political
future."

Your statement would be more accurate if you said "according to the North,
the Soviet Union, and China, The North and South did not exist
independantly" and "according to the South, and 30 other nations, and the
UN, the south DID exist as an independent nation"

So with that in mind, why do you take the point of view of the North and 2
other nations, who wanted to determine the political future of another
entity, instead of the South, and 30 other nations, which did want to
determine its own political future?

"The writer rejected the accords when it suited him, rejected them based on
error.  Now he wants to use
them.  OK.  Let's see what he's got. "

As do you, which is what he was pointing out.  He rejected the accords from
the get go, you supported them (apparently) when they agree with your own
preconeived idealogies (no independent south), and abandon them when they
don't (the north used and attacked Laos and cambodia, which IT signed
accepting its nutrality!!!)

"That's it Michael.  Thanks again." 

"Anti-communism tortures the facts till they conform to dogma.  Intellectual
(not to mention moral and political) integrity embraces the facts and
constructs a world view based thereon."

It seems from my experience that 'pro commumisn' is also guilty of torturing
the facts to conform to its dogma.  Given the monstrous history of
communism, I will proudly consider myself 'anti communist' But given the
fact that 30 nations recognized the South and it was up for UN membership
(as MaxPlumm states, I am merely assuming this is valid) does that change
your percieved notion of the 'truth' in any way?  

This is obviously a complex subject that I am still learning much about, so
I prefer seeing both sides.

Thanks for you time.

I'm just finishing "The Golden Age" by John C. Wright.  This is an
extraordinarily good book -- so much so that when I neared the end and
discovered that it was the first part of at least two books (a note on
the last page indicates that it will only have a second part), I was
both disappointed to not have the story fully resolved and also happy to
know that there was a good deal more to come.

Because of the plot structure of the book, it is difficult to discuss
its substance without spoilers, so I won't do so here.  However, a
description of the setting of the book is possible without undermining
the pleasure of reading it.  The novel is set in a fairly distant future
-- I gathered that it is at least thousands, and perhaps tens of
thousands of years in the future.  The world depicted in "The Golden
Age" is definitely a post-human one, in which there is a wide range of
sentient beings -- from unmodified human "primitivists," through a host
of various modified and augmented forms that are more or less human
through vastly intelligent and often very strange group and synthetic
minds.

I *highly* recommend this book as perhaps the best SF novel I've read in
years and would welcome discussion of it.

Two points I find worth noting -- and that contain only the most modest
of spoilers (people who want to be *completely* surprised may want to
skip what follows below):


 -- mild spoiler buffer --














The book envisions a world in which extremely sophisticated forms of
virtual reality and personality modifications are possible and
commonplace.  The texture of these experiences is vividly conveyed in
ways that many SF authors who have tackled the problem fail at for lack
of both sufficient imagination and erudition.  Wright is enough of a
historian and classical scholar that I found the dense mélange of
cultural and artistic styles prevalent in the world he depicts
believable and satisfying.

There is also a "legal" angle to the book that I, as a lawyer, found
quite well done.  Some brief research indicates that Wright is a retired
lawyer and it shows: The substantive and procedural details of the legal
context of the book are believable to me and tackle transhumanist issues
-- many we've discussed here over the years, including the nature of
identity -- in a very interesting way.

I don't think this is a very generous reading of what Mitch was saying. I
took him to be saying there are only three "live" or "worthy" hypotheses to
consider here. You need to show that there is at least one other hypothesis
here to fault his reasoning. If you are simply making the pedantic point
that there are other logical possibilities, here then the method you
describe will never work. A human probably has no chance of ever stating all
the possible answers--some of the possible answers here might be too complex
for our little pea brains to even contemplate. (For details see noetic and
alethic skepticism in http://www.sorites.org/Issue_14/walker.htm ). Only a
Hegelian would have the hubris to think that we could contemplate all the
logically possible alternatives here. ; )

I thought Sherkaner was merely in communication with the Focused.  This 
allowed him to encourage them in their off-the-books activities.  My 
interpretation was that the videomancy was a cover story that Sherkaner 
used for his communication with the Focused.  I didn't see any 
indication that he thought it was hocus pocus, or that he thought he 
was in communication with supernatural beings.  There was no indication 
of how the communication moved from the intervention during the code 
breaking to a two-way street, but I didn't mind that.

I thought there was an indication that the Focused had some amount of 
independence, particularly if they could convince themselves that it 
was during a dream-like state.  In that state, they could tell 
themselves that they weren't violating orders, and could be more free.

I loved the story, even though I was ready to give up on it until I was 
more than a third through it.  Pham's ignorant old man guise had me 
seething, and I didn't see how Vinge was going to get him out if it. 
But he did a very convincing job of it.  I was expecting a deus ex 
machina, but I thought the conversion was a completely fair twist in 
the story.

Does anyone see any obvious holes in my interpretation?

Agreed to some extent (I can look forward to something we might have
in 20-50 years time since I might still be alive [without cryonics]
during that time period).

Here I disagree.  "Invoking divinities" involves "magic physics" (and
I'm sure you know how much I dislike that concept).  On the other hand
recreating a derivation of Sasha I can find emotionally satisfying
(or creatively productive) seems not unreasonable given my current
knowledge base.  (Mind you the whole concept of manipulating emotions
is an open discussion given my recent experiences with SSRIs, but that
is a very different topic).  To my mind Sasha II is definitely worth
recreating and the question becomes how close we can get him
to Sasha I.  Furthermore, the essential question is what one
might do *now* to make it easier to recreate Max II, Natasha II,
Greg II, etc. (I'm simply listing ExI board members here not
to exclude anyone on the list).

I think in essence I'm asking the question of how much information
does one need to retain to recreate a reasonable facsimile?
As computing capacity increases, the amount of information required
decreases -- provided one still has people alive who can verify
that that is/is-not a reasonable recreation of Sasha, Ted Williams, etc.
(Because the most information of whether it is a reasonable recreation
is held in human brains.)

But at some point it may be reasonable to consider the recreation
of an individual like George Washington based on historic documentation
alone.  But for an assistant to G.W. for whom there is very little
information available a recreation would be much less accurate.

Everyone should tip their hat to Anders -- this gives us (and me particularly)
something to think about.  I'm not sure I'm best at the "creation" of the
numbers -- but I'm well able to think about the numbers from a critical
perspective.   I'm not sure if I agree with the numbers as presented --
it will require some serious critical analysis.

But this is the extropian list at its best -- speculation, data and evaluation.
It is unfortunate that some of the discussion topics cannot more easily be herded
into this realm.

Samantha, I'll try to take on a couple of your comments.
Please read the entire set of comments before responding.

True.  It becomes a critical question of whether people are
able to self-determine when they are in a "responsible" state.
If they are not able to do that, then external intervention may
be necessary (recent public examples might be Nick Nolte and
Winona Ryder).

> Does your problem lead you to coerce others who you have a
> problem with?

If one is not in a self-responsible state then coercion may be required.
The question becomes whether the "problem" is an issue involving
public safety (where coercion may certainly be justified) or
public "conventions" (say laws against public indecency).
This is one of the reasons that I think enclaves will ultimately
be the direction humans will go in.  We will each seek out the
"enclave" with "laws" we prefer.

The question becomes whether or not they are able to judge
whether or not they might be hurting anyone.  I've recently
had some experience with a physician prescribed medication
where I have questioned my ability to drive a vehicle in
a responsible/reliable fashion -- so much so that I had
to request another extropian to do the driving.  It is
only a small step beyond that I fear that one isn't able
to make that judgement call.  In that situation "coercion"
by society is necessary for public safety.

Michael,
       I am aware that decades ago there were people that considered 
themselves anti communist.  I am not sure why there is something wrong with 
not wishing to surrender to the treatment the citizenry of socialist 
countries have historically received.  But, be that as it may.  I suppose I 
am just not enlightened.  Murder, starvation, and terror isn't a standard 
condition in the sort of country I wish to live in.
       But in roughly 1955 Macarthy was sat down and rendered harmless.  
Actually many people attacked him with great ridicule beginning in 1951 to my 
certain knowledge.  In fact I think the anti-Macarthy sentiments (stated 
publicly by prominent people and organizations) began much earlier.  I 
remember the late 40s but truthfully I was a teener paying more attention to 
my boxing team, playing sandlot football and a certain young lady than 
politics.
       That was then.  But I haven't met a true anti-Communist in years.  
Most of us have picked up the writtings of various Libertarian or Capitalist 
writers and forgotten the socialists except where they immediately threaten 
us.  They have shown repeatedly that they fall of their own weight.  We also 
have been duped into propping them up from time to time.
       I seem to have wandered around a bit so what am I saying?  I say to 
deny the charge of Anti Communism.  We are not guilty and most listeners can 
discern that fact if we point it out.
       The charge of Anti Communism is only a debating tactic of the 
socialists.

It would be a mistake to characterize the "transparency" school of
thought by this false dichotomy: neither Brin nor I would have any
use for scenario (b) here.  We have problems with (a) because it
automatically assumes that one places value on others' not having
certain pieces of true information about you.  I contend that this
is an irrational fear, and not something to be valued.  Even if we
grant people the ability to hide information about themselves, the
fact that they value "privacy" in this way is a disadvantage to them.
It is something they value that others don't, and so they become net
consumers of an expensive commodity with little real benefit.  Far
better to simply choose not to value such privacy, and spend one's
energy elsewhere.

I don't deny that there are very good historical reasons for valuing
privacy, most notably powerful, intrusive, and repressive governments.
And we certainly haven't solved all of those problems even today.
But looking forward into the technological future it's important that
we fix the real problems and not just carry along our old band-aids.

In actuality, lead shot is extremely stable and does not poison
waterfowl, contrary to the claims of the ignorant greenies. However,
there are alternatives you can consider:
a) bismuth shot or steel shot: both are now the shot of choice for
waterfowl hunting. Try the reloading suppliers at your local gunshops.
Bismuth is about the same density as lead. While steel isn't as dense,
it still offers a significant deadening capability because most of it
comes from the action of the shot transferring energy outward as it
tries to stack up, which is irrelevant to the density of the material.
b) mail order your lead shot. Try http://www.cheaperthandirt.com to
mail order lead shot from their reloading supplies department. You
might also be able to get some at auction via
http://www.auctionarms.com.
c) cannibalize a dead blow hammer: You can buy high impact polymer
hammers at Sears, etc which have the head filled with lead shot to
dampen the impact of its striking. Cut these suckers open and
cannibalize the shot. Only for the truly desperate who live where their
postal workers xray and search your mail.

I just read one of the Umberto Eco books, an English translation of 
"Island of the Day Before".  It was pretty good.  Eco is a really good 
writer.  I read "Foucault's Pendulum" and maybe "Name of the Rose" 
before.

I read the John Irving books one time, Tolkien, recently some Clancy.

"Island of the Day Before" is quite entertaining, and it doesn't really 
go anywhere.  This is funny in the book, Roberto and Caspar are on the 
ship trying to figure out how to get to shore, they can't swim.  Caspar 
dons an early diver suit and proceeds to walk on the ocean floor to the 
beach.  He never surfaces.

It's a good post-surreal romanticist book.  It takes a while to get 
started.  Eco uses new words.  I liked that "Foucault's Pendulum" too.

Poor Goethe.

Ah, but lefties also claim that communism is a right wing ideology of
state capitalism, thereby placing it in the right wing camp.

No, if your actions cause harm to the children, then you've crossed the

No more than the costs of their actions that are externalized onto

Yes, I do. The problem, of course, is by whose judgement is 'nobody
getting hurt'? If the person judging is impaired in their judgement by
drugs, then their opinion is compromised. If you are placing me at risk
by driving drunk or high on the same roads I use, then you are 'harming
me', at least a little in that you cause my insurance premiums to be
higher than they need to be. If you get into an accident with me
because of your impaired judgement, then you are certainly harming me.
If you are not insured against such risk, you are most certainly
harming me to the maximum degree possible.

My original statement was very much like my above one, it just
triggered some who did not fully read my statement before they chose to respond.

I don't think there's anyone here that would argue with you.  Even the
most militant libertarians don't approve of drunk driving, and "drunk
parenting" is certainly a rational extension of that (though I wouldn't
go so far as to require insurance, just get a babysitter while you
party; and if you're constantly so pickled you simply can't be an
effective parent then by all means you should lose custody).  I think
the only time you've been flamed when you talk about drugs is when you
say things like Marijuana is addictive, or that it's more dangerous
than alcohol, or that there's some difference between "legal" and
"illegal" drugs besides stupid laws, or when you tacitly approve
of current laws the lock people away for mere use, regardless of
whether such use has caused external harm or not.

You have quite clearly supported laws against drugs themselves,
which is no different than supporting gun bans: it's making the
technology evil instead of the particular use it's put to.  If you
cause harm with a gun, prosecute the harm, not the gun.  Likewise if
you cause harm with drugs, prosecute the harm, not the drug.  The
fact that some drugs alter one's ability to make rational choices
while on the drug doesn't change that--one still has the ability to
rationally choose whether and when to use, and there do exist
responsible uses for all drugs, just as there are responsible uses
for firearms.

But is there any way of determining whether they are "in a 
responsible state"?  I think it would avoid a lot more evils if 
people were simply held rigorously accountable for results of 
their actions without the State attempting to preemptively 
determine whether their state was acceptable or not.

Coercion should only be required in my view if the person is 
actually acting in such a manner as to actually harm others. 
Public saftety should only be invoked when actual real harm is 
occurring or is imminent.  Public "indecency" generally does not 
qualify as no real harm is being done.

Law seems, for better or worse (mainly the latter), to be going 
global.  More cases imply that one nation's laws can be applied 
anywhere in the world every month or so.

It is not a matter of whether they can judge.  You certainly 
cannot judge easily what they can or cannot judge.  A person 
alone or with others taking a drug in a carefully chosen 
location (setting) that is safe should certainly not be bound by 
any law.

I think we are talking about somewhat different things also.  I 
am saying things directly about the asinine "War on Drugs" and 
more generally  about some of its justifications (and 
justifications of many other things "for our own good") and 
resulting dangers to freedom.   Hmmm.  So maybe I am talking 
about different things at once. :-)

Not only did he write that himself, there are also numerous extremist

THe problem with this approach is that it smacks of the same sort of
Pollyannish ignorance of human nature and social inertia that often is
the achilles heel of collectivists.

Accepting that there are lions, tigers, and bears out there in the
woods of life, and that privacy is one defensive measure against their
ravages that works well would tend to dismiss arguments for
transparency. Predators don't generally care as much about getting
caught as they do in making the kill, so transparency is the same sort
of false security that one gets from thinking that it is the job of
police to protect you.

It seems that a supernova must be within about 25 light years of Earth
for its emissions to significantly impact our ozone levels to the point
of causing mass extinctions. Based on this, the risk of such occuring
is about once in a billion years.

This would seem to rule out the GRB mechanism for the Fermi paradox,
though the current large volume of space free of dust around our star
system would indicate we are passing through the remnant of such an
event, and might lead other races to believe that this zone is vacant
of intelligent civilizations. Sounds like a 'zone of thought', eh?

Is the Fairy of Doubt named Thomas? For those of an Xian leaning who
want to teach their kids science but also what a decent guy
Hoerkeimer's brother was, you could demonstrate that the Apostle Thomas
(known as Doubting Thomas) was the first scientist. He doubted Jesus'
resurrection until proven by scientific, experimental, evidence (i.e.
sticking his finger through the wounds). His testament, found in the
Nag Hammadi, is generally considered to be the more accurate of the
testaments. 

The problem with your proposal of the Fairy of Doubt is that kids
should continue to not believe in him (is it a him?) even after
confronted by the evidence of his existence in the form of presents.
You'll wind up raising kids who don't believe NASA ever sent men to the
moon, and other such foolish things.

Actually, things like blood alcohol levels, etc are very useful in
determining an individuals degree of responsibility/valid self
judgement.

WHile there is some variability in tolerance between individuals, there
are levels at which absolutely nobody is in a responsible state.
Furthermore, field sobriety tests are also very useful, though they are
more subjectively interpreted based on the administrators bias as much
as the variable tolerance of the individual.

Indecency doesn't have anything to do with it. Risk to the public is
another matter entirely. If your choice to act irresponsibly puts the
public at risk, then the public is being coerced by you into assuming
the costs of that increased risk.

Certainly, and I don't think either Robert or myself disagrees with you
in this. The problem there is if you retain the ability to leave that
location and place others at risk while impaired. If you leave your car
keys with a responsible individual, for example, and someone else is
also watching your kids, etc then you should be able to get as high as
you want...

Having said that I am okay with people getting high under certain
circumstances, I personally don't find it to be something that should
be encouraged or glamorized either. One of the problems with
maintaining a free society is maintaining a recognition in the populace
that self responsibility is the key to maintaining individual liberty,
that when we start to prefer to abdicate responsibility, we start to
seek out institutions which will alleviate us of those
responsibilities. This is the road to government tyranny, and why I
choose not to use to any degree beyond very light social use.

I've always said that marijuana should be legalized, nor have I
advocated laws which lock people away for mere use regardless of harm.
I have advocated coercive interventions by freinds and families for
those who are addicted, primarily because of my own experience with an
addicted business partner, which as I recall has not been similarly
experienced by anybody else here.
I also have a friend who is paralyzed and addicted to oxycontin, and
will be for the rest of her life, or whenever her spinal injury is
cured. She is a functioning individual, she doesn't harm anybody, but
she doesn't work either or have kids. While she is in no risk of
falling into a spiral of depression, poverty, and crime (she lives off
a nice trust funded by the insurance settlement), she is also quite
immune to rehabilitation treatment (family has put her through five
times) so long has she has this safety net, and so long as she tries to
consume only at 'maintenance' levels, since it is so hard to obtain the
drug in this regulated environment. I fear what would happen to her if
you could buy oxycontin out of vending machines.

I dont recall that I've ever supported, on a blanket basis, laws
against drugs, though I've had some ambivalence about some of the more
heinously addictive and impairing drugs.

Furthermore, a gun doesn't alter it's users ability to make rational
responsible judgements. It doesn't cause physiological changes creating
a dependency at the cellular level. Comparing the two is a false
analogy, though it is one that many try to make.

Actually, there are grounds for impeachment of every president since
1934, but those grounds have absolutely nothing to do with foreign
policy. But I doubt Chomsky would agree with me. 

Those grounds are the National Firearms Act of 1934, and the
enforcement of such by every president since.

The web bites back

Web used to flood spammers and spooks

Protesters are turning the tables on government officials and
businessmen who they say are making the web less pleasant to use.

The web activists have found the personal details of the man behind a
federal surveillance system and an e-mail spammer and are giving them a
dose of their own medicine. The home address and phone numbers of the
two men being widely circulated and posted on more than 100 websites.
The action has led to the spammer being deluged with junk mail, and the
boss of the surveillance project undergoing the scrutiny that every
American will soon be under.

Bulk spammer Alan Ralsky has been the first to feel the wrath of
outraged web activists.
Many web users see spam, or unsolicited commercial e-mail, as a curse
that needs to be curbed.
Mr Ralsky is widely acknowledged as a prolific spammer and has said he
has the ability to send more than a billion e-mails per day. To protest
against the way that he makes a living, anti-spammers have found his
home address and have signed him up with as many direct mail agencies as
possible. As a result he is now being deluged with junk mail.
An article in the Detroit Free Press chronicled his anguish.
"They're harassing me." he told the newspaper. His complaint caused glee
on the Slashdot website which hatched the junk mail plan.

Similar treatment is being meted out to John Poindexter, the man in
charge of the US Government's Total Information Awareness program. This
will bring together credit card, medical, travel, school and other
records to help spot terrorists.
Many web users consider the project to be a gross infringement of
privacy and now are subjecting Mr Poindexter to 24-hour scrutiny. Mr
Poindexter's home address, complete with satellite photos, has been
published online as has his home phone number and that of his
neighbours.
The protest was started by SF Weekly columnist Matt Smith and the
information he ferreted out is now widely available online.

EVENTS 

NBIC CONFERENCE 2002: CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR 
IMPROVING HUMAN PERFORMANCE 

In another sign that Transhuman ideas are gaining currency 
the well received NBIC report on Converging Technologies 
for Improving Human Performance is being followed up by a 
conference on the same issues. The convergence of 
nanoscience, biotechnology, information technology and 
cognitive science ("NBIC") offers immense opportunities 
for the improvement of human abilities, social outcomes, 
the nation's productivity and its quality of 
life; it also represents a major new frontier in research 
and development. 

This conclusion was reached at a December 2001 workshop 
held by the National Science Foundation and the Department 
of Commerce in which leading experts from government, the 
academic research community and the private sector 
explored the nature and size of the potential 
opportunities in NBIC convergence. The report that 
resulted from this workshop, asserting that NBIC 
convergence is "a broad, cross-cutting, emerging and 
timely opportunity of interest to individuals, society and 
humanity in the long term," recommended that an R&D
initiative focusing on enhancing human 
performance (while governed by respect for human welfare 
and dignity) should become a national priority. The NBIC 
Convergence 2003 conference has been organized as a first 
step in realizing the vision of this report... 

More information on the conference can be found at 
http://www.infocastinc.com/NBIC/nbic.asp. 
The original report can be found as a pdf file and is 
worth a look -

WTA NEWS 

WTA OFFICERS GROUP 

Mike Latorra and Simon Smith have created a new group for 
officers of WTA local chaptes. According to Mike "This 
group is for World Transhumanist Association Chapter 
Officers to discuss how best to operate their chapters. 

Group membership is restricted to full dues paying members 
of WTA who are also WTA Chapter Officers." This should 
serve as a great resource for Officers to learn from 
each other on what has worked well and what hasn't. If 
you are leading your local chapter be sure to check it out 
and participate at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-chapter-officers/ or 
contact Michael Latorra at mike99@lascruces.com 


J.B.S HALDANE AWARD 

As mentioned last month the WTA has created a new award, 
the Annual JBS Haldane Award for Best Undergraduate 
Transhumanist Paper to honor the top undergraduate paper 
in the field of transhumanism. Now is the time to get 
the word out to your local colleges and universities. 
This award is a tremendous opportunity to introduce the 
idea of transhumanism to a demographic group that will 
likely prove to be a great supporter of the WTA. 
Talk to friends and family members who may be interested 
in submitting a paper. The WTA has also created a flyer 
that can be posted on information boards in Cognitive 
Science, Philosophy, Computer Science and other related 
departments. It is up to us to promote this award and the 
fact that the awardee will receive $250 and a chance to be 
published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Evolution 
and Technology or a special edition of the 
Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics should help. 
Haldane award flyers are available at

NEWS FROM THE FIELD 

JOSE CORDEIRO's TRANSHUMANIST TRAVELOGUE 

Very dear transhumanist friends,

I have returned to Venezuela after several months 
traveling in different countries thanks to several 
academic commitments and other professional 
responsibilities. The experience was very enriching, and I 
had the opportunity to meet people in different areas, all 
the way from libertarian ideas to Communist futurist 
thinking. Here is a brief report per country:

URUGUAY: Alain Ayerra (alain@adinet.com.uy) is a young 
transhumanist living in Montevideo and working 
simultaneously for several academic degrees (physics and 
philosophy included) in the national university. Even 
though he is very young, he was one of the initial 
translators into Spanish of the original transhumanist 
literature. I also met some "standard" futurists in 
several gatherings at the Mercosur headquarters and their 
telecommunications groups.

ARGENTINA: Fernando Enis (fer@ignatius.com.ar) is a "self-
educated" transhumanist who has been working many years in 
marketing in Argentina. He told me that there are other 
people in Argentina (mostly in Buenos Aires and 
Cordoba)dedicated to the TH ideas, and he pointed out a 
brilliant student of computer science and a medical doctor 
interested in cryonics. Fernando has now left Argentina 
due to the crisis in his own country and is working 
currently in Madrid. There is a Spanish listgroup with 30 
members (groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-espanol), that was 
started by James Hughes last March, and many of the 
messages come from Argentina.

BRASIL: Octavio Pineda (op@plus.org) is a very active 
transhumanist in a very large country where no one knows 
what transhumanism is. He translated the transhumanist 
principles into Portuguese and has been pushing the 
Portuguese listgroup started last February and that now 
has 20 members. Most members are in Sao Paulo, even though 
there are some people in Rio de Janeiro and Ceara as well. 
Octavio met another Brazilian (Dr Antero Coelho Neto) 
through the TH listgroup of the UK and since then they 
became friends, but they have not organized larger 
physical meetings yet.

ENGLAND: Tarik Theodorus Ibrahim "Theo" (theo@gmx.co.uk) 
has been active in the TH movement since its incipient 
beginnings in England with Nick Bostrom and David Pearce. 
We had a very nice dinner in the house of a friend in 
London, where I could see how committed Theo was to TH, 
even on his rigorous caloric intake and diet. Ian Pierson 
(Chief Futurist of British Telecom) also accompanied us 
and we had a fantastic conversation about new technologies 
and even the orgasmatron (for the year 2012:-) Theo talked 
about his company (Community Technology), a London-based 
nonprofit organization that promotes technology education 
and access. There is a growing group of Extropians in 
London, called ExtroBritannia, who have been meeting 
regularly to discuss books and other subjects. On a side 
note, I had the opportunity to meet Lady Thatcher and two 
Economics Nobel Prize Laureates in the reunion of the Mont 
Pelerin Society in London.

SPAIN: Giulio Prisco (giulio@prisco.info) invited me for 
some Spanish "tapas" and beer (which tasted great but 
would not pass the Theo test of TH food:-) while smoking 
heavily (like many Italians, combined with Spanish:-) 
Giulio is a very hyperactive person with incredible varied 
interests, all the way from space travel to quantum 
computing. His job at the European Union is a good 
platform to promote TH ideas, and he has been heavily 
involved in this. He started the FASTRA listgroup in Spain 
(www.fastra.org) last March, and it now has 43 members, 
some of which are very active. Giulio was convinced that 
we have to push the TH movement to new highs, and his 
commitmment is worth of admiration.

MEXICO: I was only in Guadalajara and all the 
transhumanists seem to be in Mexico City and Monterrey, 
apparently. I gave a conference about TH for students at 
the University of Guadalajara and it caused a lot of 
interest.

VENEZUELA: I (jose_cordeiro@yahoo.com) am working with 
some people of the World Future Society Venezuela to start 
a formal chapter of the WTA. So count on more Venezuelan 
transhumanists learning about the TH ideas. And already 
include us in the WTA chapter list:-)

I hope this short briefing is useful to you. It was 
funny to see that most of the THists only know each other 
virtually. We need more physical bridges. Until 
Transvision 03...

Futuristically,
La vie est belle!
Yosé (www.cordeiro.org)

NEW YORK 

The New York Transhumanist Association (NYTA) met on Nov. 
21 starting off with a report on the recent Alcor 
conference on Extreme Life Extension from Jones Murphy. 
The next speaker, John Klos, focused on the future of 
computing and simulated neural networks specifically. The 
NYTA is also working on a symposium to be held at NYU on 
World Futures: The Science of Humanity in The Epoch Of 
Technology for more info on this or the New York 
chapter contact Mike Treder for more information at

TORONTO 

TTA is leading the way in what will hopefully become 
standard practice - defense of transhuman values and 
beliefs by way of brilliantly titled press 
release. The press release was issued in response to a 
talk by Leon Kass. According to Vice President George 
Dvorsky "The Toronto Transhumanist Association greeted 
Leon Kass's visit to the city by issuing a press release 
titled "Bush Bioethicist Thinks Canadians Should Die." In 
the release, the TTA made clear its opposition to the life 
extension position of Leon Kass, 
chairman of the US President's Council on Bioethics, who 
gave a talk called "Why Not Immortality?" at the 
University of Toronto on Dec. 2." To read the 
entire press release, go to 
http://toronto.transhumanism.com/news/ 

The TTA executive staff met with WTA secretary Dr. James 
Hughes and WTA board member Dr. Mark Walker on November 
21. Topics discussed included the future of Transhumanism, 
the contributions of Betterhumans, and the 
relationship between charter groups and the WTA. 

On Thursday November 28, the TTA hosted the discussion, 
"Women's Issues in the 21st Century." Content was 
generously provided by Shari Golberg, who works for the 
Government of Ontario's Women's Directorate, Natasha 
Vita-More, current director of Progress Action Coalition, 
and Michal Nahman, currently completing a sociology 
doctorate on reproductive technology at Lancaster 
University. 

Also in November, the TTA added the Speakers Bureau to the 
Website.

TRANSCENTRAL 

The first campus group to seek affiliation with both the 
WTA and the Humanist "Center for Inquiry" through the 
Campus Freethought Alliance met with a CFA representative 
Tuesday, 12/10. The club name "Third Culture," refers to 
JS Mill's prescription for a progressive culture that 
incorporates the scientific community and that of the 
humanities in free discussion of ideas and issues that 
affect each and thereby develop a more comprehensive 
understanding that is reflected, eventually, in more 
enlightened legislation supported by a more knowledgeable 
population. The group met with the student activities 
personnel at the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, IL. On 
Friday 12/13 in one of the last steps to becoming an 
official recognized club. The 
final step will be connecting with a faculty member in 
January to serve as the club advisor (coordinated through 
the office of student activities). The first draft of the 
club constitution is held in the open "Files" section of 
TransCentral. The College of DuPage is the largest single 
campus community college in America.

Transhumanists - Co-Creators of the Universe!
By Marc Geddes 
"...If all physical process can be simulated on a

NANOTECH MEMES GO MAINSTREAM 

>From renewed commitments by the US government in the form 
of more than half a billion research dollars, to increased 
venture capital investment and the NBIC report/conference 
mentioned above nanotechnology has had a good deal of 
publicity in the last year. 

The trend continues with the release of Michael Crichton's 
new book Prey. Crichton plays with the familiar and 
successful theme of a technology that inadvertently and 
overwhelming runs out of human control. Crichton is not 
the usual Luddite interested only in spreading fear 
about nano and other technologies. In recent interviews 
Crichton has shown an interest in the positive aspects of 
nanotech; an optimism that is constrained by concerns over 
the power and uncertainty surrounding the 
technology. To read reviews or purchase the book go to 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-
/0066214122/qid=1039828901/sr=2-1/102-5912347-5434528?
v=glance&s=books 

The Economist magazine has also been bitten by the nanobug 
and in the recent article "Trouble in Nanoland" they 
investigate the hurdles faced by nanotechnology. This 
article can be found at 
http://economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1477445 


NULAND ON KASS

Sherwin Nuland recently reviewed Leon Kass's latest book, 
Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Human Dignity, for the 
New York Times. Leon Kass is the Chair of the US President's Council 
on Bioethics. 
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/books/review/17NULANDT.html
Nuland notes "as you admire the elegance of Kass's 
writing, the sweep of his erudition and the appeal of his 
narrative, lest you forget that you are in the company of 
perhaps the most conservative of bioethicists -- and 
certainly the most persuasive of the polemicists 
declaiming against the unquestioning acceptance of the 
technological imperative currently gripping the 
imagination of an enthusiastic American public. Kass 
leaves little room for compromise or adjustment. Under the 
spell of his luminescent writing, one is tempted to 
abandon long-held assumptions about the inviolability and 
freedom of the scientific enterprise. His is a voice that 
properly deserves attention, but always with the caveat of 
its seductiveness."

"Under the Enhanced Border Security Act of 2002, the government is
required to develop an automated information system called Chimera
that places machine-readable biometric identifiers in all visas and
passports by 2004. The General Accounting Office estimates Chimera
will cost between $6 billion and $11.5 billion to build."

On the site:
http://travel.state.gov/passport_pressrelease.html
we see:

"All passports, except those required for urgent travel, will be
issued in the United States using the new more secure
photo-digitized imaging system.

Effective April 8, 2002, American citizens residing or traveling
abroad, who require issuance of a U.S. passport, will be issued the
latest, state-of-the-art passport. It incorporates a digitized image
with other enhanced security features. Because this technology is
not available at U.S. embassies and consulates, overseas passport
issuance is being transferred to the National Passport Processing
Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

Travel documents in the post-September 11 world have become even
more important. The new passport has many features that make it one
of the most secure travel documents produced anywhere in the world. 
Getting these more secure passports into circulation will help
minimize the misuse of American passports by criminals, terrorists,
and others."

Ummm. I'm not seeing anything there, apart from a test text message and a parent directory. However,

Robert,

I explore this idea in a short story Ive written.  Basically once we have near 
human level AIs what is called an artificially intelligent "Estate" is created 
for everyone that has known to have existed.  The goal of these AI "Estates" is 
two fold.  One is to archive, recover, and keep as much as the original as 
possible and two is to behave as the original would have behaved.  In the story 
these "Estates" are given the right to vote but their votes only count as half 
a vote and so on.

If society advances to a state required to resurrect and restore people that 
were not cryonically preserved a subset of a growing "Estate" will have become 
identical to what the original was.  At that point in time the original 
is "resurrected" in the state they were in just before they died.  These 
resurrected beings are worshiped and celebrated as the literal creators of 
humanity, society, and all their descendents.  They are then brought up to 
speed and given all that the "Estate" had accumulated up until that time, 
including all memories and so on.

Its basically the logical extension of us wanting to preserve as much of Sasha 
as possible.  As we move into the future we will rapidly become much better at 
recovering and preserving more and more of what Sasha was.  Who knows if well 
ever be able to truly restore enough of him to truly resurrect him, but surely 
well soon be able to do infinitely more than we can do today.

For those interested the short story, entitled "1229 Years After Titanic", it 
is available here:

[www.futureport.dk/news] Summary - 2002-17-12 (6 articles)

Well ... I needed to get them done a bit sooner today, so not all sites 
are updated yet. This means there will probably be a bigger posting 
tomorrow.


New gene therapy boost immune system to cure cancer
===================================================
[Health] Found by: maxm
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-12/nu-ngt121202.php

Using a novel gene therapy approach that boosts the body's immune 
system, a Northwestern University researcher has cured cancer in 
laboratory mice.



Scientists Find Plants Work Like Hormones
=========================================
[Health] Found by: maxm
http://www.lef.org/news/nutrition/2002/12/13/RMTN/0000-8417-KEYWORD.Missing.html

Food can be "more powerful than drugs" in our bodies, altering genes 
that affect whether we get cancer, heart disease, depression, 
schizophrenia or dyslexia, two Colorado researchers report.



Purdue works to transform Ebola virus from killer to healer
===========================================================
[Health] Found by: maxm
http://news.uns.purdue.edu/html4ever/021216.Sanders.ebola.html

By redesigning the shell of Ebola, Purdue University researchers have 
transformed the feared virus into a benevolent workhorse for gene 
therapy  and as one of the first gene bearers that can be inhaled 
rather than injected, it might prove valuable in the fight against lung 
disease.



Cool Runnings
=============
[Technology] Found by: maxm
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/scitech/CuttingEdge/cuttingedge021216.html

Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., have 
been working on an elegant solution for the military that could soon 
find its way to desktop and laptop computers.

Worm's fat swap could help humans
=================================
[Health] Found by: maxm
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2569715.stm

The ability of worms to convert potentially harmful fats into helpful 
ones might be harnessed to cut heart disease and strokes.



Rats, Robots, and Rescue
========================
[Robotics] Found by: maxm
http://www.csee.usf.edu/robotics/crasar/roborats.html

Despite the quote to the contrary by roborat senior researcher Prof. 
John Chapin in the Associated Press, robots were in fact used in the 
World Trade Center and were successful by any reasonable metric of 
performance. CRASAR teams were in New York within six hours of the first 
building collapse and tasked to respond by the New York City Office 
Emergency Management.

The robot teams assisted the New York Fire Department, FEMA, and 
military rescuers in several critical tasks, including searching voids, 
providing data on structural integrity of the slurry wall, and, sadly, 
finding remains in places where technical search specialists using dogs 
and traditional tools could not reach.

Hi John,

Thanks a million for the photos and all on the
site!  You guys are really cooking.

That's probably my future home.

It happens, and is primarily the fault of government and those who
think that government is the only solution to problems. What else are
you trying to get at?

This applies only to all AMERICAN passports and visas issued to
foreigners visiting the US. The problem of this approach is that there
is still no way to truly verify the real identity of a foreigner BEFORE
they are issued their biometric visa to visit us. This system could
easily be abused to establish foolproof bona fides for individuals
traveling under false but well documented identities.

THe problem of the system is that it isn't Americans who are the
problem with terrorism, it is individuals traveling from countries
which cannot afford the passport systems they currently have, and are
thus vulnerable to corruption. Such countries can't afford the sort of
systems proposed here, and even then will still be vulnerable to
corruption at the entrypoint, where identities are initially
established.

THis being said, if such a system is established worldwide, and is made
relatively immune to corruption, it would go a long way to helping to
build the sort of global institutions of trust that Nick Bostrom spoke
of at Extro5. Those countries with corruption problems should still
expect to see their citizens validity questioned, which would be useful
if a terrorist traveling under a false passport has previously been
biometrically scanned under a different identity. In this respect, the
system would be useful in identifying terrorists as well as spies.

In establishing the system, it would make the practice of spying far
more expensive, since agents would only be able to posess one identity
throughout their careers. If linked to questionable activities, they
would be easily identified in the future and their ability to enter
other countries limited. In doing this, this would limit the
post-governmental career potential of said agents and would make them
far more circumspect about engaging in black operations.

In this respect, the system would put our country at a disadvantage in
combatting its enemies.

Oops.  That was supposed to be off-list to John Grigg.

I went to that link and then, by chance, got to
where the pictures really are at:

I don't know.  Why do you ask?  What do you think it would be?

Sorry, these are kind of psychoanalytical questions.

I think war is wasteful.

The hardback edition of this book has been sitting on my desk the last few 
weeks while I have been recovering from shingles (chickenpox revisited) - 
read the first few pages - seems extremely good (in the meantime I've 
finished off the Prelude to Dune novels and the Butlerian Jihad part one). 
Much seems like what I and others have been thinking about for the last six 
years... seems like a comprehensive attempt at integrating a number of 
factors - I've a number of other books I should read (Kiln People, The 
Forever Peace, and so on) but I end up skimming them because they aren't up 
to integrated changes and discussing the interaction between culture and 
immortality (Greg Egan leaves me with this feeling too). I've been saving 
this book (The Golden Age) until I feel a little better and can meditate 
upon it and related matters fully.

My take on this conversation is that the difference between those 
participating in the scientific process and detectives, engineers, and 
short order cooks is that the former are adding to the scientific 
literature.  It isn't necessary that every scientist form explicit 
hypotheses, make clear predictions or identify events that would 
constitute contrary evidence, but if they contribute to the literature, 
then someone else can put in the rigor that makes it a scientific 
result.  The more rigor that is included by an early author, the 
smaller the remaining work before it can serve as a basis for further 
theories.

Detectives participate in a process that resembles science in many 
ways, but the proof of the pudding for them is what happens in court 
for the most part.  There's no implication for society's knowledge 
after the trial.  Even those who study trials are mostly interested in 
the evolution of law, not of methods of detection.

Engineers have a literature that overlaps with science.  Most engineers 
don't publish, and thus don't add to the scientific literature.  Others 
publish, but are merely saying "this worked for me."  When engineers 
say "we tried x and y in similar situations, and observed z", then 
they're contributing to the scientific literature.  Other than that, 
it's just recipes.

Oversimplifying,
Chris

I doubt very much that different U.S. passports will be issued to
different people. (No I don't have any proof to back up that statement)

Big Brother version 1.0 is already issuing the "most secure travel documents
issued anywhere in the world". It will be only a matter of time
(and a few billions$) before Big Brother version 2.0 issues
"machine-readable biometric identifiers" -enhanced passports.

Do you think A, B, C exhaust the possibilities.  There is no 
evidence of (C) so it should be dispensed with.  Thery D is that 
a disgruntled US scientist or scientist wishing to expose some 
danger sent the Anthrax.  This has the best supporting evidence 
to date.  The motives are less clear including the possibility 
of some government involvement in keeping the climate of fear 
whipped up long enough to pass some legislation/directives that 
might otherwise have had a harder go of it.  I support theory D 
and frankly believe the government or at least one of its 
tentacles had a hand in it.  Otherwise it is difficult to 
explain the investigation just dissipating.

Trouble is that different labs leave telltales.  Only a few of

Then we would have had no reason to let the investigation 
fritter away and no reason to not tell the people so Bush et.al. 
could move much more quickly as they were wont to do with the 
invasion of Iraq.

The large concentrations of troops and equipment for an attack 
are a damn expensive bluff.  All indications are that the 
administration very much plans to go through with an invasion. 
I don't see any evidence that your scenario is likely or that 
Iraq sent the Anthrax.

Why not? It was right above the comment.  It is the theory of 
state sponsorship that the government is supposedly too afraid 
to public mention and prove.

If there was strong evidence of the former then I see no reason 
Bush & company would not have trumpeted it.  They would have had 
full support for whatever actions they saw fit to take against 
such a state.

Nope.  It is not so known.  The one supposed incident usually 
quoted as been seriously called into question.  The type of 
anthrax used requires more sophisticated lab work that not just 
any country or facility can handle.  It is especially doubtful 
that Iraq after a decade of bombing, years of inspections and 
systematic weaking of its entire manufacturing base could have 
pulled it off.  And for the last time, there is zero evidence 
the Anthrax came from there.  If you are not going to give any 
then please drop this.

The simpler conclusion is that your chain of reasoning has very

It hasn't stopped them anywhere else in this campaign so I don't 
buy this "reason".  It is more likely that this assumption is 
far too weak for even them to really claim or even seriously float.

This is  silly after MAD.  Countries make no bones about the 
fact the world is a dangerous place.  There were no signs of any 
blackmail from the anthrax.  Any thinking person understands 
that certain forms of dangerous weapons are useable by smaller 
and/or poorer groups.  But acts of terrorism, even in death 
tolls in the millions, would not be likely to cause the US to 
capitulate.

Again, you are weaving weakly plausible explanations assuming 
that an even weaker theory is true.

All of our support for Iraqi campaigns including covering up the 
incident with the Kurds are part of the public record.  There is 
not much left to hide there.  Besides, most Americans refuse to 
look at or evaluate that record so there isn't a problem here.

I don't think it is real.  An effective biowar to counter a 
conventional war is not that easy to wage.  Especially not for a 
country with very limited delivery vehicles and freedom of 
movement.

That sort of retaliation is the least of my worries at the 
moment.  I am much more worried by the vastly accelerated 
destruction of American freedom and rights, the worldwide 
consequences of stirring up the Middle East hornet's nest more, 
the huge potential direct loss of life and property, the 
staggering cost of not only the invasion but the subsequent 
occupation, and the loss of any real response to many other deep 
problems and issues of this time for the duration of this 
(never-ending) "emergency".

#Thanks for the criticism, Jeff, I always appreciate it. However, I must
take issue with a large portion of your argument. You began:


"No, there was no "South" Vietnam.  There was only
Vietnam, an "associate state" of the French Union. 
The territory of this state was the combined area of
the 'north' and 'south'--the area associated with the
Vietnam of today.  The whole country.

A short summary of who, in the period 1945-1954, had
what part of indochina and when--cast of players here:
French, Vichy French, Japanese, Nationalist Chinese,
British, Ho & Co., French again--can be found at:

http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0861793.html

Note the following excerpt:

In Mar., 1946, France signed an agreement with Ho Chi
Minh, recognizing Vietnam as a free state within the
Indochina federation and the French Union. ..."

# I find it fascinating that you, or more specifically your source, cut off
the statement here. In full, it continues "In that which concerns the
reuniting of the three 'Annamite Regions' [Cochinchina, Annam, Tonkin] the
French Government pledges itself to RATIFY THE DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE
POPULATIONS CONSULTED BY REFERENDUM. (Frederik Logevall, The Origins of the
Vietnam War, p. 100)

Obviously, there were no such referendums ever held, meaning the French
government was under no obligation to hand Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh and thus
it became a dead letter.


"However, differences immediately arose over whether
Cochin China [the southernmost of the three
regions--Tonkin, Annam,  and Cochin China] was
included in the independent state of Vietnam; in June,
1946, France supported the establishment of a separate
republic of Cochin China.
<snip unnecessary stuff> the French in 1949
reinstalled Bao Dai as the ruler of Vietnam, of which
Cochin China was then recognized to be a part."


  -----end of excerpt------

# I submit all of this is "unnecessary stuff". It is irrelevant what
differences "came up", given that the agreement that you base your
assertions upon was never ratified by the French government nor were the
terms of the agreement carried out.

"I direct your attention to that last bit: "...Vietnam,
of which Cochin China was then recognized to be a
part."  So from 1949 to the onset of the Geneva
Conference, Vietnam was all of Vietnam, the combined
regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China."

# You have previously stated that the 1946 agreement that Ho Chi Minh signed
with Jean Sainteny was the legally binding force with regard to Vietnam,
which I have clearly established it was not. Yet here, you acknowledge the
legitimacy of the 1949 Elysees Agreement between Bao Dai and French
President Vincent Auriol, which established that Tonkin, Annam, and
Cochinchina were part of Vietnam in addition to acknowledging Bao Dai as
chief of state. I should note this agreement was ratified by the Frech
government on March 12, 1949. Given that we both apparently agree that Bao
Dai was a legitimate head of state, then you should have no objection to the
fact that he formed the Republic of Vietnam in 1954.

Additionally, when one reads the text of a letter President Auriol sent to
Bao Dai shortly thereafter, one finds that the President refers specifically
to:


1- The reuniting of South Vietnam to the rest of the Empire will be
accomplished according to the following procedure:
Vote by the French Parliament of the law creating the Representative
Territorial Assembly of South Vietnam provided for by Article 77 of the
French Constitution and charged to give its opinion on the changing of the
status of the territory in question(18).
Vote by the Representative Territorial Assembly of South Vietnam on the
changing of the status referred to above and the integration of South
Vietnam with the rest of the Empire(19).
Vote by the French Parliament of the law provided for in Article 75 of the
French Constitution sanctioning the changing of the status of Cochin
China(20).
The National Assembly will be consulted according to the procedure of
urgency as soon as the Representative Territorial Assembly of South Vietnam
has made its opinion known.

Note, clearly, a reference to a South Vietnam in 1949. As opposed to 1954,
when you claim it was dreamed up.

"Now the prior error pretty much invalidates everything
that follows--anything premised on separate north and
south prior to the accords--but regarding the
election, you must take note of the fact that
representatives from India, Canada, and Poland made up
the International Control Comission, charged with
carrying out the peace agreement, and woulda, shoulda,
coulda been there to oversee the elections.  In
addition there ain't no one on the planet not being
spoon fed in an Alzheimer's ward who doesn't
acknowledge that Ho, as the dominant political
personality and the 'hero' who won independence for
his country, was going to sweep those elections. 
Fairly."

# Again, if there are any errors or lack of facts here, it is clearly on
your side of the discussion. But to address your seemingly unending faith in
the International Control Commission, Iet us examine how well they fared
during the period of mass migration during 1956, in which 900,000
northerners fled south, while only 10,000 made the trip north. Several
Canadian observers believed the number leaving the North would have been
even larger, if not for the fact that:

"Soldiers, political cadres and local militias were frequently stationed in
the houses of the Catholic population with instructions to prevent them from
leaving their homes in order to contact the teams." (Ramesh Thakur,
Peacekeeping in Vietnam: Canada, India, Poland, and the International
Commission, p. 134)

As factually impressive as your "Alzheimer's ward" analogy is, you still
have not refuted my contention that the sheer population advantage in the
North would've provided Ho with victory, nothing else. Again, please provide
an example of a fair and honest Communist sponsored election.

"This is just anti-communist dribble.  Ho was an
authentic Vietnamese nationalist and the north was not
'the north' at the time.  Whether or not he was
communist, how much, and of what sort, well, it's all
irrelevant.  Unless anti-communism self-justifies
anything it does. (Like say, Wahabism.)"

# Please explain why Ho Chi Minh's communist affiliation is irrelevant,
unless you are suggesting that "communism self-justifies anything it does."

"Again, ain't no South Vietnam at the time."  

# Again, there clearly was, as you have acknowledged.


"However, an interesting note.  The Geneva Conference
began in May and ended on July 21, 1954.  In June, in
the middle of the conference, France declared Vietnam
a completely independent nation, free from the legal
strictures of membership in the French Union.  Can you
guess why, boys and girls?" 

# Probably for the same reason that the Soviet Union and China attempted to
get the elections held when 1956 rolled around. 

> As I've noted, the Republic of Vietnam was already

"I'd have to see some documentation.  I've seen a lot
already, but nothing about this, except for the Soviet
and Chinese recognition of the Democratic Republic of
Vietnam.  I suspect that the writer of this piece
would not view with favor *those* recognitions." 

# Please document the source that provided you with the communist nations
recognition of North Vietnam and yet made no mention of the recognition of
the Republic of Vietnam.  (see again Ramesh Thakur's book in regard to
documentation of recognition) Again, your tone would lead to me to believe
that recognition by the USSR is somehow legitimate, while recognition by the
US et al is not.

"Again, the North and South don't exist at this point
in time.  There is one Vietnam, and free and fair
elections, as provided for in the Accords, are the
internationally accepted norm for determining a
nations "own political future."

# Again, they clearly did exist, and South Vietnam was not bound to submit
to any election. And, for that matter, explain how you came to the
conclusion that the elections provided in the accords were the
internationally accepted norm?

"Blatant" violations?  Absent facts, crank up the
rhetoric.  Fine.  I can do facts *and* rhetoric
simultaneously."

"The writer rejected the accords when it suited him,
rejected them based on error.  Now he wants to use
them.  OK.  Let's see what he's got."

# You are incorrect. I have asserted, correctly, that the United States and
South Vietnam rejected the Geneva Accords, while they were supported by the
Communist powers and their North Vietnamese proxy. Therefore, given that the
North Vietnamese blatantly violated the neutrality of Laos and Cambodia (to
borrow from you, I believe everyone not in an Alzheimer's ward has heard of
the Ho Chi Minh Trail) after accepting said neutrality in the accords merely
illustrates how farcical and pointless the agreements actually were.

> This

"Oh, yeah, riiight.  Bombed the livin' shit out of
Laos, so that it's a hell hole of unexploded ordinance
to this day.  Concurrently, the CIA overthrows the
govt of Cambodia replacing Sihanouk with Lon Nol,
bombing the living shit out of Cambodia, bringing war
with the Khmer Rouge, and then the Khmer to power." 

# Let's stop right here. Provide one piece of evidence that the CIA
overthrew the government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. 

The Khmer Rouge was founded with the aid of the Vietnamese communists. Hanoi
snuck communist trainees, aid and materiel in and out of Cambodia throughout
the war. (see David Chandler, Brother Number One: A Political Biography of
Pol Pot) More importantly, is was not the bombings, but the attacks on Lon
Nol's forces by NVA regulars that brought his regime to the brink of
collapse. As Chandler himself puts it:

"Until the end of 1972, (Pol Pot's) troops were armed, trained, and often
led by the Vietnamese. The defeats suffered by Lon Nol in 1970-71 had been
at the hands of Vietnamese regular forces. Pol Pot in large measure owed his
victory to the Vietnamese." 

And tell me, who was the United States bombing? Could it have been the North
Vietnamese, who had violated the neutrality of Laos and Cambodia, to
construct the Ho Chi Minh Trail? Again, let me refer back to your sacrosanct
Geneva Accords:

Article 12: In their relations with Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, each member
of the Geneva Conference undertakes to respect the sovereignty, the
independence, the unity, and the territorial integrity of the
above-mentioned States, and to refrain from any interference in their
internal affairs.

I do not believe the terms could be anymore clear. The United States did not
interfere in the rest of Indochina until after the North Vietnamese
incursions. Beyond that, the United States did not accept the terms of the
Geneva Accords to begin with, but respected the neutrality of Laos and
Cambodia until the North Vietnamese interfered. 

"Yeah, that's respect for their neutrality.  The same
way the writer respects the truth.  And the same way I
respect the writer.  I've heard enough.  He's outta
here."

# Everything I have provided is easily verifiable, and I'm not the one
quoting websites that provide half a document.

<snip the remaining dribble, go take a shower>

# Interesting that pointing out that South Korea provides a better standard
of living for its citizens than North Korea is dribble in your opinion. Much
like pieces of documents that contradict your opinion, I imagine.

"Anti-communism tortures the facts till they conform to
dogma.  Intellectual (not to mention moral and
political) integrity embraces the facts and constructs
a world view based thereon."

# Who's providing incomplete documentation again?

It's a feature, not a bug. Messages posted to the BBS will only be forwarded

Probably a little off topic, but --

I need to have my wavelet web pages pay for themselves, while
maintaining control of them. Presently, I can't think of any other
simple way to generate some income from them, except for using
banners. I don't like banners but one banner from a company that is
related to digital signal processing would be acceptable.

Does anyone have any other ideas (clean and elegant, hopefully) for
generating income? My wavelet pages are accessed about 3000 times per

Steven Pinker's fat new book, on the rediscovery of a persistent and
universal human nature forged by our Darwinian history, is really superb. I
thought at first that it was just going to mooch through territory most list
members will be familiar with, if only from Pinker's earlier excellent
books--evolutionary and cognitive psychology, game theory, etc--but Pinker
manages to make some of the themes new while developing his amazingly
polymathic knowledge of these fields into a number of perhaps unexpected
policy recommendations (in the broadest sense). Libertarians might be
surprised by his account of the virtues of a state, and of a more
egalitarian income distribution; non-libertarians might learn something
unsettling (as I did) from his account of why he follows Chomsky in
linguistics but not in anarchist-communitarian politics. An extraordinarily
fertile book: highly recommended.

I can't think of any easy income source, but I'd be happy to host
them on my server for you, still under your control, if it's just
hosting costs you're worried about.

This is an amazing spacecraft. It keeps going and going and going
going and going, no matter how badly it limps. We should have a party
for it next year, to celebrate its long illustrious career.

Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.

News Release: 2002-231

Galileo Millennium Mission Status

NASA's Galileo spacecraft has begun transmitting high-priority 
scientific information that was collected and stored on its tape 
recorder during the orbiter's early-November dash by Jupiter, which 
brought it closer to the planet than ever before.

Damage from naturally strong radiation near Jupiter had left the tape 
recorder inoperable for weeks.  Galileo's flight team traced the 
problem to a light-emitting diode in the electronics controlling the 
motor drive, and then gradually and carefully completed a successful 
long-distance repair job.

"We're delighted playback has begun. There was no guarantee we could 
get to this point," said Dr. Eilene Theilig, Galileo project manager 
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  "It's a real 
tribute to the dedication and creativity of the team, and it 
continues the tradition set by the larger Galileo teams earlier in 
the mission who overcame challenging setbacks to keep the mission a 
success."

Playback and transmission began late last week, after tape movements 
earlier in the week positioned the tape to start the download with 
the data of greatest scientific interest. That information is from a 
period starting on Nov. 4, when Galileo was beginning to get closer 
to Jupiter than the moon Io's orbit. It ends when the spacecraft shut 
down its instruments on Nov. 5 as part of a precautionary standby 
reaction to other radiation-induced problems with the spacecraft's 
computer shortly after passing the inner moon Amalthea.

"We hope this will be the best data set that's ever been collected 
about the inner region of Jupiter's magnetic environment," said JPL's 
Dr. Torrence Johnson, Galileo project scientist.  The tape playback 
may also provide recorded information about dust particles that form 
Jupiter's faint "gossamer" ring, which Galileo flew through on Nov. 5.

The recovery was achieved by running a current through the damaged 
diode to anneal, or repair, radiation-caused damage. The first 
annealing attempt of six hours produced barely discernible 
improvement. Three additional treatments, for a total of 83 more 
hours of annealing treatment, produced progressive improvements, to 
the point that the tape recorder can run for about an hour at a time. 
A fifth treatment produced no additional gain. However, normal 
playback runs the tape recorder for only a few minutes at a time, so 
the improvement appears sufficient, said JPL engineer Greg Levanas, 
who helped plot the recovery strategy.

The flight team plans to continue playback until mid-January, the 
scheduled end of Galileo's mission operations.

Galileo's tape recorder became critical to the mission's strategy for 
handling science data after the spacecraft's main antenna failed to 
open fully during the journey from launch in 1989 to arrival at 
Jupiter in 1995. Most information from onboard science instruments 
has been recorded onto tape during the busy days when the spacecraft 
has flown near one of Jupiter's moons.  There have been over 30 such 
flybys since 1995.  The recorded data has been played back slowly for 
transmission to Earth via Galileo's smaller secondary antenna during 
the weeks and months before each subsequent flyby.

Galileo has operated five years longer than its original prime 
mission and has received more than four times the cumulative dose of 
harmful radiation it was designed to withstand.  Last month's 
encounter took the orbiter nearly twice as close to Jupiter as it had 
ever been before, and exposed it to the strongest radiation it has 
yet experienced.  In particular, the spacecraft entered the most 
intense region of a trapped proton belt and was exposed to 40 times 
the proton radiation of any single previous passage close to Jupiter, 
probably more than the rest of the mission combined.

The diode that radiation apparently damaged in the tape recorder is a 
gallium-arsenide semiconductor component that emits light. The 
motor-drive control has three of them. Light from them shines through 
windows in a rotating wheel onto detectors on the other side of the 
wheel. That setup senses the turning of the wheel and feeds digital 
logic that controls drive signals for the motor.

The damage apparently came from high-energy protons from Jupiter's 
radiation belt displacing atoms in the semiconductor's crystalline 
molecular lattice. Passing a current through the diode for hours 
serves as a way for electron flow to cause some of the displaced 
atoms to shift back to their original lattice positions.

Galileo has nearly depleted its supply of the propellant needed for 
pointing its antenna toward Earth and controlling its flight path. 
While still controllable, it has been put on a course for impact into 
Jupiter next September. The maneuver prevents the risk of Galileo 
drifting to an unwanted impact with the moon Europa, where it has 
discovered evidence of a subsurface ocean that is of interest as a 
possible habitat for extraterrestrial life.

Additional information about Galileo and the discoveries is available

Science, Washington, D.C.

In the December AAS Newsletter pg. 13,

Teaching Astronomy with Science Fiction

"A new annotated topical index of science fiction stories
and novels that use good astronomy is now available on the
education web pages of the ASP.

Compiled by Andrew Fraknoi, the listing currently has 195
entries organized into 40 categories, ranging from "anti-matter"
to "Venus." It includes stories and novels by a number of
scientists (some writing under a pseudonym) and by other
writers who pay attention to the accuracy of their science.
It is not designed as a complete index, but highlights stories
that teachers have found particularly useful for making scientific
ideas come alive for non-science students.

http://www.astrosociety.org/education/resources/scifi.html

The stories and novels listed deal with such topics as the
dangers of asteroid impacts and exploding stars, the future
exploration of Mars, the fate of travelers who venture close
to a black hole, the search for intelligent life in the universe
(and what forms it might take), and what it would be like to
live among the rings and moons of the outer solar system."

----------

And I see this on the web page, for you sci-fi writers and readers,
you can write Fraknoi and make suggestions:

"The author welcomes suggestions for additions to or
subtractions from this list, especially if your favorite
story with good science is left out"

No... that's the purpose of the Competing Hypothesis, which states that 
the Fairy of Doubt's existence is an elaborate hoax maintained by a vast 
conspiracy that includes the media, the schools, and the child's own 
parents...

Hm, I see what you mean.

searching for definition of Newtonmas I found:

http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Fun/holidays.html

Which also described:

----------------
Singularity Day
===============

A future holiday that will be celebrated
on the anniversary of the Singularity.
----------------

I just wondered if it wouldn't be more suitable to give it a celebration 
halftime instead of anually ;-)

So first celebration would be a year after, the next one 1/2 year, 1/4 
year, 1/8 year etc.

G8 Countries Call for Biometric Data of all Travelers to be Recorded and
Stored
[12.12.2002 12:08 ]


The eight industrial countries that regularly meet as the G8
Group[1] intend to make the security industry a gift of a very
special kind. Nothing less than the upgrading of the passports of
all travelers worldwide with biometric features is what the grand
get-together has in mind. heise online is on possession of a
planning protocol to that effect confirming the "universality,"
"urgency" and "technical reliability" of the concept.

The immigration experts of the group of states have already agreed
on an initial list of principles. This -- together with projects to
create a comprehensive databank about the exchange of child
pornography, as well as projects on the employment of undercover
investigators -- is to be completed during the first meeting of the
group of major powers under the future presidency of France at the
beginning of 2003 and then implemented with the aid of international
standardization bodies. In the paper the G8 working group
emphatically recommends the development of a "complete, common
technical interoperability standard," upon the basis of which all
nations of this world are to introduce the machine-reading of
identity papers with biometric features. The working group reckons
that this measure will enhance the capacity to fight international
terrorism. At the same time the experts are fanning the fear that a
delay in the implementation of such a global, interoperable system
would "unnecessarily increase the risks to our populations."

In devising the standard the immigration body is working together
with the International Civil Aviation Authority ICAO. That
Montreal-based body of the UN has for years now, as a driving force
behind the moves to harmonize passport types and systems, been a
vigorous proponent of facial features recognition as a global
biometrics feature. Fingerprint recognition and iris scanning too
are, according to the G8 report, being "actively" surveyed.

The G8 suggestions read in large part like a massive brochure of the
growth industry that has sprung up around biometrics, which ever
since September 11th can hope to garner major orders of ever
increasing size. The costs alone of building the infrastructure that
will ensure the readability of visas with biometric features, which
will be officially required to enter the United States from next
year on, are calculated to amount to 3.2 billion US dollars. "We
have become convinced," the G8 working group writes, "that biometric
authentication is able to enhance the individual's private sphere,
ease travelling and improve security." However, "proper"
implementation was called for, they added. "Careful scientific
tests" should be carried out to permit the "enormous promise"
inherent in biometric technologies to be realized.

Assurances of this kind have been given for years- yet tests
repeatedly show that biometrics technologies cannot as yet be
applied within the framework of large-scale projects. "The
technology suitable for mass consumption for identifying and
authenticating the identity of persons on the basis of their
physical features is obviously still in its infancy," was the final
conclusion reached by c't´s editors when they examined a range of
eleven distinct biometric access protection devices[2] and their
programs this spring. Indeed, during a field test by the Pentagon
the FaceIt software by Visionics failed in 51 percent of cases. The
head of BioTrusT (a project supported by the German Federal
Government) Henning Arendt on the other hand estimates the average
failure rate of facial feature recognition systems to amount to
"only" about ten percent. For him it would be "inconceivable,"
though, for every tenth person to be forced in future to face
problems when crossing a border.

"Besides the question of suitability for every-day use and of
security, many legal implications" were "still to a large extent
unclear," the Research Committee of the Bundestag, Germany's lower
chamber of parliament, concluded in its introduction to the Report
on biometric identification systems by the Office of Technology
Assessment. Data watchdogs, moreover, warn against piling up
uncontrollable mountains of data, point to the dangerous possibility
of ethnic screening and highlight the threat of camouflaged
investigations being introduced.

Nevertheless, the German Federal Government as early as a year ago
laid the foundations with its controversial second package of
anti-terrorist legislation for incorporating biometric features in
identity papers in machine-readable form. At the time the data
watchdogs had vigorously protested against the plan to fingerprint
and photograph the entire population and had argued by way of
criticism that biometric mass mobilization was an unsuitable means
of fighting terrorism; as, for instance, the 9-11 suicide suspects
had been in possession of valid US visas. Systems for monitoring
citizens more closely still are nevertheless still gaining ground.
Thus, for instance, the new EU visas, which from April 2003 onwards
will also be issued in Germany, are already calibrated to conform to
biometrics. What is more, the Interior Minister of the German
federal state of Bavaria, Günther Beckstein, this November presented
automatic facial features recognition projects in operation at the
border crossing points of Waidhausen and Nürnberg airport. (Stefan

I don't think any of the authors are explicitly transhumanists, but
Flynn's "Fallen Angels" has a very pro-technology anti-luddite theme
to it.

Some very good authors.  I suppose that SOME of the Telzy stories could 
be consider ... if not trans-human, then something similar.  This is 
basically because JW Campbell was so fond of super-heros.  (But also 
consider the stories about the Psycology Corps ...  much close, but not 
included in the collections.  Esp. "Sour Note on Palayata", "A Tale of 
Two Clocks", etc.)

The James H. Schmitz "Agent of Vega" also deals with SuperHuman 
characters blended with machines, for the same reasons.  (A 1940's 
perspective on where AI could lead.  Dated, but quite interesting.)

Also consider whether you should think of aliens as transhumans in 
disguise.  They all seem to react very much the way people woud.

Additionally, I'm not familiar with "The Lion of Farside", but many of 
John Dalmas works could be taken as being about transhumans.  (Actually, 
he's more of the "Virtual Universe" school... but doesn't that count?)

That said, it's a pity that the selections are so restricted, but it's 
also easily understandable.  In particular, I wish that he carried a 
large selection of out of print works, though I certainly understand the 
economic rationale for not doing so.  (Maybe he could negotiate for the 
right to carry a work if someone else entered the text?  [Not that I'm 
volunteering.  The ones I'm most interested in are the ones that I don't 
have access to.])

But it's a shame that so many works languish unreprinted because of 
copyright restrictions.  That does nobody any good.

Panspermia is old hat, but 41 km is not space, and it's not obvious how 
bacteria riding micron-sized dust at some 100 km/s a) will survive a 
~lightyear journey b) will survive reentry.

Pebbles are easy, but interstellar pebble transport doesn't happen.

Fractal Magnets May Fracture Old Technologies. Scientists have announced a
precocious new offspring of magnets and plastic -- conveniently embedded in
every card with a magnetic strip -- that could reinvent smart card
technology and yield a dazzling new array of high-tech gadgets. Plastic
magnets, surrounded by unusual magnetic fields shaped like branches and
snowflakes, may one day be the heart of computer hard drives small enough to
power the denizens of nanotechnology: ultra-small surgical robots or tapes
no larger than a molecule that house vast information libraries. (Yahoo news

production - 'What Is Nanotechnology?' presents developments in key areas
heavily influenced by nanotechnology, including: novel foods, smart

Trouble in nanoland. Plagued by both pessimism and hype, can nanotechnology
grow up? "HUMANITY, get down on your knees", scream the billboards
advertising "Prey", the latest novel by Michael Crichton, author of
"Jurassic Park". The horrible beasties threatening humanity in this new
thriller are not giant dinosaurs, but swarms of minute "nanobots" that can
invade and take control of human bodies. Nanobots are putative machines with
working parts that are smaller than 100 nanometres (billionths of a metre).
A film is, inevitably, in the offing. And to increase the impending
nano-horror, the chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy, is due next
autumn to publish a book fleshing out his own nano-Luddite views. (Economist

(Related to above) How much nano-danger can fit on the head of a pin? The
writer is a public policy scholar at the Smithsonian Institution's Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars. This commentary first appeared in
the Los Angeles Times. It's official. The nanotechnology debate is under
way. Michael Crichton's alarmist novel, Prey, with menacing swarms of
molecule-sized robots, hit bookstores last week, with a Hollywood
spectacular soon to follow. Nongovernmental groups, scientists and industry
are lining up for a major public relations battle over the good and evils of
nanotechnology. One side says nanotech will fill the world with
self-replicating microscopic ``nanobots'' -- 1,000 times smaller than the
diameter of a human hair -- that will wipe out humanity. The other calls
nano a silver bullet that promises a cure for cancer, an end to crop
shortages and the solution to cleaning up pollution.

IEDM: Intel, IBM joust at 90-nm. Intel and IBM each came to the 2002
International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) claiming logic performance
leadership at the 90-nm. But the two companies take much different
technology paths: IBM uses partially depleted silicon on insulator, while
Intel has adopted strained silicon technology for its 90-nm process. And the
two companies emphasize different metrics. IBM claims it has the fastest
ring oscillator reported in 90-nm CMOS, while Intel, which said it does not
report ring oscillator results because each company has a different method
of benchmarking that circuit, claims it has the fastest drive currents seen
to date for 90-nm silicon. (EE Times 12/10/02)

AMD discovers a flash nanowire structure. A novel nanoelectronic structure
has startled researchers at AMD with a sudden show of promise for future
flash memory devices. The structure, called a polysilicon nanowire, was
under investigation as a possible method for fabricating flash cells in
processes below 65 nm. But it caught the attention of researchers by
demonstrating an entirely unanticipated - and quite possible quantum
electronic behavior. AMD believes it can probably scale the existing
stacked-gate flash cell to the 65 nm process node, according to vice
president of technology Craig Sander. But the company is searching for novel
structures that can be fabricated below that level. (EETimes 12/12/02)

A quite amazing hoard of old and recent sf is now available at
www.Fictionwise.com, usually quite cheaply. The writers get a heroic royalty
rate, three or four times what we'd earn for paper.

Some time back I recommended Poul Anderson's BRAIN WAVE, a short and flawed
but immensely interesting early novel (nearly half a century old now) about
brain augmentation on a planetary scale. It was out of print and hard to
find at 2nd hand stores, but now it's at F/wise at
http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook8270.htm for four and a half bucks...

In case your suspicions are growing, no, I don't own stock in the company. I
do have a bunch of fiction on sale there, though, and next week I'll be
mentioning a long-lost book of mine when they release it.

But a funny thing happened on the way to-- Barbara Lamar recently posted a
mention here of the F/wise release of a novel by me and Rory Barnes. The
title given was AGAINST THE EMPIRE. That's a slightly revised version of an
unusual sf tale from 1983, VALENCIES. In the blurb for the novel, F/wise
used a citation from Russell Blackford describing the book in terms nobody
could mistake for a buoyant space opera, but still the thumbs-down voting by
early readers gave us all rather a shock. We decided maybe  the new name had
given at least some browsers the mistaken idea that it was like a STAR WARS
or STAR TREK adventure. Actually, our characters are immortal denizens of an
empire that's glutted the entire universe by 4004 A.D., restricting
technology in the interests of power and stability. Transhuman in the
upbeat/uplift mode, therefore, it ain't... Quick-smart we reverted to the
earlier title, and added the following warning to the blurb (and I hope
nobody here was caught by that unintended trap):

Authors' note: This revised edition was launched here in November 2002 under
its original working title, Against the Empire. We quickly found this change
misled some readers into expecting a rousing space opera in the tradition of
'Doc' Smith or Star Wars, so now we have reinstated the published title. A
word of caution, therefore: this book is not a military adventure yarn nor a
romance in deep space. What is it, then? Australian critic Van Ikin
comments: "... utopia is an elusive grail with a different meaning in every
age, and contemporary [Australian] writers of speculative fiction ...
examine the dangers and pitfalls of utopian fervour. The most notable of
these works are Beloved Son (1978) and Vaneglory (1981) by George Turner,
and Valencies (1983) by Rory Barnes and Damien Broderick." (The Penguin New
Literary History of Australia, 1988). Critics Ikin, McMullen and Blackford,
in Strange Constellations (1999), also point out that "in its structure,
although not its thematic concern with individual freedom and universal
human dignity, the book is atypical of Broderick's fiction, quite different
from his novels of time travel and altered realities..."

If all this sounds a little downbeat, take heart! Brian W. Aldiss, in
Trillion Year Spree (1986), praised Valencies as "one of the more playful SF
novels of recent years" and quoted it at some length. Ikin, McMullen and
Blackford say: "Some of the book's set pieces ... are glorious pieces of
comic writing." So, yes, it is a literary dystopia, but we hope it's a lot
of fun as well.

It's now available as VALENCIES at

warned... :)

It should be noted that Fictionwise titles are available only
in bizarre proprietary formats, and some of them only in
encrypted formats.  Another pay service, Webscriptions, makes
its titles available in standard formats just like Baen, and
has current releases (indeed many even before publication in
paper form), and makes multiple works available for a single
price, so you're not forced to buy a title blind.  In general
I think that's a much more sensible model with more respect for
the consumer.

I have never bought one of their downloads myself (since I don't own a Palm
or equivalent), but the e-books I've seen from them are perfectly readable
on Adobe Acrobat freeware.

I have bought ebooks from them, and used Acrobat. No problems at all -
although acrobat is a bit crappy for reading a novel, it's good enough. I
can download any of the other formats for books that I've bought anytime I
like. Does anyone know if any of the other formats are good for using on a
notebook running win2000? ie: better than acrobat?

Saying "We support AppleMicroPalmReader 17.5 and 28 other formats you
never heard of unless you shop at WalMart like your grandmother" is just
a way to avoid the real issue.  How about plain fucking text that ANY
user can read on any hardware, and format and adapt to his own needs?
Nothing else matters.  If you ALSO support some special fancy formats
that's cool too, but unless you supply even one STANDARD format the
complaint is valid and his answer is evasive and dishonest.

He says that the formats he offers are standrd for his industry, and
he may be right, but they're still not PUBLIC STANDARDS.  Public
standards outlive particular industries and markets and products.
Just because Microsoft or Palm calls something "standard" doesn't
make it one, even of all the vendors in a market agree.  The only
format he lists that might have a claim to the name is what he calls
"Adobe Acrobat", which might be PDF, but the site doesn't make that
clear.  If it is PDF, which is a standard, then my objection is
withdrawn.  But if it is, why don't they say so?  I suspect because
it's really some secret format that Acrobat can read but that isn't
real PDF.

That's a perfectly valid policy.  A stupid decision on the publisher's
part, but one they certainly have a right to make.

Adobe Acrobat is not available as "free software" in the FSF sense,
it's only without cost to those customers who use an operating
system that Adobe chooses to write for.  True standard PDF files
can be read by true free software that any user can compile from
source on any operating system.  If the files are really PDF, as I
said, the complaint is withdrawn.  As someone who has been free from
the Microsoft gravy train since 1996, I don't give a damn what
features he's provided for obedient little Windows users.

"The isolated organisms are very similar to known terrestrial
 varieties."

I seem to recall that last time this popped up (a year ago?) there
were claims of bacteria unlike any known on Earth.

Panspermia is strongly associated with kookiness.

You don't recognise "Larry Niven"?  Have you heard of the Ringworld novels?
Lord, if you haven't heard of the "Ringworld novels" then you don't
know about megascale superstructures.  That would imply that you haven't
read Dyson's original paper on Dyson "shells", Anders' paper on Jupiter
Brains, my paper on Matrioshka Brains, and subsequent theoretical work
by Frank or Lloyd.  You probably don't even know who Bremmerman, Bekenstien
and Landauer are.

I am hereby proposing this as the 3rd greatest "crime" in the history
of extropic & transhumanist development.  These are:

1) Sasha's unfortunate premature demise.
2) A large  number of extropians being sold a bill of goods by a
   responsible and qualified academic "expert") at Extropy 4 (which
   prompted my rather infamous outburst from the audience).
3) Max M. (from Denmark), not to be confused with Max More, doesn't
   recognize the name of "Larry Niven".

Lord, we need to invent a whole new body of law -- "Crimes against Extropy".
And Max is probably going to be the first person we prosecute under them.
Are we now allowing people with a complete lack of knowledge about megascale
superstructures onto the list?  That is just a completely unacceptable situation!
It seems clear that if we are going to maintain the quality of the Extropian
list that we are going to need to require "entrance exams".  Only those
people who have read all of the necessary background literature should
be allowed to particpate.  (Of course since I'm a little behind on
my extropic reading, I realize this might eliminate me -- but hey, that
might make some people on the list very happy.)

Rant, stamp of several feet, slamming of doors, razzim, frazzim, moaning
and complaining, Robert stomps off the stage.

(Side note to Max -- please take this minor rant with a large dose of humor
and send me an offlist note if you want me to provide pointers to any of
the things I have cited.)

In fact, F/wise are listing various nonfiction works (including THE SPIKE,
but in an e-dition released by the paper publisher, Tor, at about the same
price, which is absurd of Tor and self-defeating), although most of those
appear to be self-helpish or business oriented.

Robert's point about Fictionwise being a `commercial marketing site' speaks
to Lee Crocker's rant about the evils of not providing plain text that's
easily disseminated to all & sundry free of charge. When the rest of us can
come by Piclab and get our image processing done for nothing, and our free
food and drink at the market, I'll be all for that.

Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if we had
Xanadu, if AutoDesk hadn't been eaten by the banks,
etc.  Is anyone working on building Xanadu from within
the Web?  Consider my idea for a social contract as
one of the base points of a universal financial web.  

Another possibility: creating a market for clock
cycles.  It is truly tragic that we are saddled with
this mindless excuse for an OS - Windoze.  By now, I
was confident that we would have in general use
systems that would continually optimize themselves to
search for each individual's heart's desire.  Such
systems would, of course, tend to expand to the limits
of available processing power, memory, etc.  So, if
you have something on a site that is valuable to me to
access, then I should trade something for it.  If not
money, then maybe resources for you to access, as in a
credit on my account within the computational universe
to your account.

Just a thought - or two.  You can pay me later...

(1) I made no mention of the re-distributability of the works; only
the ability to read them on my Linux box.  As it turns out, the files
they call "Acrobat" format are actually PDF, so they can be read (I
bought "Valencies".

(2) I charge good money for my time, as I would expect anyone to.
But I have never, and will never, seek to exercise control over
what anyone else does with the information that might result from
it.  Please try to understand the difference. 

I should also point out that the classic distribution system for
your work isn't as peachy as you might think.  Your words have
value because people like me enjoy reading interesting things.
When I first heard about "The Spike", I looked for it every time
I went into a bookstore (which is frequently--I have a very large
collection), but couldn't find it because it wasn't distributed
here.  The system failed you: I was eager and willing to spend my
money for a copy, but I could not.  Later, after reading more of
you here and meeting you on your trip to California, I happened
across a copy of "White Abacus" at a used bookstore and bought it.
Unfortunately, you received none of that $3, which is what I was
willing to spend on a random chance I might like a book (it wasn't
bad, but I wouldn't recommend spending $20 on a hardcover), so
the system failed you again.

I did finally find a copy of The Spike, and as I mentioned I just
boought "Valencies".  You mention that you get better royalties
from the latter, and I'm not surprized.  So at least you get
something for your efforts.  But please don't think I repudiate
the notion of copyright because I have something against
authors making money--that couldn't be further from the truth.

The Iron Maiden is closing on freedom from involuntary search 
and seizure, freedom to live one's life without a blow-by-blow 
accounting to the state, freedom to simply be left alone.  A 
large assist for world-wide tyranny is here heing constructed.

Notice that is being done in the name of a relatively small 
blight in the world, child pornography.  So all of us, in all 
developed countries, are supposed to be absolutely trackable to 
stop child pornography?!?!  Is any person with IQ over 90 
actually swayed by such a gratuitous excuse?

I am very sad to say that it is probably already too late.  Too 
few even see the danger.  Too many that should no better welcome 
it and cheer it on.  Too many of the rest thing it can never 
lead to any arm for them.

I've often pondered the various obstacles that make "selling"
transhuman/extropian ideas to the ignorant/indifferent masses so difficult.
Although I'm pulling the following range out of my rear end, and
purposefully ignoring other important factors such as education, ideology,
sf exposure, and web-ability etc., I feel a good transhumanist candidate
(100% >H lore virgin) probably falls between the ages of 28 and 40 years,
nine times out of ten. Any younger, and they're probably too focused on
other matters to give much thought to getting old and actually dying one
day, or trying to figure out their place in the evolving metaverse. Any
older, and their memes/dreams have probably hardened more than their
arteries.

That's why I thought this item was rather interesting:
http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=116&art_id=qw1039668480796B241&set_i
d=1

What a great way to teach some of that former <28 group that thinking about
transhuman ideas might be worthwhile.

As for the over 40 group? Well, we'll probably have to reanimate a vitrified
dog or two before they'll come around.

Gee, that brings me back, that was the second science fiction book I ever
read, the first being "What Mad Universe" by Fredrick Brown. At the time I
thought they were both quite wonderful but I'm a little scared to reread
them today because I was pretty young and I don't know how well they would
hold up.

Just responding quickly to this point: paper distribution surely sucks,
under the current increasingly centralized methods of book marketing.
Luckily, amazon and other online stores provide non-item-du-jour books like
THE SPIKE at somewhat cut-price levels that compensate for mailing costs.
Granted, most of us want to flip through a book and see what it's like
before laying down the plastic, and maybe the sample pages they provide are
insufficient. Still, it's an alternative to bookstores.

John K Clark recalls Poul Anderson's BRAIN WAVE nostalgically:

Fredric Brown's book was a comic farce sending up pulp sf clichés and
fandom, which possibly escaped your youthful notice. It surely escaped mine;
I thought it was terrifically exciting in its own right, and blushed later
on seeing what he'd really been up to. Good fun, though.

But Poul's novel holds up surprisingly well as a serious extrapolatory
novel. His prose is cleanly wrought, his projections of a world where IQ
keeps soaring in humans and animals alike is rather well thought through,
his device of using an uplifted retarded man as his by-our-standards
ordinary genius viewpoint character is effective. If there's a major
problem, it's with the compression entailed by novel length in those awful
days when sf books had to fit inside 60,000 words or less (and even that
looks like a virtue compared with much of today's shameless bloat). I
suggested to Poul a couple of years ago that it would be a wonderful book
for him to revisit and develop in his late maturity; alas, he was even then
sinking into his final illness. Reading the book now conveys the sense of
what it must have been like to be a brilliant young sf writer in the early
1950s, when the groundwork had been laid by the Golden Age geniuses and now
sophistication and a deeper insight lay beckoningly ahead. Ah...

He didn't say that.  He implied that Larry Niven was not of interest
for transhuman subject matter, which seems correct to me.

What you're talking about there is machine learning.

There's a good book about some technical machine learning, "Machine 
Learning".

http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html

I think everybody's thought about writing their own OS.  I did.

I got a bunch of books that I think contain the information required to 
run an operating system on all PC hardware.  I got some PC system books 
and a book about video cards, almost all the PCI and other standards are 
available over the Internet.

If the operating system itself streamlines its operations with forms of 
machine learning, which it does, there are a lot more free resources.

There are places in the TCP/IP protocols to enable online page and site 
billing.  Some of the HTTP return values are for transaction 
information.  Through computers are connected gateways to financial 
information.

Another thing you're talking about there is the old uploads/downloads 
ratio.  Bulletin boards used to have requirements to upload as much as 
was downloaded, or more or less, enforced by the bulletin board software.

Ah, the computer BBS.  There were really lots of things on Telnet.  
There used to be SAABRE right there.  I think most computer bulletin 
board systems used one phone line.  There's not much like a roomful of 
computers.

There was a young fellow from Trinity Who took the square root of 
infinity. But the number of digits Gave him the fidgets; He dropped Math 
and took up Divinity.

In the limerick above, physicist George Gamow dealt with the paradox of 
a finite being contemplating infinity by passing the buck to theologians.

Brigham Young University researchers are reporting in the December issue 
of the prestigious oncology journal "Cancer Research" that they have 
successfully tested a new method in laboratory animals that would 
concentrate the impact of cancer drugs on specific cancerous tissues, 
thus sparing the rest of the body from harm.

Two years after the human genome was mapped, scientists are drawing a 
stunning insight by comparing human genes with those of mice. Their 
conclusion? Researchers now agree human genes are definitely missing 
something; they're just not entirely sure what. Figuring it out could 
involve arguments about the very definition of the word gene.

Might be true, but it doesn't invalidate the hypothesis. 

If panspermia is true it might affect the Great Filter in interesting 
ways. The emergence of life can be extremely rare, but interplanetary 
and interstellar spread makes this low probability be multiplied by a 
macro multiplier. On the other hand the spread might be patchy - the 
seeding will be random, and the drift rate can be so slow that large 
regions have had no time yet to be reached by any spores.

I doubt this is true. My own experience is that it is very easy to
get younger people interested in transhumanism, maybe *too* easy -
they are attracted to it and then cling to it as a somewhat
undigested view they just have accepted, not really considered
deeply. On the other hand older people are far more mentally flexible 
than our culture gives them credit for, but usually they demand a bit 
more in-depth discussion before they start to believe in all the >H 
stuff (which IMHO is a healthier approach but demands more of 
proselytizers).

Sounds like a wonderful educational tool. I can imagine something
akin to the childcare classes today where people drag around a bag of
flour with a beepy alarm clock to simulate caring for a baby, but in
this case an "ageing awareness class" to get people to really
understand *why* life extension is a good thing.

We have a plausible interplanetary mechanism.

While having interstellar panspermia would be cool, we so far can't see 
how. It can't ride the dust while having no metabolism. If we say 
interstellar panspermia, we must also say vacuum life.

Adobe Acrobat describes a number of data formats; some of them proprietary 
(encrypted). While Elcomsoft has been found not guilty in the very recent 
trial (we'll see how the Norwegian kid fares), Adobe is still very much 
unrepentant.

While tools like xpdf (and pdftotext) can read some of Adobe Acrobat
formats, a much better solution would be to reject them on lack of
openness and because of commercial interests embroiled therein.

Absolutely. (I have never been on that particular train, thankfully).

"More" is not better. Baen free library while not offering .TXT at least 
offers gzipped HTML and RTF, which both can be exported into .TXT.

Again the 'more is better' fallacy. It doesn't matter how many proprietary 
formats he supports, as long as he supports the basic open ones.

Ah, I thought so. Proprietary formats, all about them. I bet their Adobe

Yes, I see what he means. By conveniently omitting HTML and RTF he shows 
that he's a proprietary bastard, and is blowing heavy smoke assuming his 
target audience (you here) is too naive to notice it. Not good, Steve.

Yep, having seen presentations by the primary promoters such as
Wickramasinghe I would tend to agree.  But I did get a chance to
speak with him at the OSETI III conference and did some spin control.
He isn't as completely ill-informed as the public line of comment

> Might be true, but it doesn't invalidate the hypothesis.

Yes.  Its an old and "kooky" hypothesis -- but might just be
able to be refined given current knowledge of genomes resistant
to radiation (e.g. Deinococcus), interplanetary meteorites, etc.

This is a very interesting area that really should be explored more fully.
I think Eugene's subsequent messages "dis" the whole interstellar spread
possibility -- *BUT* one doesn't need "LIFE" to survive interstellar
transport -- one only needs some of the components for "LIFE" to survive.
If one can get a ribosome or a proteosome or a G-coupled receptor (or at
least the blueprint for one of these) across the divide one may be a
huge step up from an evolutionary perspective.  Hell, even getting the
"code" for a single DNA repair enzyme (there are dozens in the current
basic code set) across the divide probably puts one *way* ahead in the game.

Life doesn't have to survive -- its the *code* that counts.
To refute panspermia you have to make some *very* complex arguments
about the stability of DNA (which is more stable than RNA), radiation
levels, transit times, probable radiation exposures, size of a "useful"
genomic unit, probability that the destination system uses "DNA" as
its information carrier, etc.

Now as most people on the list know -- I *like* complex technical
arguments but this isn't one that I would tackle lightly.

As always, Anders has cut to the chase.  I'm not so sure I understand
the "Great Filter" perspective since it seems to me the G.F. is based
on an evolved "intelligent" life form.  That is somewhat different
from the distribution of genomic "sub-units" based on astronomical
impacts, random phenomena, etc.  (I.e. one is "intentional" while the other
is "random").  But Anders does seem to sum up the essential differences.

It would appear that the question revolves around whether or not
"our" universe just happens to be in the state of the "emergence"
of intelligence.  So we have a mix of genomic code being distributed
by panspermia (and slowly evolving) with current or emerging capabilities
destined to soon overwhelm it with our own self-directed evolution.  All of
this combined with a lack of knowledge of what really exists (now)
outside of our light-cone.  (So we could really be in a multi-state
phase space.)

What a *very* strange web it is that we weave.

Robert

The idea of the story is moving, and the plot works well.  But when I 
reread it, I found it very clumsy.  As if he were being careless about 
his craftsmanship.  I think that Poul thought of this one as a 
knock-off, and just wrote it because he had too.  Despite the strong 
basic structure, it doesn't work well.  I think that he didn't like it, 
and didn't realize how he would feel about it until after he signed the 
contract.  Contrast this with his "Bicycle built for Brew" aka "The 
Makeshift Rocket".  That one has a rather weak plot, but he LIKED the 
story.  And so it *flows*.  As a result it's a much stronger work.

While agreeing completely with much of this, xpdf readable acrobat files 
have many advantages.  Still, I don't see that they have many advantage 
over rdf files.  (But they have LOTS of advantages over HTML!)

But I consider Brain Wave to be recent science fiction.  I'm thinking of 
magazine serials and stories from the 1930's and 40's (I never saw any 
significant amount of the work from the 20's or earlier).  Early Jack 
Williamson, e.g.  I once had an early story of his called the 
Equalizer.  Or the E.B. Cole novella's.  Or the early James H. Schmitz.  
Well, most of what I know actually was written after WWII, but I saw 
enough to know that the mood and theming of the stories changed 
DRAMATICALLY around them.  Eric Frank Russell wrote a truly moving short 
story about militarism, that includes the entire text of a child's story 
about experiencing an aerial bombing "...My cat went splat against the 
wall...".  I can't remember it, and I regret it much.  This is a story 
that would be very important to us now, if we but knew it.

And sometimes the early work of an author is their best.  "Blood's a 
Rover" by, I believe, Chad Oliver, was never again equalled by that 
author.  But it was too short to be half of an ACE double, so it died 
ca. 1952, when that magazine issue was replaced by the next.

Consider the concept of the Protectors.  They seem clearly TransHuman.  
I tend to consider all science fiction aliens as disguised transhumans, 
but the protectors aren't even disguised.
But contrast the differing ways in which intelligence expresses itself 
in the different species of the "Known Worlds" series.  This seems 
clearly significant for TransHumanity.  These are differing paths that 
we could take.  And we may end up taking all of them.

### Personally I'd find it hard to imagine a snippet of DNA capable of
transferring across interstellar distances and then successfully
incorporating into other life. Remember, the DNA triplet code is largely
arbitrary, an accident of history (aside from the codon structure with the
third relatively non-significant base). The exact complement of aminoacids
is not strictly an immutable law of nature, either.

So, for "partial" panspermia you'd need a remarkable coincidence of locally
produced codes, on many levels. For whole organism panspermia you also need
some pretty unusual circumstances - you need a highly radiation-resistant
organism (can anybody calculate the cumulative dose of cosmic rays over the
millions of years it takes for a meteorite to travel to another stellar
system?), with the ability to use prebiotic organic substances, or with an
autotrophic metabolism. We don't know how long it takes to evolve highly
radiation-resistant spores, I wouldn't be surprised if they occurred only
after the prebiotic sources were exhausted by preceding waves of extremely
simple creatures, which implies a lack of the relevant metabolic adaptations
in radiation-resistant bugs. If so, then the successful panspermic organism
would need to be autotrophic, and this requires pretty complex metabolism.
No Mycoplasma-sized genome would suffice, and with a relatively large genome
the ability to resist radiation goes down.

And then, of course, the problem of the sheer immensity of the lifeless
void, diluting the already uncommon spores that survive being ejected by a
volcanic or other blast. Even with the perfect organism the likelihood of
reaching a suitable planet before radiation destroys the genome will be very
small, unless one assumes spores being intentionally carried out of the
gravity well, in stunningly huge numbers.

I give 10e30 odds against non-sentient interstellar panspermia.

I find they do quite a few programmes that mention cryonics, most if not 
all of which are generally quite favourable.  I think they may even have 
had one with Alan Alda in it (He's certainly been on one about extended 
lifespan/caloric restriction).  Alcor is typically the provider they mention.

Does anyone get the Sci-Fi channel?  They run small 5 minute items between 
programmes which are also pretty positive on >Human/Extropic themes.  They 
have one about extended life, Artificial Intelligence and cyborgism (which 
includes the Extropes all-time favourite, Prof. Kevin Warwick).

As I mentioned, it turns out that the Fictionwise files are indeed
PDF, so I was able to read with "ggv", without involving Adobe.

Give the fogies a little more credit for flexibility.  I'm just on
the edge of 40 myself, and I know there are philosophical positions
I haven't solidified in my mind yet.  I also know that I've swayed
older folks on certain issues, especially politics, though I admit
it's unlikely that I'll be able to talk my parents into cryonics.
I still have some hope for my big sister (45).

A brief article about Vernor Vinge's Singularity theory appears in the
December 2002 issue of Esquire magazine. For you, to whom this message is
sent, there is nothing new in the article. But the fact that the Singularity
has been mentioned in a magazine like Esquire is another sign that the meme
has spread deeper into the general culture.

Cool, an interesting debate with Rafal who is more than well qualified
to discuss this topic.  :-)

In general I'd agree, this discussion would be something interesting
to potentially structure for the Long Bets foundation (www.longbets.org).

A couple of responses --
- chemical molecules may survive a long time (I think the paper scerir
pointed out may point to this).  In fact *most* geological samples,
certainly asteroidal material, are collections of non-covalently
bonded molecules -- DNA being a covalently bonded molecule *should*
survive to a greater extent than its carrier.
- I don't think one can cite arguments that the triplet code is
completely "arbitrary".  It is clear one can construct a different
code (and I've even designed one).  It might be arbitrary -- but I'd
probably give at least even odds that we will discover that it isn't
(thus at least one long-bet)  :-).

> So, for "partial" panspermia you'd need a remarkable coincidence of locally
> produced codes, on many levels.

Agreed.  But we don't have a clue as to how much "biological" material
we are being assaulted with that contains a code that is totally useless
on the Earth!  There could be tons of the stuff hitting us every day.

But the point of my message *wasn't* that you get "whole organism
panspermia".  It was that you *happen* to get some useful information
transfer.  You have to balance the cumulative dose of cosmic rays
with the number of copies of G-protein coupled receptor DNA.  That
may not be a small number and so surviving the radiation may indeed
be feasible.  As I said -- its a complex topic -- so complex that
I'm not enthusiastic about wrestling with it.

> We don't know how long it takes to evolve highly radiation-resistant spores,

Agreed.  But we know that there are high-radiation environments out there.
And so for organisms to develop and survive in those environments they
have to develop the defenses.  Radiation resistance actually has an
negative effect from an evolutionary standpoint because it slows
down the rate at which mutations propagate through generations
(and could subsequently drive the development of another trait
such as intelligence).  So at least in some environments one *should*
see the development of high levels of radiotolerance.

Here we are getting into some very complex issues regarding the
evolution of life itself, the code(s) it might be based on,
the environment and the metabolic resources available in it.
This is *way* beyond the question of panspermia.

I'll grant the fact that smaller genomes are unlikely to contain
a full complement of DNA preservation or repair genes.  But the
Deinococcus genome is only 3.26 megabases compared with the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome which is 4.41 megabases
(http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/genomes/) both of which
are smaller than the E. coli genome at 4.64 megabases.

I disagree entirely that a "successful panspermic organism" has to
be "autotrophic".  The point I was trying to make was that one
doesn't have to throw organisms across interstellar distances
one only needs to throw information across interstellar distances.
Now, on the receiving end, one does need to have something like
a virus that can pick up a small fragment of DNA that happens
to have something like an ATP receptor site that can be utilized
creatively.  I believe there are viruses and/or bacteria that do
pick up DNA, incorporate it into their genomes and gradually may
evolve such that it performs a "useful" function.  The question
revolves around whether the "nature" of the universe is to drive
biological systems into "niches" that happen to be able to transfer

Rafal, I think you are thinking too much along the lines of it has
to be "spore" transfer [which may be what many panspermic proponents
think].  It doesn't have to be that way -- it could be molecular
transfer.

The question isn't "How many complete complex life forms can
I transmit across interstellar space?"  The question is "How many
organized pre-evolved "bits" of information can I transmit across
interstellar space that is (a) meaningful; and (b) short-cuts
the development process, where-ever it ends up?"

Very different from the "classic" panspermia hypothesis -- but
one that may be more useful.

Supernovas or planetary collisions would seem to be likely sources
of carrying very large numbers of "bits" out of the gravity well.

Obviously in both cases you have to deal with the the genomic
destruction caused by the radiation/heat -- but you have to
complement that with the number of genomes.  I've done some
work with these numbers and I would not want to make a judgement
one way or the other -- as I've said it is a very complex technical
argument.

> I give 10e30 odds against non-sentient interstellar panspermia.

10e30 -- that is a *really* big number -- I'd probably take that bet
(against Rafal) -- even though I'm generally opposed to the traditional
panspermia hypothesis.

Going further, in the same direction: Whole Earth Review, flagship
magazine of the intelligent greens, is devoting the entire spring '03 [I
think] issue to the Singularity. Writers invited to contribute include
Vernor Vinge, Bruce Sterling, Cory Doctorow, Jaron Lanier, myself,
and quite a few others.

This isn't so much a first mention of the Singularity -- WER ran Vinge's
original essay back in 1994 -- but a sledgehammer assault on the barricades
of ignorance. Some of us are tackling different aspects (I'm writing about
the dangers of a panopticon singularity -- a total surveillance state),
but hopefully it'll be a comprehensive, provocative, and interesting read.

Just to respond to Kai Becker's criticism that many other groups
besides Iraq might have obtained Ames strain: there are three broad
reasons to think that Iraq is the most likely candidate. The main
such reason is the evidence that Iraq was the state sponsor for
a string of Al Qaeda-associated plots (WTC93, "Bojinka", OKC95,
finally 9/11). If Iraq sponsored 9/11, and 9/11 was associated with
the anthrax, then it is most likely that the anthrax came from Iraq
as well.
http://www.meib.org/articles/0106_ir1.htm
http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/index.jsp?section=static&page=jaynadavis
http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/2395416

The second reason is Iraq's track record with anthrax. Anthrax was
indisputably central to Iraq's biological weapons program. In 1995,
when the program's existence was uncovered and Iraq began admitting
details to inspectors, one of the revelations was that in late 1990,
with the approach of the Gulf War, Scuds were loaded with liquid
anthrax and pointed at Israel, to be fired in the event that
coalition forces marched on Baghdad (TIME, Sept 4, 1995). There's
a whole book ("The Continuing Storm" by Avigdor Haselkorn) arguing
that this is the real reason Saddam Hussein wasn't overthrown back
then.

Iraq is also regarded as one of only three states ever to crack
all the problems of anthrax weaponization (the other two being
the USA and the USSR). The anthrax in the letters was prepared
in a sophisticated fashion, so again Iraq is on the shortlist.
Details of the weaponization signature have been kept secret, but
the latest reports say that the spores were a dry powder treated
with a silicon additive ("fused silica" or "silicon nanopowder"),
which is within Iraq's means both materially and technically.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A28334-2002Oct27&notFound=true

The third reason, which supplements the first, is the uniqueness
of Iraq's relationship to the USA and to 9/11. Iraq was the only
country with which the USA was officially at war at that time,
and its official media praised the attacks. If you look up "Bin
Laden" by Yossef Bodansky (published in 1999), page 362, you will
find the remark that Al Qaeda and Iraqi intelligence were reportedly
at work on preparing spectacular terrorist attacks which the
Islamists would "agree with" and which Saddam would "understand",
but with which both would deny any operational connection.

Theory B (an insider) was meant to encompass this possibility.
Anyway, just to be a broken record, any advocate of the anthrax
loner theory has to explain the Florida anthrax. Palm Beach County
was absolutely central to the hijackers' penultimate preparations;
the three out of four team leaders who were based in Al Qaeda's
Hamburg cell all met up there, along with many if not all of
their support teams (see "The Cell", John Miller et al). There
are maybe a dozen anecdotal reports or verifiable facts linking
the guys who were in Florida either with the anthrax target
(American Media Inc) or with an interest in chem/bio terrorism.
Under Theory D, all that has to be explained away.

>Trouble is that different labs leave telltales.  Only a few of those labs 
>(iirc) can produce that grade of that strain.

Genetically, the Ames anthrax from those dozen labs is apparently
indistinguishable. If by "grade" you mean the skill with which
the anthrax was weaponized (finely milled powder, silica dopant
to keep the spores separated), I don't know whether any of those
labs does that stuff, or whether they concentrate purely on
culturing. The Dugway facility in Utah may have performed anthrax
aerosolization experiments with samples from USAMRIID, but they
don't say which strain was used.

But as they confessed to the UN in 1995, they were ready to do so
in 1991, if pushed to the edge.

The argument for a cover-up runs like this:

1. If the people thought that the anthrax came from Iraq, they
would support war against that country.
2. But if we do go to war against Iraq, Iraq may arm Al Qaeda
with bucketloads of biological weapons, against which our civilian
population has little to no defense.
3. Since we can't risk open war against Iraq just yet, we have
no reason to publicly make the case for the Iraqi connection.

I wouldn't exactly call it a bluff. But I would maintain that
for now, both sides are being deterred from all-out conflict.
I doubt that Al Qaeda is deterred, given its cult of martyrdom,
but the potential state sponsors who have the WMD arsenals are.
So all Al Qaeda can do is stake out the London Tube, and wait
for the nerve gas to show up in the mail. Similarly, the USA
feels confident enough to conduct assassinations and intercept
missile shipments, but that seems to be about it.

>
>Nope.  It is not so known.  The one supposed incident usually quoted as

The *way* it has been called into question is very suspicious.
In the most recent round, the New York Times ran a story saying
that Czech President Havel had discreetly contacted the White House
to say that there was no evidence of the Prague meeting. This story
served as the basis of an editorial the next day. Buried in that
same issue was an amendment to the first story: "Havel Denies
Telephoning U.S. on Iraq Meeting". They manage to rescue the
basic premise: 'The spokesman ... said Mr. Havel was still
certain there was no factual basis behind the report... In an
interview last month, Mr. Havel told The Times that he knew of
no proof that the two men had met. "I definitely wasn't at this
meeting," Mr. Havel said with a laugh.'
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/23/opinion/23WED1.html
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/23/international/europe/23CZEC.html

Havel had said earlier that he gave the report that Atta met
with the Iraqi diplomat "70 percent" odds of being correct. 
http://edwardjayepstein.com/2002question/prague.htm

The operational commander of 9/11 is believed to have been Khalid
Sheikh Mohammed (uncle of WTC93 bomber Ramzi Yousef, who worked
with him on 9/11 precursor Operation Bojinka). Before KSM was
publicly named as the mastermind, ex-CIA officer Robert Baer
published a book ("See No Evil", epilogue) placing him in Prague.
And the NSA intercepted Atta calling KSM just before 9/11.
http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/mld/ledgerenquirer/news/politics/3416632.htm

So the whole media saga surrounding the alleged meeting in Prague
gives every appearance of being an exercise in the management
of public opinion.

I'd like to see someone discuss the tension between Singularity and
Doomsday Argument / Fermi Paradox. I expect that tension to become
a major concern of the scientifically literate intelligentsia within
the next few years.

I don't buy this, with possibly the exception of the transfer of a

Imagine that life is spread around by spores, encysted bacteria or 
ribozymes in rocks thrown away by meteor impacts. There is a tiny 
transfer between the planets of the solar system (with some biases) and 
an even tinier leakage of lifebearing pieces into interstellar space. 
Occasionally pieces fall down in suitable environments, and then 
life breaks loose quickly. 

I did a quick and dirty Matlab model of this (included below), assuming
that spores are drifting slowly through interstellar space while stars
buzz around at ~200 km/s. If the probability of release and infection
are high enough you get a cool-looking chain reaction - at first one
little star has life, leaving a trail of very dilute spores. Eventually
another star system with a suitable planet passes by and is infected,
and so on.  Looks very nice, and one gets a typical Gompertz growth
curve. The next thing would be to run this in 3D and with calculated
release probabilities, death rates in space and impact probabilities. I
think we will end up in the boring "almost never happens"-range, but it
is a doable calculation (and maybe a nice paper?). 

Spread from low gravity worlds to high gravity worlds is preferred, and 
I would guess interstellar spread is easier from outer worlds than from 
inner worlds. If there are brown dwarf gardens they might be a powerful 
reservoir of life and a source of spores.

This could be possible to partially estimate from this kind of model; we 
could at least estimate the time constant of the Gompertz curve, 
especially by adding other features to the life model of the stars. 
Assume the growth of life is a kind of Markov process, with low 
probability filters for going to the next "higher" stage. Once you get 
expansive rationality the game is over. We might not have much on the 
later probabilities, but extending this simple model to single-celled 
life, multicellular and intelligent life based on estimates from Earth 
fossil records could give us some hints.

(Panspermia is taken more seriously these days)

Extracted from my post to extropians list August 8, 2002
with subject: "A Short Report of Asteroids, Comets, Meteors,
Dust and Culture in Potsdam and Bär-lin"

"In the last year, at this meeting and at several earlier meetings, I
have noticed presentations about different aspects of Hoyle's panspermia
idea. I know that on this list I've been rather negative about the
theory because it has carried the 'kook factor' for more than 20 years.
That 'kook factor' seems to be fading some as more and more planetary
scientists are taking parts of the idea seriously, testing the ideas in
the lab if they can. I also noticed that a relatively new book:
_Astrobiolgy: The Quest for the Conditions of Life_, edited by Horneck
and Baumstark-Khan, Springer-Verlag, 2002 has several chapters
addressing the topic, describing relatively new results from lab
experiments.

At the ACM, the most relevant paper I saw addressing the panspermia idea
was from a colleague from Kent (UK), Mark, Burchell, who gave a poster
presentation of the rate of bacteria surviving hypervelocity dust
impacts in the laboratory.  In Burchell's abstract, he said that recent
attempts to quantify the probability of life naturally migrating through
space is to break down the migration into discrete steps: ejection from
the planet, survival in space, etc. and to find an independent
probabilty for each step, then to multiply these terms in order to
arrive at an overall probability of panspermia occurring. His particular
lab experiment was to use a light gas gun firing projectiles doped with
bacteria impacting on target materials. He told me that at impacts of
>7 km/sec: nothing lives, at 5 km/sec some live, and at 1 k/-sec, all
bacteria live. He has some resent papers (published as well as just
submitted) about this topic."

in the Laboratory"

   Survivability of bacteria in hypervelocity impacts

One of the biggest questions that science is attempting answer at
present is whether life exists elsewhere in the solar system and
if it does, is it possible that life forms can move between
planets? Currently the focus is on the planet Mars. There are
several reasons for this, but most important is the belief
(supported by the scientific evidence available) that at an early
stage of its existence Mars had environmental conditions similar
to that found on Earth. Microorganisms found on Earth have been
shown to be remarkably resilient to extremes of temperature, pH,
nutrient deprivation and desiccation. There is plenty of evidence
now available that microorganisms can exist for many years in a
desiccated state (at least several millennia) which perhaps could
allow them to survive transit between planets on or in meteorites.

We are currently investigating one aspect of this hypothesis. One
possibility is that transfer could take place after microbes are
ejected from the surface of a planet following collision with
other bodies such as meteorites, asteroids or comets. This would
be followed after some time (several millennia) by a collision
between the material ejected from one planet and the surface of
another. Calculations indicate that the energy released during
such impacts although large could nevertheless allow the survival
of microbes in material fairly close to the impact point.

Using a gas gun was possible to accelerate microbes up to
velocities similar to that which occurs during a typical meteorite
impact with the Earth. We have shown that rhodococci (a
particularly difficult to damage bacterium) can survive such
impacts. We are currently investigating the effect that the
physiological state of such microbes affects their ability to
survive such events and what biochemical damage occurs.

I don't think capture is the bottleneck; I think transfer times (at some
10 to 100 km/s) while exposed to the cosmic background will make anything
living in stasis pretty much scrambled. While I'm not looking closely, I
don't see this point addressed by panspermia types.

Jay,
       Notice the title that Playboy models get more androgynous over time?  
I still think the gays have gotten into the process.  Their ideal woman is a 
teenage boy with two quarts of silicone on his chest.

Are you saying this is due to the influence of gay men?  Or gay women?

I tyrannically demand that all hip humans immediately

that before the singularity, we will be conversational

is making nouns out of verbs and vva, we make machine

weirds language.

Do review Orwell's newspeak in the wonderful novel 1984.
He proposed a universal subset of English in which words
are unambiguously defined and redundant words eliminated.
All ungood words would equal unhere.  Language would
equal double plus easy.

Well, then, I think your one close lesbian friend probably doesn't have any
preference for androgynous looking women.

No Fauxever, I'll stick to my guns and stay with the fitness model as the 
physical type I prefer in the female figure.  However, I would have to 
seperate your "intellectual" into two sub components.  First, I think the 
highly intelligent woman would be preferable in any case but as to style I 
would recognise the Scholar, Athlete, and Monk (people into relationships) 
types from the Enneagram and hold out for the all around type.

Question:  

In the first star-forming era after the big band, when
all the stars are composed of hydrogen and helium,
what is thought to be the upper bound for the mass of
H/He supergiant stars?  What factors contribute to
this limit/boundary?  

If these stars proceed most rapidly to the
(super?)nova state (that's how it works, right?)--and
with it heavy-element (heavier than carbon,
right?)nucleosynthesis--what then is thought to be the
shortest possible stellar 'lifetime'?  

Best, Jeff Davis

My first masters thesis back in 95' had a few answers to this question. I
was modelling the stellar interiors of varying metallicity and mass
Population III stars (zero, little bit more than zero, etc, all the way up
to low-end population II). The idea was to come up with a range of plausible
mass functions and plug some numbers in to see how quickly the early
universe could generate low-end Population II metallicities.

[Metals in stars -- carbon and up -- are very strong sources of opacity, or
coupling of radiation to matter. This makes even tiny amounts of metals by
mass have huge effects on stellar evolution and upper mass limits].

So it turns out that with very little metallicity, you can have
100Msol-1000Msol quasi-stable stars that go supernova in under a million
years from ignition. Unfortunately, it's hard to say how much of the metal
gets out -- the software and physics just really wasn't up to that at the
time. You also have extremely long-lived tiny stars (as in they should still
be around now, everywhere), which we ruled out with some BOTE calculations
based on existing astronomy. When the math tells you there are a thousand
magnitude 18-21 objects within ten light years of us, the initial input is
wrong :)

Anyway, current upper bound in mass is thought to be 40-100Msol, depending
on who you want to believe. Low end, more likely. It's entirely
metallicity-determined. If you know the composition and mass of a star,
everything else follows from that.

[www.futureport.dk/news] Summary - 2002-20-12 (8 articles)


The Next Plastic Revolution
===========================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/start.html?pg=6

Heeger and two colleagues won the 2000 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the 
accomplishment: coaxing conductivity from plastic. (The material in the 
vials is a luminescent semiconducting polymer.) Now their efforts, and 
those of a growing number of chemists, physicists, and engineers, are 
clearing the way for superthin digital screens, polymer computer memory, 
disposable electronics, and a new generation of smartcards.



Big Idea, Bad Idea
==================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&CID=1051-121902C

Is it possible to catalogue every human idea? Japan-based researcher 
Darryl Macer thinks so, and last month he proposed in the journal Nature 
to count the number of human ideas and map them. This plan, while a 
clever attention grabber, will not succeed and demonstrates a worrisome 
mode of thinking.

A Proposal for an Integrative Mental Mapping Project



Dizzying Diet News
==================
[Health] Found by: maxm
http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&CID=1051-121902B

Almost every day brings a new study on the human diet. Most of them 
contradict each other ("for the last time, does fiber prevent colon 
cancer or not?!"), leaving readers perplexed about what and how much 
they should be eating.



"Binary" Enzyme Created By Scripps Scientists Demonstrates Darwinian 
Evolution At Its Simplest
==============================================================================================
[Sci-fi] Found by: maxm
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/12/021219065007.htm

Two scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), Research 
Associate John S. Reader, D.Phil, and Professor Gerald F. Joyce, M.D., 
Ph.D., both of the institute's Department of Molecular Biology, have 
succeeded in creating an enzyme based on a "binary" genetic code--one 
containing only two different subunits.



Nanotechnology Under The Scope
==============================
[Politics] Found by: maxm
http://pubs.acs.org/cen/today/dec4.html

Attention from advocacy groups, the publication of a highly anticipated 
science-fiction novel, and soon-to-be-released environmental research 
results are keeping a heightened focus on the possible societal impact 
of the nanotechnology revolution. The result is that today--along with 
all of the optimism for this emerging science--there is a sense of 
caution about how the revolution ought to proceed, especially when it 
comes to public communication.



Small molecule 2002's major find
================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2591217.stm

The discovery that molecules called small RNAs control much of a gene's 
behaviour - which may further research on cancer and stem cells - has 
been cited as this year's big breakthrough.



Moon's youngest crater discovered
=================================
[Space] Found by: maxm
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2592075.stm

Astronomers have discovered the only known lunar crater to have been 
formed in recorded history.

In 1953 a flash was seen on the Moon that was taken to be the impact of 
a small asteroid. But ground-based telescopes were not powerful enough 
to see any crater.



Bone Marrow Stem Cells Used to Create Brain Cells
=================================================
[Science] Found by: maxm
http://abcnews.go.com/wire/SciTech/reuters20021220_6.html

Stem cells from a person's own bone marrow can be used to generate brain 
cells and other nervous system cells that, when put back into the body, 
may be a way to treat diseases like brain cancer or Alzheimer's, 
researchers said on Friday.

I believe the theory goes that there are many influental gay men in the 
fashion world. The fashion world chooses the models. So gay men chooses 
the models. Thus slightly more masculine models get choosen.

It *is* amusing that in the more hardcore/porn "mens magazines" women 
are considderably more "shapely", than in fashion magazines.

Go figure ...

First, thanks Reason, for your response.

40-100 solar masses(maybe as high as 1000 Msol);
stellar lifetime less than 1 million years.

     ------------------------

Now, take note of this paper--oddly short--which
suggests an alternate ***and ubiquitous*** method of
dispersal to either impact ejecta, or deliberate
interstellar seeding (Crick's directed panspermia).  

Panspermia revisited

http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/9909/9909013.pdf


"The solution is to argue that suitably shielded
microorganisms can be ejected from a planetary system
like ours when the star is in its red giant stage."

But he doesn't elaborate further?!!!

He also writes: 

"...even if the biological material is damaged on its
journey,...,even the arrival of fragments of DNA and
RNA on Earth some 4000 million years ago would have
given a kickstart to the processes by which life
originated here."  

It seems that as one looks more closely at the
panspermia concept it undergoes a natural evolution. 
It starts out with the idea of whole spores able to
revive and then reproduce in an appropriately resource
rich environment.  Then stripped to the essentials, it
becomes the delivery of a/the crucial prebiological
fragment that surmounts a crucial prebiological
developmental-sequence bottleneck.(As Robert
suggests.)

Logically such a fragment would be more durable than
an entire organism--bacterial spore, etc--affording it
more travel time before being trashed.

Regarding Gene's point about the low transit speeds
with the long radiation exposures:  If a biological
fragment exits the local gravity well with a
tangential velocity low relative to the velocity
necessary for a relatively circular orbit of the
galactic center, won't it simply accelerate inward and
'across the galaxy' in a severe elliptical orbit like
a comet around the sun? If--as seems somewhat
reasonable to me at first glance--the orbit precesses
at all, might not such an orbit take the fragment to
any quadrant of the galaxy interior to the radial
distance of the point of origin?

Once again let me wish you all a safe and happy
holiday season.  Drive carefully.

Best, Jeff Davis

Only by taking the big view we can make it a common
dream, and then a reality. It's worth it."

Eeeeewww!!!!

Have you ever tried using speech recognition software for anything
creative?  It's getting on for an AI-complete problem to do anything
significantly more complex than a business letter or telephone-hell

Right. "Don't do that, it'll break the software." In other words, let's
dumb ourselves down enough to use pre-broken tools.

You _are_ aware that he didn't think this was a good idea, I hope?

White House to Propose System for Wide Monitoring of Internet

December 20, 2002
By JOHN MARKOFF and JOHN SCHWARTZ




 

The Bush administration is planning to propose requiring
Internet service providers to help build a centralized
system to enable broad monitoring of the Internet and,
potentially, surveillance of its users.

The proposal is part of a final version of a report, "The
National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace," set for release
early next year, according to several people who have been
briefed on the report. It is a component of the effort to
increase national security after the Sept. 11 attacks.

The President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board is
preparing the report, and it is intended to create public
and private cooperation to regulate and defend the national
computer networks, not only from everyday hazards like
viruses but also from terrorist attack. Ultimately the
report is intended to provide an Internet strategy for the
new Department of Homeland Security.

Such a proposal, which would be subject to Congressional
and regulatory approval, would be a technical challenge
because the Internet has thousands of independent service
providers, from garage operations to giant corporations
like American Online, AT&T, Microsoft and Worldcom.

The report does not detail specific operational
requirements, locations for the centralized system or
costs, people who were briefed on the document said.

While the proposal is meant to gauge the overall state of
the worldwide network, some officials of Internet companies
who have been briefed on the proposal say they worry that
such a system could be used to cross the indistinct border
between broad monitoring and wiretap.

Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer who represents some of
the nation's largest Internet providers, said, "Internet
service providers are concerned about the privacy
implications of this as well as liability," since providing
access to live feeds of network activity could be
interpreted as a wiretap or as the "pen register" and "trap
and trace" systems used on phones without a judicial order.


Mr. Baker said the issue would need to be resolved before
the proposal could move forward.

Tiffany Olson, the deputy chief of staff for the
President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, said
yesterday that the proposal, which includes a national
network operations center, was still in flux. She said the
proposed methods did not necessarily require gathering data
that would allow monitoring at an individual user level.

But the need for a large-scale operations center is real,
Ms. Olson said, because Internet service providers and
security companies and other online companies only have a
view of the part of the Internet that is under their
control. 

"We don't have anybody that is able to look at the entire
picture," she said. "When something is happening, we don't
know it's happening until it's too late."

The government report was first released in draft form in
September, and described the monitoring center, but it
suggested it would likely be controlled by industry. The
current draft sets the stage for the government to have a
leadership role. 

The new proposal is labeled in the report as an
"early-warning center" that the board says is required to
offer early detection of Internet-based attacks as well as
defense against viruses and worms.

But Internet service providers argue that its
data-monitoring functions could be used to track the
activities of individuals using the network.

An official with a major data services company who has been
briefed on several aspects of the government's plans said
it was hard to see how such capabilities could be provided
to government without the potential for real-time
monitoring, even of individuals.

"Part of monitoring the Internet and doing real-time
analysis is to be able to track incidents while they are
occurring," the official said.

The official compared the system to Carnivore, the Internet
wiretap system used by the F.B.I., saying: "Am I
analogizing this to Carnivore? Absolutely. But in fact,
it's 10 times worse. Carnivore was working on much smaller
feeds and could not scale. This is looking at the whole
Internet." 

One former federal Internet security official cautioned
against drawing conclusions from the information that is
available so far about the Securing Cyberspace report's
conclusions. 

Michael Vatis, the founding director of the National
Critical Infrastructure Protection Center and now the
director of the Institute for Security Technology Studies
at Dartmouth, said it was common for proposals to be cast
in the worst possible light before anything is actually
known about the technology that will be used or the legal
framework within which it will function.

"You get a firestorm created before anybody knows what,
concretely, is being proposed," Mr. Vatis said.

A technology that is deployed without the proper legal
controls "could be used to violate privacy," he said, and
should be considered carefully.

But at the other end of the spectrum of reaction, Mr. Vatis
warned, "You end up without technology that could be very
useful to combat terrorism, information warfare or some
other harmful act."

### Would you think that thanks to your having had an extra hundred million
years of evolutionary time behind your genes, you could easily deal with a
T.Rex? Whether you decide to call it "ridiculous", or not, it is a fact of
life that certain physical, chemical and information -management engineering
problems are hard, and evolution so far found no general solutions to them.
Just as organisms in general do not have a foolproof way of dealing with
teeth and claws, their ability to resist DNA damage is also limited.

Since in our ancestral environment teeth and claws were a much more
important factor than late-life accumulation of all kinds of DNA damage
(aneuploidy, chromosomal rearrangements, point mutations, mtDNA mutations,
dysmethylation, and other types of structural damage), we do have good
mechanisms (such as our brains and group organization) for dealing with the
former, but insufficient mechanisms for clearing the latter. I am sure you
are familiar with the argument that our ancestors hardly ever lived long
enough to need solutions to their late-life DNA damage problems - in this is
the answer why don't have them.

### The answer is above - multicellular organisms under natural conditions
tend to die for all kinds of reasons (many of them toothy), and they need to
cope with DNA damage only long enough to cover their predicted lifespan.
Multicellular organisms deal with DNA damage but not well enough. The
complex web of adaptations necessary to prevent DNA damage longer than that
would have no chance to contribute to increased fitness, and therefore never
evolved in the first place.

Mutations do accumulate in bacterial cultures - if you propagate a strain
through many passages, you will be able to observe divergence from the
ancestral phenotype.

Stem cells accumulate damage, too. Replacing old and sick neurons with new
and sick neurons won't help.

### Generally it's commendable to have doubts as a scientist, but at some
point the available evidence becomes simply too strong to leave room for
anything but the most general philosophic objections. The involvement of DNA
damage in aging is already at this level.

### Yes, this is correct - we have insufficient knowledge of the processes
involved in cloning, so any conclusions either me or you could draw would be
of the highly conjectural type.

I don't know if Panspermia is true or not but the fact that a bacteria like
Deinococcus radiodurans exists is very puzzling. A radiation level of just
500 rads can kill a human but D. radiodurans not only lives but thrives
after being hit with 1.5 million rads, and if you freeze the bacteria first
it lives even after 3 million rads. Why would Evolution go to all the
trouble to provide that much protection against a threat it is unlikely to
ever see? Perhaps the radiation protection is just a byproduct of something
else or maybe their is a more radical answer.

### The problem that I see is that for a "bit" of genetic information to be
useful it has to fulfill rather stringent criteria - the protein encoded
must either do something very useful on its own, or else interact
meaningfully with other proteins. There are very few proteins that have very
general usefulness, almost independently of the cell where they happen to
be. I could think about catalase, or a DNA repair enzyme here. So you have
another Great Filter - you need to transport not any fragment of DNA, but
one of the very few that do not need a complementary cellular machinery to
work. Otherwise the effect of the panspermic transfer will be about as much
as that of a few random mutations in the cell's non-coding, or
low-importance DNA.

Actually, that's a relatively easy problem.  It's evolving the solution 
that's difficult, not describing it.
Solution:  Have a complex of cells that combines multiply-duplicated DNA 
strands with extra error checking.  Instead of "I tell you twice!" 
(Paired nucleotides.), use an "I tell you 4 times!" (or whatever number 
is secure enough).  This gives you a reference standard.  You don't want 
to have too many of these cells, as they will be expensive.  But they 
are your Read-Only library.  If you have reason to suspect an error, you 
check it against the library.  Also you make sure that messages are 
signed on the way two and from the library cells, so that both the 
sender/recipient and the reference target can be verified.  How to 
correct the problem is a bit more difficult, but fortunately evolution 
has long been working on that.  You might also need to give each cell a 
URI (how many bits would be needed?)

You will notice that 1) many of these techniques are in use in the 
internet, and 2) they are much easier to design than to evolve.  I could 
easily design a technique for assigning each cell a URI.  Evolving it is 
quite a different matter.   (Stab 1 at a design:  Cells only divide in 
half, so this is a binary sequence.  Pick a maximum number of divisions 
to allow.  Say 1000.  Then you need about 2000 bits.  Use base 4 
notation c = new, g = left, a = right, t = other.  The initial cell 
starts as URI ctttt....tttt. When it divides, it divides into 
actttt...ttt and gctttt..tttt  these divide into aactttt....ttt, 
agctttt...tttt, gacttt...tttt, and ggcttt...tttt.   Etc.  Note the 
constant length of URIs.  This is an optional choice.  You could as 
easily use ttt as a stop code, which would allow for an unlimited number 
of generations.   [Remember:  the URIs need to be signed by a validating 
third party, so each cell division would require a midwife]).

The fact that this is a simple design problem doesn't make it as simple 
thing to evolve.   E.g., URIs don't become useful until after utilities 
are built that assume their existence.

"Personally, in general, I prefer the so called intellectual as a type."

So true!!!  Being male everyone thinks I must prefer the stereotypical
playboy model.  But when I look around and see pictures of models plastered
on the walls in shopping malls and in front of victoria secrets, they
*always* have that passive demure coy look.  You almost never see a women in
any kind of sexual connontation standing proud and tall.  This is what I
want to see, not coy looks behind wavy hair hiding half the face, with their
jaw lowered and fake innocent glance at the camera.  I want to see a
magazine of not just beautiful women, but beautiful intelligent women.  I
want to see bios that talk about the current research the she is
undertaking, what her PhD thesis is, or the 1,000 page novel their working
on, or thier latest incredible painting.  Not "tee hee, I like to go
shopping and hang out with my friends and watching survivor"

But this is primarily because most men prefer women passive and demure, at
least I have read of a few pyschological studies indicating as much, and
judging from the way most women are represented, and the way most men I
interact with, think of, and what they admire about women it seems to be a
valid presumption.  

Where are the beautiful strong, intelligent, confident hard working women?
Im sure there are many?  A women can be confident secure and proud, while
still being beautiful and sexual, but do you ever see that in posters / ads
/ movies?

I keep thinking Dagny Taggert in Atlas Shrugged.  

Oh well...

Michael,
       If you look at the men and women on this list you will find that 
mostly we come from the upper end of the intelligence curve.
       I have never been a woman so I will confine myself to talking about 
male experience -- mostly. <G>
       As to that passive and demure woman I think that most of the men on 
this list at one time or another have probably gone for the gal that was 
exemplary in everyway excepting that she was dumb as a door nail.  Then 
inevitably we come to that moment of decision -- shall we stay at her 
intellectual level and bore ourselves or stay at our intellectual level and 
bore her?  So, eventually we learn that we should associate with the smart 
women and be happy.  Besides as every connoisseur of the wonderful sport 
knows, smart women are sexier.
       But intellectual?  I think of intellectual as an attitude or style.  
So long as my friends, male and female, are smart I don't care one way or the 
other about such things as being intellectual.

### Yes, with the benefit of our rational insight we can see solutions, and
I am eager to implement some of them ASAP. Putting special ultra-stable
reference cells into my tissues looks like a good idea, as is piling up
layers upon layers of cell cycle regulation, transferring mtDNA genes to the
nucleus and keeping a multiply-distributed blueprint of the large-scale
features. Of course, in addition to the standard real-time synchronized
copies, frozen backups, and other assorted gimmickry :-)

It isn't well known but E. coli can replicate in 20 minutes -- but
the rate of copying of DNA polymerase cannot replicate a 4+ megabase
genome in 20 minutes.  Thus to replicate at its fastest rate E. coli
must produce multiple genome copies.  So in its fastest growth mode
E. coli must always be having 2-4 genome copies per cell!  It is
suspected that one of the reasons for the radiation resistance
in Deinococcus radiodurans is involved in its very slow growth
rates and/or the fact that it grows in tetrads (groups of 4).
So it may either be maintaining multiple genome copies in each
cell (perhaps more than E. coli) or it might even have a mechanism
of passing genome copies between cells.  In any case it seems to
have a very good mechanism for either the repair of double strand
breaks and/or "homologous recombination" (where you do the repair
based on similar sequences -- something assisted if you happen to
have multiple copies of your genome on hand).

There isn't an example of this in biology that I'm aware of.
Certainly if we find one it will be a significant discovery!

I'm too lazy right now to look it up -- but the cell numbers are
documented in Nanomedicine VI.  The number that I think I use
for #'s of bacteria on or in the human body is 40 trillion --
the number of human cells in the body is less (most of them
are red blood cells).

Well that is because design is "intelligent" while evolution is not.
That was my point in the panspermia discussion about preserving the
pre-evolved information across interstellar distances -- that may be
much more valuable than having to create it all over again.

Now you are really going over the top from the perspective of how
biology currently works (not to say that there couldn't be biology
out there someplace that works this way -- we just haven't discovered
it yet.)

Quite true -- currently (though this is speculative) it seems likely that
the protein turnover times are not tuned for the optimal rate.  I.e. proteins
degrade over time, particularly due to deamidation, and there appear to be
"molecular clocks" that "label" the proteins and signal that some proteins
are likely to have become defective and should therefore be recycled.  But
the probability that this has been optimized for 30,000 genes in most higher
organisms genomes seems *highly* unlikely.  The usefullness of URIs comes
long after you manage to optimize the basic maintenance of the code
(which is why there are 130+ proteins involved in DNA repair -- and
the protein maintenance -- which probably involves several hundred
more proteins).  So the scenario that Charles is proposing is *very*
far along in the evolutionary tree unless we impose the designs
(derived from computer science) on biology.

These observations may be understood better if we recognize
the purpose of the models.  Fashion magazines are primary
bought by women, so the models found therein are placed in
ads designed for selling clothing to women.  The Playboy
models are chosen to sell magazines to men.  Models in
motorcycle mags are chosen to draw mostly hetero male
eyes to the ads to sell bikes.

The ad people are good: they know what works, for what
purpose.  Next time you see an ad, try to figure out the
intended audience and how the model would make that
intended audience feel.

Then ask the same question of television ads: which are
the most effective in influencing you to buy whatever
it is they are selling?  What are the very most effective
ads?  I would suggest the best made are actually beer
commercials.  They are creative, funny, they do get one
in the mood to devour beer.  Think like an ad man, and you
will understand why models look the way they do.  spike

Sure.  What I am proposing is a Newspeak-like subset
of English that is specially designed for talking to
our computers.  It wouldn't be used for poetry, you cannot
talk your sweetheart into bed with it (unless she is
turned on by that sort of thing: "...double good human

By using Newspeak or equivalent, we would give software
developers a fighting chance at teaching computers what
we are saying, until the day we manage to teach computers
to understand humans on a human level.  Actually this may
require a greater than human intelligence since humans
are very difficult to understand by human level
intelligences.  I consider myself a human level
intelligence, and I sure don't understand humans.

Speech recognition software is actually getting
pretty good, btw, as far as recognizing words.
As for extracting meaning from a conversation,
we still have a loooong way to go.

Well sure, Charlie, *he* didn't think Newspeak a good
idea, *I* think it is a good idea.

English is too big and bloated, too ambiguous in too
many usages, too many cognates.  Its the spoken
equivalent of Ada.  {8-[  Great for crossword puzzles,
bad for teaching to humans.  It should tell us something
when so many Japanese and Chinese immigrants to
Taxifornia become fluent in Spanish but never do
really grok English.

Blair was so very insightful, considering that his
classic 1984 was written in the late 40s.  He anticipated
governments using "wag the dog" techniques, manipulation
of news cycles with fake wars, and perhaps his most
important insight for today: what happens as information
technology inevitably advances without corresponding
reduction in the authority of government.  Trying to
stop infotech with law is chasing the wind, ordering
the tide off of the beach.  We must compensate away
government authority by voting for ever lower taxes,
for instance.

1984 should be required reading for all extropians.

I seem to recall that D. radiodurans is robust against desiccation
and that the radiation resistence is indeed just a byproduct of
that.

It may be important to keep in mind that D. radiodurans is
radiation resistant in a non-spore form.  I haven't studied
the radiation resistance of spores -- I believe it is higher
than bacteria from which spores are derived but may not be
as high as D. radiodurans.

Exactly -- that is one of the reasons I was so very interested in
studying it (circa 1991) and made a visit to LLNL telling them that
they should sequence it (circa 1993).

This is the current working hypothesis of the people working
on D.r.  They think that the radiation resistance is a byproduct
of dessication resistance.  I.e. the organism has evolved to be
resistant to drying out -- something that one can view as being
much more common than high radiation doses.

But -- if the organism evolved to be dessication resistant then
that promotes the panspermia perspective since that property
certianly increases the transfer of the organism and/or the
information that may be contained in its genome.

Though I would need to look at the most recent data, I do believe
that D.r. is near the base of the evolutionary tree.  It is also
very hard to mutate its genome (this creates some big problems in
studying it) so it is likely that any programs that compute the
evolutionary history of organisms based on the "typical rates"
will get it wrong with respect to D.r.  So D.r. may be lower in
the tree than programs will currently estimate.

Mind you there are some other bacteria which have radiation
resistance and they are worth studying as well.

Why did I develop this high interest in radiation resistance?
Radiation exposure mutates cells and mimics many of the effects
of aging.  Dr. L. Obukhova had a very interesting method of
exposing mice to radiation where just the head was irradiated
and guess what -- I saw mice that were perfectly healthy but
all of the hair on their heads was grey.

One only has to observe something like this once to be convinced
that "aging" is closely tied to DNA mutations (in part caused by
radiation but likely to more frequently be caused by free radical
damage [IMO]).

Either way round, it's easy to calculate the exposure during transit on 
micron sized dust stream over some 10 light years, given some 100 km/s 
speed. I'd rather know how dirt-dwellers managed to get into these 
interstellar dust streams with a high efficiency. Either way round, I 
think they're toast.

Maybe comets are contaminated, and bloom briefly during perihelion 
carrying the contamination outwards, facilitating crossover at the 
outskirts if stellar gravity wells. A large enough body would offer enough 
shielding for embedded organism spores.

But I sure haven't heard of any papers citing this. The ejected pebbles
don't do interstellar hops apparently; but they do clearly travel widely 
in interplanetary transfer and capture. They never go over 40 C while 
having transfer times of Mars-Earth of half a year to several megayears. A 
recent paper in Science suggests the observed Mars impacts are 
commensurable with Mars rocks actually found (mostly the Antarctica 
cache).

What can one say about the following article?

http://www.ex.ac.uk/nlo/news/nlonews/1997-01/9701-14.htm

It seems to provoke that odd scary wariness that
generates the characterization "kooky".  Yet the tone
of the writer is all "sensible shoes".  Odd.  The
whole business.

More an more I get the feeling that there is a
protective human reflex that defends against the
discredit associated with 'flakiness'.  Anything too
weird is labelled kooky and then kept at a safe
distance.  Then, the evidence can/must mount quite
high before surmounting the kookiness barrier.

The earth is, in fact, round, not flat. Tectonic
plates roam the surface of the planet.  Little
invisible bugs saturate the planet.  Etc.

The article:

NLO News: January 1997

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Living Micro­Organisms From Space
­ Real or Apparent?

The recent announcement by the American space­agency,
NASA that a team of scientists have found evidence for
primitive fossil life on the planet Mars reminded me
of an article, which I wrote in 1963, that described a
sequence of unusual events at the Norman Lockyer
Observatory, Sidmouth, in the period 1936 to 1961.
During the summer months of 1936 the Observatory's
spring­water supply, used in the routine processing of
photographic material, was found to contain a very
high concentration of ultra­rapid gelatine­liquefying
bacteria, whose characteristics were markedly
different from those of B. fluoroscens liquefaciens,
normally present in the local supply. The invading
organisms disappeared in the ensuing winter, only to
reappear during the summer of 1937 ­ indicative of a
spore­forming micro­organism. 

Following the 1937 outbreak, water samples were sent
to the bacteriological department of the Seale­Hayne
College, Newton Abbot, and tissue cultures were
obtained. It was, however, found to be impossible to
match these with any known strains of indigenous
liquefying bacteria. The result was later
independently confirmed by tests carried out at the
Lister Institute. 

Between 1937 and 1963 five more major outbreaks of the
invading micro­organism were recorded, and in one
event (1956) the appearance of the ultra­rapid
liquefyers in the water supply was preceded by
approximately 4 days by an extremely rapid airborne
strain of liquefying organisms having a yeast­like
structure. 

At the height of each major 'invasion' irreparable
damage to freshly processed spectrographic plates was
caused by numerous quasi­circular crater­like defects
(0.05 ­ 0.25 mm in diameter) from the centre of which
the silver deposit had been eroded, and transferred to
the perimeter. In a badly affected 1/4­plate negative
some 5100 of these craters could be seen at low
magnification (x15). In several instances the
photographic film was completely liquefied and was
seen to slide off the glass base intact. By contrast,
the indigenous strains of F. fluorescens were quite
incapable of completely liquefying the gelatine layer
even at high concentrations. 

Two outstanding features of the invading
micro­organisms that differentiated them from the
local spring­water liquefiers were: 

its phenomenally rapid liquefaction property; and 
its complete toleration of the highly toxic
concentration of silver and silver halide salts in the
processed photographic film. 
On some tests made with pure cultures on unexposed and
unprocessed plates rapid liquefaction was not
impaired. 

When confronted by such unusual properties of the
bacterial organism as those just described, it is
natural to pose the questions: 

Is the observed activity of the invading bacterium
wholly consistent with that expected from terrestrial
strains? 
Why do these micro­organisms show such high tolerances
to toxic silver halide salts in sharp contrast to the
reactions of indigenous types? 
If the 'invaders' are indeed extra­terrestrial, what
is the likely source? 
In an attempt to answer these questions, all the
available data between 1936 and 1961 were analysed in
conjunction with solar (geomagnetic storm) activity
and planetary (Venusian) configurations. 

The results were completely unexpected and clearly
indicated that (with one doubtful exception in a total
of nine bacterial events) each recorded presence of
the abnormal liquefying micro­organisms in the local
water supply coincided closely in date with an
inferior conjunction of Venus and a concurrent major
geomagnetic storm. 

Furthermore, an examination of the local weather
conditions preceding each of the six major events
exhibited a similar pattern marked by a period of
rainfall immediately prior to the bacterial invasion
and a wind direction remaining predominantly northerly
during the time­interval between the geomagnetic
storms and the bacterial events. 

The latter observation suggests that a northerly
surface air­stream is required to transport the
air­borne micro­organisms to the locality of the
Observatory where they are brought to the ground by
the local rainfall. Indeed this is what might be
expected if the foreign particles are initially
injected into the upper atmosphere by the solar wind
entering the auroral belt some 500 miles north of
Sidmouth. Moreover, the observed mean interval of 55
days between geomagnetic storm and bacterial invasion
of the local water supply is consistent with a cloud
velocity of some 15 miles/day, a speed sufficiently
realistic to support the above hypothesis. 

If indeed this is a valid one, we have presumptive
evidence that the events occurring at the Norman
Lockyer Observatory were caused by the
extra­terrestrial strain of gelatine­liquefying
bacteria which had originated in the upper atmosphere
of Venus and then been transported to Earth by the
solar wind associated with major geomagnetic storms. 

Granted that the arguments presented above are highly
speculative, the support provided by the totem of
observational evidence appears sufficiently strong to
justify a valid speculation. 

We may, therefore, presume that the facts as observed
are consistent with an extra­terrestrial origin for
the invading organisms and that they are brought to
Earth in the solar wind from the upper atmosphere of
Venus ­ where the temperature is similar to the summer
temperature at the Earth's surface. 

Consequently, the fact that the observed invading
bacteria were living may well make their discovery of
even greater importance than the recent claim that
fossilised micro­organisms in a meteorite had come
initially from the planet Mars.

Some stray thoughts on language and list-people
===============================================

Language types and socialization are particularly relevant to transhumanists 
and extropians (TransExtros)and related creatures.

TransExtros can be seen to operate like overheated lawyers who cannot stop 
talking about the legal aspects of any particular subject that comes up in 
conversation. To everday persons such a lawyer would be one who cant stop 
talking about work. Additionally, most people have only a generic knowledge 
of law. Therefore they cannot adduce the truth or otherwise of a legal 
opinion and can only evince a generic response. The lawyer becomes a 
lecturer and an unverifiable one. More than that, the lawyer becomes a 
social outsider if the lawyer persists in such behaviour too often.

This is because much language is outsider socialization. That is, social 
networks outside of specialized workspeak often function largely as 
reiterative mechanisms for social hierarchies and social exchange (though 
elements of all language types and forms mix of course).

So, for example, there is the what did you do last night conversation, the 
what movie did you see recently conversation, the how is your sister 
conversation, the hows work conversation, the how is the illness 
conversation. Often answers in these conversations are irrelevant, including 
broader social observation answers.

TransExtros have an unfortunate (?) tendency to butt in with speciality 
answers. Last night I argued about the merits of uploading. Im bored 
with movies, I want to go into totally immersive 3-D virtual realities. My 
sister wants a baby before shes 35, but I told her she can have one when 
shes 45 or 55, I said dont stress about it. When I go to work I keep 
thinking about monkey style mass productin versus robots and assemblers. I 
dont expect to be ill again  ever  in a dozen years  except cultural 
illness, maybe.

In some cases TransExtros will be labelled as cultists as a result, lumped 
in with extreme ufologists and Atlantean believers.  This probably 
infuriates many of them because they are coming from a believe-in-science 
background. It is difficult for them because most people are unwilling to 
read new material and their scientific background does not extend beyond 
black holes and Darwin to nanotechnology and in particular the notion of 
molecular supercomputers (the concept of the nanobot is somewhat known 
from Star Trek and similar sources but it is perceived as a limited 
non-intelligent type of machine virus).

Another difficulty is TransExtros languages challenge existing mores or 
expectations but do not answer where the Singularity is leading  there are 
as we know many different opinions on this. This means TransExtros can often 
scare ordinary people when they occasionally do convince them that big 
change is on the way.

So at the moment one effect is that TransExtros can speak amongst 
themselves, a kind of in-house work-speak, but when they speak with 
outsiders language does not function to reiterate social exchange or gossip 
but to destabilize them from the existent hierarchy. And if TransExtros 
"bite their tongue" and do not talk about these things, whey enter into a 
form of social "double existence" with all the problems this entails 
emotionally.

When does this change?

As we move into the Singularity, conversation can move from mobile phones 
and computers into nanotech engineering. As such engineering begins, a 
secondary effect is that the physical mechanisms of TransExtro culture begin 
to be hard-wired. What 3D website did you immerse yourself in last night? 
Hows your brothers Parkinsons Disease blocker working? This guy had an 
eink wallscreen with lifesize video sex showing. The Pope has declared 
that clones have souls, what do you think?

One noticeable effect that also takes place in this new scenario is the role 
of complaint in language. Currently complaint focusses on physical 
limitation and is ever-present because it is real. Ageing and illness hammer 
away at choice progressively for most people. Most people overcome a certain 
amount of difficulties and then freeze in place, if they are lucky. Under 
the impending conditions of existence, complaint (certainly a stubborn habit 
once acquired) moves from the complaint of physical limitation in terms of 
substrate (food, water, shelter, medicine, travel, cellular regeneration) 
into the complaint of cultural limitation (acceptance, cultural choice, 
sexual popularity, political popularity etc.).

Another interesting change that should take place is the movement from 
future shock to stasis shock in terms of physical substrate. In this sense, 
the singularity may be like one of those sauna treatments: first the hot 
tub, then the icy tub, then a brisk rub down and on you go with life!

The Ex-Mass Holiday Season
~~~ and ~~~ 
The Story of Solar Cause

The Ex-Mass[fn1] holiday season amuses us with feasts and fêtes, socializes 
us in shared ceremonies, and educates us via allegory. It runs from the 
solstice nearest perihelion (winter solstice in the northern hemisphere, 
summer in the southern) until Sir Issac Newton's birthday on December 25th. 
Especially for children, the character of Solar Cause[fn2] plays a large role 
in Ex-Mass celebrations. Adults tend to focus more on such convivial rituals 
such as exchanging gifts, praising our stellar good-fortune, and meditating 
on the illuminating powers of human science and industry.

The Story of Solar Cause

For most of the year Solar Cause lives in the warm, yellow sun. He watches 
over the far-away Earth, making sure that it spins all through the day and 
all through the night. Once a year, the Earth's clockwork starts to run down. 
Day and night get so out of balance that one almost falls into the other! On 
that crazy day, Solar Cause reaches across the vastness of space and draws 
the Earth a little closer to the sun. He climbs down to fix our shivering 
little planet--and brings with him a bag full of presents for good boys and 
girls.

Solar Cause comes to Earth on that special date to set things right. With a 
gentle nudge to the North pole, he puts day and night back onto course and 
sets the Earth whirling into another year. But each of our hearts spins on 
its own, private pole. Like the Earth they will, if left alone and untouched, 
tumble into weariness and confusion. When he comes to fix the Earth's orbit, 
then, Solar Cause nudges each our hearts to set them right, too.

Grown-ups sense the touch of Solar Cause in a typically grown-up way: 
absent-mindedly, as if their feelings wore five layers of sweaters. But 
children! Their light hearts dance on Solar Cause's touch like motes in a 
sun-beam!

Solar Cause has a special understanding with children. All through the year 
he traces the days and nights of their little hearts. He sees all their acts, 
both good and bad. Because Solar Cause loves extropy, he loves each child who 
plays nicely and studies well. Solar Cause dislikes the cold and dark of 
entropy, however. It thus grieves him to see children hurt their playmates or 
neglect their lessons.

While Solar Cause watches over Earth's children, his vast fusion-powered 
factories teem with tiny workers making gifts. All year long they build toys 
and cook sweets. Solar Cause brings these gifts with him on that one special 
night when he comes to set the Earth back on course. Then, in the darkest 
hour of our longest night, he flies across the whole of the world. Solar Ca
use flies over our roofs and shines down through our windows and chimneys!

Solar Cause visits each dreaming child. Because watching boys and girls 
extrope [fn3] during the rest of the year brings Solar Cause such great joy, 
he thanks each of them with a special present on this special night. But to 
children who did terribly entropic things during the year past, he gives only 
shadows.

Of course, no one--not even adults--can act perfectly well all of the time! 
Solar Cause thus gives everybody at least a little bit of a shadow. These, 
our conscientious guardians, follow each of us throughout the year, reminding 
us to try and overcome our weaknesses and to improve ourselves as much as we 
possibly can.

Dreaming through his visits, children do not see Solar Cause in all his 
glory. What does he look like, then? A mane of shining, golden hair rings his 
beaming face. His vibrant yellow costume reveals a fit, trim build. Solar 
Cause shines so brightly that, sometimes, even sleeping children feel his 
warm gaze. And, if their good acts have made Solar Cause especially happy, 
they may hear a light-hearted laugh echo through their dreams. "He! He! He!" 
Why gives Solar Cause so much joy? Elementary: Seeing Extropian children grow 
forward, upward, and outward!


Notes

[1] Why "Ex-Mass"? Because the holiday celebrates the sun's conversion of 
mass into energy.

[2] Solar Cause's female companion, Luna, plays a periodically recurring role 
in his story. But her lights merely reflect, to a greater or lesser extent, 
Solar Cause's own; he plays the star in the pageant of Ex-Mass.

[3] "Extrope": v.i. to advance the subject's extropy. So far as I can tell, 
Amara Graps coined this particular variation on "extropy".

A while back we had some rather extensive discussion
regarding "race".  I believe I asserted that it didn't
exist.  In light of this NY Times article based on a
recent study I may need to modify my opinion.

December 20, 2002
Gene Study Identifies 5 Main Human Populations
By NICHOLAS WADE
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/20/health/20GENE.html?pagewanted=print

One direct quote:
"But Dr. Feldman said the finding essentially confirmed the popular
conception of race. He said precautions should be taken to make sure the
new data coming out of genetic studies were not abused."

One number that blew my mind was that 7.5% of Swedes have hemochromatosis.

Slashdot is also pointing out the article in Forbes involving the 85
biggest ideas of the last century.

http://forbes.com/2002/11/01/85.html

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/12/20/1636229&mode=thread&tid=126

>From the /. leadin "and a frightening realization that not
much of interest has come out of the last 10 years (a whopping 4
of the 85 ideas)."

That looks like a pretty low productivity during the last decade
(particularly considering the amount of money that got spent during
the dot-com boom).  Did Forbes simply mis-judge the list or are
we slowing down in inventiveness?  This would seem to be counter
to the singularity hypothesis.

Could it be possible we are approaching some limit on the phase
space of what humans (or teams of humans) are capable of?  I.e.
to push the envelope further requires transhumans or AIs.

I'm just asking the questions...

Yes, we seem to have a pool of unusual alleles at high concentrations
up here - several unusual mental aberrations, some schizophrenia genes,
a bit of seasonal affective disorder and of course hemochromatosis. The
wonders of genetic purity - enriching the recessives ;-)
http://www.scripps.edu/bcmd/pdfarea/issue_09_98/mercier.pdf suggests
that since 5.6% of Bretons have the mutation it confirms their celtic
origins.

I don't agree that we're not making progress. Arguably the biggest thing 
coming is nanotechnology (I'm glad to see that despite Forbes putting up a 
meaningless laundry list of  

  Organic polymers
  Neurobiology
  Superhard coatings
  Hydrogen fuels
  Tissue engineering
  Genetically modified food
  Nanotechnology
  Microfluidics
  Bacteria-based drugs
  Simplified software coding

for voting most people realized that nanotechnology covers all of the
other list and it showed in the vote.

Even without Far East emerging as the world leader in R&D I'd think even
EU and US alone would have continued making progress. We ain't seen 
nothing yet.

I realise what I have to say is not going to be particularly well received,
but it does need to be pointed out to folks on this and similar lists:

Any notion of "transhuman" is fallacious! This is because of the law 
of the excluded middle. Evolution can be from (sub/pre-human) to
(Homo Sapiens/ Human), and to (after/post-human) .... but at no
stage is there a separate "trans" stage. Sure, you might get two or
more classes co-existing at the same time, and individuals with traits
from more than one category ... so an individual humanoid might
be more regonisably human than post-human for example.

We cannot meaningful aim to be "transhuman" .... only post-human.

Well, in an interesting "twist" of the news media, this
article may be putting spin on the spin.

Source: Stanford University
Date: 12/20/2002
People From Distant Lands Have Strikingly Similar Genetic Traits, Study Reveals

http://www.sciencedaily.org/releases/2002/12/021220080005.htm

So I may be back in the camp that the concept of "race" is
only marginally useful.  I strongly suspect that it will be
a case-by-case concept.  Knowing that someone is a black
african may be useful for diagnosing sickle cell anemia
while knowing someone is a white swede might be useful
for diagnosing hemochromotosis or SAD, but "evaluating"
someone for intelligence or many other qualities may be
totally beyond the realm of "race" based diagnostics.
I doubt that survival in Sweden is significantly more
or less difficult than survival in Somalia (on a historic
basis).  It just simply does not make sense that the
general environment is going to generate significant
differences in intelligence.  (UV radiation resistance,
SAD, perhaps use of nutrients like iron -- yes) but I
don't believe that survival in various environments is so
significantly different that it would result in differences
in intelligence across "race".  Whether it be Sweden or Somalia
the questions are always going to be "How clever are you?" or
"How strong are you?".  And there are going to be two independent
survival and reproduction evolutionary vectors based on those
two principles.

So unless someone can propose why Sweden should produce more
intelligent people than Somalia I reject any ideas related
to differences between the intelligences of the various "races".

Actually, this is related to an issue I have been thinking about a lot:
How complex is the terrestrial environment really? The whole race-IQ
issue seems to hinge on the assumption that some environments are less
complex and less intelligence is needed to survive. But we humans tend
to *generate environment* in our daily activities - we clothe ourselves,
build, make tools, construct elaborate social and cultural structures
that can be ridiculously complex even when the surrounding land is just
flat plain. This effect seem to overshadow any effect of the environment
when it comes to general intelligence. 

My own interest is more related to the issue of learning. What is the
distribution of importance during everyday life? Clearly not every
experience is equally important, but how are their relative importance
(perhaps measured in terms of mortality or fitness) distributed? Is it
an exponential with a long tail, some kind of normal distribution or
something else? And can we somehow determine this distribution?

If we know the complexity of an environment (or what *kind* of
complexity it is - living in white noise land is different from the
Amazonas or living on the net) and the distribution of importance it
becomes possible to sketch the optimal learning and thinking systems for
that environment. I think.

Yes!  But don't forget Animal Farm too.  "All of us

Well, we already abbreviate our speech when talking
to children and babies, to the sick and elderly, and
even---as was just pointed out by someone---to non-
extropians.

So we will just naturally learn how to talk to yet
another kind of entity whose understanding is in
some ways inferior to our own.

1984 is a very interesting book by black gay writer Samuel R. Delany, and
should indeed be read by all extropians.

NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, a novel by George Orwell, is also of considerable
interest.

No one seemed to respond to the original question...

I don't know exactly what you had in mind, but with a liberal view of
Humanities Greg Egan qualifies; AFAIK he's unchallenged for looking at what
life as an AI could be like.  Pohl's later Gateway books are a distant second.

Andy Clark is a philosopher, head of cog sci at IU, and cited by Peter Voss.
I don't know much about his ideas yet.

You did happen to leave off Vinge and Kurzweil. :)

If you want to read about biomedical science at its
"best" (in terms of controversy), take a look at this article:

December 21, 2002
Word War Breaks Out in Research on Stem Cells
By NICHOLAS WADE
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/21/health/21CELL.html?pagewanted=print

Debates don't get much better than "sharp disagreements".

It is worth noting that stem cell research is moving forward
in China at warp speed, entirely devoid of politics and spin
found in the U.S. so Extropians need not be overly concerned
with Kass & Co.

                       Before
                   by Lee Corbin

Dear Jimmy - well, by the time you'll be able to read
this maybe you'll want to be called Jim.

I hope that Flo or the others will have taught you
to read, though heaven knows, there'll probably be
less to read even than now.  If you don't find the
other plane and get more paper, then at least you'll
have this to read to your children some day - if
you find other people.

So one main reason to write this to you is to give you
yet something more in our language, English, that you
can read over and over, trying to get literate.

The other reason, of course, is that by the time you're
able to read this I'll be long dead and gone.  You're an
awfully cute little boy, and, so it seems to me, a really
smart one.  So just remember old Uncle Lee was once
strong and healthy, and he had a very good life.  I'm
sorry that I couldn't have talked to you more.  And I'm
so very sorry that you couldn't have lived Before.

I hardly knew your mother, you came just afterwards.
But she seemed very sweet.  The night you were born,
we all wept as she died.

I'm sure that your biggest questions are, "what was
life like Before", and "what happened?".  Before
2012 we had a fabulous world.  With each increasing
year, from maybe 1994 on when the Web was invented,
it seemed like more and more wonders came, and were
available to almost any person who wanted them.  No,
not airplanes - Samuel was unusual to have one and
it wasn't really his.

You may have talked about "the web", "the internet",
and "the dome" with Samuel if he's not too sick,
because he was there too, and we used to "surf"
the web.  This means only to go from one web site
to another - you could see on your computer monitor.
It was a box about as wide as a person, and it had
a glass window which showed you pictures from far
away, like a TV if you've heard about that.  Later
some people like Samuel got good at VR, which
means that with a thing they wore it was like they
could walk through the internet, the web, and even
in a way the real world under the dome.  They hardly
needed to turn their necks, to look all over, up and
down, 360 degrees, go anywhere.

So I'll tell you more about Before, if there is room, but
you probably want me to describe what happened.  There
were more than six billion people in the world then, and
they traded lots of goods with each other.  In some
countries they'd make one thing, and thousands of
miles away other people would produce something else
that they were very good at making, and then they'd
trade.  This was how so many things got manufactured.
It got everyone so rich that most people had a lot
of spare time, and so knowledge was extremely advanced.
It's just incredible what was known.

Anyway, we all thought that our knowledge, science, and
progress would go on forever.  It had gone on for
hundreds of years, and we just sort of unconsciously
assumed that it had to keep going.  In fact, I belonged
to a very small group who believed that we didn't
even have to die.  We thought - and I still think that
we were right in principle - that you could be frozen
just after you died, and since you weren't damaged
very much yet, the science of the future would be
able to defrost you and bring you back.  Oh, about
"freezing".  It means that you have something, like
water for example, at so low a temperature that it
turns solid.  If you go to the far mountains, the
Andes, you'll see ice.  It's frozen water, of course.
You'll see it's high and white before you get there.

Well, there had been some times, like the 1930s, 
and then later when I lost a lot of money---in 2001
and really badly in 2009 when all the trading
that the people were doing got confused, kind of,
and the money we used for trading wasn't good
any more and a different kind of money was made.
When disruptions like this happened, no one was
too sure what the other people would make, and so
they didn't know for sure whether they should make
anything.  It was much more complicated than that,
but basically things would just collapse somewhat.
And this had always gone on, in history.

Now, there were a few people who thought that it
could happen in a BIG way, but most people never
really listened to them.  I sure wish that I had
all my old friends---especially on the internet---
to talk about this with, because thinking together
we could understand all sorts of things.  We called
ourselves the Extropians.  Sorry.  I guess that I
just wanted to see that word in writing one more
time.

I didn't realize how much I depended upon them, and
upon all the people I knew, and all the radio and
television I saw, to do my thinking for me.  There
is just a huge hole in my head where they all used
to be.

We had this one idea we loved, that by 2030 or
2040 progress would go to infinity, and we used
to talk about The Singularity all the time.
That was the moment when infinity would be
reached.  It must sound very silly, but it
wasn't.  I still think it could have happened.
It's amazing what seemed possible Before.

Anyway, if they were here I'm sure we'd have some
good arguments about whether it was the atomic
attacks on cities or the mammal viruses that caused
the economic collapse or vice-versa (the other way
around).  Well, about that:  the war weapons had
become very powerful so that one bomb could wipe
out an entire city, that is, a number of square
miles.  That happened, actually, a lot earlier in
1945.  But the weapons were never used in a big way
until late December in 2012 as everything was ending.

I'm sure that some of my old and really smart
friends would have said that it was the launching
of the bio-weapons, and the plagues, period.  But
I don't think that any of those awful things alone
that really did it.  (Plagues are where everyone
gets sick, gets an illness that is deliberately created
as a weapon - it's why we're scared to talk to any
other people if anyone's alive but us).  Instead,
I think that it was the economic collapse that
happened first and we couldn't deal with the plagues.

Several of the people older than you surely still
live, and can tell you about how we got away.
It was the cryonicists.  They were always so very
cautious about everything.  Long before, Alcor even
moved away from California where I used to live just
because of earthquakes there - if you cross the
Andes some day - watch out for them.  The ground
shakes real hard.

Anyway, they had just staked out a base here in
the Amazon, when everything happened.  Several
others and I were just very lucky.  We had been
in Phoenix Arizona (near the coast i.e. California)
and I was realizing I should get out right then, and
just happened to be with Samuel when he got his
airplane and was coming down here to help set
things up.  You know the story of the other plane.
Never give up trying to find it.  This was my
last piece of paper, except for one I'm saving.
Good luck, Jim.

In much of his fiction, perhaps. But given his stance as a politically
engaged black, gay writer, especially in autobiographical texts like *1984*
and *The Motion of Light in Water: Sex and Science Fiction Writing in the
East Village 1957-65*, it would be rather missing the point.

I really don't think we can afford to let people like Kass go unchallenged.
It's fairly clear where as to his ambitions lie in terms of hindering or
preventing as much of this research as he can -- killing people, in effect.
Given that it's not clear what our margin of safety is in terms of making it
to radical life extension technologies, I don't think we can afford to let
research be hindered or prevented anywhere.

My current thoughts on managable distributed activism run along the lines of
letter writing campaigns to research facilities, corporations and funds
putting money into this sort of thing. Tell them we appreciate what they're
doing, want them to stand up to government luddites, think the government
should mind their own business, and that we'll be first in line to buy real
anti-aging products. I think that will do more good per letter than trying
to talk to politicians.

I agree. Even if he can't stop Chinese researchers from doing useful
research he can slow or stop US research, and that is where most of the 
research is done today. Even a local ban would slow things. And once you 
have a local ban, why stop there? His stated views are universalist, and 
Joy and Fukuyama are promoting ideas about how to go about implementing 
restrictions worldwide. Suppose they could hook their anti-tech ideas to 
the anti-terrorist bandwagon? 

The way of stopping much of this is to mess up the field of debate by 
showing that there are other views there, not just Kass and a slightly 
sceptical mainstream, but also people like us who think we can use this 
technology for powerful good stuff and that the downsides can be 
handled. Once the policy field becomes wider Kass and his ilk will have 
a much harder time. We might not get what we want either, but at least 
the middle position isn't half negative any more but somewhere in the 
center.

This is a nice idea I hope we do (a friend at a political journal told
me that if they received more than two letters about an issue it
demonstrated to them that it was a relevant issue; OK, this is little
Sweden, but scale it up by twenty or so and you get the same effect in
the US). But I also think you are aiming at the wrong groups (with the
possible exception of the funders): these are end-users of ideas,
influenced by ideas in society and academia rather than the producers
and distributors of ideas. 

To really get an effect we should aim to influence the "purveyors of
second-hand ideas" as Hayek put it, the intellectuals and pundits that
produce and magnify our culture's ideas.  They range from the pure
academics to journalists. So start to write essays for journals, or even
better suitably controversial and interesting books. One can always
start by writing heartfelt letters to get one's writing style, then go
on writing articles for journals and websites, then essays and academic
publications. It is fun, and it has important effects.

[My gay friends predicted this trend at least 20 years ago, saying that
as their influence in fashion increased men's tastes would change - that
thin, short-haired, androgynous looking women would become popular, and
that did happen. But what I find scary, is that when I watch TV, which

Playboy study shows men's tastes tilting to
androgynous
                       
Joseph Brean
National Post

Friday, December 20, 2002

Playboy bunnies, and the air-brushed ideals of female beauty they
represent, are starting to look more and more like boys, according to a
scientific study of the magazine.

Reporting tomorrow in the normally staid British Medical Journal,
researchers from Toronto and Austria describe a 50-year
trend toward taller, thinner, even "androgynous" centrefold models with
smaller breasts and thinner hips.

The research by a Canadian psychologist and an Austrian
statistician did not involve looking at naked women, but
rather analyzing body measurements provided online by
Playboy for their 577 centrefolds, all the way from Marilyn
Monroe in December, 1953, to Shanna Moakler in December,
2001.

For every model, researchers calculated various composite
measurements, such as body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio,
and also an androgyny scale based on the model's curvaceousness.

In charting the course of the centrefolds' physiques,
researchers showed that height and waist size have increased,
breast and hip size have decreased along with body mass index,
and the androgyny readings went through the roof. The
models' weight, however, remained nearly constant.

It is as if the perfect woman's curves are smoothing out as she is
stretched vertically, said one of the authors, Maryanne Fisher, a PhD
candidate in psychology at York University.

"And as she's being stretched, her hips are going in and her waist
is coming out," she said.

The research is illustrated in the British Medical Journal with
pictures of three women: Renaissance artist Peter Paul Rubens'
shapely wife Helena, Marilyn Monroe and current sexpot
supermodel Eva Herzigova.

The major implication of the study, according to Ms. Fisher, is that
it debunks previous research on Playboy models that purported to
reveal a stable waist-to-hip ratio over time, hinting that this is the
basis of the perfect figure for attracting a mate. That study was
based on only a subset of the data, however, whereas this new
study is exhaustive.

"There's no formula that we can come up with for female
attractiveness because it's changing," she said.

It appears to be changing in a regular fashion, however, and
Playboy is a good indicator for what will be beautiful tomorrow,
Ms. Fisher said.

"Playboy is extremely widely circulated; at one point it exceeded
Time magazine even, so if you look at the number of people who
buy that and think of them voting on attractiveness with their
money, then it's kind of interesting," she said. "If you take that
with a grain of salt, you could say that this trend is happening in
the general population."

The Playboy study comes on the heels of a Statistics Canada
analysis of underweight people, released this week, which found
they are overwhelmingly young and female. The author, Janet
Che, attributed this trend not only to cultural ideals of
attractiveness but also to genetic, socioeconomic and behavioural
factors, such as income and smoking.

For example, those with a low household income were one-third
more likely to be underweight than those with a high household
income.

When it came to exercise, underweight people were found to be
just as physically active as those with acceptable weight, but
smoking was more common among underweight people. Ms. Che,
a Statscan senior analyst, said this is due in part to the use of
cigarettes as a weight-loss aid.

Underweight people, defined as having a body mass index
(weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres) of
less than 20, were also 25% more likely to score high on a scale
measuring emotional distress, Ms. Che reported.

According to the tv, the average female weight has increased to 10 stone
from 8, and the average female waist is 32 inches.  Apparently.  Which means
that's larger than Mike's!!

Helen of Troy
Oddly pleased to be below average for once :-)

-------------------------

Thing is the pictures in the mags are put their by the same idiots
promoting the thin fashion models. I'd believe this more had they bothered
to ask blokes what they think.
I for one like a curvaceous woman not a stick insect whose ribs I can use
as a zylophone and whose backbone could saw wood!
Steve
Send your unwanted curvy women to the usual address.

-------------------------

I think you have hit the nail on the head.
Those coke induced magazine people have got it wrong.
I personally do not think a thing that looks as if she has come out from
Belsen is my idea of a woman.
I prefer women to be women, and stick  women have no place outside of a
Lowrie painting.

Dave

-------------------------

Hear, hear.  I recall that some anthropologists once did a study and
found a cross-cultural universal that men thought a ratio of hips
to waist of 4:3 was sexy.  If androgyny really were becoming a
preference, you'd expect sales on push-up bras to be down.

People all have their own tastes, I mean, if you tried to judge male ideals 
from porn 15 years ago you'd have siad "Ah-ha - men like shaved women with 
white groin areas where they are not tanned".

People fancy who they fancy and trying to gauge what half of the population 
finds attractive from one small sauce is really going to get you in trouble. 
It's like judging a shoal of fish by the light that reflects off of some of 
them when they move a certain way.

The London Metro had a story in it today which was based on the same 
research claiming that, after looking at porn, women are getting less curvy.

Scott

------------------------

I agree, but the article was talking about long-term trends. I
personally predict that this trend has peaked and fashion will be
looking for something new to spice things up.

Well, this will be happening. It's on the list after a) building a mailing
list back-end for longevitymeme.org, b) transhumanism.com site redesign, c)
singularitypath site construction, d) bioethicssucks.org reseach and
writing. (The day job fits in there somewhere :) I intend to make this sort
of thing my default "how can you help" section for my advocacy sites.

So the question would be the actual list of people/organizations we're
encouraging people to write to? I'm all for greater economies of effect per
letter. I see the following sorts of letter as most useful (and take the
quotes with a pinch of salt):

1) As potential consumer to major drug/medical company: "when are you coming
out with real anti-aging stuff, because my money is so there when you do"

2) As outraged individual to journal: "how dare they try to kill us all, the
murderous luddites"

3) As grateful individual to funding organizations: "you are absolutely
doing the right thing by funding this research, keep it up, since my money
is so there when you get results"

I was more thinking letters from the public rather than articles. Akin to
political letter-writing campaigns that provide some guidance as to what to
put into the letters but encourage freehand rewriting.

That wasn't a prescient forecast, it was a memory of his youth in the 1920s.

According to the article, it makes the claim that the modern human group 
mainly emerged from a central core 50,000 years ago which then spread across 
the planet. This gels with many figures quoted. I wonder how it relates to 
the "common female ancestor" or "eve" theory.

Personally, living in Asia (Australia), I find the phrase Asian meaningless. 
There is something to using phrases such as Korean or Vietnamese or Thai or 
Cambodian because there are rough body types for each. But a Tamil Indian 
and an Ainu have about as much in common as a Sicilian and a Pole.

It is interesting that genetic studies have indicated that invading peoples 
often are too few to leave genetic marks, and only attain cultural conquest. 
For example, the Celtic population in Great Britain was alleged to be mainly 
two groups of neolithic peoples genetically, a western one dating 40,000 
before now and an eastern one dating 20,000 years before now [this study 
excluded Anglo-Saxons-Danes]. Therefore the Celtic-speaking conquerors of 
c.700 BC (plus or minus a century) were small in number.

Maybe if someone asks me my race I should say Cro-Magnon!

===

just for interest, some other figures I have heard on dating:

dogs date back to 100,000 years before now, not 10,000 as previously thought

Australian Aborigines date back to 60,000 years before now, not 40,000

the earliest art artefact (as such) dated to 250,000 years before now - and 
prior to this, also certain stones which resembled human faces naturally, 
were taken to campsites

earliest inhabitants of South America (the first wave, which was spread very 
thinly) arrived 50,000 before now

time taken for a mutation to spread through a large human population (e.g. 
for cow's milk drinking) 10,000 years

hut building (including stone anchors for walls) and fire control 1,500,000 
years before now

earliest boats 800,000 years before now

earliest use of pictographic language markers (non-counting ones) 10,000 
years before now (e.g. the symbol now used as the Christian cross was a 
symbol for "man")

Information Awareness Office Website
Deletes Its Logo

The government's Information Awareness Office--you know, the Defense
agency that's running the Total Information Awareness Program, the
huge database that will track everything about everyone in the US and
beyond, helmed by convicted felon John Poindexter--keeps getting more
shy. First, the IAO took down the biographies of its senior staff.
(The Memory Hole has mirrored them here.)

Now, the IAO has removed its eye-death-ray logo, which was denounced
far and wide as being Orwellian, Masonic, and just plain creepy as hell.

Above, we've archived the logo's large version. Below, we've archived
the IAO's banner, which used to incorporate the logo but is now quite
plain. (The banner also used to contain the IAO's slogan, "Scienta est
potentia," which is Latin for, "Knowledge is power.")

To fondly recall how the logo and banner used to look in context,
follow these links....

WHY SADDAM IS STILL IN POWER

Saddam Hussein gained his popularity in Iraq as a pan-Arab nationalist in 
the style of Nasser, nationalizing the oil industry and distributing some of 
it to the people in the form of education, roads and development - the rest 
being purloined for himself, his family and the military. Nationalists liked 
his attempted confiscation of the border oil region from Iran and his 
attempted annexation of Kuwait, which they considered an artificial state 
created by the UK, and a "corrupt" one at that (i.e. non-Ba'athist).

Both failed invasions did not result in the loss of Iraqi land. In this 
sense, Saddam Hussein can claim not to have "lost" these wars.

Of course, his secret police and occasional acts of extermination ensure 
opposition is punished violently.

The closest comparison is not perhaps Caligula (though Saddam is a sadist 
and megalomaniac) but the late dictator Ceausescu of Romania.

WHY THE US WILL GO TO WAR

As I have argued previously, I believe the US is really concerned to nip a 
non-Western nuclear arms race in the bud. China's 300 nuclear weapons are 
presently the only non-Western ones outside of India and Pakistan (I rate 
Israel's 200 as being "western"). The US cannot continue with disarmament in 
tandem with Russia while Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan and India attempt 
to arm themselves or increase their nuclear weapons numbers. Left unchecked, 
these states could increase the non-Western tally by hundreds, altering the 
global strategic balance which has been in place for decades. Should any of 
them go "rogue", for example Pakistan after an Islamic revolution, the 
danger escalates tremendously.

The US can afford some minor losses of troops in light of the Sept 11 
victims.

However, it has to act quickly before public opinion allows the Twin Towers 
massacre to be forgotten.

The invasion of Iraq will be a sideshow intended to force Iran and Iraq to 
halt nuclear weapons development. Without air power, Iraq will collapse 
quickly with a minimum of ground losses for the Americans and British.

I would guess the next steps will be [as I have argued previously]:

. further boosting of the limited ABM system (already announced for Alaska 
and possibly Europe)

. an immediate request for Iran and North Korea to open their nuclear 
facilities to inspectors, followed by surgical bombing if this is refused

. following resolution of Iran and North Korea, similar demands on Pakistan 
and India. There is a small possibility that India might be allowed to keep 
some weapons under supervision, but given the Pakistan-Indian animosity 
"even handed disarmament" is more likely.

. long term development of satellite ABM, electro-magnetic pulse cannon 
technology, laser disabling systems (for attacking ICBMs) through ground, 
airborne and satellite platforms. Also increased development of automated 
bomber and fighter planes (probably some of this is hidden secretly in 
George Bush's request for nearly a trillion dollars of addition military 
spending last week).

THE MILITARY REALITY

On a purely military level, there are only nuclear powers. In a "serious" 
war the west holds all the nuclear cards. America, Russia, France, the UK 
and Israel vastly outnumber China's nuclear forces, by a factor of 45 to 1. 
Atomic bombs can stop a fleet in the ocean, destroy a country's major 
cities, destroy tank forces and so on. No military opposition could 
currently defeat the west under ANY scenario. (Note I am talking about 
defeat, not damage).

America has only two choices, under the doctrine of worst-case military 
scenario: build up its own nuclear force and ABM systems (at extreme cost) 
or prevent another arms race in the third world right now - and, indeed, an 
arms race in the most unstable area of the third world, where revolutions, 
hatred of the west and interstate warfare are common.

[The above views are not my personal views on what is right or wrong, or 
justifiable, only an assessment of the current position from a traditional 
military point of view.]

I realise what I have to say is not going to be particularly well
received,
but it does need to be pointed out to folks on this and similar lists:

Any notion of "transhuman" is fallacious! This is because of the law 
of the excluded middle. Evolution can be from (sub/pre-human) to
(Homo Sapiens/ Human), and to (after/post-human) .... but at no
stage is there a separate "trans" stage. Sure, you might get two or
more classes co-existing at the same time, and individuals with traits
from more than one category ... so an individual humanoid might
be more regonisably human than post-human for example.

We cannot meaningful aim to be "transhuman" .... only post-human.

This is in response to a MaxPlumm BBS message

In his message MaxPlumm misquotes, misinterprets,
misattributes, and assigns meanings unsupported by the

tangled mess unqjust barely resembling a coherent

****IT DOES NOT CONTINUE**** as you state.  You cite
an entirely different source.  Everyone makes
mistakes, but this subject is difficult enough without
blunt misattribution. 
 
> # You have previously stated that the 1946 agreement

Quote me if you wish.  And then offer interpretations
of the quote if you wish.  But please refrain from
putting words in my mouth.  I made no such comment.  I
referenced the document to show what was going on at
one moment in time.  The document is a document, and
as such is regarded by various persons in a manner of
their choosing. The document had some force and
effect.  Exactly what, is subject to interpretation.  

You state above, about the document: "the agreement
that you base your assertions upon was never ratified
by the French government..."

It is my impression that ordinarily when a governement
gives its representative in a negotiation the power to
make an agreement, then the agreement is binding.  At
least to the degree that any government considers
itself bound by any agreement it signs.

I didn't even mention--much less acknowledge any
possibility of legitimacy regarding--that instrument
of recalcitrant colonialism.   

> which established that

> in addition to acknowledging Bao Dai as

Huh?! Me, recognize the legitimacy of Bao Dai, a
French puppet?!  I never did any such thing.  

First, the French recognize and agree to the
independence of Vietnam--and by signing with Ho,
suggest that Ho's govt was at least a legitimate
candidate for that govt--pending a series of
referenda--a country whose territory up till then was
excepted by all as composed of the three regions. 
Following this the French try to separate Cochin China
from the recognized territory of Vietnam and make it a
separate entity.  Either to salvage something from a
never-desired agreement, or--and this seems more
likely to me--to intentionally quash the agreement. 
Ho objects and war ensues.    

> I should note this agreement was ratified by the

There you go again, presuming to speak for me.  Bao
Dai was the puppet of a colonial regime.  He was a
"head of state" indeed, but neither a "legitimate"
head of state nor a head of a "legitimate" state.

So you assert, but the documents--but more to the

Mapping Human History: Discovering the Past Through our Genes
By Steve Olson
Bloomsbury/Allen&Unwin


Lots of people look and act differently from us. Many of them now live just
down the street. Racism is one of history's dopiest reactions to that fact.
Will today's treasury of genetic discoveries help expunge such
stupidities--or reinforce them? Genes hold intriguing clues to our past.
The stories they tell can be confronting, especially to those who preen
themselves as ethnically spotless and superior.
	Bigots and racists lump people into pre-judged groups using some
blindingly apparent and skin-deep discriminator: sex, or age, height,
melanin tone, eye shape, hair type, verbal accent. How on earth did this
get started? We do seem to have a penchant for carving the world into kin
(however loosely defined) versus the rest. Some people we proudly gather
inside the `us' boundary. The others we lock out behind the `them'
boundary. All too often, these groups get confused with `friend' versus
`foe', `sexually unappealing' versus `wickedly attractive', and many other
opposed categories.
	Bigotry quickly feels all too natural. Even those who pride ourselves on
being `color-blind' can slip into old habits. White against black is only
the crudest of these arbitrary divisions, apparently sanctioned by common
descent from sacred or secular heroes steeped in some blood-drenched
landscape. Soccer teams make a fetish of it.
	Identifying ancestry-based groups of humans as `races', then ranking them,
is not just arbitrary, grounded in ancient wrongs and self-interest, but
systematically misleading. Now we're unpacking the genome, uncovering the
immensely complex endowment of various alleles (that is, the gene variants
underlying physical features--for eye color, say, or blood type).
	American science writer Steve Olson tells a very accessible, widely
researched tale of how humanity's genes map out a vast, tangled history of
virtually identical tributaries in the great river flowing out of Africa
100,000 years ago. All the world's human plenty funnels back to one common
maternal ancestor 200,000 years ago, dubbed Mitochondrial Eve, and one
common father 50,000 years later, whose Y genes form the basis of every
male alive. Obviously these are not the Biblical first parents, just those
whose lineage has never once faltered along the road to us. The variant
haplotypes, or slightly different versions of mitochondrial and Y chains,
are a sort of chemical map of the peoples they've passed through.
	Obviously we're not identical, so the enterprise has its risks. An expert
in Hawaii, with its remarkably mixed population, warns against using
genetic markers to prove ethnicity: "I don't believe that biology is
destiny. Allowing yourself to be defined personally by whatever your DNA
sequence is, that's insane. But that's exactly what some people are going
to be tempted to do."
	But aren't some groups of humans--some `races'--known from IQ tests to be
smarter or dumber than others, even though nobody is allowed to mention
this any more? Olson notes that the claim is fallible. The Buraku of Japan
are "a minority that is severely discriminated against in housing,
education, and employment. Their children typically score 10 to 15 points
below other Japanese children on IQ tests. Yet when the Buraku immigrate to
other countries, the IQ gap between them and other Japanese gradually
vanishes." Conservative black American scholar Dr Thomas Sowell observed
recently that over five times as many black girls as boys score above 140
(highly gifted). Social not inherited factors are at work.
	Chinese specialists still favor the idea that different peoples evolved
separately from proto-human stocks spread about the globe. Molecular probes
quash this possibility. Everyone on earth is African, although most of us
have less genetic variability than those like the Bushmen who remained in
the original continent. That's because some gene variants were lost during
the migrations. But one charming discovery cited by Olson is that much of
Southeast Asia was seeded from Australia and New Guinea, 20,000 or more
years after the first ancestors arrived here. Arguably, those boat people
are just coming home.
	The heart of Olson's book is the double adventure of mitochondria, ancient
assimilated bacteria handed down the maternal line, and Y-chromosomes,
carrying the male sex genes. Mapping the four-letter sequences of DNA bases
along these tiny genetic chains lets scientists find the places where
mutation added variety to the basic code. Sexual reproduction mixes and
re-sorts our gene variants, and over time new mutations or random changes
enter each lineage. In isolated regions, the variants narrow and persist,
while in the melting pots they spread and multiply. Tracking these markers
lets us estimate how long a particular group has been away from the African
homeland, and more intriguingly which geographical routes its ancestors
took to get where they are today.
	Languages, too, mark out groups and peoples, although they change faster
than genes, and can be adopted without marrying into new families. Still,
historically, the two went hand in hand. A celebrated geneticist, Luca
Cavalli-Sforza, has traced genes and tongues alike, mapping a controversial
history of dispersion. His views are becoming accepted as ever more nuanced
genomic studies draw out the ancient blends of migration, marriage (and
rape), spoken and written languages.
	The details are dauntingly complex but Olson tells the tale as clearly as
you could hope for, in a story full of startling connections and the
mandatory human interest details of its explorers. In a poetic flourish, he
cites Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha: "Each one was mortal, a passionate,
playful example of all that is transitory... continually had a new face;
only time stood between one face and another." Olson foresees a future in
which panmixia--the blending of all today's peoples--will reverse the
dispersion of our genes. That is surely too tame a prediction. The same
genetic technology that revealed Mitochondrial Eve will allow us to blossom
forth in such a profusion of chosen variety that racism will be laughed to
scorn and then forgotten. The mother of that new epoch might be, perhaps,
Mitochondrial Dawn.

Does anyone know about the maximum number of languages that can be learnt? 
The record that was quoted in one source was about 60, though it didn't 
specify whether it was conversational (usually about 300 words, mostly 
hunter-gatherer related) only.

Secondarily, does anyone know what the maximum number of computer languages 
able to be learnt by one person might be?

A few months ago Slashdot talked about a Japanese ultralight                  
helicopter, at http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/11/21/1733238.   

I looked up some of the U.S. aviation regulations, and there are              
few restrictions on using experimental aircraft.  The main one though         
is that you can't fly over a "congested area", which means any built-up       
area.  So that would rule them out for any but sport use.

Not a very cheery story, Lee.  Perhaps the holidays are weighing              
heavily on you?                                                               

The future is a complicated place.  We see great potential for                
marvelous good, but we must acknowledge the possibility of                    
terrible failure.  I think many of us are predisposed to see things           
in such extremes.  But the reality may well lie in the muddled                
middle, not as good as we hope, but not as bad as we fear.

Michael Dickey, MaxPlumm, interested parties,

This will be my last post to this thread.  You're
welcome.  

This is in response to a MaxPlumm BBS message
forwarded by Michael Dickey.

In his message MaxPlumm misquotes, misinterprets,
misattributes, and assigns meanings not supported by
the text nor intended by moi.  The result is, IMO, a
tangled mess not meeting the minimum standard for
reasoned discourse and just barely capable of being
mistaken as such.

The facts of the events in question are remarkably
complex, so reasonable people could easily experience 
confusion about what exactly transpired.  But with
MaxPlumm, as with others, I'm convinced I'm dealing
not merely with confusion, but with confusion
irrevocably misguided by the 'rationality sickness' of
fundamentalist anti-communism.  Perhaps bad faith as
well.      

This series of exchanges has been largely a waste of
time.  Old men fighting old battles long past.  Hell!,
my side--the right side--prevailed--though at horrific
cost--back when it was the central event of my
generation.  Hooray!  Having taken my victory lap, it
is now time for me to get on with looking to the
future.  If the rallying cry of extropianism is
"Onward!",  then the equivalent bleat for this series
of exchanges would be "Backwards, tediously..."

At the end of the post you'll find my response to
MaxPlumm's response to my response to his first post
forwarded from the BBS by Michael Dickey.  Oy!

Nevertheless, I was pleased to discover some pieces
missing from my own understanding of those events. 
Also, I discovered the best account--detailed,
comprehensive, yet seemingly concise--that I've found
of the events effecting Vietnam between 1940 and 1964.
 

B.S.N. Murti, Vietnam Divided: The Unfinished
Struggle. London: Asia Publishing House, 1964. vi,
228pp. 

Murti was an Indian member of the International
Control Commission, charged with monitoring the
implementation of the Geneva Accords of 1954.
 
Part of this book--as much as you'll ever need--can be
found at:

Quoting from Chapter I, here are some details about,
among other things, how the north and south became
separated ***the first time***,  right after the end
of WW2.

        -----------------------

In the meantime, the Big Powers in Europe were
deciding the fate of the Asian countries which were
under Japanese occupation during the war. At the
Potsdam Conference held in July 1945 it had been
decided that the surrender of the Japanese troops in
Indochina south of the 16th Parallel should be
accepted by the Southeast Asia Command under Lord
Mountbatten, and north of the 16th Parallel by the
Chinese troops of Chiang Kai-shek. Accordingly, the
British troops under General Douglas Gracey had
arrived on September 12, 1945, in Saigon. 

It is interesting to note that the situation in
Vietnam at this moment was rather delicate. Neither
the British nor the Chinese troops moved into Vietnam
immediately after V-J Day. By the time the Allied
troops arrived in the country the Democratic Republic
of Vietnam had proclaimed its independence and was
demanding that it be recognized. French authority had
been replaced. However, the two occupying armies in
the north and in the south of the 16th Parallel
followed different policies in their dealings with the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam. 

General Gracey refused to recognize the Viet Minh
administration and he released and rearmed the French
who had been interned by the Japanese and helped them
to seize power in Saigon. [General Gracey has placed
on record what actually happened when he arrived in
Saigon on September 13. He said, "I was welcomed on
arrival by Viet Minh, who said 'welcome' and all that
sort of thing. It was a very unpleasant situation and
I promptly kicked them out" (Journal of the Royal
Central Asian Society July-October 1953 p. 213).] 

<snip>

North of the 16th Parallel the situation was
different. The Chinese who occupied the area
proclaimed a policy of non-interference in Vietnam's
internal affairs and left the Vietnamese in charge of
the administration. The Chinese were not very
enthusiastic about restoring the French authority in
Vietnam. The reasons for this attitude were many. The
Chinese had a traditional interest in Vietnam and they
wanted to reassert their influence over Tonkin. They
also had a score to settle with the French for their
pre-war penetration of Yunnan province and allowing
Indochina to be converted into a Japanese base against
China. French troops and civilian officials were
refused entry into Tonkin. This made it necessary for
the French to appease the Chinese in order to
eliminate the danger of an armed clash when they
arrived in the North. Even after the Franco-Chinese
treaty of February 28, 1946, by which the Chinese
agreed to withdraw from Tonkin, was signed, they still
insisted on the French entering into an agreement with
Ho Chi Minh before they could bring their troops into
Tonkin. 

As a result, the French had to conclude an agreement
with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 6,
1946. By this agreement, France recognized the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam (Tonkin and Annam and
not merely the territory north of the 16th Parallel)
as "a free State with its own Government, parliament,
army and finances, forming part of the Indochinese
Federation of the French Union." The French Government
pledged itself to a referendum to determine whether
Cochin-China should be united with Tonkin and Annam. 

     ------------end of excerpt------------

So what happened was, Ho & company declared Vietnam
independent on 9/2/45, and set up shop in government
offices throughout the whole of the country.  The
Brits arrived shortly to occupy the south, booted out
Ho's people, and reinstalled the French.  In the North
the Chinese wouldn't let the French back in, unless
and until they recognized Ho's govt, which they
grudgingly did.

At this point you have two separate governments, each
in de facto possession of only half of the recognized
territory of the country, but both asserting a de jure
claim to the whole. 

Read the rest of the piece if you're interested in the
whole story.

***IT DOES NOT CONTINUE*** as you state.  You cite an
entirely different source.  Everyone makes mistakes,
but this subject is difficult enough without blunt
misattribution.

Quote me if you wish.  And then offer interpretations
of the quote if you wish.  But please refrain from
putting words in my mouth.  I made no such comment.  I
referenced the document to show what was going on at
one moment in time.  The document is a document, and
as such is regarded by various persons in a manner of
their choosing. The document had some force and
effect.  Exactly what, is subject to interpretation.  

You state above, about the document: "the agreement
that you base your assertions upon was never ratified
by the French government..."

It is my impression that ordinarily when a government
gives its representative in a negotiation the power to
make an agreement, then the agreement is binding.  At
least to the degree that any government considers
itself bound by any agreement it signs.

> Yet here, you acknowledge the legitimacy of the 1949

> President Vincent Auriol,

I didn't even mention--much less acknowledge any
legitimacy of--that instrument of recalcitrant
colonialism.

> in addition to acknowledging Bao Dai as

Huh?! Me, recognize the legitimacy of Bao Dai, a
French puppet?!  I never did any such thing.  

First, the French recognize and agree to the
independence of Vietnam--and by signing with Ho,
suggest that Ho's govt was at least a legitimate
candidate for that govt--pending a series of
referenda--a country whose territory up till then was
excepted by all as composed of the three regions. 
Following this the French try to separate Cochin China
from the recognized territory of Vietnam and make it a
separate entity.  Either to salvage something from a
never-desired agreement, or--and this seems more
likely to me--to intentionally quash the agreement. 
Ho objects and war ensues.

There you go again, presuming to speak for me.  We
most certainly do not agree.  Bao Dai was the puppet
of a colonial regime.  He was a "head of state"
indeed, but neither a "legitimate" head of state nor a
head of a "legitimate" state.

>From Murti, "Vietnam Divided":

"After the March 6th agreement [French recognition, at
Chinese insistance, of the DRV], the story of
Franco-Vietnamese relations rapidly deteriorated and
finally resulted in open hostilities between the two
parties. The Dalat Conference which met on April 18,
1946, to discuss various problems between the
representatives of France and the Democratic Republic
of Vietnam failed on the crucial question of the
status of Cochin-China. The French regarded
Cochin-China as their colony and the Viet Minh
insisted it was an integral part of Vietnam. On June
1, the French authorities announced the setting up of
a provisional government in Cochin-China and
recognized it."

Set up de jure for the first time June 1, 1946.  As a
French colonial possession.  In March 1949, the
French, having possession of the south, installed--as
in installed their puppet--Bao Dai as head of state to
put a Vietnamese face on their attempt to reconquer
the whole of Vietnam.  In 1956--facts, my boy.  You
need to cultivate an acquaintance with the
facts--Diem--for the second time--declared a separate
state in the south.

# Again, if there are any errors or lack of facts
here, it is clearly on your side of the discussion. 

So you feebly assert, but the documents and the
untortured facts--tell another story.

Best, Jeff Davis

	It seems unlikely USA-UK-UN forces would attack North Korea, even with
high-precision weapons. North Korea has a very potent threat; they
possess a large conventional army and a good delivery system for nuclear
bombs. Should Western forces threaten surgical strikes, Pyongyang might
attack, or convincingly threaten to attack South Korea and/or Japan. In
the latter case, they need only threaten to detonate a bomb in a high
air-burst off the western Japanese coast. Whether or not this might make
a militarily useful EMP, it would certainly generate mass disruption of
Japan's still-important and still-fragile economy through public fear.
Surgical bombing of Iran also seems unlikely. Iran grows increasingly
moderate with time, and military attacks would retard or reverse this
trend. In both cases, carrots will serve much better than sticks.

	"Even-handed disarmament" sounds much more likely than dictated
disarmament. Under UN auspices, this might even work.

	These developments probably will come much sooner than you think.
Directed energy weapons (DEW) make up a very popular area of research
right now in military aerospace. (See many articles in the last two
years of Aviation Week.) According to AvLeak, antenna design and to a
lesser extent, power budget (inc. heat dissipation) make the main
problems now. Anti-missile lasers exist as the Tactical High Energy
Laser and the airborne theater missile defense projects. We will also
see some sea-based ABM work, and a little bit of sea-based DEW. I
strongly suspect that the increase in military spending will move
development systems into field trials, esp. for offensive information
warfare. The potential Gulf War Two would allow real-world use for many
weapons not yet used in battle. 
	UCAVs (Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles), while they have funny-looking
shapes and a futuristic appeal, mark more of an evolutionary change than
a revolutionary one. If you fly commercial airliners, you have already
flown under the care of a machine. In fact, an instructor at the flight
school I just worked at complained pilots returning for annual training
arrive with airmanship rusty from a year of letting the autopilot do
almost all the work. In fact, new Gulfstream jets come with footrests
for the pilot and co-pilot seats.

>

	That oversimplifies to the point of falsehood. For example, in a
Russo-Chinese War today and ignoring outside intervention, the RSFR
would lose a great deal of eastern territory regardless of how many
nuclear weapons they used. China has some 203 million available and fit
for military service
(http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/ch.html) vs Russia's
30 million (same site, different page).

	Atomic weapons can only destroy. Atomic weapons do not help in
counter-insurgencies, training local forces, military operations in
urban terrain (save eliminating a city), and they would have very little
use in littoral and riverine naval actions. Further, atomic weapons'
environmental consequences make them unsuitable for defensive
use--except in the most bitter of scorched-earth tactics. A defender
will not use a nuclear explosive to stop an advancing column of tanks at
the outskirts of a friendly city, and might not use it to stop them on
enemy territory downwind. Finally, atomic weapons can only destroy what
they can target. This is why the Cold War saw ballistic missile
submarines form a third of the nuclear triad. 

> currently defeat the west under ANY scenario. (Note I am talking about 
> defeat, not damage).

	I agree with your conclusion, but not your premise. All the Western
powers combined might defeat any combination of other states. The US
alone might well defeat all the other Great Powers combined, and would
certainly do so if one excludes Russia from the opposing forces.

>

        Why should America do that when it already has an overwhelming
nuclear advantage? Remember "...the west holds all the nuclear cards"?
Adopting a policy of treating any terrorist WMD attack on a NATO member
as a WMD attack on all NATO members from country-X-suspected-of-

Curious weapon?

I've heard of microthin shields to block the sun's light over Earth as a 
space weapon - stopping plant growth and energy input - but could the same 
idea in reverse apply - a huge microthin mirror or series of mirrors 
focussing on the Earth or parts of it as a kind of giant focussing burner 
beam?

Not necessarily weapon, with a gossamer Fresnel or a mirror you could nix 
the global warming, if latter be landing.

A very large phased array microwave radiator could generate damaging 
microwave fluxes at Earth surface, or in space. At the extreme side, you 
could radiate some MT/s matterenergy equivalent.

Study: Stem Cells Could Bypass Ethical Quagmire
By Randy Dotinga
HealthScoutNews Reporter
http://www.healthcentral.com/news/NewsFullText.cfm?id=510956

Bottom line -- you can reprogram your own stem cells.

The question at this point will be to determine whether
the stem cells being reprogrammed are relatively speaking
your "perfect" genome -- that is a DNA sequencing or
polymorphism testing cost issue.  It is best from a
repair/replacement standpoint that the genome be relatively
"perfect".  But it seems likely that each of us should have
some of these cells so the issue is finding them.

Secondly, it isn't clear if the reprogramming is "universal".
More work will be required to see if you can turn proto-stem-cells
into only neurons or whether they can become muscle cells, kidney
cells, etc.  It may be the case that adult stem cells are not
completely totipotent.  That may not be a complete show stopper
though -- as the saying goes "half a loaf is better than none".

Oh, now this is an interesting question.

> Does anyone know about the maximum number of languages that can be learnt?

I think it is in the vicinity of 5-6 (with some degree of fluency).
The correct source for this I think would be the Guinness Book of
World Records (though one would need to carefully constrain based
on fluency).  To be able to say hello in 60 languages is easy --
to be able to converse in them is much more difficult.

To be "conversational" one generally needs several thousand words
(its much more than hundreds).

> Secondarily, does anyone know what the maximum number of computer languages
> able to be learnt by one person might be?

It depends on what you mean by "learnt" but if you include the assembler
languages (many of which may be obsolete due to the termination of the
production of the chips), I've probably learnt a dozen or more.  I would
be relatively comfortable today with PERL, C, Fortran, PDP-10 and PDP-11
assembler.  If pressed I could probably deal with IBM-360 Assembler,
NS-16000 Assembler, IBM Series-1 assembler and Intel-8086 Assembler
as well as some uncommon languages such as Bliss-10, Bliss-11 and PPL
(polymorphic programming language).  I could probably make a stab at
BASIC, LISP and perhaps SMALLTALK as well.

The principles behind most of these languages with the exception of
LISP and SMALLTALK are pretty much the same so relearning a new
vocabulary isn't too difficult.  The primary difference between
natural languages and computer languages is that the "natural" vocabulary
is much larger.  There are a few "natural" languages that have
a very different syntax -- but they are a minority.  So the difference
between learning a computer language and a natural language is really
a question of the required size of the vocabulary.  My gut level
feel is that the computer languages are about an order of magnitude
smaller than natural languages in this requirement.

Hope that helps.
Robert

The letter writing idea has been discussed before but we have not followed
through on it. As the above exchange makes apparent, there are three sorts
of groups one could write to: corporations, politicians, and
journalist-types. Which group to write to? Well some experimentation is
probably in order, but a little technology might amplify the results. A
letter to one group should be cc-ed to the other two groups. As Reason
suggests, a hand-written letter might be the most effective, but this could
be photocopied on the cc versions. With sufficient numbers, there is perhaps
some hope that we might influence politicians and the political landscape.
Imagine a politician receiving copies of letters sent by activists (us) to
corporations and idea purveyors (journalists, etc.). Not to be too cynical
but one can see the politician counting the lost votes in her head as multi
front battle shapes up.....  It might help if we had a central repository
for mailing lists of these three groups and also at least a few examples of
letters. Also, we should keep count of who has been sent something and by
whom. Reason, what do you think about having a letter writing activism
section on Transhumanity? Is a goal of 10,000 letters in the next year
unreasonable? (100 people writing 34 letters sent out to three individuals
sounds doable).

All three, I'd say, though writing to politicians and journalist will
probably have a bigger impact.  Politicians moreso if the letter-writer
is either a constitute or the head of powerful or monied group.  (On the
latter, forget about transhumanist groups.  I doubt any politician is
going to rethink a position based on an ExI or WTA position paper.  This
is sad, but true.  Now, if the same position paper came from NOW or the
NRA, it would be a different story.)  Also, one might consider teachers,
especially those of political science classes and the like.

I would suggest that, in most cases, you do not let the targetted party
know they're being carbon copied.  Why?  Then it looks more like a
letter-writing campaign -- a blatant attempt to influence opinions --
and is likely to dismissed by journalists, etc.  Imagine, e.g., if you
were the taget of a carbon copied letter.  Any yahoo with access to a
photocopier can do that.  You want the targets, in most cases, not to
think that they're being manipulated.

Actually, petitions might be more effective here.  Also, as I mentioned
above, the letters to politicians have to be from constituents or heads
of powerful/monied groups.  Me writing to your MP is probably not going
to have a big impact, since I don't live and vote in Toronto.  You
writing my Congressman will likewise not have much effect since you
don't live and vote in my district.

BTW, the Liberty Committee already has such a project dealing with
legislation in the US.  See:

http://www.thelibertycommittee.org/contribute.htm

Imagine a similar setup to push transhumanist positions, though not
limited to US Federal government elected officials.

One might also add to the mailing list, people in government agencies,
such as, in the States, the FDA or NIH.  I'm not sure of the impact
here, but a little negative feedback toward their policies might help to
spread the seeds of doubt in their ranks.

Happy Holidays!

"Today, it is almost an heresy to suggest that scientific knowledge is
not the sum of all knowledge. But a little reflection will show that
there is beyond question a body of a very important but unorganized
knowledge which cannot be possibly called scientific in the sense of
knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular
circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that
practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that
he possesses unique information of which benefical use might be made,
but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are
left to him or are made with his active cooperation." -- F.A. Hayek,

Another way to look at this: the universe is defined
as the totality of all things. The question of what
caused it is meaningless because if there were
something before the creation of the universe that
caused its creation, then that thing must have existed
in the universe -- and that is a contradiction.

[Rafal]
I agree that because time itself is valid only in the context 
of the universe, the question about what caused the universe 
cannot be couched in temporal terms. What Hal and I say is 
(the way I see it) is to provide a conceptual framework 
for looking at the universe from an imaginary outside
perspective, to gain a pleasant, aesthetic sense of understanding, 
no more.

[Saint Augustine, from 'The City of God']
'Six is a number perfect in itself, and not because God created 
the world in six days; rather the contrary is true. God created 
the world in six days because this number is perfect, and it would 
remain perfect, even if the work of the six days did not exist.'

[J. A. Wheeler, from 'Geons, Black Holes & Quantum Foam']
'According to a graffito that I once saw in the men's room
of the Pecan Street Cafe in Austin, Texas, "Time is nature's
way to keep everything from happening all at once".'

    This is the 75'th update of my fly longevity experiments. Average
temperature was 25.5 C during this run. Here I examine the effect of fly
population size on survival, and its (possible) interaction with taurine
dosage. Please note that I usually add 1 gram of taurine to 20 grams of
4-24 fly food per bottle, to act as a nontoxic larvicide.
    As it turned out, taurine dosage had no consistent effect on
longevity, so the results for this run are listed below, in fly number
order. In theory one might anticipate three population effects. Maximum
lifespan should be increased, if more flies are used, since extremely old
flies are expected to  be few and far between. On the other hand a high
population density might promote the transmission of pathogens between
flies, and so average longevity would then be reduced if the population is
too high. Another negative effect from too high a population would be
increased mating frequency, which would also act to reduce average
longevity.
    From the data presented below it appears average longevity (see day
21) is increased if fly number is below about 20 flies. Maximal longevity
displays a bimodal distribution, with fly numbers either below 10, or
above 30 showing some advantage. I generally try to place between 15 and
30 flies in most of my runs. However due to the limited number of flies
available from a single breeding bottle, increasing this number is not
feasible. On the other hand, I'm uncomfortable statistically with reducing
fly number to less than 10 per bottle. I'll have to try this experiment
again, in the future, to see how robust this less-than-10-fly effect is.

Why?  Reading the reviews I don't see much terribly extropic 
about the book.  On the face of it, it isn't the type of thing I 
would normally go out of my way to read.

This is an inappropiate slam with no value to this list 
whatsoever.  It is also demonstrably false.  Many homosexual men 
don't have remotely any such thing as an "ideal woman" and to 
the extent they do thing of women it is not, judging by their 
writings, characterizations, drag queens ans so on, a teenage 
boy with big boobs.  And of course homosexual men are only one 
side of the coin.  Lesbian women have determinely no single 
"ideal woman" image.  The very notion is anathema.  The fashion 
model ideal came out of the heads of fashion folk alright but it 
is not particularly "gay" in origin.

Most of the Earth's surface is way too cold.  The continent I
live on, North America, is mostly too cold for human comfort,
and supports plant life only in some seasons.

The giant sheets could indeed be used to warm polar regions
and cool tropical regions, but of course we are too afraid
to CHANGE anything because no matter now many people would
ultimately benefit, some people would be inconvenienced.
(Not to mention many animals.)

Perhaps, however, the intense harm occasionally done by
heat waves in some areas might provide enough incentive
to try diverting small amounts of solar energy to more
northerly (or southerly) latitudes.

Yes, you've made quite explicit what distinguishes science
from other arenas of human knowledge.  It's an accumulation
of standard, repeatable, yet often profound and arcane
knowledge.

(It's most interesting to me, incidentally, how the existence
of certain common and widely used terms, be it "science",
"race", or "hypnosis", provides interesting testimony as
to the actual existence of those things.  Usually claims by
theoreticians that "science is no different", "race does not
exist", or "hypnosis is a sham" are over-wrought, and the
theoreticians have managed to delude themselves by excess
ideological zeal.  Yet indeed sometimes those things in
fact do not exist, and are the result of a kind of culture-
induced mass hysteria.  One of our best tests at present is
to determine through anthropological studies if these things
are present in most cultures, or only a few.)

Yes, and to the degree that someone is interested in the
methods of detection, we often call it a "science", as in
forensic science.

The primary thesis under discussion here, however, is 
whether this built-up literature, this body of knowledge
is investigated by special processes not present in other
fields of inquiry---that is, in other situations where
people are trying to find out what is going on.

My claim is still that there is not.   In other words,
that what is advertised as different in the "scientific
method" is false, and what is intelligent, rational,
objective, and sensible in it is not new.

The most damaging flak that I've taken so far is, IMO,
that scientific research is often accompanied by heavy
reliance on statistical methods, and non-scientific ways
of knowing never is.

I doubt very much that any book should be read by 
everyone, but NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR (aka 1984)
taught me about true power.

I know that Bertrand Russell wrote a book entitled
"Power", and I have that around somewhere and should
dig it up.  But it's bound to be pretty old, and I'm
wondering if anyone knows of some good books on how
power arises in human societies, why it's inevitable,
how it really works, what it's good for, and so on.

I think that an objective understanding of power may
be a blind spot for all of us, but especially for
libertarians.

Neg.  That may be one reason some people give, but the real reason is
that the effects of such climate change are simply not well known.  As
in, there is a significant chance that you could wind up turning
inhabited areas into deserts or another Hurricane Alley, when you were
intending to just adjust said areas, or ones anywhere within a few
thousand miles, towards the human norm.  That is why the inhabitants of
those areas object.

<nods>  If 'tis to be done, 'twould best be started off in very small
increments, such that the maximum magnitude of disaster is also
minimized.  (To be clear: I'm not saying the worst will happen; I'm
saying peoples' fear of the worst is the obstacle.  So, minimize the
fear if you want to make sure there aren't lynch mobs, or their police
representatives, roughing you up for what might happen.)

I seem to remember that the record is on the order of 20 or 30 or
so.  Some guy at a UN translation office.  The main problem being
to get enough practice to stay fluent in them.

As many as you can find time to actually work with, I guess.  For
practical purposes, computer languages are an entirely different
thing than human languages.  Personally, I don't think I process
code like language at all, but hey, I might be wrong, given our
species' absurdly limited ability of introspection.

Lee,
       I don't have a total answer for you but if you find one I would like 
the reference also.  I recently read a book about Stalin named Koba by Martin

War and Peace has a goodly number of interesting meanderings on this topic
amid the soap opera. I haven't read much else by Tolstoy, but I assume the
same theme crops up elsewhere in his works.

       I would look among the writings of the various left wing advocates.  
For purposes of background in a novel I am writing I have became interested 
in community activism and social engineering.  We are talking "how to" here.  
I have recently begun to find material by searching on community activism.
       I believe there is also material in a book called power as well as in 
Machievelli.

The reason I'm dubious about sending letters to politicians is that they
do -- so far as I can see -- an excellent job of ignoring large, well-funded
popular movements. 10,000 letters and no cash probably won't even show up on
their radar. Based on my reading, cc'ed letters and e-mail go straight into
the trash.

The people I'd send 10,000 letters to are those who listen to their
customers, have money and have a vested interest in buying politicians --
e.g. drug companies, large medical businesses. You can get a major company
to change direction if you're waving the carrot of happy, paying customers
or the stick of unhappy, non-paying customers.

That and Anders suggestions of the journals -- seems a smart plan for
efficiency per letter.

Orwell is worth reading because it represents everything we are against
- death, slavery, mindlessness and stasis. Reading it should fill one
with anger against the awful trapped situation in the fictional world,
and hope to change our own imperfect but infinitely more improveable
systems to something better. 

A good dystopian novel shows a bad possibility, how it works and 
sometimes even how the world got there. That is useful in guiding 
actions to avoid it. Lightweight dystopian novels suggest improbable or 
easily avoidable futures; good dystopian novels show dark pathways 
opening invitingly in the near future or our culture.

That's Peter Ustinov, although I think he has more than "some degree
of fluency".  Rare but not really unusual, as far as I know.  There
is also the question whether you want to weigh the relatedness of
the languages concerned.  Speaking, say, Portuguese, Spanish, and
Italian could be judged less formidable than speaking three unrelated
languages such as Russian, Arabic, and Japanese.

[computer languages]

Yes, that is an important point.  There are a couple of programming
paradigms out there (imperative, functional, object-oriented, ...).
Learning another language that employs a paradigm you already know
requires very little effort.

> The primary difference between natural languages and computer
> languages is that the "natural" vocabulary is much larger.

Yes.  However, you need to be careful when considering the vocabulary
of a computer language.  For example, look at C, which is reasonably
well-known to most people in the field.  C only has a handful of
keywords (and another handful of operators composed from nonalphabetic
characters that really need to be counted as keywords, too).  But
there's not all that much that you can do with pure C.  For practical
work you need to know the standard library, which is not part of
the language proper and adds a lot of "vocabulary".  Then, for real
world programming, you also need to know operating system bindings
and all sorts of APIs.  A lot of stuff that is considered to belong
to the core part of some languages comes as external libraries for
other languages.

> There are a few "natural" languages that have a very different
> syntax -- but they are a minority.

I wonder what you have in mind there...
Most non-linguists have no idea how many "weird" features there are
in existing languages.  It doesn't help that most people in the
Western countries have only had exposure to a subset of Indo-European
languages that are closely or even incestuously related.

I'm far from sure that this is *the* difference, but is *a* huge
difference.

That might feasible.  The figure I recall seeing was with respect to
a prodigy in the late 1800's that had mastered all of the major European
languages and several Asian languages as well.

As I type this, I decided to get off my lazy butt (similar to Spike's
presumably) and see if I could look it up.  My 1995 edition of "The
Guinness Book of World Records" contains 5 pages about "Languages"
which alone could probably make for a very interesting game of "Trivial
Pursuit".

For example, it is estimated that in New Guinea there are an estimated
869 languages.

Now, with respect to the question at hand:

"The world's greatest linquist is believed to have been Dr. Harold Williams
of New Zealand (1876-1928), a journalist.  He was reputed to speak 58
languages and many dialects fluently."

"The greatest living linquist is Ziad Fazah (Brazil; b 10 Jul 1954 [so
he should now be about 48]) who speaks and writes 58 languages..."

"Alexander Schwartz of New York City *worked* with 31 languages as a
translator for the United Nations between 1962 and 1986."

So there you have it.  These numbers are surprisingly high (to me)
so these people must have had really exceptional verbal skills.

The process of writing code may be different -- its a logical
creative process that I suspect is not too different from writing
a book.  But the process of knowing the vocabulary of what you
can write and the syntax of how you must put things together,
I suspect makes use of the language centers and genes.

But natural languages are *much* more complex than programming languages.
Programming languages use from a few dozen to a few hundred terms.
English has ~600,000 words and ~400,000 technical terms, of which
Shakespere used ~33,000.  So we are talking a difference of approximately
2 orders of magnitude in complexity.  No wonder computers have a problem
with speech recognition.

Kind of amazing what you can learn from reading only a couple of pages
of the right source.

Robert

Thanks Anders, I couldn't have said it better.  I wish
to get very specific, at the risk of boring you with
my saying the same thing over and over.  We really really
cannot stop infotech.  We can't, it is coming.  Orwell's
novel is an example of what happens when infotech empowers
a government and the proles do not compensate somehow.  We
compensate by reducing the number of laws and the budget
of government, and not just the Feds, but also the state,
county, city and homeowners associations.  Start by *always*
voting for the guy who runs for lowered taxes.  spike

I don't think we should declare human races to be nonexistent just
because the idea is politically incorrect.  Anybody who declares
that there are no systematic non-cultural differences between, say,
a group of indigenous North Europeans and a likewise group from
Subsaharan Africa needs to have his head examined.

I don't have a problem accepting that geographically separated
groups of people have evolved distinctive traits.  Sure sounds
reasonable.  Now, whether you can draw clear borders and just where
these are to be drawn (e.g. can you really lump all of Black Africa
together?) is another question.

However, and obviously, those distinctions start to collapse when
people originating from separated locations meet and interbreed,
something that has happened extensively for instance in the Americas.
In European languages we still have historical terms such as "mulatto"
and "mestizo" that have long ago ceased to be applicable because
modern populations are just too interbred.

Treating, say, the Afro-American population in the USA as a homogeneous
group, and one that is idential to Africans, is absurd.  Afro-American

However this still begs the question of why it is done.
Why learn multiple languages?  We have demonstrated that
computers can both recognize and generate speech.  Computers
have arbitrarily much memory, they do not forget, they can
be "trained" in seconds a task which takes a human genius
years to master.  Using a biobrain to master a language
may have some benefits, but in general it seems like a
misuse of the technology.

I can forsee where every human language will soon have
a form or subset with a standardized structure and grammar,
so that a carbon unit can understand as well as a computer.
I am told that as many as a third of all human languages
will disappear in the next 50 years.  Clearly, all
languages in order to have a chance of surviving will
need a standardized form or subset which can be understood
by a computer.

No way!  My butt is far lazier.

But my brain is used to do only that which brains do
so very well.  I find it so very bizarre that universities
still require languages, when we are at the point where
machine translation is upon us.  Next they will be
requiring arithmetic.  spike

I'd have to contest that. While it may be said that it causes large
numbers of deaths, injuries, and destruction of infrastructure, it is
also in some cases the only way to achieve justice, or at least the
most efficient.

For example, had Patton gotten the go-ahead at the end of WWII to keep
on marching against the USSR, certainly at least a few more million
people would have died, at least until we nuked Moscow and decapitated
the 'evil empire' later on in the year, after we had subjugated Japan.

Had we shown the intestinal fortitude to do so, half the population of
the world would have lived in liberty for 45 years earlier than they do
now. China might not have gone communist.

In the calculus of liberty, are a million deaths worth gaining liberty
for 100 million others?

Had we continued in the same milquetoast policy followed by Clinton
after 9/11, Afghanistan would still be under al Qaeda/Taliban control,
where people would still be getting executed for posessing western
music, bibles, or for walking around without their burkhas. Aren't the
few lives lost worth liberty for ten million people?

Do western leftists value liberty so little that they do see as worth
dying for?

What I am wondering, though, is why you think it is such a bad thing to
use biometrics in id documents like passports and visas. Libertarian
societies depend upon maintaining high degrees of trust between
individuals. This trust is compromised when untrustworthy individuals
are able to penetrate and infiltrate the society via lax immigration
standards and poor means of verifying individual bona fides. 

Even L Neil Smith admits that libertarian societies cannot deal
effectively with terrorist attacks.

Another thing I wonder about is how is it that you have a problem with
such biometric id standards when you choose to live in a country which
is considered one of the most burdensome in regard to government
paperwork and bureaucracy imposed on the average individual.

Mike

I think the choice of term "androgynous" was rather unfortunate and
the misleading title above illustrates this.  If you look at Playboy
centerfolds, they are *not* androgynous.  These women are very
unmistakably female.  The study showed a trend pointing to less
pronounced secondary sexual characteristics, which you can label
"more androgenous", but this is not the same thing at all.
Grammatically speaking, make sure you use the comparative and not
the positive form of the adjective.

For what it's worth, I'm under the impression that a non-negligiable
number of Playboy models have undergone cosmetic surgery to enhance
their secondary sexual characteristics (i.e. they got boob jobs).
This is also endemic in Hollywood, not to mention the porn business.
Liposuction is also popular, hip width is not operable at this time.
Am I missing something or can we conclude that the social ideal of
the androgyny index (as defined in the Voracek/Fisher paper) is
definitely above the average one of the eligible female population?

Well, how do I tell? :-)  As much as I am in favor of giving people
to option of cosmetic surgery, I can't say that I always agree with
the results.  Not long ago, Melanie Griffith was on Larry King Live
and I was appalled.  I mean, sure, she doesn't have any wrinkles,
but... the term "disfigurement" crossed my mind.  Cher at least
only looks weird.

There are probably several such prodigies; yet, my own history recalls one
such man: Jeremiah Curtin (1835-1906).

I grew up in the same small village that he lived as a child (Greendale,
Wisconsin). I even toured his house (very small) one of the few times it was
opened to the public in the 1980s. My own childhood home is only five
minutes away by car.

I guess I was marked by my experiences in Navy Flight School in the 50s.  
Flyers attract a lot of young beautiful women -- The City of Pensacola, 
Florida isn't known as The Mother in law of Naval Aviation for nothing.  In 
addition there was hardly a centerfold or girlie calendar published that 
didn't end up hanging on the walls of our Cadet BOQ.  I looked.
       One day I was going through the barracks and a fresh centerfold caught 
my eye.  For some reason, I stared until I realized that me and my buddies 
were routinely dating and undressing better looking women than the centerfold 
was.
       After that I started really looking at the women I dated, knew or just 
passed on the street.  It didn't take long to realize that you can easily 
find better looking women than ever show up to work with Hugh Heffner if that 
is your standard of desirability.
       Further, after the service I became an engineer working for a company 
that made all sorts of hair products for women.  It was a small company and 
after a year or so I began to be asked my opinion of the women (looks only) 
that we hired to model our products.  Chiefly this meant picking the pictures 
that went on the packages we used.  Let me make it plain, someone else made 
the final choice but I was always asked for my input.
       That led to a lot of discussion about what we wanted in a model.  That 
in turn led eventually to my realizing that a lot of companies including the 
men's magazines do not make a practice of picking the prettiest women 
available -- they want a woman that folks can relate to.
       All of the above is what led me to wonder about the selection criteria 
for the models in the men's magazines.  In the end I don't know who picks 
those models but I do know that prettier ones are available on any busy 
street or campus in the nation.  
       I won't even get into picking real women that are capable, competent, 
and all the other good stuff -- Shakespeare said it in the Tempest I believe, 
oh brave new world.  I can apply that to women as well as his heroine did to 
men.  LOL

This trend of female fashion models looking like sexy boys seems to be
reversing in recent years.  Women who have some meat on their bones are
beginning to appear.  The media doll or fashion model came into being
just after World War II based on the research below:

Terry


Case Study of "Manchurian Candy"
     The world knew Candy Jones as one of the most successful American fashion
models of the 1940s; however, she led a secret life as a "Manchurian Candidate"
agent for the U.S. intelligence services during the Cold War. Her life is
analyzed in this tale of multiple personality, conspiracy, and hypnotic mind
control and fantasy life. She married Long John Nebel, the Art Bell radio host
of his day, in 1972, after a 28 day courtship. He began noticing her voice and
posture changing. Her affluent parents did physically and sexually abuse her.
Nebel hypnotized his wife, asking questions and taping the amazing results.
Donald Bain's book, The Control of Candy Jones, records this tale. Her fashion
office in New York became a FBI mail drop in 1960. That year she met a World War
II acquaintance, Dr Gilbert Jensen, in San Francisco. He said he worked for the
CIA in an Oakland office. Candy needed cash, having three sons in private
schools, and so agreed to Jensen's offer to help covert intelligence. He used
hypnotic techniques and intravenous injections of highly experimental drugs.
Arlene, her evil persona, received intensive CIA training, testing, and
exploitation that are too graphic to describe here. [TWC] As a media doll Candy
Jones shares the dream-machine of television and Hollywood movie characters,
more "system-animal" than human. Candy's first husband, Harry Conover
(1946-1959), created the 'cover girl' concept after World War II, starting his
business with a matching loan of $500 from Gerald Ford, President of the USA
(1974-1977). Ford, a male model at the time, knew Conover as a room-mate. [This
article ends with a tie-in to my installment seven, subliminal messaging.]

Sony soon to deliver child robot
By Sue Lowe
December 23 2002


Not sure you want children? By the middle of next year, hesitant couples
with a spare $[AUS]80,000 may be able to have a trial run with a child-like
robot.

Flush with the worldwide success of its Aibo robotic dog, Japanese
technology giant Sony is working on a 60-centimetre humanoid robot. It says
the Sony Dream Robot, SDR4X, would cost between $60,000 and $80,000.

Like the Aibo dog, SDR4X can interact with its "carers", expressing emotions
through a combination of words, songs and body language. It can recognise up
to 10 human faces and voices and adapt its behaviour according to the way it
is treated.

April 7 is tipped as a possible launch date. That is the day that AstroBoy,
the wide-eyed, rocket-powered, robot-boy of 1960s Japanese comic fame, was
supposedly born.

Car maker Honda also has an advanced prototype of a humanoid robot, dubbed
Asimo, who is now used to help sell cars in Honda's main Tokyo showroom.

Oh, I see very fine reasons for reading Orwell's 1984, 
especially now when we seem so keen on implementing such a 
hellish state.  But Delaney's "1984"?  That I don't see so many 
reasons to read.

"Scientists grown entire kidneys in laboratory mice using human stem
cells in a development that raises the prospect of growing full-sized
human organs in pigs - a breakthrough that would alleviate the worldwide
shortage of kidneys for transplant operations.

An Israeli team led by Professor Yair Reisner of the Weizmann Institute
of Science in Rehovot grew miniature human kidneys inside the body
cavities of mice in which human kidney stem cells had been transplanted.
The kidneys were fully functional and produced urine."

Given the generally low percentages of women on these
transhuman/extropian lists, I'm pleased that some topics are strong
enough to catch the occasional woman-passer-by to the Transhumanity
web site, and I am pleased to see them writing good messages.

My egg-freezing topic is one of those- it has generated the most
comments on the Transhumanity web site so far. It was enough of a
strong hook to keep my own interest these last 10 years, and I see it
is important enough for other women to think of its consequences 
for our future lives too.

The feedback on the article gives a clue about half of our
population's concerns and one way in which transhumans and
extropians can gear public relations.

I personally know a professor who speaks 12 languages fluently
("fluently" also means: without accent). Of course, such 
prodigies are uncommon, but exist.

Hmmm, you must have missed Haskell,(O)(ca)ML,Haskell,clean,mercury,
prolog,Dylan,Erlang,Q or J.

For me, they are much more different from C than smalltalk
or lisp.

They are mostly similar in that regard, that they are mainly 
declarative, i.e. you declare the specification of the functions 
abstracly, *not* the way *how* they should be computed. 
That is, the programs are precise mathematical specifications, 
instead of state-transformers as in the imperative languages.

There is a nice comparison of the syntax of programming languages on

http://merd.net/pixel/language-study/syntax-across-languages.html

However, it is only a syntactical comparision, it does not show
the principal differences.

That didn't take long, even by our standards.

Interesting, I thought about posting this but I didn't see the discovery
as that exciting to bother the list about.  Perhaps I see Greg Fahy's work
on vitrifying organs as solving this problem sooner and don't think of
this as "that" significant.  One still has the problem of the time it
takes to grow adult sized organs through "natural" processes.  That may
only be solved with "whole genome engineering" to an extent that provides
a faster cell division time (in normal eukaryotic organisms its ~24 hours
but one "should" be able to speed that up significantly).  A new kidney
may be of no use if it takes a pig 5-10 years to grow one (unless you
can afford to grow up a spare supply in advance).

But of course having multiple paths is probably a good thing.

Hi Barry et al.

I have some comments which may be of use/interest:

No answer can be given to such a question unless (a) the notion 'learn a
(natural) language' is well defined (and there are various ways of
defining it, which would yield a wide range of answers) and (b) a
distinction is made between children and adult learners (although that
could not be a water-tight distinction).  The point about degrees of
difference is also important (although sometimes it is hard to keep
similar languages apart!).

The number of languages cannot be determined precisely, even for one
specific time, as there is no clear distinction between the notions of
'dialects of one language' and 'closely related languages'. 
'Common-sense' figures given are around 5,000.

On the other hand, different codings of the same language are a
different matter from different languages.

I could not comment in any detail on computer languages, which are
parasitic on natural languages and other systems (maths etc) but which
inevitably have certain special properties that distinguish them from
natural languages.

Of course, proficiency in a language centrally involves control of the
grammar, not merely vocab size.  Natural languages have very varied
grammars indeed, and - like another commentator - I do not think that
the comment 'There are a few "natural" languages that have a very
different syntax -- but they are a minority' could be sustained.  Which
languages are these supposed to be?  (It is not unusual for
non-linguists, including proficient language-learners, to focus too much
on vocab at the expense of grammar when commenting on such matters.  But
of course natural languages do also have very large vocabs.)

Machine translation is still rudimentary in many ways (look at some
examples!), but no doubt it will improve.  It might improve faster if
there were progress towards an agreed & successful linguistic theory by
way of input - but there is little sign of this.  (Highly optimistic
statements about rapid improvement do not take this adequately into
account.)

Many languages are dying out, but not for reasons of excessive internal
diversity; these are usually spoken by very small groups and thus, while
not standardised, show relatively little variation. 
Those languages which remain strong continue to display large amounts of
variation, especially in certain respects. Eg, even with the 'global
village' effect, English is not really becoming less diverse in respect
of accents.  In some respects, English and other widespread languages
are actually continuing to diverge.  And indeed standardisation is a
process which applies much more strongly in certain respects than
others.  The French have tried very hard to standardise their language
and indeed to have one standard for the whole francophone world, but
even in France itself this has had little effect on informal speech.

### If they grew them in mice, it couldn't have been much more than a year,
probably much less. You could transplant clusters of mini-kidneys to humans,
tide them over with dialysis, and then only make sure they don't overgrow
with time. You need only a fraction of the adult creatine clearance to keep
you off dialysis.

I'm pleased to announce that Fictionwise have now put up my novel about VR,
uploads, time travel, the Omega Point and all that jazz, written in the
mid-'70s, at

http://ww.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook8404.htm

Here's their blurb:

======

The classic that coined 'Virtual Reality'! Maggie Roche is an unemployed
poet and single mother in 2009. Before the day's done, she is spied on by a
robotic rat, physically attacked, drugged into panic and rapture, seduced,
drawn into conspiracy, then flung four thousand years into her own future.
In the alien world of the Upload Lifeform Lords, who are human-machine
hybrids of overwhelming power, she learns that she is the first true time
traveler in history, hunted by friend and foe. More than her own survival is
at stake--the entire future of the cosmos will be reset by these terrifying
events. Damien Broderick's classic science fiction novel of time travel to
the end of the universe has long been out of print in the USA. First written
in the mid-1970s and published in 1982, The Judas Mandala introduced the
terms 'virtual reality' and 'virtual matrix', and anticipated both Frank
Tipler's influential Omega Point Theory and the cyberpunk fiction of William
Gibson. This revised edition retains these startlingly creative elements,
while bringing the novel firmly into the 21st century ... but not

That last phrase is a teeny bit misleading: the chapter was omitted from the

It is nothing but the axiom of logic that either A equals B, or
A does not equal B; there is no "middle" or third alternative.
It's a mathematical axiom that lots of people like to mistakenly
apply to real-world things where it is utterly irrelevant, as it is
here.  Much the way people misinterpret Godel as saying something
about human knowledge.  It is natural, and tempting, but dangerous,
to take small specific ideas and make them grand theories.

Computer languages are an order of magnitude simpler.  As far as human
languages go, I've tried to learn many, but have never been very successful.
I am fluent only in English and competent in Spanish, but never really
accomplished anything else.

Programming languages, on the other hand, are nothing at all: I've
programmed in 6502 and x86 assembly, BASIC, Forth, Fortran, Pascal,
C, Eiffel, Perl, Python, Java, PHP, and probably a few I've forgotten
about just now, and learning a new one is pretty trivial.

Correcting for the modern Gregorian calendar, the anniversary of

Interestingly, yesterday's rather conservative and religion-biased newspaper
The San Antonio Express-News prominently ran this pro-stem cell research
piece by Tom Dodge on the first page of their Insight section, with a big
carry over on the back page. Dodge's son was badly messed up in a diving
accident:

http://news.mysanantonio.com/story.cfm?xla=saen&xlb=130&xlc=899897

It ends:

====

Weapons of mass destruction is the current mantra around the world. Why
can't there be weapons of mass construction?

Most people do, in fact, support stem cell research, and despite federal
government restrictions, things are happening. California has gone beyond
federal policy by allowing research on embryos created from therapeutic
cloning.

Just a few days ago, Stanford University announced a new effort to develop
human embryonic stem cells through nuclear transfer technology. "Our goal is
to advance science," the medical professor who will direct the program said.
"For any group to stay out of the action and wait for someone else to do it
because of political reasons is wrong."

The Juvenile Diabetes Research foundation announced a campaign recently to
raise $20 million to fund embryonic and adult stem cell research in eight
countries and, with Sweden, laid out $7.5 million for embryonic stem cell
research in that country. The Michael J. Fox Parkinson's Research Foundation
also is supportive.

So there's hope, although in our more cynical moments Lindon and I fear that
the only certain way to end the so-called ethical debate on government
support of stem cell research treatment is some sort of universal
self-interest. We're waiting for studies to show that stem cell research
also prevents aging.

Damien,
       I noticed a paragraph in the article that went, "One of Reagan's White 
House assistants, Michael Deaver, says in the article that when he was told 
that "some conservatives contend that Ronald Reagan would never have approved 
of embryonic stem cell research, he retorted, 'Ronald Reagan didn't have to 
take care of Ronald Reagan for the last 10 years."
       I admire Ronald Reagan greatly and have no idea whether that story is 
accurate or not but it does point out something I regard a a basic 
fundamental fact of human nature -- about the hardest work that exists is to 
change ones ways.  It is very painful and usually doesn't happen until not 
changing becomes more painful.
       If 35% don't support the research then mathematically 65% do support 
it.  The 65% should be able to feel the pain of not changing very easily, the 
other 35% can be educated or gotten around.
       If W can order a good thing to cease by his will, contrary to what the 
majority wants, then that is not the kind of government we want and that can 
be made to change.
Ron h.

Not really. It's more a tour de force, but not a practical solution. The
organs are not yours, and the process, even if viable, is highly damaging.
If you can grow organs from own stem cells in xenohosts you can stage the
prepping for the operation optimally (xenodonors are rarely asked for
consent). In most cases transplantations don't need to be done suddenly,
overnight. There are waiting lists going on for years (a relative of mine
is waiting for a liver; she's been slowly going up to higher and higher
priority so soon there is going to be a donor organ with her name on it).

While it's not fun, you can spend some 5-10 years on dialysis before your
transplant matures. And of course we're now within hailing distance of own
clones with higher cortex functions knocked out raised in sterile pens for
the time you might be needing a spare.

Definitely.

article that when he was told that "some conservatives contend that Ronald
Reagan would never have approved of embryonic stem cell research, he
retorted, 'Ronald Reagan didn't have to take care of Ronald Reagan for the
last 10 years."

This is the profound, yet disturbing, truth of it all.

This might be a good heuristic, but there are two additional snarls:

Have any bureaucracy/state power ever reduced its size without violent
or near-violent upheavals? I have so far not managed to recall any
examples of this. The government apparatus seems to withstand quite
dramatic pounding; even if the leadership is purged the system often
remains and quickly rebounds. This suggests a nasty problem:
bureaucracies tend to grow for a variety of reasons, but if reducing
them demands drastic coercive methods it will be hard to set up a
libertarian system with libertarian means. 

Infotech is both a sword and a shield when it comes to freedom. The PC
and Internet made government information control much harder, and
allowed decentralized alternative solutions. Pattern recognition and
data mining technology helps centralized organisations to sift
information better, enabling better control over citizen speech and
communication. And so on. So far tech development and the surrounding
legal and social development has not been very well connected with each
other. We get new powers to the governments which are not put under
checks and balances, and also new civil powers which are not fitted into
reasonable legal frameworks. 

To some extent this is healthy trial-and-error: we learn as we invent,
and bad laws will be recognized after a while and changed (but possibly
after much pain). What might be worrying is that we encounter a very
stable attractor state during these socio-technological fluctuations
that puts a lot of power to bad uses and prevents the natural shift to a
more human-friendly state. 1984 is one example, unlikely today due to
the technological changes, but other nasty states can surely exist
(AI-supported Chinese-style Internet censorship for example). 

An interesting issue is how to avoid them *well*. Precautionary tales
are one useful source of warnings; essentially they are scenario
planning exercises and sometimes just a warning is enough. But in
accelerating times we need to accelerate the detection of potential
problems, the spread of this knowledge and avoidance behaviors. In
short, we need faster dodges when risky laws are proposed or someone
suggests a great new DRM system that will make everybody happy. It would
also be interesting to see if we could develop a "science of avoidance",
studying the shared properties of this kind of dystopian (or merely
disastrous) problems and help detect them early. Far more humble than
Nick's existential risks, more like applied social science/political
science/law/technology history.

Here's another possible coinage: anyone got anything to say about it?

Human: our basic genotype and phenotype, including extended phenotypic
traits such as culture, language, memetic exchange, tools ... but no
direct modification to our core genotype and phenotype.

Meta-human: us, plus neural prostheses, smart drugs, direct brain
interfaces, early uploading -- any degree of augmentation that gives us
heightened abilities by modifying our core genotype and phenotype, but
not actually deleting original human traits (other than inborn errors
of metabolism that can be corrected in phenotype if necessary).

Post-human: something derived from the meta-human platform that explicitly
omits some of the core human characteristics. (e.g.: it doesn't sleep,
ever, and all the neural circuitry associated with pain has been deleted
and replaced by some strange new damage control subsystem.)

This division seems useful; but clearly "transhuman" is the better
term for the second tier.  Steve's objection to it is empty sophistry.

That's my serious vote also, and sanctioned by usage (however recent and
local).

suggests a nasty problem: bureaucracies tend to grow
for a variety of reasons, but if reducing them demands
drastic coercive methods it will be hard to set up a
libertarian system with libertarian means."

This is a problem which I've thought about some, and
always wanted to hear discussed.  Anders' comment
suggests the problem **starts** with a perceived
degree of intractability comparable to trying to
overturn a law of nature.  "Bureaucracies/governments
are thus and so, have always been so, will always be
so. It cannot be otherwise."  But governments,
constitutions, and laws are constructed by humans, and
logically subject to modification by those same--or
later--humans.

Just as those who wrote the US constitution created
the separation of powers to prevent tyranny, we, two
and a quarter centuries down the road, might apply the
same or a similar principle to slow, stop, and then
reverse the heretofor 'uncontrolled' growth of Govt.

If government bureaucracies as currently structured
tend to grow overlarge, cannot we look at that
structure, find the factors at fault, and propose a
restructuring aimed at improving the situation.

By way of a simple example--just a place to
start--suppose you took a certain large bureaucracy,
and split it in two.  Suppose you gave management a
base salary half the usual amount and then declared
the two in competition with each other.  Whichever
half accomplished the most with the least would then
receive the lions share--say a 90/10 split--of that
half of their compensation that had been set aside at
the outset.  The top management of the losing side
could then be dismissed/demoted, and a new top
management team drawn from the remaining management
pool, and the process repeated. If competition in the
corporate world works, why not try to apply the same
winning principle in the government sphere?

Well, the myth is still true: when Isaac's parent's looked at
the (Julian) calendar the day he was born, it said "December 25".
For most anniversaries I'd say keeping the nominal date is fine,
but for the man who taught us _why_ the Earth revolves around the
sun, perhaps it does make sense to celbrate actual orbit-year
anniversaries.

Another oddity to ponder: Russia didn't switch over to the
Gregorian calendar until after the revolution, so the real
anniversary of the October revolution happens in November.

I had a smallpox vaccination in 1973, but I don't think
they last that long.

Similar arguments have been made with respect to Alzheimer's.  If we don't
solve it -- it may bankrupt the U.S. over the next 20 years.

The brutal truth (and I know I'm going to get called every name in the book
for this) is that we either have to find (a) a cure for long term diseases
that make people unproductive; (b) a cheaper way to care for them; or (c)
when their lives become a severe net drain on society that we put them down
just as we do cats or dogs.

I'm open to other alternatives but those are the only three that I can see
right now.  It makes no sense to devote X% of societies' resources to the
elderly who will never provide a ROI when one could devote X% of societies'
resources to children who will provide an ROI.  The only way out of this
box that I can identify depends on whether devoting Y% of societies' resources
to the problem will make the elderly productive again.

The system as it currently appears to be defined in "first world" countries
is unsustainable.

Very well then, I shall settle for chicken pox, assuming
you have already had it as a child.  Failing that,
I shall fall back to the Shakespearean "a pox upon
your house."  This sounds harmless enough, for I fail
to see why a well built domicile could be damaged in the
least by having a pox settle on the roof.

Merry Christmas, dammit!

"Here's another possible coinage: anyone got anything to say about it?"
______________

Transhuman explicitly states what it is - a human in transition of becoming
posthuman.  There is actually no better way to say it and I'm believe that
the folks who created the term (T.S. Elliot, Damien Broderick, FM-2030), in
their own ways knew what they were talking/writing about.

Being posthuman means that an entity is no longer exclusively human and
becomes another type of being.  There is no evidence that the posthuman
will not share some form of genetic makeup with the human - in some form or
matter.  It is my understanding, and I have written about this at length,
that we do not know what a posthuman will be in light of the many
scientific, technological, engineering and cultural changes that can and
shall take place over the next hundreds of years.

Steve believes he is a posthuman today.  This is his choice.

If anyone would like to debate the meaning of transhuman, let's set up a
time to debate it.  If only Steve has a difference of opinoion, I see no
need to take it further.

Best,

Natasha

       To the extent you have offered us a model for health care I seem to 
sense an underlying assumption that society is going to pay for each 
individuals health care.  
       I believe that to be a faulty assumption to base a national health 
policy upon.  If you look back to 1993 or there abouts when Hillary was 
pushing her health care plan ABC introduced her plan with a program either 
put on by Nightline or that preempted Nightline.  It ran for about 90 minutes 
and included one person that spoke against her plan -- a scared student from 
the University of Chicago with libertarian leanings. <G> -- otherwise every 
speaker I can remember was heavily behind her plan.
       One of the speakers or commentators was ABC's medical correspondent 
(is Dr. Johnson the proper name, they still use the same guy ASAIK)  He made 
a revealing comment.  He said that there were five components to our health 
care system -- the patients, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, insurance 
companies and I believe the attorneys.  He said that Hillary's system was 
designed to provide the funding for all five components.
       I think if you reworked your assumptions with two changes you might 
not come to the same conclusions.  I suggest two different assumptions.  
First that we will not pay for any health care as a nation, state or 
municipality except where there is an existing contractural obligation to do 
so.  Second that we rewrite our tax code to allow everyone to deduct all of 
their health insurance and health expenses just a when companies provide 
insurance to us.
       Please note that my assumptions both gives and takes away.  The 
government loses an expense but it also it loses a source of income.
       As I am 68 Y.O. let me also remind you of one unpleasant but 
unavoidable fact.  Eventually all of us come to the point that no amount of 
medical care will save our lives whether we be everyman, wealthy businessman, 
President, King or Pope -- get used to it.  Most of the elderly have done so 
long since.

Lee, when you destroyed my illusions about our saviour
Sir Isaac Newton having been born on 25 December I was
completely shattered.

However as I think it over, it comes as quite a
relief.  We all know that kids who are born on or
near christmas are ripped off: their birthdays are
often neglected or forgotten in the competition with
the holiday season.  The other kids get showered with
gifts *twice* each year, whereas the winter solstice
birthdays, well...

Suffice it to say many christmas babies develop a
complex, a deep seated desire to exact terrible
revenge upon the world.  Most of the world's dictators
and despots were born in late December, you know.

Hoerkhiemer Christ and his twin brother Jesus were two
such examples of Christmas babies.  The pent-up
rage boiled over one day, resulting in that ugly little
incident at the temple, where the moneychanger's tables
were overturned.  See Matthew 21:12 and Mark 11:15.
Hoerkheimer was clearly having a case of Messiah syndrome.
History tells us he was mistaken for his much more laid
back twin brother, who was back at the carpentry shop
peacefully carving crucifixes during the whole riot.

I would hate to think Sir Isaac suffered so, going
on to invent calculus just to inflict bitter pain and
agony upon future generations of young scholars,
just because he failed to cash in on the toys every
year.  spike

Hello, everybody!

I am back home after traveling incommunicado for a while.  I really hated to
miss speaking at the Alcor conference, but I really needed the business!  I
trust it went well and hope that someone will fill me in on the details.
The business leads I encountered in the past month might lead me into
further global travels.  I will know in a few weeks.  Hopefully I will be
able to arrange world-wide access to the Internet next time.

Either way, I'm afraid that I will be too busy to be on the ExI Board of
Directors, or to maintain the FAQ or the Community Forum on Yahoo as I did
before.  I will be participating in this and other forums, but in an
unofficial capacity from now on.  Since I am not representing any
organization, I will feel more free to speak my mind, while also feeling
less obligation to do so.

I am currently facing:  a death in the family this week, my 40th birthday in
a few months, a slowdown in my business ventures, a pseudo mid-life crisis,
a questioning that progress is occurring as rapidly as predicted, increased
government and Big Brother, and a real fear that the more things change the
more they stay the same.

Anyway, I'm back and ready to continue.  The same as it ever was...

Hiya Spike....been a while huh?  I still don't have a good (mobile) internet 
connection anymore.  Howsomever I DO have a stationary one (I now Have A 
LIFE...tadaaaaa.)complete with wife (to be)...house (and 
mortage)...cat...polyester half-dog....etc....you know....like real people.

It's just that I'm normally only home one day a week....or two days a 
month.....or less....(not much time to be online....other stuff to do)

But the deal is.....for about the last year or so I've been involved with 
wind turbines.  Lessee....Ive hauled about...50 windturbine tower 
sections....on four different projects..(walulah Wa, King Mt. Tx. Cabazon Ca. 
Clear Lake Ia.)..wind farms they call em...(except for the texas ones....it's 
a wind RANCH)

Check out the American Wind Energy Association's web site for some idea of 
the SIZE of these mothers.  (.6 megawatt is a small one.....the last few I 
hauled were over a megawatt each)...(it's Danish Tech by the way....)

So anyway....this is billed as "Green" energy.

Use this wind generated electricity to electrolysize water....pump this H2 
thru out the US in a "back bone" (big pipeline)....(analogous to an internet 
backbone) to be used when the wind don't blow......

viola.....Hydrogen Economy...

Hardly any polluttion....totally recyclable.....and lots of work for us 
truckers.....


And then I hear Jeremy Rifkin assosiated with it......eyeeeeeeeewwwww.

You can imagine my dismay....

The sixties were about nine years long: from 1963 or maybe 1964 to around
1972.

It seemed longer at the time.

spike66 asked,
> What were the sixties about?

The sixties were very much a transhumanist movement before today's version.
It was not technology-based, but was idea based.  Radical new ideas
abounded.  One idea was that one could let one's hair grow as long as you
wanted and that you could look the way you wanted.  Everyone could choose
for themselves.  Another idea was that you could love whomever you wanted
and that old rigid social systems should be abolished.  Again, people could
choose for themselves.  Another was that there might be new ways of
thinking.  Political theories, social theories, new-age theories, new
artistic movements, new musical movements, even new drug movements, all
involved new ways of thinking.

A whole generation woke up and decided that if they didn't like the way
things were that they could change the world.  There was no reason to grow
up in a stereotyped world to become stereotyped people.  Every individual
was allowed to choose for themselves what they would become, what they would
look like, how they would act, and how they would associate with others.
Old rules about race, religion, morality, expectations, traditions, and
habits were tossed out on their ear.  Everybody tried to figure out what
they would do if they were designing the whole world from scratch.  New art
forms appeared, new music appeared, new fashion styles appeared, new drugs
appeared, new family groups and relationships appeared, new political
theories appeared, new religions appeared, new causes appeared, anything
that could be tried was tried.

The whole "New Age" movement was based on the idea that we were no longer
limited by history and the way things were.  We had enough knowledge and
capability to remake the whole world, including ourselves, into any image we
desired.  A million different versions of remaking the New Age appeared.
Religions, drugs, ecology, free-love, and politics were just some of the
tools used to try to remake the world.  Everybody tried to invent their own
version of utopia and convince every one else to transcend previous
limitations to become something new.

It sounded very much like the stuff I hear on this list.  I think the
current transhumanist movement is really just an echo of the sixties.  We
are just using more technology in today's version.  Super-technology isn't
the real driving force behind transhumanism.  The real explosion of
transhumanism occurred as soon as whole masses had enough to eat that they
could spend most of their time thinking about themselves and the world
instead of merely struggling to stay alive.  Pure thought and planning
toward self-transformation are the real keys to transhumanism, not
technology.  We may have discarded a lot of sixties ideas that didn't seem
to be productive, but the main goal of self-determination and
self-transformation were the same.

This is part of the reason I do not see progress being as rapid as some
people imagine.  The roots of our movement go back a lot farther than people
imagine.  As such, they were not as rapidly successful as people think, and
they are not producing as much as people predicted.  I expect the results of
our current efforts to be similar to the results of the sixties.  There will
be a million different radical new ideas tried.  And most of them will fall
by the wayside as quaint anachronisms by the future.  Only a few of them
will survive and become commonplace.  And positioned against the larger
backdrop of history, they won't seem as radical or as new as we expected.  I
think we have already lived through many "singularities" and many stages of
ever-accelerating technology without realizing it.

EvMick -- I, like spike, am happy to see you back.

I am happy to see you dealing with Wind Farms -- it seems
silly to be having all of that energy going to waste.

You should not fear Rifkin -- he can be an ally if he happens
to be pushing us in the direction of a hydrogen economy.

My analysis thus far seems to suggest we cannot go directly
from a heavy hydrocarbon (e.g. diesel & gasoline) to a H2
economy.  This is largely due to the fact that it appears
we would have to build a completely new H2 distribution
system.  There is a problem is due to the fact that H2 is
most likely not compatible with existing pipelines.  It is a
very small molecule and can penetrate metals and alter their
properties (potentially leading to leakage, explosions) etc.

[This is based on what I have read -- if someone knows
this to be incorrect, please correct me.]

The cost estimate I've seen for a U.S. H2 distribution
system is $100 Billion+.  It ain't going to happen without
a market for the H2 (which doesn't exist currently).

The route I think may work is if we evolve from
   "heavy hydrocarbon" -> methane -> H2.
One uses the existing pipeline system to transport the
methane and then one converts it into H2 at the fuel
station or within the vehicle or home.  Eventually,
once the demand for raw H2 is developed, that may justify
the production of an H2 distribution system (be it trucks
or pipelines).

It is a "sustainable" system [unlike the current heavy
hydrocarbon system] if you are producing the methane
in solar ponds.  (I.e. Atmospheric CO2 -> solar pond CH4 ->
pipeline -> H2 + presumably Atmospheric CO2).  To do
this requires the engineering of bacteria (or other technologies)
that are very efficient at some of these conversion processes.

So one can imagine fields of solar ponds with bacteria
producing methane with EvMick's windmills producing
power over them.  A much nicer combined use of resources
(solar and wind power).

This reduces the cost significantly because one pumps
windmill produced electricity into the existing electrical
grid and pumps solar pond produced methane into the existing
natural gas pipelines.  It is all a question of *how* do
we leverage the existing infrastructure into an alternate
energy system?

Spike,
       Start with the 50s generation with me.  That was my generation.  We 
were born in the great depression, came to boy or girl hood with the WW2 and 
all our seniors off at war.  Then when young adulthood rolled aroung there 
was Korea.
       We had the long hair movement in the late 40s.  We had dope, liquor, 
sex and all the other stuff.  But, basically we seemed to feel that if you 
had the opposite sex, cars to drive and a job to pay for it all things 
weren't too bad.  Supposing of course that no one was shooting at you.
       I have been told that if pushed we were a deadly generation.  We had 
seen depression, war and even fought one ourselves so we knew there were bad 
guys in the world and the best way to handle them was to get rid of them 
fast.  We had read the stories of Hitlers beginnings and saw no reason to 
give a 2nd Hitler a head start.
       Then along came the 60s generation.  As far as I could tell nothing 
was going on that hadn't been happening all along.  Science & Technology were 
constantly turning up a marvel of the week but then they always had.  Liquor 
and dope were available but that wasn't new.  Each generation invents sex all 
over again and believes they have discovered something no one else ever found 
out about.  The philosophys that were going around all seemed to be retreads 
from the 19th century.
       It seemed like they were going inside themselves individually and as a 
generation to invent this brand new world.  But, it wasn't new.
       So, what can be said good about them?  Like all generations they were 
young and they had some fun.

Yes, being based on humans there is a potential
flexibility and arbitrariness in their structure. In
principle they could be disbanded by just saying "you
don't exist". But in practice a bureaucracy is almost a
homeostatic entity, where the decisions of its "cells"
(made out of self-interest mixed with varying degrees of
faith in what they are doing is a good thing that should
be done). This makes such structures resist change with 
great ingenuity and ferocity. 

So while it is physically feasible for the government to
say "you're disbanded!" to an unnecessary piece of flab, 
it is usually not politically and administratively 
feasible - suddenly lawyers, experts and forgotten 
protocols emerge from the woodwork. In your competition 
example, just imagine the legal cases that would 
suddenly swamp you.

Hmm, how does your constitution help you here? Mind you,
I think your consitution is a wonderful document and

Sure. I think the libertarian approach has much to offer 
here. We need some buraucracy for some things, but it is 
risky and has to be kept under control. Public choice 
theory shows some of the economics of this. One way to 
keep it in check is to reduce the incentives of growth, 
to set up funding and organisation so that it is not 
desirable for any office to grow beyond just what is 
needed - ideally it should shrink if it could. Generally 
setting up strong economic constraints on government 
might be very helpful.

Yes.  What a mind-blowingly good post.  Right on,
Harvey.  

When spike first asked the question I did the math. 
2002-40=1962.  Which means that Harvey was either a
very precocious--culturally and philosophically
sophisticated--kid, or a damn fine student of
culture/people/history.  (No doubt both.)  

Awesomely impressive.

Welcome back, Harvey.

Best, Jeff Davis

Ron -- at least in Europe I think that is the "reality" (Europeans

I consider it to be a somewhat accurate assumption -- i.e. society
pays for Medicare but does not currently pay for drugs.

You will not get an argument from me on this, but I can see reasons

Providing funding to the attorneys seems counterproductive.

Ok, I'm open to that -- but it seems to only reduce private health care

Ron, your note is revealing.  And so if one values the net worth of every
person, it seems like cryonics is the only reasonable long term survival
option (based on, for example, Ralph Merkle's Pascal's wager type arguments)
should not a government (in conjunction with an individual) have the option
of "suspending" that life.  I.e. the government has the freedom of suspending
the expense (esp. medical) of "maintaining" the individual and the individual
has the freedom to "suspend" themselves until better technologies become
available to recover themselves (given the open question of whether when
one is "too far gone" (one of my grandmothers probably met this "criteria")
one can never be recovered [excepting the simulation possibilities I have
recently discussed].)

These types of questions, it would seem, raise some very thorny issues
in all "1st world" societies.

It would seem that the interesting question is "Do we not each have
a fundamental right to 'self-preservation'?".  It would be interesting
to go through the U.N. declaration of fundamental human rights and see
whether or not it supports this question.  If so then it would be grounds
for revoking many anti-suicide laws (provided the suicide was conducted
so as to preserve oneself).  Furthermore, it is a very different situation
if a government "puts an individual down" with preservation in mind or
elimination in mind (this is a legal nightmare I am sure).

That's a great idea.

I have had an idea along similar lines.  At each level
in the federal bureaucracy, a manager is required to
give up 1/5 of his or her direct reports.  That is,
he must reduce the number of groups that report to
him by 20 percent.  So even the President (in the
U.S.) would have to give up one in five departments.

All the individuals in the sacrificed department or
group would also be required to return to the private
sector.

(Now 20 percent isn't so bad; one might expect in
war time that the typical bureaucrat might have
to fare far worse.)

If you are familiar with what happens to the fraction
4/5 when raised to the nth power, where n is the number
of levels in the bureaucracy, then you'll see the
incomparable efficacy of my scheme!

Well, I wasn't there, but if you want to know how the sixties look from 
the perspective of today's average youth, like myself...

In the 1950s the GI Bill passed, permitting millions of young men who'd 
fought in WWII to go to college, what had previously been a rare and 
treasured privilege, now available to the masses for the first time. 
Everyone was happy.  For one generation.

They were happy, for that one generation, because something they'd come to 
see as the privilege of the best was now available to them.  The problem 
came in the next generation, when all those college-educated parents, 
riding on the boom of the 50s, tried to send their children to college as 
well.  Rather than being a privilege, college had become a necessity. 
That's a fundamental transition, and in this case, not a good one.  The 
function of college slowly ceased to be providing knowledge of which 
degrees were the mere outward indicator, and began to become the provision 
of the degrees that were required for jobs.  For the students, college was 
a dreary grind rather than a rare privilege; they were going there not to 
learn, or even to become part of the aristocracy, but to get an 
unremarkable but necessary piece of parchment.

Where the fifties GIs going to college had cause to regard themselves as 
going somewhere, the sixties generation of college-goers were in an 
extended kind of high school, marking time before they were allowed to be 
real adults.

Somewhere in the brains of all those young adults, a little switch 
flipped.  It was the little switch that said:  "I'm physiologically an 
adult, and yet I'm still being kept down.  It must be time to rebel and 
overthrow the tribal chief."

What mapped to that emotional concept of "tribal chief" was their parents 
(of course); the college teachers; the government; the System; the 
Establishment; critical thinking; self-control.  It was a revolution in 
the best traditions of Rousseau, rather than Locke; thankfully only 
powerless junior adults were involved, so we didn't have the kind of 
bloodbath that characterized the French Revolution.

The revolution failed.  As evolutionary psychology had dictated their 
original revolution, so too it dictated the aftermath.  The baby boomers 
got jobs, felt themselves to have a social position in society, and 
decided that this must be adulthood.  To this day, a large fraction of 
baby boomers - I don't know whether it's a majority - still aren't sure, 
on some inner level, that they're adults; they feel they've been faking 
everything since sixth grade.  I doubt that Vietnam veterans feel that 
way, having handled the kind of crisis that leaves adulthood in its wake; 
but there were never anywhere near as many Vietnam veterans as WWII 
veterans.  The baby boomer generation as a whole, I think, never really 
grew up.  Adulthood was what they wanted in the sixties.  When they 
finally got out of college they invested a tremendous amount of emotional 
energy in convincing themselves they were adults; it was their turn now, 
they were finally in charge.  Well... it's an interesting theory, and I 
wish them good luck with their mid-life crises.

As part of convincing themselves they were adults, the baby boomers lashed 
out at their own memories of youth, the same way that as teenagers they 
had lashed out at the System.  I would say that they failed to get 
anywhere with their idealism because they abandoned rationality, 
self-discipline, critical thinking, the study of history, and realistic 
assessment of the probable impact of any given strategy.  But it's a lot 
easier - and a lot more human - to say, "This idealism stuff is all 
youthful folly; it's inevitable, really, when you're young; but now I've 
given up ideals, so I must be adult."

It is easier to lose faith in idealism than to admit you were incompetent. 
  It is easier to say that stupidity is an unavoidable consequence of 
youth than to admit personal responsibility for being stupid.  Most of the 
baby boom generation is likely sneer at anything that smacks of idealism 
because that's part of how they've chosen to convince themselves they're 
finally adults.  I can see the disaster, but aside from teaching the next 
generation evolutionary psychology, I don't see much that can be done to 
fix it.

Robert,
       I haven't calculated that effect and won't so lets accept your number. 
 But, having accepted your calculation lets look a little further.  I have 
read serious contention that health care rises at roughly 15% per year and 
that a major reason for that is that no one has an immediate interest in 
keeping the costs in line.  It was for that reason that I quoted Dr. Timothy 
Johnson, "He said that there were five components to our health care system 
-- the patients, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies and I 
believe the attorneys.  He said that Hillary's system was designed to provide 
the funding for all five components."  I cannot pull up the quotation 
verbatim but somehow he left the distinct impression that it was intended to 
remove the rationing restraints on all five components
       The contention is that if you were to pay all your health care costs 
directly you would be very concerned with cost and costs would soon rise not 
15% per year but would equal the rest of the cost of living increase.  For 
years we had no government health insurance and cost increases stayed much 
lower -- they took off as soon as government assistance was available.
       Let me give an example.  Did you notice I weasel worded what I said 
before in the last email?  I said, "First, that we will not pay for any 
health care as a nation, state or municipality except where there is an 
existing contractual obligation to do
so."  Once upon a time this country held a war and I volunteered in exchange 
of their promise for a GI bill.  For four and a half years I did what they 
told me and in turn they have delivered on their promise inre the GI bill.  I 
take full advantage of the medical services they promised.  However that 
system is set up as a co-pay system and it has just enough bite to make us 
treat the system as if everything was on our nickel.  
       BTW, also when I was younger I found out a way to guarentee a 
retirement home for me and my wife -- I don't have one.  I used to do charity 
work in retirement homes every Sunday and I am astounded how good this one 
is.  I have my own home and prefer living here but it is nice to know I have 
the other as a safety net.
       My point is this: look around while you are still young, a little 
planning goes a long way.

> What were the sixties about?

"The closed operational universe of advanced industrial civilisation
with its terrifying harmony of freedom and oppression,
productivity and destruction, growth and regression is pre-designed
in this idea of Reason as a specific historical project.
The technological and the pre-technological stages share certain
basic concepts of man and nature which express the continuity
of the Western tradition. Within this continuum, different modes of thought
clash with each other; they belong to different ways of apprehending,
organising, changing society and nature. The stabilising tendencies
conflict with the subversive elements of Reason, the power of positive
with that of negative thinking, until the achievements of advanced
industrial
civilisation lead to the triumph of the one-dimensional reality
over all contradiction."

Alas! 

C.K. Raju, PhD, in 'Calculus, Mathematics, and Astronomy in Medieval 
India' (History of Science in India from 15th c. to 20th c., volume
commissioned by PHISPC) writes that calculus was anticipated in India. 
It was transmitted from India to Europe through the 'calendrical 
manuscripts' imported into Europe (and then translated!) in connection 
with the European issue of navigation, and the calendar reform of 1582. 

See also something here:
http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_raju_monsoon.htm

I doubt they (in India) knew everything about gravitation and astronomy. 
Even if - according to Dr. Kac http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9804020 -
they already knew much about the speed of light (in vacuum) and cosmology.

Hari-Krishna. Hari-Hari.

s.

<<That gravity should be innate inherent & essential to matter 
so yt one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum
wthout the mediation of any thing else by & through wch 
their action or force may be conveyed from one to another 
is to me so great an absurdity that I beleive no man 
who has in philosophical matters any competent faculty of thinking 
can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting
constantly according to certain laws, but whether this agent 
be material or immaterial is a question I have left to ye consideration 
of my readers.>>

Having grown up in the 60s*, I've thought about this question a lot.
[* I was 13 in 1970, but had an older brother with whom I tagged along
into some of the core experiences people associate with "the 60s."
Also, as Damien B points out, "the 60s" really didn't begin until 1962-4
or so and didn't end until some time in the early- to mid-70s.]

[snip the rest of Harvey's very good post ...]

I think Harvey's right on with his observations.  There's also a lot of
truth in Ron h.'s and Eliezer's posts, as well.  I'll share some more or
less random thoughts with their posts in mind.

First, as Ron h. points out, many of the ideas and social trends that
people identify with "the 60s" had their roots much earlier.  I often
get into deep woolgathering following the strands back in time.  The
most obvious and immediate precursors of what many people think of as
the phenomena of "the 60s" were the "Beats," who I've spent a lot of
time studying (and perhaps too much of my late teens and early twenties
trying to emulate).  If you really want to understand the 60s in
America, at least, you have to understand Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsberg
and "Dean Moriarity" and their crowd.  You have to read "On the Road"
and "Gravity's Rainbow" and listen to Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie
and Thelonius Monk and take long road trips across the desert.  If you
can do all that in a 1953 Oldsmobile, all the better.

Another thread you have to pick up is Tim Leary and Aldous Huxley.  You
can read "The Doors of Perception" and "Be Here Now" and "Flashbacks"
and "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test," but a lot of what was going on by
1966 or so will be opaque to you if you don't actually "walk with the
king."  'nuff said.

These threads weave back in time through the loom of the second World
War into the wanderings of "the Lost Generation," and the earlier fabric
of the first World War.  You need to read "The Razor's Edge" and "A
Moveable Feast" and imagine the mind-smashing insanity of the trenches
and the flower of a generation ground into the mud of the Ardennes.  In
that era you have to feel the energy of the cubists and revolution of
"Finnegan's Wake" and "the Hollow Men," and know that this is the way
the world ends, this is the way the world ends.  And you have to ride
with Vladimir Illich on the sealed train into the cold of a Russian
winter with a burning ideal that can smash the past with science,
science, science and feel the stirrings of hope in the hearts of recent
American immigrants, new intellectuals with the vision of a utopia built
upon the bones of the czars and sing the Internationale in a hundred
tongues and ten million voices and all of this before the gulags, before
the butcher, before the cold set back in, in the shadow of Hiroshima . .
.

Oops, sorry, that desert road trip rhythm got back into my fingers ...
So, where was I?  Oh yes ...

So Eliezer's right, that the 1960s were (almost) the second generation
after the GI Bill college kids (really a second memetic, but not quite a
second genetic generation).  By then the West had had 150 years of
"modernism" and the concept of "the modern" had become the ground of
being, had seeped into every nook and cranny of culture.  Pour into that
mix an exploding ideology of "cognitive liberty" with a chemical tool
kit for actually reaching some of the basic neurotransmitter pathways in
the brain, along with a set of memetic tools to play with -- free verse,
abstract expressionist painting, be-bop jazz, syncretistic
cross-culturalism -- and you got an expanding wavefront passing through
a generation in adolescence just at the time that the birth control pill
was becoming commonplace.  Now vibrate the mixture with the new
synthesis of jazz, blues and hillbilly music that found a beat and
rhythm that perfectly catalyzed the mixture and -- BOOM -- SEX, DRUGS
and ROCK N'ROLL ...

Which all got too confusing and of course couldn't really make sense
when there were so many painful distractions: A western intelligentsia
that couldn't shake the romance of Marxism; a war that was fought in a
bizarre compromised way with the wrong tactics and muddied rationales;
an industrial technology that was still in the last part of its first
phases, and therefore dirty and ugly and dehumanizing, just to name a
few.  Huxley's famous "summit meeting" with Leary before the former
finally died, in which he urged caution so that the real potential of
the new mind-drugs could be developed before they were poured out into
the world was a failure.  By 1975 the fireworks show had turned into a
confusing conflagration and people were scared and tired.  And anyway,
you have to come down from the mountain eventually.  The freedom
marchers had done everything they could do and now the hard work of
assimilation and learning long-term fairness was there in front of us
and there weren't any clear voices about how to do that work.

But then, that's just one trajectory through the '60s.  There were
others.  There was Selma and King and George C. Wallace.  There were the
Beach Boys and Jan and Dean and the smell of leaded gasoline being
burned very fast in a 427 or a Hemi.  And that's just America.  In
France there was the summer of 1968, and in Czechoslovakia there was the
Prague Spring.  Oh, and then there was Gagarin and Glenn and Armstrong
and One Small Step, above it all and, sadly, somehow disconnected from
it all.

So, spike, what was your question?  Oh, yes ...

I very much agree with Harvey that transhumanism can claim to be the
legitimate descendant of much of what was best about "the 60s" -- the
adventurism, the energy, the ideals of ultimate liberty and exploration.
But that's a post for another day, I think ...

Thats two words.  But good ones.  {8^D

I had fun in the 60s but I fear it wasnt the

at the time there was a revolution going on.  spike

As Robin Williams said, if you remember the sixties, you weren't
really there.

For me, the sixties were about NASA, culminating with my fondest
memory of childhood: watching Neil Armstrong flub his one line in
front of the biggest audience in history.  But then, I was a geek
from birth.  My older cousins were into sex and drugs and stuff,
or at least the Southern Baptist equivalents (dancing and beer).

Greg, as they used to say.  I saw it from the standpoint of what was going on 
in the University engineering depts.  The challenge of the studies and the 
excitement of the new world coming over the horizon -- the moon, underseas 
mining, automation in manufacturing to mention only a few.  Then during the 
same decade the excitement of my first engineering job, grad school at night, 
the raises and the promotions.
       Then I would look over and see how LBJ had totally betrayed his 
supporters with his machinations to start the Vietnamese war -- okay, to 
enlarge it.  I had studied war enough to see that LBJ & flunkies were totally 
screwing things up.  
       As far as I could see the only good thing happening socially was the 
break down of segregation.

__________________________

I grew up in the 1950s, but lived in the 1960s - was a teenager and a
radical.  I remember the 60s very well - like my own breath on a chilly
night - cold, crisp, refreshing, visual and real.

I appreciated Harvey's post very much because it brought memories that I
could touch, but I cringed at Eli's post, not because it was untrue or
opened old wounds, but because it was filled with disdain and looked at
only one part of an era, rather than the whole.

The 60s saw the most spectacular technical achievement of the 20th Century
when man landed on the moon in July 1969.  The 1960s also realized civil
rights, birth control pill, disco, Pop Art, Motown. Seeing my closest
friends go to Vietnam was horrific - seeing others flee the country was
understood.

I loved the 1960s for my own maturation as a woman.  Being part of the the
60s movement helped carve my nature.  Seeing Martin Luther King and being
in Memphis when he was assassinated was paramount to my views on freedom
and civil rights.  Being a beauty queen and socialite gave me a sense of
grace, and leaving the south to live with the Navajo Indians gave me
courage.  Like many people who were a vital part of the 1960s, my
philosophy as a futurist was realized and developed because I was a part of
the 1960s - an era that I shall always hold as radical, insightful and
carrying much of the foolish and irrational of being human, but attempting
to reach beyond human restraints.  Let it be rememberd as one of the
beginnings of transhumanity.

Dear friends one and all,
       In this thread about the 60s I admit to being a member of the 50s 
generation.  I had forgotten reading Jack Kerouac, listening to Thelonious 
Monk, and the beat jokes.
Did you hear about the Beat that saw a man drowning?
The Beat yelled to the guy, 'Swim man swim.'
The fellow yelled back, 'I can't swim.'
'Then fake it man, fake it.'

       Come to think of it, it is no wonder those jokes died out.  LOL

But now that you have reminded me please let me wish everyone 
a cool yule and a frantic first.

If you have been doing "whole genome engineering" on the side, I'd

My Dad worked at NASA.  I remember watching the moon landing on television.
My Dad was yelling at the TV when the astronauts were bouncing around and
generally ignoring safety procedures they had practices over and over on
earth.  He also told me internal stories that never reached the press.  For
example, how they broke off the ignition button inside the capsule and
delayed stepping outside until they could jury-rig a method to blast off in
a hurry if they got into trouble.

My other memories from that period were the old space exploration schedules.
We were supposed to have a permanent moon base in the 1970s and a Mars base
in the 1980s.  By 1990, we were supposed to be exploring asteroids and maybe
reaching Jupiter.  It was not for no reason that the movie 2001 showed us
going to Jupiter by now.  NASA had predicted it, congress was planning to
keep approving these budgets.  I really thought that by now I would be off
planet with multiple different worlds to choose from.  I am not joking.  I
really thought I was living in the space age, only to be stuck on earth with
no way off.  I really feel marooned in a non-technical world compared to
what was predicted.  This is probably the biggest basis for my belief that
things don't always progress as fast as predicted.

Lord, I cannot believe that I'm a year older than Greg Burch
(no offense Greg).  It must be that he seems so much more
educated than I (as his speeches and eloquent post demonstrate).

*But* he did miss some essential aspects of the "60s".

The 60s began with the Beatles.  It was a "new" kind of music
(though derived from the likes of Elvis and Buddy Holley in the
late '50s.)  The peak of the '60s was clearly Woodstock with
people like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead and the Doors
(esp. Jim Morrison) were redefining how we thought about the
central issue of the day (the Vietnam War).  The '60s ended
with the "rock opera", esp. Tommy (from The Who) and Jesus
Christ Superstar (Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber), good
hard rock (e.g. Grand Funk Railroad), pop (Three Dog Night)
and was dead when disco (e.g. Saturday Night Fever) arrived.

To view an era, a good window is its music.

The basic idea is the same:
   "We can do better than this."

The only difference between now and the '60s is that we know what the
technologies are (biotechnology and nanotechnology) that really can
accomplish this.  Unlike back in the '60s when we only had nuclear
weapons, missles, primitive integrated circuits and a lot of motivated
people (enough to get us to the moon).

The young people on the list should really study how far we have come.
I haven't looked for the numbers but I suspect the average hand held
computer, perhaps even the average cell phone, has more CPU power than
the Apollo command module.

Why can't we do better than this?  (e.g. a pandemic orphaning millions
of children in Africa).

Why?

Robert

Is this our own Mr. Reason (reason@exratio.com)who
posts occasionally to extropians?  Was Reason writing
about ideas way back in 1964?  So what is this idea
of Reason?

My failure to grok Marcuse might be a vocabulary thing.

I read Kerouac's On the Road, which I really liked, and
Visions of Cody, The Dharma Bums and so on, but I was
definitely over my head when I hit Dr. Sax and the later
fantasy stuff.

I may attempt to translate Kerouac into a simplified
vocabulary, such as Newspeak.  Consider the following
passage (page 172 of On the Road, Penguin paperback)
and its translation:

Kerouac:  I walked around picking up butts from the
street.  I passed a fish-'n-chips joint on Market Street,
and suddenly the woman in there gave me a terrified look
as I passed; she was the proprietress, she apparently
thought I was coming there with a gun to hold up the
joint.  I walked on a few feet.  It suddenly occurred
to me this was my mother of about two hundred years
ago in England, that I was her foodpad son, returning
from gaol to haunt her honest labors in the hashery...

Newspeak:  Subject collected refuse tobacco.  Subject
arrived at sea creature and starch root merchant
at GPS coordinates 37.4912 North 126.4783 West.
Female attendant appeared apprehensive.  Female
attendant feared subject possessed firearm, feared
subject desired to obtain currency by non-legal
procedure.  Subject proceeded.  Subject underwent
mental activity indicating female attendant equals
maternal relative, time interval -6.14E9 seconds,
GPS coordinates 43 degrees North, 4 degrees West.
Subject equals male offspring engaged in unlegal
activity returning from correctional institution
for purposes of uncooperation with female attendant's
efforts to produce in form adequate for exchange of
currency sea creatures and starch roots.

Y'all are making me feel ancient.  :-)  I was sweet and terribly 
naive 16 in 1970.  I had read Leary, Huxley, Alan Watts.  I had 
spend the last several years with the horror of Vietnam, 
political assasinations, MAD being formative factors in my 
consiciousness.  By 16 I had decided to look inward for some 
years and to attempt to find those who were doing likewise.  I 
was persuaded that only a shift of consciousness could really 
make a difference.  The last thing I wanted was to go 
immediately to college and have my math gifts feed the machine 
whose products seemed to me then to be so terrible.

Hardly.  This utterly misses the atmosphere of new beginnings, 
inquiry outside the boundaries of yesteryear, a sense of 
personal responsibility for whatever comes next and so on that 
were ate the very heart of the 60s.  The music was an outgrowth 
of that heart and one expression of it.  It was certainly not 
the essence.

I think we have forgotten the part about the importance of a 
"change of mind" though.

And yet our culture is, if anything, more filed with emptiness 
and hype than it was then.  I doubt that that is lost on the 
young today either.

Because our actual working priorities are caught up in a race to 
make money faster than our governments can confiscate it?  Our 
priorities seem (still) more about power, relative prestige, 
amassing wealth among assumed and or create scarcity, violent 
defense of "ours" and a relative low priority on maximizing the 
well-being of all people or even our own.  Can it be different? 
  Some days I think so.  Other days I confess to not being so sure.

Compared to today's status quo across all generations, it was a 
wonderful if rather massively chaotic time.  Less gelled out of 
it that was hoped by many.

What utter hogwash.  Only the most willfully blind wouldn't
recognize that our culture has advanced remarkably as well.
When I was born, it was still illegal for whites and blacks to
marry; Politicians could be openly segregationist.  Women were
openly excluded from colleges and a lot of professions, and were
only beginning to break into politics.  Homosexuality wasn't
even discussed in polite company, and the arrests didn't make
the news.  Police didn't bother tracking down deadbeat fathers--
that was just part of life, as were drunk driving accidents.
Hotels and condo associations could and did exclude jews.
The strict father, friendly uncle, and local priest were never
suspected of any wrongdoing--a child with bruises or emotional
problems was just accident prone or introverted.  Rape was
tolerated against wives and women with reputations.  Women had
no reproductive choices--the pill wasn't available yet, and
condoms and abortions were only available in back alleys and
were things only prostitutes knew about.

Now tell me again how today's culture is "empty" compared to that.

Yeah, you were too young.  I was square in the middle of
it, but deeply alienated from the alienated.  So I never
understood all those things that Greg Burch so eloquently
refers to.  Unlike most university students at the time,
I also had a rich life---well, rich to me---outside the
narrow confines of just people my own age, and I was
 well-integrated into a community of about 100,000 people.
When my university friends told me in  1969 that a
revolution was about to occur, I just laughed; they
didn't have a finger on the pulse of an entire large
American community the way I did.

I agree with Eliezer's analysis, except I'm confused about
the role of idealism in extropian thinking.  Somehow,
as is evidenced by its appeal to people of all ages, our
own revolutionary beliefs seem based on different psychological
motives.  Therefore, I'm unsure about Harvey's contention that
our futurismo views are a continuation of the best part of the
sixties.  Maybe it depends on your coordinate system.

I was deeply affected by the sixties, and what was happening
to students especially, but not in any good way.  The greatest
harm perhaps was that I took my studies so much less seriously
than I might have in the eighties.  All the traditional values
were being questioned, and taking school seriously was one of
them.  But some people, I don't know how, managed to imbibe
fully the intoxicating atmosphere with no damage to their
careers.

So while I was there physically, I missed the spirit of the
thing entirely.  It didn't appeal to me at all, and now I
view it as rather destructive on the whole.  I guess you
had to be there, Spike, but in the deepest most positive
sense, I didn't experience it any more than you did.

	What would they be competing to do?  Someone once said "Thank

	The problem isn't with the number of people.  It's with how much
power they have.  Still this idea might work to reduce government's
effective power in that there would be fewer of them to oppress us.  It
would be de facto freedom instead of de jure freedom.  God help you when
they caught up with you, though, since they would be very good at what
they do.

	I'm not sure if I want my government to be better at what does
since it seems hell bent on making this nation less free.  The only real
solution I see out of the problem is to change the philosophy of the
culture.  The problem is that takes generations.  But I don't see how
anything else would work since our government reflects the totality of
the ideas the American people hold.

I got into a long discussion at a Saturday night
holiday party this last weekend, in which the
rationale for the upcoming (?) Iraq war was debated
(yawn) for the nth time (n to infinity).

However, I introduced a hypothesis which I have
thought about for some time, but never expressed:

To wit: suppose Bush & Co. understands what Conrad
Schneiker was saying in 1978 about the exponential
growth of the power of destruction outpacing the
capacity of defense, and Conrad's follow-up corollary
that the only surviveable high-tech society is one of
universal surveillance.

If so, then Iraq is just the beginning.  A convenient
place to start the American Imperium, to impose
surveillance on the entire world.  How else could it
be done?  And if the alternative - for the moment - is
universal annihilation, then what could the objection
be?

Extropes,

Worth a look.

Healing power in a gene

With age, the body deteriorates. Muscles atrophy.
Bones grow thin. The skin loses its elasticity. Wounds
are slow to heal. Our tissues don't regenerate the way
they did in youth. 

University of Illinois at Chicago researcher Robert
Costa believes he knows why: our FoxM1B gene retires.

Best, Jeff Davis

Not necessarily. Hef's daughter exercises significant degrees of
control over the magazine, and it might just be her sublimating.

My question about the sixties was from an offline
discussion I was having last week with Damien
Broderick.  He replied thus, which I post with
his permission.

Altho I take issue with his comment on ABBA (one
of my all time favorite rock groups), from these
powerful passages it is clear to me why it is
Damien makes his living as a writer while I slave
away at a crummy 9 to 5.

The following passages are from his book Transmitters:
====

Damien wrote thus:

Here are two portions (parodic, however, in intention)
from BRIGHT, my revised version of TRANSMITTERS (which
I think you own):

====

JANUARY FIRST NINETEEN SEVENTY

	The clocks are being smashed.
	We are a generation in revolt. The old
rhythms are breaking up, ocean froth before a tidal wave.
	Now is not then. The clocks are shuddering
and shattering. This world of us is not the world of them.
	We are a generation in revolt against the
sickly wistfulness of bullshit sentiment, against
the evasions that stifle honesty and rage, against the
dull grey smog of dull robot clothes and grey lifeless
clothes on stiff dummy bones.
	And yes, indeed, we are in revolt against that
one bright feverish flame at the center of the dull
grey world we were born into, the lunatic nuclear
flame which is waiting to burn us out.
	It is in the last ten years that we have
become who we are.
	We are the generation walking cool on our own
feet into the Seventies but we were formed by the Sixties.
That ferocious decade which has just closed was the
time when we found ourselves, created in our own bodies
and our own styles a rhythm shaking the worn-out world.
	And it is the music of the Sixties that is our
rhythm and our style, our voice, our voyage of discovery:
us shaping ourselves.
	Where we have been already points to where we
are going. And where we are going--if we keep our nerve,
if we keep our cool, if we keep our truth, if they do
not destroy us first--is into the Revolution of Joy.
	The music of the Sixties is our history.
	It is the mad, wild, fierce truth of Dylan,
and his lyricism.
	The music of the Sixties is the dream fantasia
of psychedelic West Coast America, the surf pulse and
the good vibrations of the Beach Boys, the blatant
savage adrenaline of Jimi Hendrix, the nimble black
Tamla Motown beat, the White Negro voyage of Presley.
	Above all the music of the Sixties is the
evolution of the Beatles: the honest sexy excitement
of their first songs, the nervy innovations of
Sgt. Pepper, their hungry curiosity for new ways
to speak and sing and their glad embrace of ancient
raga from that crowded Indian manscape which previous
generations had despised and crucified, the search for
reality and beauty no matter the color of its skin,
the discovery of the naked human body, that taming
of the devouring computer to the musician's soul-
plucking, sledgehammer art, the welding of East and
West and Peace and Love in the strange wonderful
harmonies, so vile and so hideous to older ears
and eyes, of John and Yoko...
	It is our poetry, scarring the sky and tearing
apart the placid paralysis of the air, coming on
strong and heavy with all the good and bad vibrations,
all of them.
	The music of the Sixties, if it does not fail,
if we do not let it out of our hands, is an arrow into
the history of the Seventies.

====

DECEMBER EIGHTH NINETEEN EIGHTY

	The 1960s died on the 8th day of the twelfth
month of 1980 when, outside his New York home, five
bullets were pumped into the body of John Lennon by
the music critic Ronald Reagan, who was later released
after questioning by police.
	The 1970s died much earlier, on the 19th day
of the eighth month of 1969 when half a million children
pitched their sad loony tents in a field outside Woodstock,
in upstate New York. A recorded interview was later
released to the media.
	It was the worst of times, it was the worst
of times. Picture a skinhead bootboy with razorblades
at his toes and safety pins through the flesh of
his cheeks, stamping on his own face forever.
	No. Picture four scrubbed and patched middleaged
Swedes rampant on a field of armwaving eight year olds
argent, droning the theme of the decade:
"Money money money."
	No no no. Picture Linda Ronstadt and Governor
Jerry Brown on undecorated sheets in a single bed,
Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta flicking and
sliding in the mirror above their heads on squares
of pure light.
	No. Alice Cooper eating a live chicken. KISS
in their six year old fantasy greasepaint and ten
thousand decibels. Sid Vicious in spoiled brat psychopathic
rage working out the punk dreams of his generation in the
murdered flesh of a convenient woman.
	The seventies was waking into the hungover
spoils of the party. Everyone had died during the night.
	Jim Morrison was dead in whiskey, caught by the snake.
	Hendrix was dead, all his flashing crying chords jangled.
	Joplin was dead, swallowed up and chewed into lard and blood.
	Presley was dead, fat and banal, in alcohol and spangled spansules.
	Marc Bolan was dead, gnawed by Tyrannosaur's jaws.
	The Beatles were dead, John by an assassin's gun, Paul by his own hand.
	Abba were born dead.
	Disco was a corpse plugged into a fibrillator.
	Like old pre-industrial gods, the remnants of the
pantheon took themselves into eclipse and changed their wigs,
were reborn, shook it again in the video clips: David Bowie
falling in endless rebirth, Lou Reed transformed, Carly Simon,
Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Brown; Heavy Metal clashing by night, 
Tangerine Dreaming their remote electronic buzz; and Dylan was
Born Again.
	Robert Zimmerman was Born Again.
	The music of the Seventies was a pike gaffed into
the belly of the Eighties.

Damien

a) ultralights are not experimental aircraft
b) a 'congested area' is one with congested air traffic, not with
development on the ground. The purpose of this is to keep aircraft
which are very slow, as ultralights generally are, out of areas with
lots of civil and commercial aircraft travelling several times their
velocities, kinda like keeping the model T's off the freeway.

No matter how much work the machines can do for us, somebody will
need to be trained to develop, maintain and verify the machines.

If we (humanity) don't understand what our machines do for us,
we're effectively prisoners of technology developed by our
ancestors, sounds like a very effective way to stop progress dead

Not a bad plan either, for exactly the same reason.

Phil, I have never heard of Conrad Schneiker, but
I came to exactly the same conclusion after the
terrorist bombing of Oklahoma City in 1995.

Regardless of what it does, society will have a
3 sigma element whose fantasy is to slay as many
as possible.  Over time, technology empowers
individuals to do ever more damage.  In 1995,
shortly before I started reading extropians,
I became convinced that regardless of what path
the future takes, universal surveillance will
result.  Terrorists take away our right to
privacy.  spike

Well, some positive developments today.

A new form of gene therapy is demonstrating some promise
with respect to AIDS.  Interestingly it seems they are
using an HIV derived gene therapy vector to turn off the
CCR5 receptor required by HIV to infect cells.  Now isn't
that a "turn about is fair play" game!

http://www.sciencedaily.org/releases/2002/12/021224092956.htm

Other studies are providing more information that viral,
and perhaps other, infections may play a role in heart
attacks and strokes.

There is  the rub.
Universal access to all information is useful to the decentralization of
parallel processed new R&D.  The problem is that putting that
information under the wing of
one nation's or an elite group of mutinationals restricts the
decentralization and
value added benefits therefrom to an oligopoly.

Like most oligopolies it will crumble in time, given the evolution of
technologies
which transcend the current technology.  The creation of a self-aware AI

is one such technology.  The power of an AI to oversee  and counter
destructive actions of individuals-corps-nation-states would transcend
the need
for security and secrecy and privacy and thus liberate the prisoners of
the currently
developing information oligopoly.

Case in Point:

In Canada we have satellite tv legislated to come only from CRTC (gov't)
approved services.  Companies not authorized to sell tv services in
Canada now have their
equipment confiscated by the RCMP.
This is a dangerous situation.
If I feel I want to see information from a channel not deemed by Gov't
regulators
as an approved source I am now deemed to be breaking the law.
The law is imposed under the guise that selling only a limited number of
choices
creates an economically sustainable market.
However , the elite regulators and not the free market determine who
shall or shall
not be allowed to disseminate information/entertainment services.

As a Canadian, I am mad as hell.....The basis of all freedoms is the
freedom
to information.

Ok, I've read it and I'm not buying it.  It sounds like hype to me.

"Like a traffic cop, FoxM1B controls both steps, Costa says.
'If the cells had no FoxM1B gene," he said, "their DNA often failed to make
a copy of itself, and they had trouble dividing.'"

"The DNA failed to duplicate due to a pileup of a protein called p21Cip1."

DUH, if cells fail to divide you are, of course, going to have problems
with numerous body functions (your immune system, your skin and digestive
tract, your lungs, repairing wounds, etc.)  Any external or internal
organ system that is "exposed" to the environment plus your immune
system and perhaps your endothelial system (blood vessel linings)
depends on cell division to renew itself.  However, it is important
to keep in mind with respect to "aging" that most other organs (e.g.
heart, kidney, brain are much less dependent on dividing cells).

Now, I'm not sure about p21Cip1, but normal p21 is a close relative of p53
and both of which are involved in the process of determining whether a
cell is "good to go" (with respect to division or perhaps if there is
too much damage which then induces them to commit apoptosis).   [Genes are
now coming in "families" so it isn't clear to me without spending more
time whether p21Cip1 is indeed one and the same as the gene normally
identified as "p21".  But usually the functions of genes within a "family"
are similar.]

So it sounds to me like they are simply saying, if cells don't divide
you age.  Well my response to that is "Not so fast buddy".  This is
a perspective promoted in "Reversing Human Aging" by Michael Fossel.
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0688143245

I know Michael and am comfortable to say in public or to him personally
that this is an incomplete perspective.  I believe he is currently
working on a textbook that may be somewhat more refined.  Michael
is currently the editor of the Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine
(http://www.liebertpub.com/JAA/default1.asp) and one of the co-directors
of the American Aging Association.

So it sounds to me like Robert Costa read "Reversing Human Aging"
and then made some invalid leaps with respect to the genes he was
working on.  Bad, bad, bad science.  There are probably dozens,
if not hundreds, of genes that can impact the ability of cells to divide
and they are all going to cause *some* of the features of "aging"
if the limit cell division.

Why is this?  Simply because to prevent cancer the amount/rate of
cell division must be limited.  Limit the amount of cell division and
you limit the ability of a whole set of organs to renew themselves.

But that is *not* a complete picture with respect to what "aging" is.
It doesn't touch the question of how do you renew the organs that do
*not* depend on cellular division for renewal?

Sorry to rain on your parade Jeff but I think you are being dragged
over a popular cliff (isn't this a scene from an Indiana Jones movie?)
and I'd like to hold onto your feet to save you if possible.

Best,
Robert

Yes, yes ... and along those lines even more can be said.

Looka here, wonders just never cease.  I actually agree with Mr. Lee Daniel
Crocker.

Only disagree about The Pill not being available in the 1960s (it was, and I
gulped down a few in those days ... being awed and appreciative that I was
of THE VERY FIRST GENERATION of women since the dawn of humankind to have
this remarkable pill that provided impeccable birth control).

Also prostitutes weren't the only ones who knew about abortions.  Although I
was quite young then, I'd heard of women who'd had abortions - some of them
were married, some were unmarried teenagers, and others were (due mainly to
widowhood and divorce) "single-parent" mothers.

[Excellent analysis snipped]

I strongly concur with Robert's analysis.  The FoxM1B gene may be required
for cell division, and cell division failures would cause aging.  But most
old age symptoms are not caused by a lack of cell division.  This is over
simplistic and not a general symptom of aging.  Plus, the hype at the
beginning of the article, about skin elasticity, immune system response,
healing, and other symptoms are only vaguely linked into this gene by saying
that none of these could occur without cell division.  There was no
scientific process here, no cause and effect, no experimental data, and no
logical argument for the position.  It was loosely references as fact with
no reason.  I believe understanding this gene is probably very important,
but jumping to these conclusions that it will lead to a major aging therapy
breakthrough seem unwarranted.

Interesting theory. But I don't understand why gays would have any "ideal
woman" in mind in the first place.  Much less why they would try to get
their version of an ideal women into a heterosexual men's magazine.

Has Playboy really lost favor among heterosexual men?  Does nobody care for
their centerfolds anymore?  I can't imagine a big business like Playboy
losing market share by choosing unattractive models.

Maybe your tastes are more refined than most men?  I think the real culprit
is an obsession toward skinniness and youth.  Both of these factors would
tend toward immature girls (who look more like immature boys) in a much more
direct way than a secret conspiracy of gays to sabotage Playboy.

But then, I only read it for the articles.  No, really...  I really mean
it....

Yes, but the effects of what we do seldom are well-known.

There is too little risk taking at present, IMO, and
indicates a too conservative mind set that civilization
as a whole is falling into.

Kevin Kelly wrote a book in 1994 or so entitled "Out of
Control".  I didn't read it because it appeared only to
cover material that I was absorbing elsewhere.

My reading of history suggests that progress occurs only
when things are "out of control".  That is, progress
occurs almost always when societies en masse have no
control over the processes that are affecting them.
But a keen goal of our present civilization appears to
be to place everything that could possibly harm or
threaten us "under control".

Lee

P.S.  About Kelly's "Out of Control", one reviewer wrote:

I agree with the "Chicago reader" who said this book could've used an editor, but it's one of the best poorly-written books I've
read too.

Kelly's cheerleading for the decentralized, "hive-mind" mentality smacks of the giddy 1940's Tomorrowland propaganda -- oblivious to
market realities, people's resistance to change and the fact that simple technologies always win head-to-head competitions with more
complex technologies.

Yes, we should at least have Luna by now. Instead, that effort and money 
has been absorbed by the Shuttle, and the ISS.

Manned space exploration didn't happen, but the probes are doing nicely. 
And people _have_ started talking about going to Moon again, this time to 
do industry. It's no big deal delivering a few tons of hardware to Luna 
surface once or twice. Once we have the capability for remote fabbing 
packaged into that footprint things are going to lift off. You might not 
go to the Moon in person (unless medicine can hold aging), but you could 
at least telecommute there.

But other things did. TBit/s transmissions, global (wireless) networks,
computers, genetics, nanotechnology within touching distance. I can't 
think of a single predictor who got all these things right in the 1960s, 
or 1970s.

I agree. It is difficult to get funding for the more far out projects; it
is nearly impossible in the current relentless low-margin atmosphere in
industrial R&D. It encourages hard-liner local optimization, since a
mistake will make you go out of business on a few years scale. *Not* good.

I'm particularly appalled how little the global network and powerful 
personal computers are being used as virtual bench and collaborative 
infrastructure by individual end users. We do have a vibrant gamer 
community, which will become even more so in the future, but all of it is 
remarkably escapist.

This doesn't follow. Few technologies are destructive. Out of hand, I can
think of conventional and nuclear explosives, nerve and bioagents. We
clearly can discount ecovory for now. While our current society is
_mentally_ ill equipped with living under the threat veil, this doesn't
mean it can't be done. In fact blanket surveillance is one of the worst
methods to prevent casualties, especially in cases when a tiny package
delivered by automation can unleash death and destruction on a large
scale.

The robust, passive solutions to threats are 1) decentralization 2)  
blanket realtime agent detection and user notification 3) physical seals
and shields, from gloves and masks to suits and tents up to the level of
closed loop ecosystems.

What is necessary for decentralization? Convincing telepresence. Ability
to see the man on the stairs who is not there, with full detail. So spend
the money on augmented reality (huds, trackers), motion capturing and
realtime avatar projection. Which will require low-latency broadband 
infrastructure, and not just in the cities.

Once you go distributed the threats diminish almost to zero, quite 
naturally.

I again remind all and sundry that a messed-up press release does not 
necessarily indicate messed-up research.  The included hype and 
irrelevancies are probably more likely the result of a reporter trying to 
"make the research interesting".  My guess would be that Costa found 
FoxM1B was implicated in cell division and everything else is a figment of 
the reporter's imagination.

I agree -- *but* -- a quick PubMed scan on "Costa RH FoxM1B" reveals that
most of the research is in the liver and lung.  These are tissues that
are (or can) divide.  Further, they are explicitly damaging the liver
to force regeneration -- that *isn't* a good model for aging.  It may
very well be that the aging angle got added by the person writing the
press release -- but a responsible scientist is going to try and make
sure that the press get it right.  That will not always happen
but it doesn't mean that that we should pull any punches with
respect to evaluating what is reported -- that is the way that
science is supposed to work.

While I'm not sure about eurekalert.org, most Science Daily
press releases are derived directly from the university doing
the research.  From the looks of it, the information is
directly from the press office at UIC, one Sharon Butler
(with phone number and email supplied).  Extropes with
my "yelling from the back of the room" approach to getting
things right may feel free to forward to her my comments, perhaps
along with Eliezers (so she doesn't feel too assaulted).
[It would be a little too self-serving for me to do so --
and besides its Christmas.]

One would *hope* that most universities allow their scientists
some editing power over their own press releases.

What you saw was not science.  It was reporting.  Given what was 
published, I seriously doubt that Costa has any power over what gets 
reported as his research in press releases.  I think the policy should be 
to hold scientists responsible only for their research abstracts and 
research papers, and not press releases, unless you have specific evidence 
that the scientist was given veto power over the press release and failed 
to invoke it.  I'd like to live in a world where reporters always 
fact-checked their articles, but we don't live in that world or within a 
hundred parayears of it.

You hope; I'll doubt until I see evidence.  I suspect that some 
universities give their scientists editing power over press releases and 
others do not; if something looks spectacularly awful then my reaction is 
to doubt the scientist was allowed editing powers by that particular 
university or company.  I doubt that IBM ran its famous teleportation ad 
past the scientists involved before publishing in Scientific American. 
(On the other hand, the Max Planck Institute's press releases are almost 
always filled with technical information and I suspect they may be written 
directly by the scientists or by experienced technical writers.)

The degree of researcher control over press releases varies by 
institution, the researcher isn't the one who controls how it varies, and 
I think the assumption should be that the researcher is innocent until 
proven guilty.  If you want to hold someone responsible, make it the 
university involved.

Here's an idea; instead of discussing this back and forth to no useful
conclusion, e-mail the guy and ask. Tell us the answer, then we can discuss
back and forth to no useful conclusion. We live in the 21st century now,
after all.

As for me, I'm all for more press on aging research. If said press makes
other scientists sit up and say "wait a minute, that's all wrong" then even
better. A little needling goes a long way.

Extropistas,

Big step toward molecular electronics 

http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-8/iss-6/p9a.html

Love the increasing magnification photo sequence. 
Denser.  Non-volatile.  Cheaper. And this is just the
very first generation.  Ho, ho, ho indeed.

By the way, a question.  

The article provides a link--

http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-8/iss-5/p9.pdf

--to "...a new imprinting process recently developed
by Princeton University physicists (see TIP Briefs,
October/November 2002, pp. 10-11).

That mini-article, entitled "Printing on Silicon",
cites the first(?) use of a nanoscale-etched quartz
mold--like that used by the Hewlett-Packard folks
above.  But the Princeton use was different.  They
shined a laser through the quartz and melted the
adjacent silicon, which then flowed into the etchings
in the mold and resolidified, creating the positive of
the etched negative.  

*****Presumably, the resolidified silicon is still
single crystal.*****

Now here's my question.

Silicon chips require single crystal silicon, right? 
This comes in slices--referred to as wafers--cut off a
single crystal ingot.  Without looking into it to find
out why, I've always wondered at this seemingly
laborious--and, could it be, wasteful?--process.  

I say wasteful, because, though I must confess to
being severely uninformed about this, it seems to me
that the purified silicon starting product is quite
expensive (I could be wrong), and in order to survive
the slicing process must be cut way thicker than
needed for the final chip (too thin is too delicate to
cut).  These wafers are then ground to the appropriate
thickness and polished.  

          -----slight digression---------

I've actually done this once.  Helped Novalux in
Sunnyvale set up their clean room, and ground a
gallium arsenide wafer from 450 microns starting
thickness to 150 microns final.  One experience with
this hardly makes me well informed, but look at that
one case.  Fully two-thirds of the material was ground
away!

          -------end digression----------

Why are not the wafers made say, by compressing
powdered silicon between two polished flat quartz
discs and then melting the sandwiched particles
together using the same laser melting technique
described in "Printing on Silicon"?  Or, why is not
amorphous silicon made single crystal by some such
similar process?

Normally, I wouldn't ask, but I had only a few minutes
to kill before going off to >Hmas dinner, so rather
than some few pleasant hours googling up the answer,
and otherwise joyfully exploring the realms of arcane
technoweeniedom--it's what I do--I decided to pose it
as a question to y'all.  "Show me the magic."

No pressure.  Ponder, discourse upon, or ignore,...as
pleases you.  Or throw me a link or two.

Onward then, "to horizons of love or good luck,... or
more love."

Best, Jeff Davis

               "You are what you think."

Resonable suggestion, but this article:
University Of Illinois At Chicago Researchers Find "Fountain Of Youth" Gene
http://www.seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/10-01-1YouthGene.htm

Suggest that it is Robert Costa that is the source of the problem
unless he is being completely misquoted.  E.g.

"Ponce de Leon was looking in the wrong place for the fountain of youth,"
said Costa. "He should have been looking for the FoxM1B gene."

The fact that the research is being supported by "The National Institute
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of
Health" who are not experts on aging suggests to me that things are being
stretched.

My success rate of late with email to academics has not been high.
So its either getting filtered or they just aren't responding.  It isn't
clear to me how most universities are dealing with the growing volume of SPAM.
So I'd have to get on the phone and I'm not sure I'm that ambitious
(given that they can refuse to take your calls or you end up playing phone tag).

Robert

Yep.

Maybe not so much with Si, which I believe may be a bit
stronger than GaAs.

But Si is moving in the direction of Si on Al2O3 so
things are changing anyway.  Al2O3 is probably stronger
so the slices can be even thinner.

If there were an easy way to do this I think it would have
been found by now.  Because Si based solar cells are a lot
more efficient if made out of single crystal Si compared with
amorphous Si.  Something like 20+% vs. < 10%.

I suspect it is because to recrystallize amorphous Si one needs
to have an extremely uniform heating and cooling process moving
as a "wave-front" across the entire surface of the Si and
nobody has figured out how to do that yet.  Or it may require
so much energy (say if you are using laser heating) that it is
prohibitively expensive.

My 2 cents.
Robert

In the meantime it appears the Moller Air Car has been a success in an 
underpowered prototype model.  Now they builders are installing the full 
sized motors and we are looking for the first test results sometime between 
now and next spring.
       He, Paul Moller, puts out a monthly report updating progress -- 
however when he gets really busy with building that report can be up to a 
month late.  In any case the next report is supposed to be out Jan 01, 2003.

20 minutes would be somewhat practical. I'd assume MEMS tech could apply to 
jet packs. I'm surprised the military haven't developed this for specialized 
usages. How about mounting a laser cannon and retractable laser mirror 
shield (if there is such a thing) to it?

Speaking of the military and lasers... would laser cannons mounted under 
helium balloons have no "heat signature"? Could such a balloon be a 
"stealth" balloon with a specialized shape and surface material?

         I spent the 1960s working as an aerospace engineer, building ICBMs 
and the Apollo equipment, raising two stepchildren and two of our own, 
doing some graduate work, teaching evenings as assistant professor, and 
writing a book on statistical decision theory. The popular culture of the 
1960s just passed me by, except when I followed my stepson, who ran away 
with his girlfriend to the San Francisco Haight Ashbury Summer of Love. Of 
course, I paid attention to the Vietnam War, and I remember watching 
Johnson announce that he would not run again (as I remember the first moon 
walk). What did I think of it? Confusion. I was too young for WW 2, 
although I escaped from Germany one day before that war was supposed to 
begin (although a week before it did begin), but I served during the Korean 
War. I recognized the great danger of Nazism and Japanese Imperialism, and 
hence the necessity of fighting them, and was only a little less certain 
about the domino theory of the Korean War. My problems with understanding 
the Vietnam War probably stemmed from the undoubted excesses of the 
American anti-communist right. The fact that they had been so utterly wrong 
about communist influence on American domestic affairs provided doubt about 
their asseverations concerning international affairs in which communism 
might be involved.

         However, when I woke up to a wider social life at the end of the 
1960s, I did not find myself in an unknown world. If you wish to say it 
this way, I lived a rather Bohemian and intellectual life before the Korean 
War, which was put on hold, so to speak, through the 1950s and 1960s by the 
necessities of war and early professional and family life. So that, in many 
respects, I resumed that life in the 1970s. However, as I remarked in an 
earlier post, popular music had gone to hell and new-age superstitions had 
multiplied.

I'll be starting the Longevity Meme Newsletter in a couple of weeks. If you
are interested in:

- life extension news and events digests
- (my and other) opinions and commentary on life extension
- less political naysaying than I inflict upon this list
- updates on all the new stuff that's happening at
http://www.longevitymeme.org
- all of the above arriving in your inbox every now and again

then you should come along and subscribe:

	http://www.longevitymeme.org/newsletter/

If you haven't visited the Longevity Meme in while, then drop by
(http://www.longevitymeme.org). I've been busy while you've been away.

A licensee of Bell/Textron did a couple of turbine jet packs after the two
(more famous, but more limited) Wendell Moore rocket belts... I used to have promo
literature from Bell/Textron about both, but I fear it's long lost. This was late
'60s-early '70s stuff.

Diging through Smithsonian files gives me the name of Williams International
(formerly Williams Research Corp.) of Walled Lake, Michigan. Here's some info on
them these days:

http://www.eclipseaviation.com/inthenews/detail_02.htm?content_id=359

I believe Williams now makes small turbine engines for cruise missiles.

The US military looked seriously at both; I don't think the bang for buck was there yet.
Certainly the rocket belt was very limited (6 seconds rise, 6 seconds cruise, 6 seconds
descend and a 2 second safety margin was a typical flight profile).

And yes, MEMS turbines like the ones a group at MIT is working on would provide a huge
potential thrust to weight and thrust per watt, along with some gracefl failure modes if
massively redundant arrays are employed, and this has been noticed by some of the people
who are funding the work. ISTR some (ca 1996-8) Marine Corps paper on the matter.

If you expect a response from me then start over.  I didn't say 
nothing had improved in any areas at all.  I said that the level 
of that feeling of emptinness and hype has not improved 
significantly.  Take a look at anti-depressant prescription

culture feeds that which is most important to you and fuels you.

When I noticed "god versus satan" was one of their suggested "fights" I got
curious...


life (102 000 000 winner) versus death (30 300 000 loser)

living (35 600 000 winner) versus dying (3 810 000 loser)

 - yea, a decisive extropian victory

islam (4 530 000 winner) versus christianity (3 250 000 loser)

  - bit of a surprise there

reason (26 000 000 winner) versus islam (4 530 000 loser)

  - no brainer

jesus (15 800 000 winner) versus  mohammad (673 000 loser)

  - ah, but how to reconcile this with islam's victory over christianity

sex (185 000 000 winner) versus god (43 800 000 loser)

  - well in all fairness to god, folks having sex typically utter the
expression "oh my god!"

god (43 800 000 winner) versus anal (29 300 000 loser)

  - hah, but not by much! not by much!

science (52 100 000 winner) versus religion (16 400 000 loser)

working (48 100 000 winner) versus sleeping (5 110 000 loser)

christmas (18 800 000 winner) versus castration (279 000 loser)

Best of the holiday season to you all!

So you would like us to choose between hell and non-existence?

And a similar element whose fantasy is to exert total control over
as many as possible. And *they* seem to be attracted to the political
process like wasps to a honeypot.

The headache I've got with the whole Iraq mess -- speaking as a
non-American -- is that the planned US invasion of Iraq is clearly an
attempt to gain a choke-hold on the remaining unexploited oil fields, and
looks like a first step towards establishing an imperial hegemony. (And
it's being really badly managed, in terms of PR directed at the rest of
the world; from over here, the sabre-rattling emanating from the White
House is distastefully reminiscent of the noises coming out of Germany in
Summer 1939 with respect to Poland.) If it succeeds it's going to breed
festering hatred in the middle east and extreme distrust in Europe,
where people have a somewhat more acute sense of paranoia about such
goings-on -- for good historical reasons.

I'm not a libertarian, but even so, a planetary imperial hegemony does
not strike me as being a good thing for personal freedom. Nor is
pursuing primacy through the political tools of the nineteenth century
a good idea for the twenty-first.

America as a world-devouring menace, and Saddam's Iraq as pitiful 1939 
Poland? Ok.  I don't see the necessity of the USA defining its role in the 
world as some kind of global people-pleaser; every-ready to reasure and 
consult withw anyone and everyone who makes a complaint.

My contention is, if the populace is going to hate you in the middle east, or 
europe; they are going to hate you, no matter what you do. America as some 
kind of intercontinental pretzel, bending to and fro, to the delight of its 
critics, doesn't appeal to me. Fortunately, for this list, there are other, 
voices, ready to define the US role in a more "flexible" way.

Cheers

I'm glad I'm not the only one who's noticed that.

Um... I suspect that the specific aspect Charlie Stross and I are both 
referring to is the manner in which the US clearly wants war, is looking 
for the slightest excuse, and failing the existence of any excuse will 
manufacture one while claiming that it is Iraq's fault and we were provoked.

Perhaps a case can be made that the US needs to pre-emptively invade Iraq 
in order to prevent them from obtaining weapons of mass destruction, but I 
don't think the current party line of "They're making us do it!  Really! 
We were provoked!" is fooling anyone outside the US.  And it *is* rather 
reminiscent, historically speaking, of Poland 1939.

Though come to think of it, it's probably reminiscent of a great many 
other cases in international history as well; it's just that Poland is the 
famous case that even an amateur like myself has heard of.

Gotta give credit to the anonymous party coining the term 'homeland',
though. Truly a stroke of genius. Makes one think of South African
apartheid and Hitler Germany simultaneously. It's really hard to do it on 
purpose.

What era would you have rather be living in, the sixties? That was in the
middle of a long costly pointless war that was ultimately lost; and it
didn't matter if you thought the war was a good idea or not because the
draft existed and you'd still be forced to fight and die 12 thousand miles
from home; the didn't have the Internet either. The fifties? Racism was
considered perfectly respectable by most; the H bomb had just been invented
and politicians still didn't have a deep understanding about how powerful
they really were so the dagger of thermonuclear war was very high. The
forties? Half the world was trying to kill the other half. The thirties?
Great economic depressions are not my cup of tea. I wouldn't trade with any
time in the past; as for anti-depressant prescription, people take more of
them because they work better now.

I'd rather be living in 1992 than 2002.  I'd gain an extra ten years of 
time on my deadline.  (Just because you don't *know* when your deadline 
is, doesn't mean it's not a deadline.)

What would universal surveillance actually mean? 
Does universal mean *everyone* is watched to 
some extent (perhaps we approach that now) or
does it mean everyone is watched *completely* like
a prisoner in Bentham's jail?

Assuming the thesis is correct. Then one question
that arises is how do we get "universal surveillance"
even in principle? I can't offhand think of a scenario
where surveillance isn't at least partially stratified.

What sort of threat does the surveillance need to 
detect? A polio virus builder in the back shed as
opposed to an amateur bomb maker using info
off the 'net?  A nanotech designer willing to sell
designs for an assembler to a rouge regime?
A quantum computer engineer who doesn't like the 
financial markets or public key infrastructure? 

Perhaps to have peace one does need to prepare for
war, but there seems to be no reason to assume all are
equally capable or well equipped warriors.

At present the US govt seems to be in the position to 
do most of the surveillance and I'm not sure that's all
that healthy for non-US commercial interests or the 
citizens of even countries that are friendly to the US. 
There is no reciprocality in accountabilities.What if the
US decides its national interest extend to breaking the 
virtual private networks of commercial corporations
that are simply protecting their trade secrets as 
part of legitimate business practise.

If large scale ambitious projects of the "lets go to
the moon" or "the lets build a nanoassembler" variety
are going to happen at all, either governments or private 
enterprise will have to fund them. Outside of war
first world governments seem to be limited in how much
planning and spending on large projects with uncertain
outcomes they can undertake. The space race was a race
between rival powers. Then there were at least two. The
only way I can see either the Democrats or the Republicans
making the construction of a nanoassembler a national
objective is if it was considered to be of military significance.
I have considerably less trouble imagining a government
deeming such technology to be too dangerous to be left in
private hands. Or even allowing it to be developed without
government surveillance.

It might be hard to keep promises to investors (and thereby)
a real innovation stifler if commercial companies everywhere 
felt that all IP in high technology such as quantum computing 
and nanoassemblers were subject to an unofficial first right of
refusal from the American NSA. 

Could it really afford not to spy on say even a European
country or one of its allies or its allies corporations if it 
thought that corporation had stolen a march on the rest of
the field and was about to develop either an assembler
potentially able to mass produce any weapon or a quantum
computer able to crack existing financial codes?

What if anything I wonder would ultimately stop the US from
nationalising all technologies and the IP of foreign corporates
that it deems to be *potentially* either an economic or military
threat and therefore "in accordance with the national interest"?

What's more: there's a widespread lack of understanding of *WHY* so many
people in the middle-east or South America hate the USA. It's not a
fact of nature, it's not inevitable, and it doesn't need to be that way.

For about three or four generations, the State Department has approached
foreign affairs in a manner that has done an almost unimaginable amount of
damage to the USA's reputation in the world. There's a huge gap between
the USA's political self-image (cradle of democracy and so on), and the
way US superpower realpolitik since 1899 or so has functioned in the
rest of the world. As often as not US foreign policy fosters fascist
dictatorships and islamic theocracies in preference to democratically
elected parliaments -- especially if the corporate interests of US
multinationals with ties to members of the administration might come
under scrutiny by such governments. (This isn't news and it isn't an
accusation specifically aimed at the Bush presidency: read up on the 
history of United Fruit if it doesn't ring any bells.)

The current business in Venezuela is just the latest in a sorry string
of incidents that include coups in Iran, Chile and Greece, invasions
in Panama, Cuba and Grenada, support for terrorists and war criminals
in Afghanistan, Iraq, and ... oh hell. The list goes on. Manuel Noriega,
Leopoldo Galtieri, Alfredo Pinochet, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden --
they're all on the list of *BENEFICIARIES* of US largesse, until they
bit the hand that fed them. (Doubtless there are other, similarly nasty
specimens that haven't gnawed the feeding finger yet: a certain General
Musharraff springs to mind as a candidate, as does a King Fahd.)

Basically, US foreign policy has largely been based on supporting people
who do *not* share core American values, often at the expense of people
who do, or who are much more amenable to them. (The glaring exceptions
to this rule, western Europe and Japan, are special cases. And when
the shit hits the fan, these are the countries who are on the same side
as the USA, not the other side.)

I'd like to see a US administration try to reverse the long-term pattern,
and start making friends rather than enemies.  But the pattern is so
entrenched that it would take a generation for such a program to bear
fruit, probably with some setbacks along the way -- and the term limits
imposed by the US political system make it difficult to see how such a
program could be sustained.

The German people has learned the hard way how it ends to invade a country
trying to establish an imperial hegemony. We could help you to take the
shorter route avoiding bloody streetfighting in Bagdad. I know at least two
friends of mine and myself who would forget their peace loving character 
and hurry to liberate the American people from the Bush administration. 
You just have to call out for help!

We already have one bridgehead on US territory: actor Sean Penn suggested,
true "patriotism" today meant to overthrow the present Government.

So please call out for help. The German people is a true friend of the US
people. We will set over the Atlantic and liberate you , just like your
grandfathers and fathers did 60 years ago with the German people. Promised.

Oh, just an array of sniffers (for nerve agents, aerosol and pathogen DNA)
hooked to a wireless network, and end user notification (beepers,
dedicated channel for mobile phone broadcast signalling, loudspeakers).

That way you know where and which attack is in progress and can notify
targets in the area in realtime (use microfilter mask, bunny suit if you
have one, get out of the open/into shelters, zip up into sterile tents,
decontaminate, observe quarantine, stand by for further instructions).  
Etc.

A primitive microfilter mask is a few bucks, yet it will quite efficiently
protect against any aerosol targeting the lung and mucous membranes --
provided, you've donned it on time. Combine this with a cheap sealed kit
containing water (microfilter/sterilizer; ion exchanger for the hot
isotopes, lyophilized food fortified with vitamins and mineral salts,
dedicated antibiotics, iodide/iodate tablets, atropine injections, a cheap
digital radio for emergency messaging, and a sterile microfilter
family-sized tent for the living room and most of B stuff just isn't that
scary anymore. Even small scale A and C attacks (but for those poor sods
who got fried/drenched in the open) are not all that scary.

Incremental increase in threats can make above quite mundane and people 
well trained in use of said paraphernalia and techniques. I'm pointing to 
the threat level of the average Israeli or European country during WWII. 
Even the most badass terrorists can't marshall anything comparable.

I will also point towards the fact that a lot of the technologies required
for manned space exploration if use down here can make humanity
effectively unkillable. Notice that above doesn't invalidate need for
decentralization; a modern largish city is still vulnerable to a meek
tritium-boosted (few g T gas, one order of magnitude enhanced yield)  
weapon.

Yes, I know Leonid.  He used to do some work for me when I was still doing
active research in Moscow.

I've read his book and I think its fairly interesting.  Both Leonid and
his wife Natalia are very well read (with respect to aging research).
Unlike many Western aging researchers (as recent list discussion has shown)
they actually have taken the time to really read and think about the
concept of aging.  They are however primarily theoretical people, not
experimentalists.  The only people I might place above them on the
theoretical level would be Steve Austad, Vladimir Anisimov and George
Martin (though Anisimov and Martin are more experimentalists and have
only written a little bit about aging theory).

Though their technical work is fine, their ethical perspective is more
typically Russian than Western.  That should not be considered "unusual"
but must be taken into account if you want to work with them.

I never expect responses unless I ask questions, but your point
is taken: sure, lots of people are depressed and pessimistic;
always have been, always will be.  How people feel about their
circumstances says more about them than about the circumstances.
Aside from those taking SSRIs to be more productive, I have seen
no reason to think the number taking them for real depression now
indicates more cases of depression than at earlier times--it just
represents the fact that there's now an available treatment and
people want to take advantage of it, because being depressed
sucks.  Isn't that a good thing?  Why do /you/ automatically
assume that more people are depressed?

What's most important to me is learning; what fuels me is knowledge.
Acquiring it, distributing it, improving it.  Aside from the
obvious technological boons to that enterprize today, the culture
today has improved my chances (and those of others) in several ways:
home schooling of children is common and accepted now, mass media
like television and radio are freer and have more and better content,
there is more diversity in colleges and other research institutions,
"nerdiness" is much more culturally acceptable now, information about
things like medicine and law that was once tightly guarded is now
made available to the public, etc.

At every point in history, there is progress, and there are problems
to overcome, and now is no different.  There have always been, and will
always be, pessimists and doomsayers as well as optimists, and some of
them may even get a prediction right now and then.  But pathological
pessimism is a debilitating disease that does no one any good, and I
for one don't care to be infected by it.

Agreed with all of the above.

(I'd like to add that you might want to look at *why* Saudi Arabia funds
wahabite propaganda and terrorism, and *who* is doing it, and ask yourself
why the US government hasn't moved against them many years ago. It's
extremely dirty ...)

> d) Depose Saddam's regime and one free's up another petroleum source.

Aha. Now the problem here is that you're implicitly assuming that the
petroleum resource belongs to the US, or the west in general, and that
deposing Saddam's regime is a necessary precondition to freeing up that
resource. It isn't; Saddam's been screaming for years to be allowed to
sell more oil in order to fund reconstruction of the infrastructure that
was bombed to bits in 1992 (and subnsequently).

I'm going to emphasize this point: buying Iraqi oil is not, and never has
been, a problem. The problem is what the Iraqi government-in-being might
do with the money they get for the oil. Forcing a change of government
is one way of dealing with this problem. Unfortunately it's also morally
equivalent to expropriating the oil -- theft, in other words. ("We're
going to enter into this voluntary arrangement whereby you give us oil
and we give you money. Except we're going to tell you what you can buy
with this money at the company store. Don't mind these bombers, they're
just there to ensure that you don't try spending it with anyone else.")

Western dependence on middle-eastern oil doesn't just render us vulnerable
to middle-eastern dictators; it's morally corrupting in the same manner 
as slavery.

Er, no. You need to take a closer look at Saudi Arabia before you make such
blanket statements.

Saudi Arabia is a really unpleasant hereditary totalitarian dictatorship.
There is no freedom of speech, religion, or behaviour there. Torture and
judicial execution are routine and there has *never* been a democratic
tradition in that nation. That's for starters. The roughly 1000 princes
in the royal family occupy almost all the top executive posts (both public
and private sector) in the country, and promotion for outsiders is almost
impossible without a royal partner in the picture.

Now it's time to get alarmist. The Saudi population has doubled in size
since 1980; the average age is around 20. However, the economy is entirely
dependent on oil production, which is subject to international treaty
quotas established by OPEC. Per-capita GDP has fallen from US $20K/year
in 1990 to roughly US $8K/year today, partly due to population growth
but largely due to the falling price of oil.

Get this: the *one* area where young Saudis are free to demonstrate
enthusiasm is the stern wahabite strain of Islam that's preached in Arabia
and institutionalised by the royal family. This strain is reformist --
in the same way that Martin Luther or Calvin were reformist. That doesn't
mean it's modernist, it means it's fundamentalist and confrontational.
The strain of Islam practiced in Arabia is comparable to the strain
of Christianity espoused by the Aryan Nations. And it's got large-scale
financial support from the monarchy, which is terrified that if it doesn't
continue to support the mosques it will be overthrown in a revolution.

(There *are* reformist and modernist strains within Islam, from the
Shiite Bohras to various Sufi sects. The Wahabite response to these
is "kill the heretics!" Friendly folks.)

Anyway. Here's the upshot: scenario (a) is turning off the money pipes
to the corrupt Kingdom. This  will probably provoke a revolution there
that will be more extreme than the one in Iran. Scenario (b), pumping
more money into the Kingdom, will enable more money to reach the barking
nutjob bampots who like flying airliners into skyscrapers. The stick is
cleft: there is *no* optimal strategy for the west, as long as we think
only in terms of buying and selling oil.

Worse. Let us assume a successful US invasion and occupation of Iraq. I'm
not going to speculate on what would happen if Saddam puts up a strong
resistance, or nukes Tel Aviv, or whatever, because those aren't the
worst outcomes. *Any* successor regime in Iraq is going to want to sell
oil because Iraq is a real mess and needs to rebuild a generation's worth
of infrastructure. This will depress the price of oil, leading to
scenario (a). A Wahabite revolution in Arabia might well spread its
tentacles afield, replacing alfresco Al Qaida terrorism with the big
bucks of State terrorism. Worse, it might catalyse a similar revolution
in Pakistan (which has nukes and the means to deliver them) or Algeria
or Yemen. And it'll do this when the US military is tied up occupying
Iraq.

To figure out a solution to this problem is not going to be easy. And
to repeat: I don't think it can be done as long as we restrict ourselves
to the tools of 19th century Realpolitik or 20th century Oil diplomacy.

I don't see anything on this list that justifies a war.  And Stross's note 
about (d) is particularly well-taken, i.e., it's _their oil dammit_ and if 
you don't like that you should be spending money on nuclear power plants, 
not soldiers.

I know doodlysquat about international diplomacy, which is an incredibly 
complex profession that requires years and years of training to even begin 
to comprehend.  I can imagine possible scenarios where all of this makes 
sense; i.e., some very sincere people from three-letter-acronym branches 
of government had a little chat with Bush in which they explained that 
while the Homeland Security office will not actually *prevent* the loss of 
major US cities to nukes, it will delay it by a couple of years and result 
in the loss of only one or two cities instead of several dozen.  Or that 
if you don't depose the current regimes in Iraq and North Korea *today*, 
Mr. Bush, no matter how bad it looks in the international community, they 
will have biological weapons capable of wiping out 90% of the human 
population within the next five years.  And if so I would not expect this 
explanation to appear in the newspaper.

But, even though I know practically nothing about all this, even though 
I'm working with information that has passed through the media and is 
therefore probably even worse than nothing, it still looks to me like 
there is almost no possibility that the Bush administration is 
implementing any kind of policy that I would agree with if I understood it 
better.  It seems more like first steps in the establishment of an 
American Empire, including the repression of dissent at home.

I'm currently trying to convince him to dig up a less academic-oriented
piece of writing or digest of his research directions for a popular
audience, if he has such a thing. I've read a number of his shorter
publications and summaries that are very good and relevant, but would never
publish on the Longevity Meme because they're in academicese.

What do you mean by the ethical perspective? I didn't notice anything
particularly unusual in his writing, but then that may be more of a
statement of my views than anything else.

amazon cites promo summary:

===
Visionary author Bruce Sterling views the future like no other writer. In
his first nonfiction book since his classic The Hacker Crackdown, Sterling
describes the world our children might be living in over the next fifty
years and what to expect next in culture, geopolitics, and business.

Time calls Bruce Sterling "one of America's best-known science fiction
writers and perhaps the sharpest observer of our media-choked culture
working today in any genre." Tomorrow Now is, as Sterling wryly describes
it, "an ambitious, sprawling effort in thundering futurist punditry, in the
pulsing vein of the futurists I've read and admired over the years: H. G.
Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and Alvin Toffler; Lewis Mumford, Reyner Banham,
Peter Drucker, and Michael Dertouzos. This book asks the future two
questions: What does it mean? and How does it feel? "

Taking a cue from one of William Shakespeare's greatest soliloquies,
Sterling devotes one chapter to each of the seven stages of humanity: birth,
school, love, war, politics, business, and old age. As our children progress
through Sterling's Shakespearean life cycle, they will encounter new
products; new weapons; new crimes; new moral conundrums, such as cloning and
genetic alteration; and new political movements, which will augur the way
wars of the future will be fought.

Here are some of the author's predictions:

. Human clone babies will grow into the bitterest and surliest adolescents
ever.
. Microbes will be more important than the family farm.
. Consumer items will look more and more like cuddly, squeezable pets.
. Tomorrow's kids will learn more from randomly clicking the Internet than
they ever will from their textbooks.
. Enemy governments will be nice to you and will badly want your tourist
money, but global outlaws will scheme to kill you, loudly and publicly, on
their Jihad TVs.
. The future of politics is blandness punctuated with insanity.
The future of activism belongs to a sophisticated, urbane global network
that can make money-the Disney World version of Al Qaeda.

Tomorrow Now will change the way you think about the future and our place in
it.

======

I... don't *think* so...

Stealing from a theif or a murderer (at least) is not really theft, or if it

<<Western dependence on middle-eastern oil doesn't just render us vulnerable
to middle-eastern dictators; it's morally corrupting in the same manner

No question. 

<<That doesn't

of Christianity espoused by the Aryan Nations. And it's got large-scale
financial support from the monarchy, which is terrified that if it doesn't
continue to support the mosques it will be overthrown in a revolution.

Shiite Bohras to various Sufi sects. The Wahabite response to these
is "kill the heretics!" Friendly folks.)  >>


British historian Bernard Lewis, has examplified the Wahabbis, as if the KKK 
had inherited Texas oil fields, early in the last century. No disagreement.

<<Worse. Let us assume a successful US invasion and occupation of Iraq. I'm
not going to speculate on what would happen if Saddam puts up a strong
resistance, or nukes Tel Aviv, or whatever, because those aren't the
worst outcomes. >>

One of the secrets of America's support for Israel, in dollars anyway, is the 
American expectation that if terorists or an military attack did inflict 
unacceptable damage on Tel Aviv, for example, one of the outcomes may be 
detonated Arab gulf oil fields, to wit: Saudi Oil taken offline. I believe 
this "relationship" evolved rather then was planned by anyone.  

The American Leadership love-affair with Saudi Princes, is going to come to 
an end, one way or another, and rather soon, I suppose. To my way of 
thinking, those peoples that wiped out 3000 Americans in one day, need to be 
violently, punished. Again I state that this is not a majoritarian view on 
this list, simply my own.

<<Al Qaida terrorism with the big
bucks of State terrorism. Worse, it might catalyse a similar revolution
in Pakistan (which has nukes and the means to deliver them) or Algeria
or Yemen. And it'll do this when the US military is tied up occupying
Iraq.

To figure out a solution to this problem is not going to be easy. And
to repeat: I don't think it can be done as long as we restrict ourselves
to the tools of 19th century Realpolitik or 20th century Oil diplomacy.



-- Charlie>>

I am unappologetic, regarding Islamic radicalism. I believe they need to be 
eliminated one way or the other.  The other path is new oil resources from 
West Africa (for one) as well as conservation technology and vast, new, 
resources to power transportation. This last category would be big money in, 
big money out, and fuels other then petrol.
This would choke the Wahabbis, and whether this war or peace I support that 
effort.

Extropes,

Since no one seems to have noticed--or perhaps just
didn't comment on it--allow me to pounce upon--but in
a "nice" way--what I found to be an irresistible
straight line from Eliezer, who wrote:

"Well, I wasn't there, but if you want to know how the
sixties look from the perspective of today's average

       *****Average Youth!!!!!*****

On Singularius, the loosely federated Dyson/Matrioshka
ring world between Mars and Jupiter, perhaps. 

And don't bother protesting that Jovian proximity
tends to destabilize the orbits of "the zingering", 
as it is called, because, as anyone well-versed in
these matters knows, the Jovian gravity well is
converted to an advantage whenever possible, as, for
example, when it's used as a launch 'slingshot' to
wherever.

        ----------------------

Semi-seriously though, your assessment of the sixties,
Eliezer, is a bit glum.  Despite some serious 
business--Vietnam, free-speech-on-campus, and the
civil, women's, and gay, rights movements--it was a
big-ass, coast-to-coast par-tee!  And you shouldn't
dis college for the masses.  It, of course, has its
problems: homework, tedium, orthodoxy, hoop-jumping,
dollops of irrelevance and obsolescence.  But at its
worst it is light-years ahead of not going, and
college in the sixties was seriously great: sex,
drugs, rock and roll, freedom, the good fight, and a
multivarious education--the good, the bad, and the
ugly--comin' at you from every direction, all rolled
into one tribal celebration slash rite of passage.  Oh
baby, it was hot!  (Sure, there were some
casualties--and we feel bad about that--but that's
just life, no matter the era.  And if we didn't
achieve our utopian dreams, well,..."A man's--and now
since the sixties, a woman's--reach should exceed
his(her) grasp.")

And now it is your time, Eliezer.  There are plenty of
like-minded naturally-amped-up-by-the-adventure young
people both local and globally-linked who want nothing
more than to "Party to the Singularity".  Carpe diem,
my friend.  I wish you well.

Since so many of the replies were less than germaine
to the question I raised, I've decided to restart the
thread.

To clarify matters, raising a question does not imply
a position on the part of the questioner, does it?

For those who somehow reinterpreted my original post
to fit whatever they felt like saying, I was trying to
bring up a specific, narrowly defined issue:

If Conrad's hypothesis is correct and those in power
in the U.S. understand it and agree with it, then what
alternative do they realistically have other than to
try to impose a worldwide U.S. hegemony?

Clearly the U.N. is not up to the task of trying to
police the world.  Perhaps if the U.S. were
aggressively leading the U.N. in a real, full-blown
campaign to root out terrorists globally - which is
what it would take - then it could be accomplished. 
The end result would be a true one-world state,
however it was configured.  

Why would the rest of the world's nation states sign
on?  Maybe because they are also under the gun?  Maybe
to avoid being left out and ultimately losing their
remaining sovereignty under less pleasant terms?

In my reports on Westercon, I discussed Tad Daley's
911 discussion, in which he proposed an Earth
Federation, similar to that envisioned in Star Trek. 
(Daley (sp?) is a liberal and was directly involved in
establishing the World Court that is specifically
targetted at people like Milosovic.)

As a libertarian anarcho-capitalist, the prospects I
have outlined as likely if the hypothesis is true are
certainly not to my preference.  That doesn't make
them less likely, except to the degree that I or
others might be able to act to create some kind of
alternative.  

I asked Conrad, when he first presented his
conclusions to me in that late '70's discussion,
~"Surely, since I know that you are also an
anarcho-capitalist, you are NOT advocating that the
STATE run this universal surveillance system."

His reply was ~"Certainly not.  The state couldn't do
it effectively enough for reasons we both understand. 
Only a self-corrective market system could.  So, the
insurance companies would charge astronomical premiums
for someone who wanted to keep a nuke in their garage.
 How would they know?  They wouldn't insure you unless
you agreed to reasonable inspections - that's common
practice with insurance now.  Secondly, they would
hire detective agencies to maintain a level of
surveillance likely to deter people who might try to
create dangers not covered by their premiums. 
Finally, they could offer rewards to free-lancers who
found premium violaters, and write into their coverage
clauses for extreme penalties as well to pay the
rewards to the free-lancers."

Such a system is probably about as good as one can
reasonably expect.  As for the monopoly state, one
question (among many) is always, "who guards the
guards?"  Other proposed solutions that appeared on
this forum that involve advanced technologies, SI's,
etc. assume that the SI's, etc. won't be part of the
problem.  We don't have those technologies yet,
anyway, and may not for a couple decades.  The threat
is a lot closer.

We don't have the kind of system Conrad discussed,
either.  So, making a radical assumption for a moment
that Bush and Co. are not in fact
crypto-anarcho-capitalists, then we have to assume
that they will use what they have.

The evidence for this hypothesis, BTW, is indirect,
but rather compelling.  When my TV came on that
morning of 911, just in time to show and record the
first tower falling, my reaction was simply, "Ah, here
it is."

Those of us who work professionally in the security
industry and have access to the professional trade
magazines were only surprised at one thing:  That it
too SO LONG to get here.  

911 could just as easily have happened in the '80's,
or the '70's, even.  The fact that no really major
terrorist event (and 911 is still far from as bad as
it could get, even using very primitive means) had
occurred up till then suggests two interpretations:

1. The perps weren't out there or motivated enough.

2. All the prior attempts were stopped behind the
scenes.

There could be a mix of both, obviously, but I really
don't buy into #1 very much.  I suspect that a whole
lot of terrorist plots got stopped in their tracks by
well-planted, long-term moles, and a whole lot of
people - CIA, NSA, FBI, KGB, M5, Mossad - who worked
for long decades to stay on top of the problem.  

In the long-term, they finally failed.  One failure in
that business can be very bad.  But, with the onrush
of Conrad's thesis, 911 gave them one thing they
didn't have before: a justification for pulling out
all the stops.  Which is where we are now.

If that scenario is even close to being on target,
then we are in for some truly tumultuous years.  The
real question is how we can preserve as much of our
freedom as possible while this goes down, and how we
can ultimately replace the top-down structure that may
be coming with something that can work long term, such
as what Conrad suggested.

BTW, Conrad was a co-developer of the theories that
ultimately came under the name "nanotechnology."  

Conrad told me, in our most recent conversation a few
years ago (after I finally tracked him down after
twenty years), that he was responsible for forcing
Drexler to publish "Engines of Creation."  Drexler,
according to Conrad, thought that the genie could be
kept in the bottle, known only to a select few in
positions of high power.  

Forget all Drexler's arguments that if the good guys
didn't develop nanotech, they would end up blind-sided
by the rogues, etc.  Recall that in spite of making
this argument re nanotech, Drexler then turned around
and made exactly the opposite argument re SI's!! 
Keeping the lid on AI's is feasible?  But not
nanotech?  Come ON...

Anyway, Conrad threatened to publish if Drexler
didn't, or that's his story.  You can believe who you will....

SING, DANCE, REJOICE-CORPORATE PERSONHOOD IS DOOMED

A Review of Thom Hartmann's Unequal Protection: the Rise of Corporate
Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights

by Richard W. Behan

Unequal Protection may prove to be the most significant book in the history
of corporate personhood, a doctrine which dates to 1886. For 116 years,
corporate personhood has been scrutinized and criticized, but never
seriously threatened. Now Thom Hartmann has discovered a fatal legal flaw in
its origin: corporate personhood is doomed.

What is "corporate personhood?" Suppose, to keep Wal-Mart at bay, your
county commissioners enact an ordinance prohibiting Wal-Mart from doing
business in your county. The subsequent (and immediate) lawsuit would be a
slam-dunk for Wal-Mart's lawyers, because this corporation enjoys-just as
you and I do as living, breathing citizens-the Constitutional rights of "due
process" and "equal protection." Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. is a person, not in
fact, not in flesh, not in any tangible form, but in law.

To their everlasting glory, this is not what the Founding Fathers intended,
as Mr. Hartmann explains in rich and engaging detail. And for 100 years
after the Constitution was ratified, various governmental entities led
corporations around on leashes, like obedient puppies, canceling their
charters promptly if they compromised the public good in any way. The
leashes broke in 1886, the puppies got away, and the public good was
increasingly compromised-until it was finally displaced altogether.

Today, the First Amendment protects the right of corporations-as-persons to
finance political campaigns and to employ lobbyists, who then specify and
redeem the incurred obligations. Democracy has been transformed into a
crypto-plutocracy, and public policy is no longer crafted to serve the
American people at large. It is shaped instead to maintain, protect, enhance
or create opportunities for corporate profit.

One recent example took place after Mr. Hartmann's book was written.
Senators Patty Murray from Washington and Ted Stevens from Alaska inserted a
last-minute provision in this year's defense appropriation bill. It directed
the Air Force to lease, for ten years, one hundred Boeing 767 airplanes,
built and configured as passenger liners, to serve as aerial refueling
tankers. Including the costs of removing the seats and installing the tanks,
and then reversing the process ten years from now, the program will cost $17
billion. The Air Force never asked for these planes, and they weren't in
President Bush's budget for the Defense Department. Political contributions
from the Boeing company totaled $640,000 in the 2000 election cycle,
including $20,230 for Senator Murray and $31,100 for Senator Stevens.

The chairman of the CSX Corporation, Mr. John Snow, has been nominated by
President Bush to be the new Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Snow's company,
another legal person, exercised its Constitutional rights by contributing
$5.9 million to various campaigns-three-quarters of it to Republicans-over
seven election cycles. It was a wise investment. In 3 of the last 4 years,
averaging $250 million in annual profits, CSX paid no federal income taxes
at all. Instead, it received $164 million in tax rebates-money paid to the
company by the Treasury Department.

No, this is not what the Founding Fathers intended democracy to be. Thomas
Jefferson and James Madison, as Mr. Hartmann details, were seriously anxious
about "moneyed corporations" and their potential interference in public
affairs. The Bill of Rights these two men drafted contained the ten
Constitutional amendments that survive, and two more that did not: one was
to control corporate expansion and dominance. (The other was to prohibit a
standing army.)

As the 19th century wore on American corporations entered lawsuit after
lawsuit to achieve a strategic objective: corporate personhood. With that,
they could break the leashes of social control and regulation. They could
sue county commissioners. Or lease their unsold airliners to the Air Force.
Or collect millions in tax rebates.

In his spellbinding Chapter 6-"The Deciding Moment"-Mr. Hartmann tells how
corporate personhood was achieved.

Orthodoxy has it the Supreme Court decided in 1886, in a case called Santa
Clara County v. the Southern Pacific Railroad, that corporations were indeed
legal persons. I express that view myself, in a recent book. So do many
others. So do many law schools. We are all wrong.

Mr. Hartmann undertook instead a conscientious search. He finally found the
contemporary casebook, published in 1886, blew the dust away, and read Santa
Clara County in the original, so to speak. Nowhere in the formal, written
decision of the Court did he find corporate personhood mentioned. Not a
word. The Supreme Court did NOT establish corporate personhood in Santa
Clara County.

In the casebook "headnote," however, Mr. Hartmann read this statement: "The
defendant Corporations are persons within the intent of the clause in
section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendmentwhich forbids a State to deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Here,
anyway, corporate personhood was "provided"- in the headnote, instead of the
formal written decision of the Supreme Court. But that's not good enough.

What is a "headnote?" It is the summary description of a court decision,
written into the casebook by the court reporter. It is similar to an
editor's "abstract" in a scientific journal. Because they are not products
of the court itself, however, headnotes carry no legal weight; they can
establish no precedent in law. Corporate personhood, Mr. Hartmann
discovered, is simply and unequivocally illegitimate.

The court reporter for Santa Clara County was Mr. John Chandler Bancroft
Davis, a graduate of Harvard Law School.

Mr. Hartman has in his personal library 12 books by Davis, mostly original
editions. They display Davis's close alliance with the railroad industry,
and they support persuasively Mr. Hartmann's argument that Davis injected
the personhood statement deliberately, to achieve by deceit what
corporations had so far failed to achieve in litigation.

If Davis knew his headnote was legally sterile, though, we can only
speculate about his tactics. Perhaps he thought judges in the future would
read his headnote as if it could serve as legal precedent, and would
thereafter invoke corporate personhood in rendering court decisions. That
would be grossly irregular, and it would place corporate personhood in
stupendous legal jeopardy if it ever came to light. But something of that
sort must have happened, because corporate personhood over time spread
throughout the world of commerce-and politics.

Mr. Hartmann doesn't fill in this blank, but his daylighting of the
irregularity will be the eventual undoing of corporate personhood. Its
alleged source in Santa Clara County is a myth, a lie, a fraud. Corporate
personhood simply cannot now survive, after Mr. Hartmann's book, a rigorous
and sustained legal attack.

Sustained it will have to be, for years or decades or even longer:
corporations will fight the attack bitterly, but we now know corporate
personhood has utterly no basis in law.

Clearly, it *can*. Just as using the passive voice can serve to deflect or disarm--or be read as an attempt to do same.

Clearly, also, humans get very good at "attacking the man", rather than discussing the question.

Further I say not.

You have a gift for studiously missing the point.  You also seem to have 
a lot of bile.   The US has annouced it will do whatever it considers to 
be in its interest without approval of UN, without being subject to any 
sort of world court and without regard for the borders of sovereign 
nations, pesky treaties, niceties like a declaration of war and so on. 
 That strikes me as more than a little dangerous and worrisome.  How 
does it strike you?  There is certainly no question of us being 
"people-pleasers".  There is a very valid question of whether we are 
claiming the right and intent to become the biggest and most dangerous 
rogue nation of all.

Well, this will keep you from asking whether you (US) are doing things 
that cause legitimate concern and upset and whether those are wise, 
reasonable, ethical and responsible things to do.    Why on earth do you 
prattle on as if the only alternative to doing whatever we please, 
whenever we please is to be a total non-entity?

The dynamical behavior of traversable wormholes and black holes under 
impulsive radiation is studied in an exactly soluble dilaton gravity model. 
Simple solutions are presented where a traversable wormhole is constructed 
from a black hole, or the throat of a wormhole is stably enlarged or reduced. 
These solutions illustrate the basic operating principles needed to construct 
similar analytic solutions in full Einstein gravity.

Yes it does, almost always.  I have extensively studied the methodology used
for psychological assessments, educational measurements, statistical
measurements, technical auditing, and investigative interrogation.  They all
suffer from this same problem.  It is extremely difficult to write a totally
neutral question that merely gathers information.

Even an objective sounding question like, "How often do you back up your
PC?" clearly imply that backups should be done and that the person will be
deemed deficient if they don't perform them often enough.  This type of
wording encourages people toward answering "yes" even if they don't, and
indicating higher frequencies than actually occur.  It is very difficult to
reword this question to gather the information without implying what the
correct answer should be.

Why settle for second best, it seems to me the ability to do whatever we
please whenever we please is quite wonderful, especially if the things we 
do are good, like getting rid of the Taliban in Afghanistan a year ago. 
As for Iraq, there is no doubt that having Saddam assume room 
temperature would be a good thing for Iraq and the world. There
is only one question worth asking, is the price to do that is too high?
I don't know the answer.

Before getting rid of the Taliban we supported the Taliban.  Before Iraq was
our enemy we supported them against Iran when they were the enemy.  Before
Iran released our hostages, we made deals to give them arms.  Before Osama
bin Laden was an enemy combatant he was a recipient of CIA support.  Before
Noriega was arrested he was on the US secret payroll.

The CIA has switched sides or played both sides against the middle for so
long that most of these terrorist situations end up having our own resources
used against us.  While the US is wondering why other countries aren't
supporting our war against terrorism, other countries are wondering why we
were training and supplying the terrorists in the first place.

It is a complicated situation and it is not clear that what the US does is
good.  Most other countries don't like what the US is doing to them.  Many
US citizens don't like what our government is doing to its own people.  If
any foreign country suspended civil liberties and disregarded its own laws
and its own treaties the way the US is doing now, they would be declared a
rogue state.

Careful.  So spoke those who have worn iron mail and tramped on all 
those who disagreed throughout history.  Might does not make right.  We 
either act wisely or we head mightily toward our own undoing.

A lot depends on how a thing is done and on why and especially on what 
comes next.  Things are seldom so simple as just smiting the current 
symbol of all that is wrong.   What happens after we go  invade Iraq and 
depose Saddam?  Is the likely long protracted holding action worth it? 
 Is the number of dead worth it?  Is the great fear and animosity added 
to immensely worth it?  Is this "good"?

This is a good question and I am glad you ask it.  Here is another good 
question and a harder one to face and answer.  Are we becoming that 
which we would very much not wish to be and losing that which we 
considered most precious in the name of vengeance and "safety"?    Are 
we becoming that which we have always abhorred elsewhere, a police state 
with autocratic powers toward any and all who offend it anywhere in the 
world?   We are the only super-power (more or less).  But with great 
power comes not only great responsibility but great danger of its abuse.

Even if it's true, why is cloning a just another animal in a long series 
newsworthy? Even if the baby was healthy (which it's not), what's the

The point is that when you think you have been abducted by an alien
it seems to be a sign that one has lost the ability to reason very well.

Yes, but that's not exact news. We're not rational as well. But the bulk
of humanity operates in a far more wacked out regime, which even results
in death and destruction. Raelians (one of whom I had on transhumantech
list as a subscriber for a while) look like relatively benign nutters
(though of course one quite never tell in advance whether they're into
Kool Aid or want to catch a ride on the next comet).

Samantha,
       It seems to me we are at a cusp in the affairs of man.  McGee is 
saying that we're in the early stages of a new renaissance.  He says further 
that we have had several renaissances before and none have been particularly 
gentle on mankind.  Thomas L. Friedman in his book The Lexis & the Olive Tree 
is also predicting a clash.  If you read the Bell Curve and follow the 
resulting argument you will find evidence that back about 1900 the economy 
became sufficiently high tech that the five or ten percent of the brightest 
people became favored to run that economy.  Since then that segment of the 
population has been coming into community and taking over the operation of 
the society.  The Extropians in turn have their own reasons for see dramatic 
change afoot.
       But it seems to me that in the midst of this change we still have an 
assumption that we can analyze what is going on using the standards and 
thought processes of yesterday.
       You question whether or not the U. S. is becoming a Rogue Nation.  You 
or others use the term Empire in connection with the U. S.  
       Of course we are a rogue nation to every citizen on this globe that 
demands we do things their way or serve their needs instead of out own.
       We are frightening to every country that is capable of settling 
Sadaams hash themselves but would prefer that we suffer the death of a 
thousand cuts rather than possibly unleash something they cannot control.
       But none of that means that we are wrong to look out for ourselves.  
We once defeated Germany and occupied that country but we got out and 
returned the country to the Germans.  We did the same with Japan.  We did not 
defeat France but we ran the Germans out before returning the country to its 
owners.  Cuba, the Philippines, and others are also free to do as they please 
because of us.  The evidence is that we can be trusted to do the responsible 
thing despite the mutterings of tired old socialists in their dusty berets 
nerves a jangle from contemplating their latest failures and drinking too 
much expressio in their coffee houses.
       Yeah Samantha, I know I over did the expression in that last 
paragraph.  <G>  But the hysteria over our knocking down Sadaam before he 
triggers a bomb is also vastly overblown.  Empire?  Rogue?  What else?

Harvey,
       I guess you are arguing that unless we have been perfect, flawless and 
above reproach we have no right to take action.  Does that include not having 
the right to correct our own mistakes and clean up any mess that we might of 
made in the past?  Does that mean that the Hitlers, Stalins and Sadaams are 
free to act but that we aren't because they alledge that once upon a time we 
made a mistake?
       BTW, how do you know whose name appears on a secret payroll?  Is that 
like the "secret airport" of fiction?  I always wondered about those -- how 
do you hide an airport?

Extropes,

I suppose everyone noticed the delivery (if true) by
Caesarian--which is to say at the moment of their
choosing--on Christmas day.  How very biblical.  The
Raelians have their own Christ child.  Somebody wake
me, this dream is too weird.

Best, Jeff Davis

I agree with you about the animal part.  If this is true, however, it will
certainly capture the world's attention no matter how "out to lunch" the
Raelians are.   (Come to think of it, many nutjobs have been capturing the
world's attention lately ...).

"We"?  I don't see you making the decisions.  Anyway, no, the ability for 
the US government to do whatever it pleases whenever it pleases is not 
necessarily a good thing for either you, or Earth.  Or even the US 
government, if the actions are stupid.  And it seems to me that they are.

An alternate subject might be "A strange thing happened on the
way to the Forum" (which I think is an old movie title).

Recently on the Europa Icepick mailing list, there was a post
pointing out that plutonium was the most recent superconductor.
There ensued a number of posts in which I questioned whether the
T_sc would be known for all of the isotopes of Pu (there are something
like 16 with varying rates of decay) and another (well respected)
individual said they should all be the same.  We went back and forth
on this (neither of us being experts in superconductivity) several times.

Then I got the bright idea of asking Google.  A simple search on
"superconductivty isotope" turned up a fair number of papers.
It turns out effect of the isotope has been studied with at least
isotopes of O, Mg and Si (in various different types of superconductors).
[I'm actually rather amazed that we have isotope separation abilities
in that many elements.] I didn't even have to go past the first page.
There *is* a difference in the T_sc temperature in materials composed
of different isotopes though the effect seems to be only a few deg. K.

Two conclusions:
1. Ask Google -- it knows more than any of us if you can figure out
   how to extract the data.

2. There ought to be an interesting cartoon using their christmas icon
   (see the Google home page) with someone holding a shotgun in front
    of the animals saying "Answer my question or *else*!").

Those of you with artistic skills might think of making up something
along these lines and sending it off to Google.  I'm sure they would
enjoy it.

I would heartily recommend everyone to read Robert Wright's analysis and
proposals for a sensible war on terrorism, if you haven't already done
so:

http://slate.msn.com/id/2070210/entry/2070211/

I think he makes a pretty good case about why pissing a lot of people
off can be equated with a very low near-future national security for
the US. As he says "it's all about the memes". And from where I'm
sitting here, all comfortable on my ass looking at the world, the US
is doing a terrible job of making sure we'll have an overwhelming
supply of the wrong memes around for such near-future.

The USA never supported the Taliban but it did support people who would
years later become the Taliban. It must have seemed like a good idea at the
time, they were fighting evil, the USSR,  and nobody predicted they would
resent the USA for having helped them, I don't fully understand it to this
day.

    >Before Iraq was  our enemy we supported them against Iran

True and that was a mistake, the USA makes lots of mistakes, but again I can
see why it looked like a good idea at the time.

Many thing are morally ambiguous but not everything is, going to war against
Afghanistan one year ago was a flat out good idea, I'll let you know in one
year if the war with Iraq was equally wise.

John,
       If you remember your childhood perhaps you were unlucky enough to have 
encountered one or more bullies.
       I did so and recall how they so often made the argument that because 
their victim (sometimes that was me) was not morally (it was alleged) as pure 
as the driven snow the victim was not morally justified in protecting 
themselves.
       Because we allegedly supported the taliban, Ho Chi Minh, Castro, etc. 
at some time in the past we unleashed a chain of evil upon the world that we 
are not morally qualified to resist.  That argument is logically a non 
starter.  It didn't fool many people on the school ground and it carries no 
weight here, IMHO.

### The methods you advocate are consistent with a siege mentality. Constant
vigilance, heroic efforts at defense. Being on the lookout for unpredictable
dangers, rearranging your lifestyle to suit them.

There is another strategy - to boldly go and attack the attacker. The choice
of the correct strategy, or the mixture of the two, will be dictated by an
analysis of all relevant information, including the physical nature of the
threat, available means of social organization, and information processing
and availability.

Somehow, adopting the pure siege mentality you seem to advocate, is IMO
inappropriate in the case of biological and nuclear threats. Detecting
merely the threats themselves is difficult, and usually means acting after
the horse left the barn: after a successful aerial anthrax attack, or a
dirty-bomb explosion in Manhattan, the economic harm is already
accomplished. It's better to be proactive, at least as long as you have the
means of actually achieving prevention.

A network of sensors detecting microbiological threats without the network
of sensors for detecting their makers is like looking only at the boot
that's kicking you: "Ouch, it kicked me on the left flank, have to cover the
left flank", "Ai, now it kicked me in the ass, need one more hand to keep it
covered", "I see it's moving towards my baAAAAA...".

In real life we can expect that a combination of "blanket realtime agent
detection and user notification" and universal surveillance will be used.
Hopefully with enough sousveillance to keep the system from turning into an
unkillable monstrosity.

That's the problem with US actions.  We assume that everybody sees our side
as good, the other side as evil, and can't predict that the people will
revolt.  We are doing it again in Iraq.  I really doubt there is a
groundswell of support within Iraq hoping that we will overthrow their
government and liberate their people.  They don't want our "help" or
"liberation".  I don't know why the US can't see this.  Claims that they do
want our help is just wishful thinking at best or disinformation at worst.
When we mischaracterize the situation we naturally create faulty
predictions.  Iraq will turn into a big mess like Vietnam or Afghanistan,
and everybody will act surprised and claim that the mess was unexpected.

So can I.  Can you also see how the locals might blame us for our mistake
and what we left behind?  I don't expect the US to be perfect, but the
confusion about why anybody might hate us or not support us does seem to
turn a blind eye to our past actions.

You are mostly focusing on the anti-terrorist activities.  Do you also think
universal surveillance is good, secret trials are good, government
monitoring of all internet activities and credit card purchases is good?  It
is easy to praise the government for what it does to other people.  What do
you think about the government's curtailing of rights for us here at home?
If you get arrested, will you be glad to forgo your right to an attorney, a
jury trial, a phone call, the right to see the evidence against you and to
face your accusers?  When it comes to your own rights, will you be as happy
to give them away?

Not at all.  I'm saying that we don't have to violate the rights of US
citizens to protect US citizens.  I'm saying that we don't have to discard
the sovereignty of other nations to protect our own sovereignty.  I'm saying
that we wouldn't allow other countries to do what we do, so it seems
unlikely that they will hold any different position.

Nope.  I never advocated these positions.  We should clean up our mistakes.
I am glad we are doing so.  But we don't need to wage a disinformation
propaganda war to blame our mistakes on somebody else.  The original thread
was implying that everything we do is good and we can't understand why other
countries don't see this.  I am pointing out that we aren't perfect, we have
made mistakes, and other countries are wondering why we don't see this.

Harvey, I am glad you aren't arguing that.  I don't believe your other 
arguments hold any water either.  But the Saturday after Christmas my family 
celebrates a ritual called Breakfast with Mom.  Our entire family comes from 
all over to have breakfast in a private dining room with my mother in the St.

you later.  <G>

Regardless what they're consistent with, they are methods *which work*. As

Constant vigilance is what automation is for. There's nothing very heroic
in a distributed society. The defense is purely passive; and hence will
work regardless of whatever you're deploying. As long as you're not
dropping ecovorous nanoplagues, or planet crackers.

Today some 30 people in a government building were blown up in Grozny by 
two suicide bombers, driving a jeep, and a truck loaded with explosive. 
The entire building has been destroyed.

Now consider eGovernment. No customers, no central office. What is there 
to blow up? Nothing. There's even nothing to DoS in a P2P based 
infrastructure. You can't even find the physical location of the clerk, 
until she reveals it herself. Now here's the cleanest solution ever.

> for unpredictable dangers, rearranging your lifestyle to suit them.

That's the whole point: the dangers are predictable. Somebody will launch
attacks against assemblies of people, or assemblies of hardware. Remove
the target, and there is nothing to attack. Make an audit over the
landscape (not much to audit in Gobi, Serengeti, the Pacific, etc). Look
at concentrations of people, large fluxes, high potential energy, etc. It
isn't rocket science.

Of course. People will still track fissibles and fissible precursors, as 
well as the usual suspects in chem and bio production.

It's just it's not going to work. Tracking is never quantitative, and as
such can only be a supportive solution. And tracking has to end where
privacy starts. Because that price tag is a bit too much to afford.

Wrong metaphor. I'm not in the cage, I'm distributed all over the 
landscape so that the lion can't even find me. Instead of a herd of gnus, 
think of a herd of mice.

Consider the monkey factors which make Manhattan Manhattan. Now develop a

The network of sensors detecting aerosols and pathogen DNA is doing just 
that: detecting aerosols and pathogen DNA. A network designed to catch 
people will unfortunately require a dragnet approach over the entire 
population. Whoever deploys that dragnet has essentially unlimited power.

They can't see it because it is far from obvious and it may even be untrue,
I'll tell you a year from now.

I will be appalled if Iraq turns out like Vietnam and delighted if it turns
out half as good as Afghanistan. I have a hunch it will be closer to
Afghanistan but I could be wrong, I hope not.

I'm not confused why the Islamic world hates the west and the USA in
particular, America is the only surviving superpower and that does not tend
to make one lovable especially if they are of a different religious
franchise. More important, Islam is a declining civilization and has been
doing so for 500 years, what is worse they know it, America is not declining
with them and this makes them angry. I do not think you can point to some
foreign policy decision and say that is the cause of the anger in the
mid-east because in its history Russia has committed astronomically more
outrages against Islam than America but it is America they really hate.

I do confess to being confused as to why the Taliban would hate us so much
even by Islamic standards after we helped many of them, I guess it's just a
case of no good deed going unpunished.

I see no sign of wholesale curtailment of rights here at home but yes, at
one time I would have been outraged at the government's recent actions, now
I'm just uneasy. It's a different world after 911.

### It reminds of an old cure for the sniffles - cut off your nose.
Sometimes you have to buckle before the inevitable and change your lifestyle
(e.g. start bathing to get rid of fleas, to reduce the risk of the plague),
but sometimes it's enough to kill the rats.

BTW, I am not *against* decentralization and agent detection - I strongly
support the distributed suburban lifestyle, but I don't think it's enough.

So tell me how to apply constant vigilance to preserving 
freedom.  K?  Cause otherwise your constant vigilance sounds 
like being utterly powerless and at the mercy of the State. 
"Safety" isn't worth that to me.  Not remotely.

So let's treat everyone like a sniper.  Thanks, Mr. Sniper, for

### As I said, it's the exact opposite of what you say - only once you see
who the sniper is, you can deal with him, otherwise you *have to* be afraid
of every passing car. And I said this long before Mr and Mr Sniper emerged

Give Osama another 19 jerks willing to die for Allah, to drive to a mall,
shoot somebody, drive to another county, shoot somebody else, once a week,
then go to NY, stab somebody in a dark alley, leave an identification object
(a copy of the Koran maybe), and keep up God's work until caught - this
would be a drawn-out pandemonium, without a good system of surveillance it
would last for months. By then 99% of the population would have learned the
lesson.

I found further description of Santa Clara County vs Southern                 
Pacific Railroad Company, 118 US 394, at                                      
http://www.ratical.org/corporations/SCvSPR1886.html.  This is                 
the case which established the doctrine that corporations are                 
legally people with Constitutional rights, a decision which some              
find highly objectionable.  Personally I don't see the problem; if            
people are entitled to make campaign contributions as individuals,            
for example, they ought to be able to join together and do so.                

In any case I studied portions of the decision, and contrary to the           
claims made by the revisionists, I did find mention of the 14th               
amendment as applying to the corporations.  To wit,                           

"The special grounds of defense by each of the defendants were: ...           
(2) That the provisions of the constitution and laws of California...         
are in violation of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution, in          
so far as they require the assessment of their property at its full           
money value... thus imposing upon the defendant unequal burdens, and          
to that extent denying to it the equal protection of the laws."               

The defendant being the Southern Pacific Railroad, to invoke the              
14th amendment it must be considered a person.  The lower court               
judge had upheld this argument:                                               

"The record contains elaborate opinions stating the grounds upon which        
judgments were ordered for the defendants. Mr. Justice FIELD overruled        
the first of the special defenses above named, but sustained the second."     

In endorsing this decision, the Supreme Court is agreeing with the            
doctrine of corporate personhood.  Contrary to the claims of the              
article MMB posted, this was not something that the court clerk made          
up on his own.  It was an implicit part of the court's decision.

Its newsworthy because its possible that they have 
actually done it. If an organisation is willing to put 
aside such ethical considerations as the health of the
baby and the number of attempts that are likely
to be required to get success the degree of technical
difficulty is not that great. The degree of technical
difficulty *may* not even be beyond Clonaid and the
Raelians.

Its also relatively easy to check if it has been successfully
done by getting independent DNA samples from the baby
and from the DNA donor source. If this doesn't happen in
a reasonable timeframe (eight days or so is something thats
been bandied about) then we're seeing just an irritating 
and politically quite a harmful hoax. Harmful to the roll out
time of stem cell therapies for those that could use them. 
Therapeutic cloning *would be* an accelerant to the
understanding of cellular biology that leads on to cures
even if it was not itself ultimately used in a commercial
contexts to provide cures. 

For 8 months of the last year I have been acting as a 
lobbyist to the stem cell industry which involves keeping a
finger on the political pulse not just here in Australia but
to some extent around the world. 

Responsible researchers and patient advocacy groups
around the world that are in favour of somatic cell
nuclear transfer (usually termed "therapeutic cloning")
have adopted a near unified political position that reproductive
cloning should not be supported whilst "therapeutic cloning" 
should be. The public often failed to see the distinction
between the two types of cloning and indeed there isn't so 
much a difference in technique as there is a difference in
application of the technique. Both involve the process of 
somatic cell nuclear transfer and are essentially identical up
until the point where the 4 or 5 day old "embryo" (scientist's
 wouldn't call it an embryo but the term will  do) is either 
implanted (for reproductive cloning) or destroyed in order
to obtain the embryonic stem cells from the inner cell
mass to be used for therapeutic purposes (as the cells can
be grown indefinitely in culture and would not be rejected by
the body from which the cloned tissue was originally derived).
 
Hoax or not the period of time up until the cloned child's
existence or otherwise is proven will be extremely interesting 
and there will be political repercussions for therapeutic cloning
around the world. Clearly it will not be possible for laws 
to be put in place in the time to prevent the birth of a child
already alive and it will not take long to confirm if the child
really is a clone. Certainly less time than it would take to
put legislation in place in the US or in the UN to oppose
reproductive cloning.  

If there really is a cloned child its health rather than the 
validity of its existence will become the pressing political
question. (I haven't read anything yet about its health). In my
opinion, a healthy child would be a great boon for medicine
generally (it would demystify cloning) but an unhealthy one
(as seems far more likely based on the track record of non-
human clones) is likely to become a strong argument against
both reproductive and therapeutic cloning. 

Regardless of the outcome, for the record, in my opinion, this
procedure should not have been tried based on what was
commonly  known of the risks to the child and the extreme 
difficulty of the mother giving genuinely informed consent. But
for the particular child, and for the political situation the ethics
of its derivation are now largely moot. What matter politically
now is the outcome. The health of a lot of people may now be
linked politically to the health of this clone (or non-clone), as
the media will now "become" the political message.  
 
Even a well publicised hoax feeds into a negative political 
climate for somatic cell nuclear transfer or "therapeutic
cloning".

By "another," I meant, "different from that already
stated tens of times before."  

No one so far has really dealt with the hypothesis
that I presented.  Instead they either seem to want to
imply that somehow I am a proponent of something or
other that I am not, or go off on yet another useless
discussion of the morality of war, etc.

Let me once again try to make the issues clear:

I am proposing that possibly the people running things
in Washington, Bush & Co., actually understand that we
are approaching a truly apocalyptically dangerous
time, in which the species itself could be wiped out
by some nut cases with hi-tech means.  I referenced
Conrad Schneiker as he was the first source I know of
who stated the problem precisely - suggesting it as a
possible answer to the Fermi Paradox, as well, I seem
to recall.

The capacity to destroy en masse is rising
exponentially, and faster than the capacity to defend.
 We can project that this will continue.  What would
the logical response of Bush & Co., assuming that they
truly understood and believed the above and that they
really wanted to stop the destruction of the U.S. or
the species from happening, in fact be, if not to rush
toward a global hegemony in which no place would
remain for such terrorists to hide?  I.e., a globally
transparent society.

If so, then we can expect that if 911, Saddam, Korea,
et al are not sufficient, then other excuses may be
"found."  One way or another, the logic inescapably
leads to the conclusion that a very strong push toward
a world state - or at minimum, a "Federation," led by
the U.S., (of course) - is in the cards.  Of course,
maybe they're just playing oil games...  

It boils down to: are they that stupid?  If not, we
are in for some truly interesting times.  How we can
prepare for them and reduce the damage is the next
logical question.

Actually, we aren't at all close to any such thing.  We won'5 be 
until we have pretty full nanotech including widely available 
general assemblers.  Sure a knowledgeable psycho can whip up 
some really nasty bug, although not as easily as some seem to 
imply.  But the matter of having the bug at just the right level 
and kind of nastiness and dispersing it widely (or perhaps 
selectively) enough is not a trivial problem.  It is not within 
the range of a nutcase really.  So what the heck are we about? 
Are we scaring ourselves into giving government total access to 
every bit of our lives with total control soon to follow?  Has 
Big Government to save us from the alleted imminent and 
immediately gloabally catastrophic dark side of technology 
become the new gospel?  If so the I present that the luddites 
and the anti-freedom control-freaks have won this round.  I hope 
those who agree with this line of thinking take the time to 
understand what the price of this sort of "solution" for the 
alleged imminent problems really is.

> The capacity to destroy en masse is rising

No, it isn't.  It is not significantly higher now than it was a 
decade or two ago.  The capacity of states to destroy en masse 
has been huge for many decades.  Giving the largest state carte 
blanche to strike at will on suspicion all over the world 
doesn't exactly make the world less threatening.  Giving it the 
right to override all freedom and dignity of its citizens at 
will does not make us more "safe".

There is no such possible global hegemony unless the State truly 
is a greater tyranny with far less hope of escape than ever in 
human history.  That is far worse in my way of thinking than the 
supposed evil it is to protect us from.  "Globally transparent" 
is a polite way of saying "ultimate Big Brother oversight and 
control of all and everything".  Do not be fooled.  Please, 
before it is far too late.

Actually, increasing the heat of animosity toward a centralized 
power structure almost guarantees an increase of terrorism and 
other counter-measures.  This game cannot be won by greater and 
more widespread force and intrusion into the lives of all and 
sundry.  Fermi Paradox?  Most advanced civs trick themselves 
into becoming universal dictatorships and thus destroy their 
growing edge?

Are we stupid enough to advocate full transparency knowing the 
blatant illogic that will drive decisions of what to do with the 
resulting knowledge?  Remember that the game is rigged such that 
we are all criminals by some law or another many times a day. 
Add in full transparency and literally all of us must walk on 
eggs lest they come and haul us away perfectly legally any time 
they please if they find us somewhat annoying or worrisome.  Are 
there really human beings you trust with that much power?  Think 
War on Drugs, think laws against various types of sexuality and 
sexual expression, think the ever expanding definition of 
terrorism and moving those accused beyond any sort of "due 
process".  Think and oppose "the transparent society" as if your 
life depends on it.  It damn well does whether you realize it or 
not.

I agree it seems like that. Rightly or wrongly the Bush Administration
has done a poor job in putting coherent policies to the world community.
I hope, as much for the sake of the ordinary citiziens of the US and rest
of the world, as for the ordinary people of Iraq that a better case is made
before invading a soverign country.

I agreed with "desert shield" and "desert storm" because they were
actions taken in defence of a sovereign country - Kuwait. Not a
particularly pleasant sovereign country by some accounts but a
sovereign country recognized by the UN nonetheless. I agreed with
Bush senior's decision not to topple a sovereign head of state even
though it would have been convenient and politically popular. I actually
thought he may have been statesman-like in restraint.

I thought then that one day there may come a time when the soverignty
of countries might have to be overruled in order to give wider effect
to human rights internationally but I hoped that the transition to such
a time would be measured and deliberate not opportunistic and
incidental.

I was too young to have an opinion on the Vietnam war when it was
running but having listened to commentaries of senior advisors from
that era I can at least see that there was a sort of cogency in trying to
stop communism in Vietnam.

When George W. first talked of regime change it looked as
though Saddam Hussein was about to be punished for past actions
and for a poor reputation rather than for any evidence of anything
new. I saw it as a positive that the UN became more a part of the
process but whether the UN comes out with its credibility and
symbolism enhanced or diminished is still up for grabs.

The bottom line for me at present is that the case has simply not
been made that Iraq actually has weapons of mass destruction (in any
meaningful sense), let alone that Saddam Hussein would have chosen
to arm "terrorists" such as Al-Quida with them. It seems quite likely
to me that Saddam would not have armed "terrorists" as the danger
that terrorist actions would be traced back to him would have been
too high to run. Also the terrorists might have turned on him if it
suited there purposes to sell him out to save their own bacon. Perhaps
this happened and is the reason that the US is not able to disclose
information to the public. Too much dealing with unpleasant characters
to catch other unpleasant characters for the general public sensitivity.

Whether Saddam would have armed terrorists before is now likely
to be moot. If he has the capacity to arm terrorists now given the
Bush adminstrations clear intention to remove him at all costs he
is likely to conclude that all enemies of his enemies are now his
friends. He has to know his time for free action of any sort is now
extremely limited, that not only his life, but that of his family and
friends are now on the line. Such a situation is likely to make even
a reasonable and just man desperate and dangerous.

I'll keep on looking for evidence that the Bush adminstrations
actions are based on reasoned motives. I won't lose interest if,
or more likely, when Iraq is conquered militarily. I hope the Bush
administration will stop making it so hard to give it the benefit of
the doubt.

Indeed.

I'm amazed to see a bunch of extropians failing to think of the
future.  There will be a point where the programs to read the
proprietary formats will be obsolete or even might no longer run
on any computer.  Only human-readable formats will survive the
grinding of time.

Just think of the amount of information (both cultural and other)
that mankind is throwing out the window by not having it available
in a format that can be read without the help of machinery or
proprietary computer programs, both of which get outdated within
decades.

IIRC NASA has so much data on old 9-track tapes that they can't
read the data off the tapes again before the tapes disintegrate
from old age.  They've rescued a few tape drives from museums and
are moving data to newer media as fast as they can, but they
have to throw away a few decades worth of meteorological observations
and other valuable scientific data, simply because they don't have
enough working drives to read the data in time.

Exactly the same thing is happening with proprietary data formats,
the programs working with those formats will get out of date, the
hardware to read the media no longer exists and humanity will have
lost a piece of potentially valuable information.

I'm afraid we'll see information disapparear like this in our own
lifetimes, mostly ebooks and movies published in DVD format.

I wonder how to counter this loss of information, maybe we'd even
need some change in copyright law to prevent this from happening ?

regards,

Rik

    This is the 76'th update of my fly longevity experiments. Average
temperature was 25.5 C during this run. This run tests whether the
relatively good survival obtained with the combination of 125 mg
acetyl-L-carnitine, and 25 mg lipoic acid in run #73, was due to chance or
not.
    The present results indicate that this fortuitous result was indeed
due to chance. Both runs indicate that acetyl-L-carnitine by itself
slightly reduces longevity. This run indicates that 100 lipoic acid may
act to slightly increase survival.

Why would any other country agree to this?  

If we just declare ourselves the leader, wouldn't that
be a dictatorship?  If we enforce our leadership position
with our weapons and prevent other countries from developing
what we already have for ourselves, wouldn't that be the
same as a military take-over of the world?  If we expect
other countries to follow the UN, treaties, the world court,
while we are exempt, wouldn't that be the same as being
a rogue state?

It seems like countries would secretly develop militant
freedom fighters to combat such a foreign power before
it is too late.  Isn't this exactly what the terrorists
claim is happening?

I can't tell if you are claiming we are already doing
this, which would imply that the terrorists were right
all along, or if you are claiming that we should start
doing this, which could imply that we should become
what the terrorist claim for us.  Either way, it seems
to be a recipe for more terrorism.

I see the problem that they *aren't* treated as persons, for example, when wrongdoing is found.
How does one punish a corporation with loss of livelihood, incarceration or death? One doesn't.
One issues a token fine, and business contnues as usual.

Limited liability, combined with "personhood", appears to me to be the crux of the inequity.

The only good thing I can say about the military is that once they get
an idea
they pursue it if the ends justify the means.
Lets hope scientific discovery is programmed high on the list of
priorities of a prospective AI.  World domination should be a lesser
priority.
Serendipity is sometimes scary.
What if the Asteriod of 65 million years ago never happened, would there
be humans?
What will Organics evolve into after AI ?  Hopefully hundreds of new
species all able to "link" consciousness from time to time.  Hopefully
the AI's we create
will enjoy the company and diversity of organics and not see us as
vermin
to be eradicated to purify the ecosystem.

Hello all,

	HighLift Systems's proposal for a near-term space elevator piqued my
curiosity. Google returns little on scenarios for much cheaper launch
costs and less on how to model such things.

	I'd like some pointers on how-to model this sort of thing. I can use
Excel decently, and have Mathematica for any heavy work. My background
doesn't include economics, so if that means back to basics please say
so.

	Oh yes, please reply off-list.

I think that that depends on too many variables, and
that such a blanket statement is suspect.  Some times
a firm hand by a ruling nation or party succeeds in
intimidating or rooting out opposition, and some times
it fails.  One of the key variables is the motivational
structure of those out of power, or those who would
resist.  The best examples perhaps come from contemplating
all the various reactions to British imperial power in
the 18th and 19th centuries.  They would succeed in 
pacifying some areas, but not others.

A similar list of examples and counter-examples weakens
this claim.  Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini provide the
best 20th century counter-examples.

Clearly you wish to restrict the discussion to less
oppressive regimes, however, and wonder just what the
U.S. and other Western governments can do to minimize
resistance to the capitalist/free-market way of life
and encroachment into societies based on other principles.

Wouldn't you agree, instead, that it depends on how it
all comes down?  For example, most of us who are sympathetic
to transparency are hopeful that it is not used by Western
type democratic governments to cart people off in the middle
of the night, but that conversely, it brings government injustice
to public awareness.  It's not entirely naive to suppose that
public awareness can be effective; the newspapers were (and
still are) pretty effective at diminishing corruption the last
two centuries.

Yes, sadly this has been the tendency over the last
couple of generations, and the number of laws proliferates
so.  One only need think of the huge number of rules that
(I think) enable highway patrolmen to give you a ticket 
for something if they really want to.

But do you have examples of laws that most of us break
every month that are more than petty offenses payable
by small fines?

I have the same question about this, too.

> Are there really human beings you trust with that much power?

No.  But all modern democracies are structured so that 
seldom do even a few human beings working in concert
have that much power.  

> Think War on Drugs, think laws against various types of

Yes; this is one of those cases.  I suspect that if the
sheriff of Santa Clara county and two colleagues wanted
to put me in prison a long time, the proper evidence
could be "found" in my house to accomplish it.

But recall that if President Nixon had picked up the phone
and ordered various generals to arrest certain dissidents
or members of congress, these orders would not have been
obeyed.  To what degree are Ashcroft and his administration
allies in the U.S. able to suppress dissent?  (Very little
so far as I know.) 

> [we should] think the ever expanding definition of terrorism

It's always amazing to me how sometimes "sliding scale"
arguments are interesting and compelling, and how 
sometimes they merely embody self-regulating governors.
On some sliding scales, (e.g., more socialism in government)
a relentless growth process occurs.  On others, (e.g. how
much corruption occurs in western governments), the worse
it gets the more counter-measures are taken against it.
Crime in western countries similarly falls into this latter
category:  when there is too much, whether it's violent
crime or corporate fraud, more measures are taken against
it.

You appear to believe that the "ever expanding" definition
of just who is a terrorist falls into the former category.

> Think and oppose "the transparent society" as if your

The risks from moving towards transparency are obvious;
people in the past have often been safer when their
governments didn't know what they were doing.  But it
still obviously depends on the extent to which we can
expect information about cipherpunks, racists, whistle-
blowers, porn-addicts, smokers, propagandists, and
atheists to actually be used by the authorities to
violate the persons and properties of those people.

One hopes that the ranks of the civil-libertarians
will swell in direct proportion to infringements on
the legal rights of the foregoing persons, and that
persecution finds natural limits.

### It's quite annoying to keep hearing the same untruth over and over
again: The enforcers cannot legally haul you away if you can prove that they
failed to prosecute to roughly the same degree all other persons guilty of
the same offense. Selective enforcement is not legal, and transparency will
give you the information you need to prevail in court against those who
would try to harass you.

I finished reading the "Cryptonomicon" today. An excellent book. Stephenson
claims it is not in the least a roman a clef but repeated references to a
group called "Eutropians" make me think otherwise. Are there any prominent
Extropians who wear black cowboy hats, and are deep into crypto? Is there a
Scandinavian cryonicist and hacker who suffered injuries in his workplace,
possibly due to an imploding monitor?

I wonder if Stephenson ever posted or lurked here.

	Perhaps, but the earliest reference I know comes from J.D. Bernal's
"The World, the Flesh and the Devil: An Enquiry into the Future of the
Three Enemies of the Rational Soul," (1929!) which you can find here.

http://www.santafe.edu/~shalizi/Bernal/

See the tenth paragraph of section 3., which begins:

A much more fundamental break is implicit in the means of his
development. If a method has been found of connecting a nerve ending in
a brain directly with an electrical reactor, then the way is open for
connecting it with a brain-cell of another person. Such a connection
being, of course, essentially electrical, could be effected just as well
through the ether as along wires. At first this would limit itself to
the more perfect and economic transference of thought which would be
necessary in the co-operative thinking of the future. But it cannot stop
here. Connections between two or more minds would tend to become a more
and more permanent condition until they functioned as a dual or multiple
organism. The minds would always preserve a certain individuality, the
network of cells inside a single brain being more dense than that
existing between brains, each brain being chiefly occupied with its
individual mental development and only communicating with the others for
some common purpose. Once the more or less permanent compound brain came
into existence two of the ineluctable limitations of present existence
would be surmounted

If you haven't the patience for reading the essay, you might try Olaf
Stapledon's fictionalization of it, "Last and First Men."

I also recall the bracelets with instructions for cryonic procedures 
as suggestive of some deep drinking from a particular meme pool too.

Not having attended any of the EXTRO meets I don't know if you
are being coy here or not. But plausible candidates to fit both 
profiles come readily to mind. :-)

Obviously, you are talking about a hypothetical full transparency where the
government can be held accountable.  I think Samantha was talking about the
Big Brother kind of surveillance where you are put away with secret evidence
that you are not allowed to see and is not presented to the courts.  This is
already happening with current enemy combatants.  Obviously, the government
is not implementing the kind of transparency that you are espousing.

Although I am not personally convinced, it might be possible that your kind
of transparency could be a solution to government's Big Brother tactics.
The only caveat is that the government that wants to play Big Brother can't
be the total owner and controller of all surveillance.  Unfortunately, our
current government is restricting freedom of information acts, cutting back
on public domain information, and making it illegal to monitor or watch the
government in many cases.  The want full surveillance for them and none for
us.

You're new around here, aren't you? ;-)

(At least,  you don't remember the good old days when Tim May was a 
regular around here. Back before about 1994, IIRC.)

Just go the ACLU site and search for "secret evidence":
<http://search.aclu.org/ 
AdvancedSearchResults.cfm?ct=a&rs=43&insearch=secret%20evidence&RequestT 
imeout=1000&maxrows=20>

This lists specific cases, specific individuals, congress members  
speaking out against secret evidence, court cases arguing for and  
against secret evidence, etc.   Bob Barr and others have introduced  
legislation to ban secret evidence.

We designed the Internet to be able to  evolve into a global consciousness-- with complexity (open vs private sections)  Like a
simple organism.  When we design self awareness/self direction to a non-human consciousness what I hope  happens next is that
the AI or AIs discover that a creative outlet  to enhance themselves is to co-design organic posthumans.  Designing living
machines with billions of new variations , each with complexities the nuances of which play out over long stretches of time
should be intellectually stimulating for AI.  Their reward would presumably be to link themselves to all their creations and
enhance their quality of life and sensory possibilities (pleasure).   EX-Just as we send out probes to fathom little queries
beyond earth a suitably designed posthuman linked to other humans (via an as yet undiscovered real time long distance link)
could wander the universe like another Voyager and yet have a similtaneous life and existance as a human.

I assume that the military developers are not focusing on this because their objectives are focused
to the security issues of the day.  A wise AI would best mask its existance until such time as it has
created one or more backup AIs before presenting itself to its developers.  Human paranoia
for eons has leaned towards "ethnic cleansing".. we have a long cultural tradition of killing, running off,
or otherwise destroying things we fear or don't understand.  That is not to say that an AI might not be also so inclined.. but
if an AI is as nimble to think as we predict  then this thought will be transcended by  more creative urges.

What I believe will make organics continue to exist is the fact that
there is potential for much more functionality in a living machine with
4Dimensional+ (post-linear)  programmability  than a silicon or whatever
inorganic machine with 3D programmability.

DNA as we are finding seems to be severely underutilized in  programming
the current model of human.  DNA or some enhanced succesor molecular
family requires AI for intial design and testing .  Human capacity is
limited to overarching strategic development while non-human
computational capacity (computers) do the pick and shovel work with a
precision not possible in the organic.  Designing an organic posthuman
with capacity for both creativity and high capacity computational
ability is currently beyond us organics.

AIs are in my view the next stage of human evolution as a boot-strap to
posthumanity.

A couple of days ago the Chicago Tribune had an editorial on Rumsfeld
insisting on the right to declare anyone, including US citizens, "enemy

No, we didn't.  The Arpanet/Milnet/Internet was designed to be a robust 
communications network that could dynamically reroute around failures 
in case the Russians nuked the U.S. during the cold war.  I was one of 
the early network engineers on the Arpanet. I can assure you that 
evolution and consciousness were not part of the design.  The RFCs and 
Internet Protocols still don't support or specify evolution or 
consciousness today.

You act as if the military developers and the Internet developers were 
not one and the same until Al Gore's Internet Act created public access 
to the Internet.  Before that, the Internet was military only with 
educational sites allowed on if they supported the military agenda.

Harvey,
       I had a general good opinion of our government and the Attorney 
General John Ashcroft insofar as the use of "secret evidence" by our 
government in dealing with our citizenry as well as people of foreign birth 
that might be here on one status or another both legal and illegal.
       There are 31 citations listed in the evidence you provided me and the 
Extropy list.  Thirty of the citations concern practices or events during the 
Clinton administration.  Some referred to court cases, some to Bob Barr's 
attempt to get a law against such practices as the use of secret evidence.
       I am not sure what purpose the law was intended to serve as our courts 
have repeatedly put the government in its place regarding unfair or 
unconstitutional practices.  For evidence I'll refer you to any good High 
School History book.  Perhaps the law was intended to aid the defendents in 
avoiding a lengthy and expensive court process before the government would 
have been reprimanded -- if so that is good.
       The 31st and last citation was a letter from the ACLU to President 
Bush thanking him for supporting the ACLU in its fight against "secret 
evidence."
       So it looks like secret evidence is about an old issue that at least 
with this administration is not a problem.  If you have further evidence I 
would appreciate hering from you.
Ron h.

Damien,
       Where, when and under what conditions?  Is it your contention that if 
a "US citizen" is on the battlefield assisting the enemy we have no right to 
regard him as an "enemy combatant" and kill him?  What if that person has a 
weapon and is using it?  Must I first ID him before I shoot back?  Does that 
in turn mean I can't shoot at any opposing combatant before IDing them to 
ensure they are indeed non US citizens acting as enemy combatants?  -- If so, 
what level of proof do you require?  Is picture ID required?  How about if 
the individual is carrying no documentary evidence of citizenship?

What are the economics of converting  the corrections service to a remotely monitored system of
free prisoners.  I'm sure somebody has done the math or published all sorts of stuff  about
this.

GPS monitored, defined activites at defined locations.  Tax paying prisoners instead of tax
consuming prisoners.
This could utilize a well developed monitoring system.  Instead of physical prisons an expert
system and human monitored interacive system.  There might be indignities such as a forced
implantation with resevoirs of drugs which could be released by remote control.  ...ei any time
pre-set activity or location parameters are exceeded.
Maybe special designated clothing to set these individuals apart from others.
Expert system monitoring (wearable computer linked)  what each individual sees, does and says
with parameters related to the nature of their offence would be costly but like many military
and public funded technology is a way to develop and test technology.

DARPA was designed to help the military survive a nuclear war.  This is a far cry from
applications like chatting on ICQ via the internet.
Similarly the technology for monitoring prisoners could one day be applied to preventing death
through medical monitoring and remotely activated emergency countermeasures.

The facts are that the cost of encarcerating are too high for society to continue.
When millions of  hard working people earn 15-30,000 it is not socially responsible  to take the
taxes
from 5-10 of these people to pay for the incarceration of one dangerous individual.

The private prison or robocop scenario is not an improvement on the present state.

This may be a distasteful subject but the bottom line is that an intelligent society tries to
maximize the
positive of even the most warped human personalities.

### Yes, you are correct on all points (except that Samantha is IMO not
making a clear distinction between the Big Brother vs. transparency
scenarios, and to me it looks like she is rejecting both to the same
extent). We need to point a lot of cameras at the government, even if
threatened with retribution.

What?  Haven't you heard of the "United and Strengthening America by  
Providing Apporpirate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct  
Terrorism Act", better known as the "USA Patriot Act"?  It was signed  
into law by President Bush on October 26, 2001.  It includes things  
like secret property searches, detaining people without charges,  
jailing people with secret evidence, roving wiretaps, expanded  
monitoring of the internet, access to private medical records, and now  
even secret military tribunals."  Do a google search on "USA Patriot  
Act" for more information.

It's hard to believe that you aren't seeing these things every day in  
the news, but here are a few items that came up on the first page of a  
google search on "secret evidence".  These are current headlines  
describing secret evidence being used by the current administration.

Oct. 30, 2002:  "The Justice Department on Tuesday defended the use of  
secret evidence in its case against an Islamic charity accused of  
helping terrorists, arguing that revealing the evidence could  
jeopardize the investigation and threaten national security."

Aug 25, 2002:  "U.S. authorities deported al-Arian's brother-in-law  
Mazen al-Najjar, 45, to the Middle East after he had spent more than  
four years in custody without criminal charges -- most of that time  
based on secret evidence.....never charged with a crime."

April 25, 2002:  "Muslim leader jailed on secret evidence"

Oct. 29, 2002:  "The government defended Tuesday its use of secret

<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-

being used in 11 cases."
<http://www.aclu.org/ImmigrantsRights/

that the freeze was unconstitutional."

<http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/911/showcase/chi-

Dec. 9, 2001:  "The Justice Department has asked a federal appeals  
court for a broad ruling to authorize the use of secret evidence in  
cases in which it is trying to detain or deport immigrants it contends  
are in the country illegally. For national security reasons, the  
government argues that it should share secret evidence with only  
immigration judges and not with the immigrants and their lawyers. "

There are many more examples, but you should be able to find them

As far as I know the number of US citizens this has actually happened to can
be counted on the fingers of one hand, perhaps just one finger of one hand.
The bozo was riding in a jeep in Yemen with 5 known members of  al-Qaeda
when he was blown up by a Hellfire missile fired from a unmanned Predator
drone. Maybe he was just hitchhiking with the terrorists and on his way to a
church picnic, but somehow I rather doubt it, and don't think it's practical
in war to get a judge to say it's OK before every shot is fired.

Suppose that there was a free country in which the government
did not dictate all moral decisions, and that furthermore a
large number of moral decisions were made by small communities.
For example, a woman's right to an abortion might be granted
by some communities, but not others.

In this extremely hypothetical large nation, communities are
even allowed to make decisions regarding cloning.  In some
communities, there are no "moral" laws whatsoever concerning
things like abortion, cloning, and other mad-scientist
experiments only provided---the usual libertarian caveat---
that strictures exist against theft and murder, and that
property rights are enforced.

In other communities, the citizens have agreed to detailed
laws concerning how and when cloning may be performed and
by whom.  In yet others, all novel experiments not sanctioned
by custom are completely prohibited, and only traditional medical 
procedures and experiments are permitted.

You live in a certain community, and read about the amazing
developments occurring in certain other communities.  I call
to your attention two such, A and B, which are otherwise
identical except in matters pertaining to cloning.  (In both
communities, there is a shortage of children and a high rate
of infertility.)

In A, cloning attempts are permitted only on animals, until
such time as 100% of cloning attempts result in perfectly
normal animals.  Only then will cloning be allowed for
humans. 

In B, cloning of human beings is also permitted, but abortions
of faulty humans are allowed up to the end of the second
trimester.  While quite a number of people have been successfully
cloned, for each success approximately ten abortions take place.

Two questions:  (1) which legal structure most closely meets
with your approval?  (2) which community more closely meets
your ethical or moral standards?

A network, whether a WAN or LAN involves information transmission. Since 
the nodes are all-purpose machines, and are subject to remote exploits the 
architecture can be used for a bootstrap of a global mind.

But of course that's operating the system out of specs.

May I suggest that cloning should be premitted as long as it is being for and

The assumption here in B is that pre-trimester assays will provide perfect
predictions of the health of the baby-to-be. That is not at all evident,
since perhaps some of the less obvious errors (maternal/paternal imprinting
etc) mightn't be manifest until well after birth.

Suppose, then that the B equation is made more realistic (perhaps): for each
success approximately ten abortions take place plus another two or five or
eight children develop to maturity botched in some markedly disagreeable
way.

If a healthy ovulating woman "owns" her own body in such a
society she seem to have "property rights" over all the raw
materials she needs to make a clone. All the medical apparatus
and assistance could be readily purchased (in such) a society.
It seems it would be very hard,  (but perhaps not impossible),
to mount an argument that denies her the sovereignty of her 
body, without undermining the "usual libertarian" "strictures"
"enforcing" "property rights".

I.E. The question would be begged if one doesn't own ones
body what can one really own?

(NB: Natural human reproduction doesn't even approach a
100% success rate. Maybe around 20 - 30%.)

Does 100% mean 100.00000etc percent or is less than 1 failure
in 200 rounded to 100%. acceptable?

(So by my reckoning cloning has a lower absolute success rate
in terms of live healthy births.)

More info would certainly help re the 100%. As wanting better 
than 1 success in 200 is different from wanting complete success
and this factors into other societal considerations like who covers
the risk, how informed could the consent of the mother be etc.

Also how healthy does the cloned child need to be to be 
determined a "success"? As healthy as the parent?

What about Canadians?  The US bombed canadian troops in Afghanistan 
without verifying their identity.  Shortly afterwards it was stated 
that whoever it was was in close proximity to terrorist camps and were 
therefore guilty by association.  Later we discovered it was our own 
allies.  We still tried to cover it up with false information.  Finally 
we just admitted that we had no idea who they were.  We just bombed 
them because they were in the area with terrorists and we assumed they 
probably were terrorists too.

It is true that the number is low.  But I think this was due to our 
policy of identifying targets before we kill them.  If the policy now 
allows unknown targets to be killed first and asking questions later, I 
expect this number to rise.  The Israelis have a similar policy of 
shooting first and asking questions later.  This has lead to the 
killing of a few UN peacekeepers who have been shot for associating 
with Palestinians.  The Israelis even claimed they were working with 
the terrorists at first, but then backed away from these claims and 
admitted that they didn't have prior reason to shoot them.

Or he might have been a reporter working on a story.  Or he might have 
been an undercover agent infiltrating the group.  Or he might have been 
a negotiator trying to make a deal.  Or he might have been an unwitting 
neighbor who wasn't told about the terrorists' double life.  Or he 
might have been a hitchhiker.  Or he might have been a kidnapped 
American was being held by the terrorists.  He could have been anybody. 
  But now we'll never know.  Because the secret star chamber that acted 
as judge, jury and executioner shot first, asked questions later, and 
isn't talking.

Neither.  They seem to be two extremes.  I think pushing human cloning 
too soon is just as bad as banning it.  It should proceed at the normal 
safe rate that most medical procedures progress.

Why not handle this new medical procedure the way we handle other 
medical procedures in development?  Test in vitro until it works.  Test 
on animals until it works.  Test on humans until it works.  And then 
market it to the general public.  Why should human cloning skip any of 
the safety steps?  It is only the race to be first that is causing 
these groups to skip all preliminary testing.  Right now cloning is not 
routinely workable for animals yet.  It fails more often than it works. 
  Taking into account the problems with miscarriage or birth defects, 
this procedures is more likely to cause harm than produce a healthy 
baby.  Why the rush?  Why not develop the procedure until we get it 
working?  I rather see a lot of healthy clones in ten years than a 
dozen unhealthy ones now.

I'm told there's trouble with the url I posted. What the hell, here's the
full text.

Russell Blackford: There's madness in the Raelians' method

30dec02

I'M as troubled as most people by recent claims that the Raelian cult has
cloned the world's first human baby, but I'm at least as horrified by the
responses. Most, alas, have simply expressed scepticism about the claim or
have made high-sounding metaphysical pronouncements of a kind that usually
mask the absence of a rational argument.

So how should we view the prospect of human cloning in a modern liberal
society such as Australia? Many of the discussions seem to assume that we
should adopt a moral code based on religious ideas of natural law, and that
it is legitimate to ban conduct such as cloning simply because some people
find it morally objectionable, irrespective of the harm it might cause.
In a society such as ours, pluralism prevails in matters of personal
morality. On the face of things, the infliction or threat of force by the
state is considered wrong, especially so when very personal interests are at
stake, as with choices about sexual relationships and family formation.

What John Stuart Mill referred to as "experiments in living" should not
merely be tolerated in such a society, but should actually be welcomed.

So it might have been expected that countries such as Australia could
tolerate or even welcome the prospect of reproduction by nuclear somatic
transfer (or NST, the "cloning" technique involved). NST could be both a
legitimate "experiment in living" and a response to some cases of male
infertility  and the understandable desires of some lesbian couples to have
children biologically related to both of them.

But what makes the Raelians' recent announcement so shocking is that NST is
not a safe method of reproduction. From our experience with animals, there
appears to be a high risk of congenital disability as a result of the
process. We know that these might not be immediately obvious.

Even the most liberal society can't tolerate the use of a method of
reproduction that is so unsafe. After all, it violates a fundamental moral
norm that requires care for our children. And most of us would agree that a
child born with any disability as a result of the reckless use of an unsafe
procedure has been seriously wronged.

Few of the published responses to the Raelians' bizarre claims have made any
mention of the welfare of the allegedly cloned child. This would be a human
baby like any other, and equally deserving of our good wishes and
compassion.

The issue is not merely one of the technique's physical safety. If the
Raelians ever succeed in their misguided quest for cloned offspring, it is
all too easy to imagine the upbringing that awaits such children. Although
it's been announced that the infertile couple involved in this first case
are not Raelians, it's clear that the cult is deeply involved in Clonaid's
research and activities. This is a cult that makes a fetish of cloning as
part of its eccentric world view.

It's easy to imagine the plight of children conceived by NST for parents who
have anything to do with the Raelians, especially if the procedure becomes
relatively commonplace within the cult. As it grew up, any such child would
be given special significance by the cult, and would be confronted with a
regime of expectations and brainwashing that is almost too intolerable to
contemplate.

We would have every reason to worry deeply about its welfare in that sense,
as well as in the sense of its physical health.

If the announcement of a first human child produced by NST is not simply a
hoax, my heart goes out to the child, as it does to any child conceived and
born through the use of NST at this stage of its technological development
and in these extraordinary circumstances.

The story may well be a hoax; I believe and hope it is. But if it's true,
let's hope that the baby is well and will have a decent life ahead of it.
Rather than posturing about it as some kind of metaphysical symbol, we
should be worried about this cloned baby as a human child with a life to
lead. A cloned baby would still be a baby with its own life and personality,
very different from that of the cell donor whose DNA it would replicate,
since we are not merely products of our genes.

No large metaphysical issue is raised merely by the use of a method of
conception that creates generationally separated identical twins. But very
real issues of social tolerance are raised by the prospect of recklessly
creating children with an unsafe technology and, where the Raelians are
involved, with obvious risks to their social welfare.

Sorry -  hit the send button too quickly. In A you'd need to be
successful with animal clones more than 200 times for every
failure to claim 100% (rounded up). That would be an extra-
ordinary difficult success rate to achieve as at present the 
reported failures are closer to 200 time more numerous than any
"successes".

For the prospective "parent" there is a point at which the risk
becomes potentially reasonable and able to be taken as a matter
of "informed consent" (in comparison even with success of normal
fertilization). And as more do it the risks will presumably get lower.
Similarly if more chose to reproduce by IVF, where the health of the
sperm, the ova and the embryo could each be examined eventually
we could have a situation where IVF is actually safer in terms of 
producing less natural abortions and more healthy children than 
normal fertilization.   

With respect to the prospective child clone, (or indeed any child) 
I can't see that it has any "interest" until it has the apparatus
necessary to sustain an interest. A CNS at a minimum.

My operating principle would be that one should not *recklessly*
bring unnecessary suffering into the world. Or encourage others
to reckless do so. 

*When* the risk of cloning approaches the risk of natural birth I
think the burden of making any case for a ban should switch to
those who want to curtail the freedom of the woman choosing to
clone herself. Personally I'd think she might find more enlightened
options in most cases, but I wouldn't be sure it would always be
a poor option in all cases. Nor would I be sure that it is my or
anyone else's right to tell her what risks she can run or what poor
judgement she may not exercise *unless* she is hurting someone
else. Then the question will be who is she hurting?

But we are not at that point yet in my view, and I think the case
for banning cloning (on the evidence available) because of the 
likelihood that suffering would be recklessly brought into the
world has been well made.

Aw Harvey,
       You did it again.  You sent me 31 citations to read about the American 
Government.  30 were about the prior administration and 1 was from the ACLU 
to the present administration thanking it for reversing the previous 
administration's practice on secrecy.  And, I never have found out what you 
mean by the blanket term "secrecy."  Are we talking about the long existing 
policy of restricting information from the public at large that might get our 
intelligence agents killed?  That proceedure allows the defendent and their 
attorneys access to the secret material but keeps it out of the public domain 
where it would likely get someone killed.
       Now, I have looked up the references you cited.  A lot of them do not 
exist at this time.  A group of the others refer to things that happened 
before the legistlation you are complaining about.  One referred to a suspect 
organization being prevented from handling large sums of money that might be 
used against us by terrorists and several referred to individuals that were 
being deported as illegal aliens in which some sort of "secret information" 
became tangentially involved.
       You also quite properly referred to a piece of emergency legistlation 
that was rushed into law by our politicians immediately after 911.  That 
legistlation was really flawed but then again at such moments politicians 
have a long history of doing something, anything, to prove they are on the 
job.  We also have a long history of our courts throwing such legistlation 
out of court -- no doubt that will be the case in this instance.
       I think seeing this legistlation overturned will probably be a good 
thing but I will not succumb and become hysterical enough to blame on this 
legistlation events that took place before it was even voted on.
       Keep up the good work, I think we should be suspicious of government 
power.  
Ron h.

As a matter of public policy I think that's the wiser approach. But I
am libertarian enough to be concerned about the basis on which
someone other than the woman (who may be informed of the risks
and choses to run them) is refused the right to make that choice for
herself. I think we need a good reason to deprive her of the choice.

> Test in vitro until it works.  Test on animals until it works.

That wouldn't extirely remove the risks. At the current rate it could
probably be decades before cloning became a reproductive option
and that would put it beyond the reach of some who apparently
want to try it.

There can't always be safety steps for new things. Thats because they
are new and encapsulate aspects of the unknown. The point is who
gets to decide what risks are permitted to be run.

The rush would presumably arise because people who want to clone
want to clone to produce *their* children in their timeframe not see
"hypothetical" children cloned for someone else in someone else's
timeframe. They are not thinking like social scientists they are thinking
like would be or wannabe parents.

I'm tired of hearing just the same old stale conventional wisdom on
cloning, (not from this list, but generally - it seems the analysis always
quits because of the yuck factor and the overwhelming desire of most
people not to stray too far of the track off the "politically correct" kicks
in.) But dammit "political correctness" has impeded some really
good research in stem cells for a couple of years now. It is equally
capable of slowing down nanotechnology and genetic engineering and
a swag of other issues that are of core interest to extropians. Stem cell
research unencumbered by claptrap but still conducted in a genuinely
ethical context would impact positively on thousands if not millions of
lives. But rather than blow away mountains of specious luddite
conservative fundamentalist nonsense with large gusts of reason all too
often it seems the "good guys" have to pick away at some tiny little
corner of a problem lest the concentration and childlike sensitivities of
Joe and Jane public and Joe and Jane politician be overstretched.

I'm beginning to think is not so much the minds of Jane and Joe public
that are in greatest danger of stultifying. All too often they aren't paying
that much attention to the details anyway. I am beginning to think that
almost all the significant challenges and roadblocks to the futures
extropians would apparently like to forge fall into the category of
"the ethical" and "the political" and that in comparison the technical
problems are relatively trivial.

Where's Voltaire with his battlecry of "crush the infamous thing"
when we need him. A little more intellectual ferocity coupled with
honesty wouldn't go astray.

Maybe I should don a pseudonym to hide behind and really cut
loose. Problem is dammit, frank words, taken out of context,
can really cut down ones chances of  marshalling serious resources
in the non-virtual world.

       I keep asking myself if there is any practical means available to the 
governments of the Earth to prevent cloning of people.
       Even though cloning might be difficult I have to assume that any 
number of people might have the knowledge to attempt cloning -- further that 
they might be successful after several trials.  I have to assume that while 
they might get some very messy results there will be those that are willing 
to keep trying.  Mind you I am using entire global population as my basis for 
prediction.
       In addition I have to ask the list how expensive the necessary 
equipment is.  The delivery of a cloned child requires only minimal 
equipment, how complex a laboratory is required for the initial work?

I'd say the single preposterous objection lurking beneath the `revulsion'
etc isn't anything that could be termed `political correctness'; it's
*religious* correctness.

It's the *immaterial soul* and its heavenly salvation that all these
terrible scientific interventions are putting at risk. Even those
anticloning humanists who claim otherwise are caught inside this medieval
trap. My local paper mentioned this morning, in the middle of the usual
bungled report, that the Pope and his theologians teach that `life begins at
conception'. That is felt to be a killer rejoinder (so to speak), and nobody
stands up to say, `Oy, everyone *knows* that *life* (snake, cat, dog, human)
begins at conception--modulo a few details about implantation, etc; but the
salient ethical/moral issue is when *personhood* begins, or can be assessed,
fuzzily, to have begun.' The trouble is that you can't *say* that kind of
thing in available English. We just don't have common words to convey what
is meant by `personhood', other than the sloppy and often misleading term
`human life', usually elided to `life' pure and simple.

True, there are further issues at stake with cloning, even if it works
right: impossibly onerous expectations by the older twin/parent, derision
from peers, the possible erosion of the recognized value of a human being as
an end rather than a means, etc. But those already obtain in many cases of
parents and their kids, or oddball kids and their peers, and so on.

The most gruesomely hilarious element in the current imbroglio is the way
the press babble mockingly about `cults who believe humans were cloned from
aliens' and `little green men' (actually I don't think the Raelians favor
*green* aliens, but hey), and oppose these absurdities with ethical
announcements from the far more sensible people who believe in the virginal
birth of a god-man who later returned from the dead.

According to a QuickVote poll on CNN, 22% of respondents are in favor of
human cloning. This is really nice, I never hoped that so many people would
support it so early on. Freedom will win, especially once find out the
frequency of serious health problems in cloned children and, if needed,
reduce it to an acceptable level.

Preventing friendly fire casualties is an important issue but has little to

Sure, anything is possible, but that's not where I'd place my bet at the
time. I think I would have won too, he wasn't a reporter he wasn't
hitchhiking, he wasn't a undercover agent, he wasn't negotiating; Ok maybe
he was doing something else that was innocent and maybe the world is flat
too but I doubt it and I've got more important things to worry about.  I'm
curious Harvey, the next time a Predator drone finds 5 top level members of
al-Qaeda riding in a jeep in the desert of Yemen what do you suggest we do,
have a jury trial to decide to fire the Hellfire or not? Should we do the
same thing every time a soldier wants to pull the trigger on his rifle? War
is a dirty business and innocent people are going to get killed even by the
"good guys", but there are people out there who want you and I dead and
that's a dirty business too, one I'd really like to prevent

### You need a gynecological ultrasound machine, the basic equipment of an
OB/GYN office, some needles, syringes for collecting the ova, then a cell
culture microscope, cell culture equipment (centrifuge, incubator, laminar
flow hood, flasks, media, and other disposables) for growing and harvesting
the nuclei, a micromanipulator (pneumatic), freezer, all in all, could be a
couple hundred thousand $ if new and top of the line, but I am sure you
could cobble together a cheaper set from second-hand sources.

I agree, although most people in today's society regard
your body as actually belonging to the government.  You
may not abuse the government's body: it must be securely
strapped into moving vehicles, helmets must be warn to
protect its head, prohibited chemicals are not allowed in
the government body's bloodstream, and so on.  But we digress.

Yes.  Sorry.  The percent would have to be a reasonable

the government (who else?).

Only the government is wise enough to see all and know
all.  (Sarcasm.)  Actually, *all* these decisions should
be left to individuals, and small groups of consenting
individuals, and everyone else should butt out.  But a
powerful part of 20th century consciousness is the need
to pass judgment backed up by law on all sorts of things
that don't directly affect one.  One need only imagine,
for example, something going wrong in a laboratory 
somewhere, and one instantly wishes to ban whatever it
is.

Yes, that's how it will happen.  But only after people have
become accustomed to the idea.  Meanwhile, it's evil, and
the results of the accidents would be better off dead (just
ask them).  Why, I myself, have two serious genetic defects
that might make most people think twice about whether they'd
want to ever be me, so I'm very glad that I was born while
accidents were still allowed.

But even someone a lot more freakish than I am is probably
better off being allowed to live (by those who pay the bills),
than never getting to be alive at all.  But I don't know of
anyone on-line---certainly no Extropian---who would agree.

While I think that it's frequently a bad idea for money
to be taken from citizens unnecessarily, why does the idea
of government involvement worry you so much?

I think religious correctness is a biggie. But after 8 months of
lobbying around the stem cell issue I think there is also a
secondary problem as well, and that is that we choose the
grounds on which we fight our battles all too often far too
poorly. Frequently we let the religious conservatives pick both
the battlefield and the language which is used in the battle. And
(as in the current case) many who should know better from
painful personal experience still resort to ridiculing the smaller
group of superstitious clowns to appease and curry favour with
the larger group of superstitious clowns. And no favour is ever
curried.

There are many forms of nonsense and superstition in the world
and all too few clear thinkers with a capacity to get on and
make a difference. I've noticed most of my fellow lobbyists
in the stem cell industry and patient advocacy groups are almost
falling over themselves to say their work and their projects are
nothing like what Clonaid and the Raelians have done.

Personally I think they are fighting on exactly the grounds the
religious conservatives would wish them to. They seem to be
constantly apologising and in retreat. The most powerful
form of lobbying is imo education and in the case of stem cells
its scientific and biological education. Media events like the
current "cloning" hoohah could be used as educational
opportunities. Joe and Jane average might just be interested
enough at present to have some biological knowledge thats
good for them slipped past their guard but most of those who
could best do the educating are busy joining in the chorus of
ridicule on the Raelians.

-----------------------------

Those who like short emails can skip this part its examples
of statements  made by religious conservative politicians
in the Australian federal parliament during the recent stem cell
debate. My point is to show how shallow and specious are
even the deepest "reasons" and convictions actually were
(despite in my view being genuinely held). I also hope that it
will be possible to see that the battle over language is not
esoteric its fundamental in championing extropic causes.

I think we may be "talking for our lives" and for someone
with my verbosity thats scary.

Senator Guy Barnett. The main organiser of petitions
against ES cell research says on the front page of his
45 page "stem cell information kit".

"A human embryo is not a commodity to be sold or a
 resource for experimentation, exploitation or research. As
 a community we should draw a line in the sand, and say
the protection of human life at whatever age, in
whatever form, is an absolute. No ifs or buts."

Its a good thing for Barnett he doesn't want to hear
ifs or buts. Someone might have informed him that each
cell in a tumor removed from a cancer patient is a "form" of
"human life". His view put into policy would stop the
killing of cancer cells to save the life of a person.

Christopher Pyne MP, in his speech to the Bill on
Tuesday, 20 August 2002.

"There will be amendments moved to this bill which I will
support and hope will be adopted. But after those
amendments are made, if they are successful, I will be voting
against this Bill, because the only way (sic) for society
to demonstrate its belief in the value of human life, is to
ban embryonic stem cell research.."

Pyne didn't seem to have too strong a grasp on the notion
that human cells make up human tissues which make up
organs, which make up the whole organism or "person"
either.  Whenever pro-therapeutic cloners uses the term
"human life" instead of "person" they adopt the foggy
terminology of the religious conservatives and talk straight
to their existing prejudices. The term "human life" obscures
the key point that not all forms of human life would be equal
even in the minds of the religious unless they want to go into
to bat for cancer cells.

Alan Cadman, MP, in his speech to the Bill on Wed,
21August 2002.

"I too believe that life begins the moment that sperm enters
 the ovum.." "..we ought to consider what we do with
research. I am opposed to the use of IVF embryos for
experimental purposes".

Alan apparently doesn't know that the sperm that
contributed to the zygote that became him was alive
beforehand. Many amongst the public probably would
not know that as sperm have already undergone the
phenomenon of crossover as part of the process of
meiosis before they fertilize the ovum, Alan's linage can
be meaningfully traced back not just to any coupling
of sperm and egg but to a *particular* sperm and egg
pairing from amidst many millions of possibilities. If
Alan knew this "every sperm being sacred" might not
just be a song in poor taste to him. Alas he was never
even engaged on this level.

Finally, Kevin Andrews, the Minister for Health and
Aging himself:  Arguable the most ardent anti-somatic
cell nuclear transfer and ES cell or all over time, says:

"(The) enlightened tradition (of doing "no harm") has
always placed great emphasis on the intrinsic worth
and equal value (sic) of every human life regardless
of its stage or condition. I believe that we should not
depart from it".

Andrews apparently overlooks that this tradition has
pertained to "human life" where "human life" was
taken to mean "persons". Mr Andrews here over-
extends the old principle to all forms of human life
regardless of its "stage or condition". Scientifically
"human life" includes not just embryos and sperm,
but also skin and hair cells.

Cancer cells are also a "condition" of "human life".
By extending the use of the term "human life" to
cover embryos (and apparently other forms of
human life) Andrews is clearly parting with the
very tradition he invokes.

Andrews goes on  "I believe that it is dangerous
to treat any (sic) human life as expendable".

Well the point about "human life" not being the
same as a "person" has been made several times.
But the religious conservatives consistently used
such terms as "human life", "human dignity",
"human rights" over and over as though all
forms of human life took place on one level and
as though an embryo was on a par with a person.

Whilst the status of forms of human life such as
sperm and cancer cells was never raised.

In so many case the most heartfelt concerns of the
anti-campaigners were not even engaged. In my
view many of them may have been turned if they
were engaged as they had already acquired a lot
of knowledge and had made emotional commitments
to the effort of understanding. Not all for sure.
But in taking the debate to the right level we would
have been far better able to pick up and engage
a better educated public next time.

Actually quite seriously it doesn't. I have a book on
developmental biology on my shelf that starts chronicling
life from the time the egg and sperm are formed in the
parents (more scientific terms used).

> salient ethical/moral issue is when *personhood*

Absolutely. "Personhood" is the line at which we should be
rallying. "Personhood" is something that Joe and Jane may not
use naturally but they know the difference when they see it.
They know intuitively a potential person, an embryo, is not
morally the same as a person.

What they don't know is how extensively their best interests
are being diddled (in terms of making medicines available
sooner) as they don't understand the processes by which
medicines are developed .

Also extropic types can conceive of non-human persons at
some point in the future.

It is a *big* problem that we can't say it concisely enough to
get through the concentration spans of the intended audience.

But we can do far better in not allowing "human life" a ridiculously
broad term to go unchallenged also. It may have been quite
effective to have journalists ask Barnett what part of a human
cancer cell he thought was either not alive or not human and did
he really think it should be protected as an absolute.

But obviously these techniques are laborious.

Yeah and these same press will adopt the same mocking demeanour, with
cryonics, and nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.

I don't want to defend Raelians but I don't want the media to get too
carried away with mocking as there are times I'd like them to examine
unlikely propositions (to them) sceptically.

?  We were talking about whether our new policy of shooting first and 
asking questions later was going to lead to unacceptable losses.  You 
specifically stated that only one American had been lost this way.  I 
pointed out a case where Canadians were lost because we shot at people 
without specifically knowing who they were.  This was not a case where 
we mistakenly thought they were terrorists due to misinformation.  This 
was a case where we saw people with weapons in a location and killed 
them without finding out who they were first.

I don't like "betting" with peoples lives.  Nor do I like authorizing 
assassinations without any evidence.  We can't kill people for crimes 
if we don't know who they are or what they might have done.  In this 
case, we killed extraneous people to get the one that was slated for 
death.  I sure hope that we don't keep up that ratio on every secret US 
assassination.

If our soldiers can't kill the enemy without killing innocents, I'd say 
get better intelligence and planning.  If they can't follow him to get 
the opportune moment, we need better assassins.  If they can't quickly 
identify the targets to distinguish the enemy from the allies, we need 
better field support.  If we can't save innocent lives, why are we 
fighting?  If we are willing to kill unrelated innocents to try to win 
our cause against the enemy, how is that different from the terrorists? 
Just giving up and saying that it is too difficult to save innocent 
lives is not a good answer.

There's also the vexed question of telomere ablation. Is Dolly's goose
cooked, and will the same be true of a little Raelian, starting out aged
30-something? Here's a typical recentish web report:

http://www.jhu.edu/hurj/issue1/researchUpdate/ResearchUpdate_Yassa_Cloning.h
tml

< Recent developments in the cloning arena should not give a false sense of
security in its safety, practicality and promise of better health. Recent
studies in mice have suggested that clones may develop health problems or
even die prematurely in later life. Some cloned mice became obese even
though they did not overeat. A study published in February by scientists in
Japan found that mice cloned from somatic cells had a significantly shorter
lifespan than matched controls. Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute in the UK
recently commented on the cloning process emphasizing how cloned embryos are
vulnerable to epigenetic change. Wilmut's research was responsible for
bringing Dolly the sheep into existence in 1997. Dolly was the first mammal
to be cloned from adult stem cells. In May of 1999, research suggested that
Dolly might be susceptible to premature aging. Structures at the ends of
chromosomes named telomeres decrease in length with age. Researchers
examined Dolly's telomeres, and reported that the structures were slightly
shorter than would be expected in a sheep of her age that was born normally.
Five and half year old Dolly was brought back into the spotlight in January
2002, when Wilmut and his group announced that she had developed arthritis.
It is unclear whether or not this is a complication arising from the cloning
process, but this incident has increased the public's concerns about the
efficacy and ethics of cloning. This unfortunate incident was after she had
given birth to six healthy lambs.  >

I think you could find them if you tried.  Or you could ask for copies

You are changing the subject.  I am not complaining about any 
legislation.  I am proving that the current Bush administration uses 
secret evidence against suspects.  I proved that.  It doesn't matter if 
it occurred before or after a specific date or which piece of 
legislation allowed it.  I have clearly refuted your claim that the 
current Bush administration hasn't used secret evidence.

Are you saying that you are unaware that our government has 
seriously restricted FOIA access, has removed or bypassed some 
traditional checks and types of oversights, and that the Patriot 
Act and much subsequent legislation allows more sweeping 
survelliance, search, detention with little or no oversight and 
far less due process?   I would think that reading more closely 
would clear up any missing evidence that our government is 
certainly not interested in reciprocal transparency.

cooked, and will the same be true of a little Raelian, starting out aged
30-something? Here's a typical recentish web report:

http://www.jhu.edu/hurj/issue1/researchUpdate/ResearchUpdate_Yassa_Cloning.h
tml

< Recent developments in the cloning arena should not give a false sense of
security in its safety, practicality and promise of better health. Recent
studies in mice have suggested that clones may develop health problems or
even die prematurely in later life. Some cloned mice became obese even
though they did not overeat. A study published in February by scientists in
Japan found that mice cloned from somatic cells had a significantly shorter
lifespan than matched controls. Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute in the UK
recently commented on the cloning process emphasizing how cloned embryos are
vulnerable to epigenetic change. Wilmut's research was responsible for
bringing Dolly the sheep into existence in 1997. Dolly was the first mammal
to be cloned from adult stem cells. In May of 1999, research suggested that
Dolly might be susceptible to premature aging. Structures at the ends of
chromosomes named telomeres decrease in length with age. Researchers
examined Dolly's telomeres, and reported that the structures were slightly
shorter than would be expected in a sheep of her age that was born normally.
Five and half year old Dolly was brought back into the spotlight in January
2002, when Wilmut and his group announced that she had developed arthritis.
It is unclear whether or not this is a complication arising from the cloning
process, but this incident has increased the public's concerns about the
efficacy and ethics of cloning. This unfortunate incident was after she had
given birth to six healthy lambs.  >

?  We were talking about whether our new policy of shooting first and 
asking questions later was going to lead to unacceptable losses.  You 
specifically stated that only one American had been lost this way.  I 
pointed out a case where Canadians were lost because we shot at people 
without specifically knowing who they were.  This was not a case where 
we mistakenly thought they were terrorists due to misinformation.  This 
was a case where we saw people with weapons in a location and killed 
them without finding out who they were first.

I don't like "betting" with peoples lives.  Nor do I like authorizing 
assassinations without any evidence.  We can't kill people for crimes 
if we don't know who they are or what they might have done.  In this 
case, we killed extraneous people to get the one that was slated for 
death.  I sure hope that we don't keep up that ratio on every secret US 
assassination.

If our soldiers can't kill the enemy without killing innocents, I'd say 
get better intelligence and planning.  If they can't follow him to get 
the opportune moment, we need better assassins.  If they can't quickly 
identify the targets to distinguish the enemy from the allies, we need 
better field support.  If we can't save innocent lives, why are we 
fighting?  If we are willing to kill unrelated innocents to try to win 
our cause against the enemy, how is that different from the terrorists? 
Just giving up and saying that it is too difficult to save innocent 
lives is not a good answer.

I think you could find them if you tried.  Or you could ask for copies

You are changing the subject.  I am not complaining about any 
legislation.  I am proving that the current Bush administration uses 
secret evidence against suspects.  I proved that.  It doesn't matter if 
it occurred before or after a specific date or which piece of 
legislation allowed it.  I have clearly refuted your claim that the 
current Bush administration hasn't used secret evidence.

{NB: sincere apologies for the length of this - I am no writer. A
big chunk or examples in the middle between two lines
marked thus ---------- can be skipped with no great loss}

I think religious correctness is a biggie. But after 8 months of
lobbying around the stem cell issue I think there is also a
secondary problem as well, and that is that we choose the
grounds on which we fight our battles all too often far too
poorly. Frequently we let the religious conservatives pick both
the battlefield and the language which is used in the battle. And
(as in the current case) many who should know better from
painful personal experience still resort to ridiculing the smaller
group of superstitious clowns to appease and curry favour with
the larger group of superstitious clowns. And no favour is ever
curried.

There are many forms of nonsense and superstition in the world
and all too few clear thinkers with a capacity to get on and
make a difference. I've noticed most of my fellow lobbyists
in the stem cell industry and patient advocacy groups are almost
falling over themselves to say their work and their projects are
nothing like what Clonaid and the Raelians have done.

Personally I think they are fighting on exactly the grounds the
religious conservatives would wish them to. They seem to be
constantly apologising and in retreat. The most powerful
form of lobbying is imo education and in the case of stem cells
its scientific and biological education. Media events like the
current "cloning" hoohah could be used as educational
opportunities. Joe and Jane average might just be interested
enough at present to have some biological knowledge thats
good for them slipped past their guard but most of those who
could best do the educating are busy joining in the chorus of
ridicule on the Raelians.

-----------------------------

Those who like short emails can skip this part its examples
of statements  made by religious conservative politicians
in the Australian federal parliament during the recent stem cell
debate. My point is to show how shallow and specious are
even the deepest "reasons" and convictions actually were
(despite in my view being genuinely held). I also hope that it
will be possible to see that the battle over language is not
esoteric its fundamental in championing extropic causes.

I think we may be "talking for our lives" and for someone
with my verbosity thats scary.

Senator Guy Barnett. The main organiser of petitions
against ES cell research says on the front page of his
45 page "stem cell information kit".

"A human embryo is not a commodity to be sold or a
 resource for experimentation, exploitation or research. As
 a community we should draw a line in the sand, and say
the protection of human life at whatever age, in
whatever form, is an absolute. No ifs or buts."

Its a good thing for Barnett he doesn't want to hear
ifs or buts. Someone might have informed him that each
cell in a tumor removed from a cancer patient is a "form" of
"human life". His view put into policy would stop the
killing of cancer cells to save the life of a person.

Christopher Pyne MP, in his speech to the Bill on
Tuesday, 20 August 2002.

"There will be amendments moved to this bill which I will
support and hope will be adopted. But after those
amendments are made, if they are successful, I will be voting
against this Bill, because the only way (sic) for society
to demonstrate its belief in the value of human life, is to
ban embryonic stem cell research.."

Pyne didn't seem to have too strong a grasp on the notion
that human cells make up human tissues which make up
organs, which make up the whole organism or "person"
either.  Whenever pro-therapeutic cloners uses the term
"human life" instead of "person" they adopt the foggy
terminology of the religious conservatives and talk straight
to their existing prejudices. The term "human life" obscures
the key point that not all forms of human life would be equal
even in the minds of the religious unless they want to go into
to bat for cancer cells.

Alan Cadman, MP, in his speech to the Bill on Wed,
21August 2002.

"I too believe that life begins the moment that sperm enters
 the ovum.." "..we ought to consider what we do with
research. I am opposed to the use of IVF embryos for
experimental purposes".

Alan apparently doesn't know that the sperm that
contributed to the zygote that became him was alive
beforehand. Many amongst the public probably would
not know that as sperm have already undergone the
phenomenon of crossover as part of the process of
meiosis before they fertilize the ovum, Alan's linage can
be meaningfully traced back not just to any coupling
of sperm and egg but to a *particular* sperm and egg
pairing from amidst many millions of possibilities. If
Alan knew this "every sperm being sacred" might not
just be a song in poor taste to him. Alas he was never
even engaged on this level.

Finally, Kevin Andrews, the Minister for Health and
Aging himself:  Arguable the most ardent anti-somatic
cell nuclear transfer and ES cell or all over time, says:

"(The) enlightened tradition (of doing "no harm") has
always placed great emphasis on the intrinsic worth
and equal value (sic) of every human life regardless
of its stage or condition. I believe that we should not
depart from it".

Andrews apparently overlooks that this tradition has
pertained to "human life" where "human life" was
taken to mean "persons". Mr Andrews here over-
extends the old principle to all forms of human life
regardless of its "stage or condition". Scientifically
"human life" includes not just embryos and sperm,
but also skin and hair cells.

Cancer cells are also a "condition" of "human life".
By extending the use of the term "human life" to
cover embryos (and apparently other forms of
human life) Andrews is clearly parting with the
very tradition he invokes.

Andrews goes on  "I believe that it is dangerous
to treat any (sic) human life as expendable".

Well the point about "human life" not being the
same as a "person" has been made several times.
But the religious conservatives consistently used
such terms as "human life", "human dignity",
"human rights" over and over as though all
forms of human life took place on one level and
as though an embryo was on a par with a person.

Whilst the status of forms of human life such as
sperm and cancer cells was never raised.

In so many case the most heartfelt concerns of the
anti-campaigners were not even engaged. In my
view many of them may have been turned if they
were engaged as they had already acquired a lot
of knowledge and had made emotional commitments
to the effort of understanding. Not all for sure.
But in taking the debate to the right level we would
have been far better able to pick up and engage
a better educated public next time.

Actually quite seriously it doesn't. I have a book on
developmental biology on my shelf that starts chronicling
life from the time the egg and sperm are formed in the
parents (more scientific terms used).

> salient ethical/moral issue is when *personhood*

Absolutely. "Personhood" is the line at which we should be
rallying. "Personhood" is something that Joe and Jane may not
use naturally but they know the difference when they see it.
They know intuitively a potential person, an embryo, is not
morally the same as a person.

What they don't know is how extensively their best interests
are being diddled (in terms of making medicines available
sooner) as they don't understand the processes by which
medicines are developed .

Also extropic types can conceive of non-human persons at
some point in the future.

It is a *big* problem that we can't say it concisely enough to
get through the concentration spans of the intended audience.

But we can do far better in not allowing "human life" a ridiculously
broad term to go unchallenged also. It may have been quite
effective to have journalists ask Barnett what part of a human
cancer cell he thought was either not alive or not human and did
he really think it should be protected as an absolute.

But obviously these techniques are laborious.

Yeah and these same press will adopt the same mocking demeanour, with
cryonics, and nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.

I don't want to defend Raelians but I don't want the media to get too
carried away with mocking as there are times I'd like them to examine
unlikely propositions (to them) sceptically.

Costs could be considerably cut by buying used. (Most of 21CM and CCR
operated that way). Wonder how many sources of used equipment are now
watched in wake of 911, since dual use.

What is interesting is that how easy germline gene engineering is with the
new technique (efficient uptake of DNA fragments by sperm and high rate of
correct insertion). It takes far less resources and technique than cloning 
(which really isn't that interesting).

With some more resources one could screen for correct insertion, asserting
that only transformed embryos (what out for teratological changes due to
insert and the screen itself) would be carried out.

Meaning, some rogue group like Clonaid or similiar could be doing it with 
nobody being the wiser. Of course, I can't think of anything known which 
would result in actual relevant enhancement. Ideas?

I am sorry but that would be utterly laughable if the situation 
was any less dangerous.  I do not believe this summary is an 
honest appraisal.  What is your agenda?

When government has a monopoly on force exactly how do you think 
that we will be able to get sufficient cameras trained on 
government?  Since they are our "public servants" wouldn't you 
think that most of their acts would be subject to public or at 
least public representative scrutiny?

I don't think so.  It was mainly linking research centers at 
universities originally and most of them were not military 
research.  In any event, that is something so far in ancient 
history that it has little to do with subsequent evolution.

Now, you are certainly right about that, generally speaking.

That is not my memory of the situation by mid 1970s at least.

I haven't specifically checked the patent databases, but any significant
breakthroughs (baring the very recent) in animal cloning are likely to be
patented and available online. Patents are supposed to provide enough info
for a skilled practitioner (competitors say) to replicate the invention as
part
of the quid pro quo for a limited monopoly. The patent databases online
might increase the chances of Clonaid having enough "how to" info to
improve their chances of  "success".

IVF technology and know how, the other side of the technical story, is
actually better understood and characterised for humans than animals. I
suspect the standard IVF clinic would have the necessary equipment.

This wouldn't be very practical - a global network has latencies with
lower bounds limited by the speed of light. That would make a global
mind an extremely sluggish mind regardless of it's architecture.
Remember our talks about Amygdala clustering and SP/2 switches,
Firewire, Myrinet and SCI links? I guess the physical size of an AI
can't be much bigger than the maximum cable lengths of these network
types. Else you'd get a society of multiple AIs, a sluggish AI or
nothing at all. To get a society you'd need to find collections of
machines that are linked with high bandwidth / low latency such as the
racks at large ISPs.

There really is no need to put consciousness / evolution issues into a
TCP/IP stack. You want to implement that *skyhigh* above of any
application protocol of your liking, such as Corba/IIOP, SOAP, MPI or
whatever. No job for the IETF. There is no consciousness in our neural
communications, too (unless you believe Penrose/Hameroff ;)

Rafal,
       So I assume that for a million dollars or so I can buy the equipment, 
space, and pay salaries if I wish to finance a cloning experiment.
       I am further assuming that I won't necessarily use top flight talent 
-- only talent that has the ego to think they are up to the job and who will 
have successes after trial and error.  Okay, the potential doctor has to be 
persuasive enough to convince an uninformed financier -- there are plenty of 
those around.
       I can't begin to do the marketing study to determine how many 
potential financiers & doctors there are for a project of this kind but it 
must run several thousand across the globe.
       In light of this I have to ask -- can we outlaw cloning or are we 
merely deluding ourselves?

Yes, but all the hardware on the local loop is tightly coupled. Here's a
clear analogy to the wet neuron, which is also mostly locally interacting
over a ms time window. The switches introduce negligible latencies to the
raw wire speed. You hardly see them even with userland pingpong code.  
Latencies will go down even for WAN type networks as we go to 10 GBit/s
hardware, which can (and at some point necessarily will) be geographically
routed. A photonically geographically switched ~40 GBit/s optical network
of the future doesn't introduce latencies other than essentially
relativistic. A ns is worth some ~1 m, a us some km. Given that high-order
processes of people involve seconds on a substrate that is liter in size
and ~100 m/s signalling constrained it's clearly more handicapped than a
city-size assembly which signals over 2*10^6 times faster. Besides,
latency is not very relevant, as the pipe acts as a FIFO even now. You
just pack your slices encoding spikes (to address, global tick when
issued) into packets and pack them into the pipe, and do the reverse as
the pipe is running full duplex. You don't have to twiddle your thumbs
until the response arrives, so it's all clearly nicely decoupled.

Given that it takes a very fat machine to saturate a GBit/s pipe
sustainably while not doing much else besides the networks are clearly not
today's bottleneck. Sure, current phone wire kBit pipes to the end user
don't look very hot, but there's technology in the pipeline to address
that. There's about a GBit/s worth aggregate wireless bandwidth within a
(small) cell, not counting line of sight laser and fiber. We have people
deploying sub-ms enduser latencies over GBit/s Ethernet fiber backbone.
That's today's technology, out in the field already in some blessed
patches of the geoid.

Given a 1 kCPU Beowulf using Myrinet it's clear the bottleneck is CPU. It
takes seconds to even stream through a GByte worth of core, not counting
semirandom access and doing I/O, while crunching some numerics heavy code.  
The fatter the node, the less load is there on the network. It's the usual
volume/surface scaling ratio which holds true for relatively low
dimensionalities (N<10, very true for N=3 which is the implementation
layer for our wetware and hence sufficient for an in machina model, though
memory accesses are temporally rather flat even for high dimensionalities;  
node-locally).

Currently, that would be a rogue code's chiefest point of interest.  
Especially, that internally the traffic is unmetered, though a sudden
traffic spike and a worm-like pattern might trigger some specific
safeguards. Demo codes for scanning very large networks in seconds exist.
As the ISP node landscape is homogenous, you can 0wn it in seconds through
a single vulnerability. Models of realtime global worms (minutes globally)
exist as well.

Depending on the payload riding the worm things could be rather quick.

A worm would just break through to highes privilege and run directly, 
allowing OS some time slices (if it be stealthy) or killing it altogher 
(fast burn, sacrificing stealth or speed).

Harvey,
       I think you can discern that I am advocating two things:
1.  Be suspicious of government so that we can perform oversight as citizens.
2.  Get you facts straight and then apply them with some reason.

       This was not "a case where we saw people with weapons in a location 
and killed them without finding out who they were first."  We don't have all 
the facts yet to suit me but it appears the pilot saw weapons firing (they 
were) concluded they were firing at him (they weren't) and as he was at 
diminished mental capacity from taking speed (prescribed by the USAF) 
concluded that the fire was hostile and he attacked.  Now it appears that the 
brass is attempting to crucify the pilot instead of admitting he was on speed 
as a resulf of their policy.
       I think it was in the late 40s when I first heard of the USAF using 
drugs to alleviate fatigue in pilots on long missions.  Now people are saying 
the drug used is speed.
       Anyway, this is the charge we need to be investigating.  Why are our 
pilots so fatigued that they need speed to keep them alert?  Or is the whole 
thing misinformation on the part of someone?

[yep! it's a pleasure to fwd these two msg ...
                                           s.]

I have wondered about that question also, since I have seen both dates used.
I think that December 25 should be used, for two reasons.

The first reason is that dates themselves are somewhat arbitrary.  It can be
argued on philosophical grounds that almost (or all?) things are arbitrary,
so that's an empty statement.  But dates and times in particular have a long
history of changing amongst cultures and times.  So I would say that since
England used Dec 25 when he was born, that was his birthday.

The second reason I like Dec 25 is more technical.  Since it was realized
that the calendar was, I believe, 11 days off eventually, adjustments were
needed.  But why should we adjust that date, or ones near it, alone?  When
do we start the adjustments?  Do dates in 1100 AD need it?  How about 100
AD, should they be fixed by (about) a day?  That is too cumbersome to deal
with.  Let us just use the date that was used locally, and state which
calendar system was used.

I once made the embarrassing mistake of saying in public that Galileo's
death and Newton's birth were easy for New Zealanders to remember because
both events happened in 1642, the year that Abel Tasman was the first
European to find NZ. But G's death and N's birth were of course over 365
days apart! What is true is that T got here in the year of G's death, and
N was born while he was still sailing along the NZ coast.

What are you talking about? I would be absolutely delighted if the USA does

If you expect to fight a war without killing any innocents, zero, not one,
then you are living in a dream world.

The USA does everything it can think of to keep the number of innocents hurt
to a minimum and so far has been extraordinarily successful; the terrorists
do everything they can think of to keep the number of innocents hurt to a
maximum and so far have been extraordinarily successful.

       However, I made a case that Harvey had given me a list of citations

occurred back in the 90s and hence were not representative of anything that 
occured under the present administration or after the Patriot Act was passed 
by congress.  There was one final citation from the ACLU that thanked 
President Bush for reversing the previous policy of "secret evidence."  I 
believe there was additionally one instance where an organization thought to

Disclaimer: -- As a non-programmer.. my last code was BASIC ...I am certainly
not the one to compare the internet's "molecular structure" to wetware.
Having said that,  it seems given cursory examination ,  that rudimentary
parts of what  we have now is evolving towards several autonomous ,
interleaved global minds.   Instead of 2 hemispheres with inter communication
we may  have numerous.

The exact structure is evolving steadily, it seems.  The need for CPU
structures would likely be
defined by adding a functioning AI.  Brains, though very similar have a wide
range of functionalities.
If a global mind is to be most things to most people it has to be both
specialized and broad in its functionality.  We are not trying to create a
duplicate of any existing neural structure, but by
understanding the diversity of wetware build an evolving (flexible) copy.
Today's global mind if that is what I can call the sum of all communications
and connected wetware is an "idiot savant".
If what we have today is used as a base, we also do have allowed for  a
multiplicity of AI's which could share the same physical domain but operate
autonomously.  Like a mind,  knowledge is
distributed throughout the organism for redundancy.  A minor "stroke" should
not destroy any particular piece of knowledge.

Our current model is not only an "idiot savant" but suffers from runaway
multiple personality  disorders.  If found in a human we'd commit it.

The internet has survived one of its first assaults, that being the chaotic
liquidity of the financial markets that have created and sustained it .

The next  step is to add a functional AI.
Another as has been said is to increase the junction speed and cohesion of the
circuitry.

The lifespan of the human units is important as it adds stability to the organ
at a cellular level.
Compare the functionality of rapidly dividing cancer cells with the cells in
grey matter.
An AI if it were to view itself as a global organism , it would undertake to
enhance each of its components.  This bodes well for us "neurons".

If history is any example, we are not going to see just a single AI but
numerous.  Can a strategy be developed now which avoids the major headache of
past human endevours "competition for resources which ends in violent
conflict".  We don't need 10 AI's dueling it out "highlander" fashion to  end
up with a single or pair of survivors... or is this a necessary function of
evolution???

"It became cliche after September 11 to remark that "everything
is different now." We didn't know what was different, but something
had changed. Months later, after the detention of hundreds of
people without charges and the unleashing of the FBI to spy on U.S.
citizens, we have a better idea of where the differences lie.
America is now less like the constitutional republic launched in
1776, and more like a third-world banana republic. "

Amara,
       I read the article you submitted: "Padilla isn't the only person in 
prison under creative interpretations of US law. Many other suspects have 
been thrown behind bars under a statute intended to ensure that witnesses in 
criminal proceedings appear at trial. The Christian Science Monitor <A HREF="http://free-market.net/cgi/redir.cgi?http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0619/p01s02-usju.html">reported</A> 
that "[j]ust as a presidential designation of someone as an 'enemy combatant' 
can trigger indefinite military detention without any formal charge, federal 
prosecutors are accomplishing that same result of indefinite detention 
without charge by relying on the material-witness statute." 

       You are attempting to apply criminal law to a battlefield with an 
enemy army.  It may well be true that once a prisoner is designated an "enemy 
combatant" he can be held without charges but you don't tell us that an 
American citizen still has to be presented to the court to appeal that 
designation.
       I know the term "enemy combatant" was applied to American Citizens as 
far back as at least the 2nd world war.  If I remember correctly those 
"citizens" were eventually hung as enemy spies still under the title "enemy 
combatant."  I also believe that was a military court not a civilian court.

Perhaps we could make it an 11-day celebration from 12/25 through 1/4.

How about an eleven-day or maybe year-round celebration by each of us
coming up with new achievements?

Actually, I'm generally against these kinds of things -- holidays.  I
see no need to compete with traditional or religious holidays.  To some
extent, it's unnecessary.  Religious types are not going to be converted
because the Newtonmas celebration looks so cool.  And if it's merely an
excuse to celebrate -- and not to thumb one's nose at traditionalists --
then there's no need to put it in direct competition -- by holding it
the same time of the year as Christmas -- with traditional holidays.

Finally, one of the joys of atheism is not having to have stuff like
this.  For example, every Sunday I sleep late.:)

First, not all "third-world banana republic[s]" drag people off for
every little offense.  The record here is spotty and one of the big
difference between a banana republic and full fledged totalitarian state
is how uneven the authoritarianism is enforced.

The quote above also reads "more like" -- not "just like."  This brings
me to the second point, wouldn't you agree that the US government now is
more a threat to freedom -- I mean the freedom of Americans NOT just
foreigners -- than in 1776 or 1789 or 1800 or 1900?  This is more
important than whether the government is now just like some proverbial
"third-world banana republic."  I don't want to wait until I'm in a
forced labor camp to decide, "Hey, things are bad."

The American Colonials went to war -- treasonous, rebellious, seditious
civil war -- over far less from the British Empire than Modern Americans
put up with from the current government -- or any administration and
Congress that's been in office during the lifetime of anyone on this
list now.  We are, today, far more taxed, regulated, and monitored than
the British did to the Colonies circa 1776.  So I don't think Amara's
hyperbole is all that hyperbolic.  (Forgive the oxymoron.:)

"Legislation appears today to be a quick, rational, and far-reaching
remedy against every kind of evil or inconvenience, as compared with,
say, judicial decisions, the settlement of disputes by private arbiters,
conventions, customs, and similar kinds of spontaneous adjustments on
the part of individuals.  A fact that almost always goes unnoticed is
that a remedy by way of legislation may be too quick to be efficacious,
too unpredictably far-reaching to be wholly beneficial, and too directly
connected with the contingent views and interests of a handful of people
(the legislators), whoever they may be, to be, in fact, a remedy for all
concerned.  Even when all this is noticed, the criticism is usually
directed against particular statutes rather than against legislation as
such, and a new remedy is always looked for in 'better' statutes instead

While people criticizing the current administration have been harassed, 
don't you think it will be a little too late when you arrive at that 
stage?

First they came for the Jews
and I did not speak out - because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for the communists
and I did not speak out - because I was not a communist.

Then they came for the trade unionists
and I did not speak out - because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for me -
and by then there was no one left to speak out for me.

Actually, I do think US is a banana republic by now. So we have a somewhat 
less-than-charismatic successor to the throne which has to fix some loose 
ends daddy couldn't. Sure, even with the vote fraud (irregularities in a 
southern chronical porkbarrel state run by a yet another relative) it was 
a pretty fair vote. Albeit a bit low on choices, but it's hardly specific 
for the US.

Apropos of nothing, here's some satire (caution, 35 MBytes file) for you:

It's still a disturbing thing, since any citizen defendants have to
fight the full weight of our central/imperial government.  IIRC, these
things are still playing out in the government's courts.

I'm not so sure about that, BUT there was an actual declaration of war
back then, which kind of made these things finite.  (I'm not praising
the US government or the FDR administration back then either.  They were
pretty much out for an end run around constitutional limits to
government power.  Remember the goal of these limits was not for cunning
prosecutors to find fancy ways of getting around them but to actually
limit government power.  The limitations have pretty much failed, so
it's time to reconsider an anarchist paradigm here -- instead of relying
on monopoly governments to play by the rules when they enforce, revise,
and interpret these rules.)  Once the enemy was defeated -- the enemy
being, more or less, clearly defined -- the detentions would likely end.
(I'm not sure people thought that way, but that seems to have been the
outcome and the underlying assumption.  A cessation of hostilities,
i.e., would lead to freedom for such prisoners.)

The current situation seems to allow for perpetual imprisonment
incommunicado of just about anyone without trial.  We shall see how this
plays out in coming months, since there have been several challenges to
the Bush Administration's policy here.

Best wishes for 2003!

I don't think that the bottleneck is the genetic identity
of the soldier.  Old-fashioned breeding methods would 
suffice perfectly for creating just the kind of soldier
you'd want.  Besides that, in most endeavors people's
idiosyncrasies complement each other on the battlefield
as they do in an economy:  a platoon of identical soldiers
would probably be less efficient.

Putin is worried about declining Russian fertility, that's
all.

Hmm.  Now if we had a few clones of Von Neumann???  Perhaps
you are on to something here!

GEOLOGY

Three inner-earth heresies

<ital>Deep water.</ital>  In the long term, the earth's oceans are going to
disappear.  This prognostication is certainly counter to present global-
warming expectations.  The reasoning behind this radical future is a bit
obscure.

It seems that the meteorites of the type believed to have aggregated to
form the primitive earth contained about 2% water.  But today's oceans
make up only about 0.2% of the planet's mass.  Where is that 99% of the
water initially bequeathed the earth?

Of course, some of the deficit is in shallow aquifers and deeper
crevicular structures.  But K. Hirose, at the Tokyo Institute of
Technology, maintains that at least five times the volume of the
earth's surface water is locked up in the lower mantle 400-1,800
miles down.  Tests of representative mantle rocks suggest that
the mantle contains vast reservoirs of water---unobtainable by
us but there nonetheless.

Unfortunately, as more of the great crustal plates are subducted
into the mantle, as hypothesized by plate tectonics, they drag
still more surface water with them down into the mantle.  Hirose's
computer model predicts that in [?] billion years the oceans will
be sucked dry.

(Weinstock, Maia; "The Waters That Lie Within," <ital>Discover,</ital>
23:11, August 2002.)

<ital>Our planet is bleeding.</ital>  Not blood, but oil and natural
gas.  For example, satellite photos outline oil slicks many miles long
where no oil wells have been drilled.  The floor of the Gulf of Mexico
is widely cracked with "cold seeps."  Contrary to popular thought, some
oil fields believed depleted are now being refilled from below.  This
"new" oil is most likely very old oil created tens of millions of years
ago.  It is a light oil, quite different from that originally pumped.

(Cooke, Robert; "Some Oil Fields May Be Getting Refilled from Deeper
Reservoirs," <ital>Houston Chronicle,</ital> April 17, 2002. Cr. D.
Phelps)

Comments.  There may be a lot more oil down there than pessimists
predict.

Some of the deep "new" oil may be abiogenic, as long maintained by
T. Gold. (SF#124)

<ital>The earth's core is a natural fission reactor.</ital>  Virtually
all mainstream scientists subscribe to the theory that the heat leaking
up from the earth's interior is in part residual heat left over from the
planet's formation, with the remainder being heat released by the
radioactive decay of atoms in the mantle, such as potassium-40.  Despite
the simplicity and reasonableness of this model, J.M. Herndon wants to
install a natural fission reactor at the earth's core.  This reactor
would provide not only observed heat but also help explain solve [sic]
some long-standing geophysical puzzles.

Basically, Herndon posits a spherical fission reactor about 5 miles in
diameter composed of uranium-235 and uranium-238.  Technically, this
would be a fast-neutron breeder reactor.  Herndon  may have few
supporters in the earth-science field, but he can posit to some facts
consistent with his theory.

#The remains of natural fission reactors have already been discovered
in the earth's outer crust at Oklo, in Gabon. (SF#121)

#The geomagnetic field is irregular in shape and has apparently
frequently reversed itself over geological time spans.  Herndon's
seething core of molten metal could generate such a temperamental
field as it churns away, sometimes even temporarily ceasing operation
as accumulating reactor poisons shut off the fission reaction,
restarting as they dissipate.

#The helium-3 seeping outward from the earth's innards far exceeds what
geophysicists predict from primordial leftovers, but Herndon's reactor
would be a source of the overabundance of helium-3.

#Several other solar-system planets and moons are also exothermic and
without obvious sufficient heat sources.  Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and
Jupiter's moon, Io, might also harbor nuclear reactors.  Even our own
moon might!

Sorry to cut in. Rafal or anyone can feel free to disagree if my facts
are wrong.

Some further distinctions are necessary.

1) Outlawing and stopping are two different things. Laws have
 juridictions. It would definately be possible (given the political will) to
 outlaw cloning in a  jursidiction like the US (though they haven't
 actually  done so yet) but that would mean that offenders could be
prosecuted, once the law is broken, whether or not the law is actual
broken is a separate matter. Prohibition didn't stop drinking and laws
 against murder don't stop murders. By outlawing  "cloning" in the US
 you would just drive it out of the country.

2) Somatic cell  nuclear transfer or nuclear reprogramming
(sometimes called therapeutic cloning or the Dolly procedure) is
*exactly* the same process as is used for "reproductive cloning"
up until the point where the embryo is ready to be transplanted into
 a woman. That is up until the 4-5 day stage when the embryo
(actually called a blastocyst) consists of around 150 cells with
 about 30 cells in the inner cell mass that are embryonic stem cells.
The cells around the outside that make up the tropoderm (which
normally goes on to form the placenta etc) have already lost some
 of their capacity to become the full range of cells so those interested
 in getting embryonic cells for embryonic cell lines (for use in research
 aimed at therapies) must necessarily, on current technlogy, "cut
 throught" the tropoderm to collect the 30 or so cells in the inner cell
 mass that still retain the capacity to become any type of cell. This
 "cutting through" necessarily destroys the embryo (blastocyst) and is
 one of the major reasons those who oppose "therapeutic cloning" do
 so. They say, correctly,  that there is no part of this process that
is "therapeutic" to the embryo and that the term therefore is
potentially misleading. They think its unacceptable to destroy an
"embryo" even at that early stage to "harvest" the stem cells for use
 in therapies.

Whilst all the scientists I know of active in the area of embryonic
stem cells and somatic cell nuclear transfer are opposed to using
the process to produce an embryo to implant it in a woman, they
are very much in favour of using the process to collect the 30 or
 so cells from the embryo's inner cell mas (thus ending its viability
 as an embryo) as a side effect of deriving new embryonic stem
cell lines that could be extremely useful for therapies. And *would*
be useful in understanding cellular biology and in accelerating the
process of drug discovery.

Now here's the answer to the question I think your asking.
Because the technique of "cloning" to produce a embryo for
reproductive purposes and the technique of cloning to derive
embryonic stem cells are the same right up until the point at which
the embryo is either used for reasearch or implanted in a woman
and many legitimate reputable ethical scientists are not only willing
but permitted (legally) to do somatic cell nuclear transfer in many
countries. For example, Irving Weissman at Standford is
proposing to do this sort of somatic cell nuclear transfer with private
money and it isn't illegal (yet) for him to do so in the US. In the
UK. Ian Wilmut, Austin Smith and a US expat Pederson (I think)
would all be able to do somatic cell nuclear transfer (and train
students to do it) and  the UK government allows "therapeutic
cloning". Japan, Singapore, Israel, China all don't have laws
against it. The list goes on and on as most countries have talked
a lot but haven't got to the banning stage yet and some have
decided not to ban somatic cell nuclear transfer when it is to
 be used for therapeutic puposes.

Now, any country that allows somatic cell nuclear transfer (for
therapy) and also allows IVF has (or more accurately could
have) the two types of knowledge necessary to do
"reproductive cloning".  Some Arab countries have IVF too
and neither standard Jewish traditions (Israel) or standard
Arabian traditions have the same ethical problems with
therapeutic cloning as the standard christian tradition. Ie.
Neither of these cultures think an embryo is a "person" or
the moral equivalent of a person. So they are more inclined to
allow somatic cell nuclear transfer for therapeutic purposes.

(Aside: Its worth noting that most human embryonic stem
lines, including all those approved for use by the Bush
administration were derived not from embryos specifically
 created for the purposes of extracting the cells but from
IVF embryos. To my knowledge there is not currently
any embryonic stem cell lines in existence, (thought there
certainly are plans for some and excellent scientific
grounds for wanting to proceed with the creating of
some new lines).

So, given the strong drive to allow therapeutic cloning in
some parts of the "civilised" world, the widespread use of IVF
facilities and the ability for "know how" as well as experts to
travel across borders and legal jurisductions. Given also that
cloning for animal husbandry has strong commercial drivers
and gives rise to patents which get onto publicly available
databases then sooner or later, probably sooner, reproductive
cloning *will* occur.

This is not comparable to nuclear weapons making say where
the raw materials are hard to get hold of. The materials, the
knowledge and the financial backing will all be there.

And the knowledge will get easier and easier to obtain over time
especially once somatic cell nuclear transfer is done in humans for
therapeutic purposes. As I've said many reputable, ethical
scientists are headed in that direction now with the active consent
 of some national governments who want to accelerate the
discovery of treatments for diseases such as diabetes and
Parkinson's. Within a couple of years maximum scientists in
counties like the UK, Singapore, Japan, Israel and possible
the US will have produced legally what are embryo clones for
therapeutic use. Once that is done the knowledge to do
reproductive cloning *in humans* is out there also as the
technique is the same.

Any politician who thinks reproductive cloning can be prevented
from happening somewhere on the globe as opposed to delayed
is "misinformed". You could say deluded.

U.S. Had Key Role in Iraq Buildup
Trade in Chemical Arms Allowed Despite Their Use on Iranians, Kurds

By Michael Dobbs
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, December 30, 2002; Page A01

High on the Bush administration's list of justifications for war against
Iraq are President Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons, nuclear and
biological programs, and his contacts with international terrorists.
What U.S. officials rarely acknowledge is that these offenses date back
to a period when Hussein was seen in Washington as a valued ally.

Among the people instrumental in tilting U.S. policy toward Baghdad
during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war was Donald H. Rumsfeld, now defense
secretary, whose December 1983 meeting with Hussein as a special
presidential envoy paved the way for normalization of U.S.-Iraqi
relations. Declassified documents show that Rumsfeld traveled to Baghdad
at a time when Iraq was using chemical weapons on an "almost daily"
basis in defiance of international conventions.

Comment:

Notice the section stating that the "administrations of Ronald Reagan
and George H.W. Bush authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous items that
had both military and civilian applications, including poisonous
chemicals and deadly biological viruses, such as anthrax and bubonic
plague."  If this is true, then should not also the people behind these
transfers be punished for putting America in danger?  What do you think?

TRIBUTE TO FM-2030

For those of you who want to toast FM-2030 for his many visionary
contributions to transhumanity, now is the time to raise your glass.

As many of you may recall, I had planned to have a large tribute to FM at
UCLA where he taught futurism with the collaborative efforts of our close
friends - Max More, John Spencer, Seena Sharp, Andre Sharp and Nathan
Shapior.  The tribute was detained, but not forgotten.  Rather than having
an explosive and large gathering, I think that FM would prefer an intimate
gathering to continue over the years as an open-ended tribute to
transhumanity. 

FM's memory continues through his never-ending charismatic nature, eloquent
voice, visionary ideas and endless charm and humor. Let's reminisce FM's
work, ideas and vision and, in deference to FM, also those who have
continued on with a sense of optimism and vision.

Sorry, I don't quite follow.  Are you saying that full-fledged
totalitarian states have more uniform oppression?  If so, I
agree.  I would also say, however, that any technologically
advanced nation is apt to enforce its laws more uniformly.

In the U.S., however, the great profusion of laws devolves
real power back to into the hands of individuals, either the
cop on the beat or the judge ruling from the bench.  Moreover,
the notion that the law should not be interpreted literally
has helped to further uneven enforcement.

The *federal* government is indeed now more of a threat,
but I would say that government as a totality is less of
one.  The reason for this is that you have many kinds of
legal appeal available now that were not available earlier.
I do note your fine choice of dates, however  ;-)   You
didn't happen to choose 1846, 1864, 1917, or 1942.

Clearly a great deal depends on our emotions, through
which we tend to view practically everything.  For some
people, the U.S. is presently at war.  They'll keep on
feeling this way until they get used to a background of
minimal and ongoing minor threats.

On the other side, people would feel much differently
if each day another American city went up in a nuclear
blast.  I dare say that they'd be more frantic than any
of today's extremists, would demand that "something be
done", and wouldn't worry too much about a lot of suspects
being summarily rounded up and held without bail, or going
to internment camps.

Brett,
       That is the point I was trying to make.  But, as I am not expert in 
this area I had to ask first.
       As a young man studying to be a Naval Officer I learned I should never 
ever give and order that I couldn't enforce otherwise I make of myself a 
laughing stock.  Using that old principle as my launching point I am wanting 
to say that any discussion of "should cloning research be allowed" should be 
paralleled by another discussion about cloning "how are we going to delude 
this idiot?"
       I appreciate Dubya's religious principles and have a great admiration 
for him but on this issue he is impotent in the long run and not much better 
off in the short run.

He may not seem charismatic to you or me, but have you
seen his approval numbers lately?  Even more, you could
hardly have called it a "throne" before the recent 
elections that gave his party control of both the
other organs.

Yes, it was.  They never managed to substantiate the
charges of voter fraud, at least not on a scale that
wouldn't have embarrassed the ward heelers and bosses
of Chicago or New York.

In a hypothetical world, otherwise like this one, where a
clone's chances of surviving through to "birth" and being
"healthy" are just as good as that of the average non-clone, 
what new classes of threat or abuse or new sources of 
concern do people imagine would arise?  

For my part, I suspect there are none (I think they are
all resolvable by recourse to existing scientific data and 
simple lines of reasoning on what are more efficient paths
for bad-guy dictators to take) I'm keep to turn on the light
and remove the "boogieman", but maybe I am mistaken,
maybe there is some new cause for concern I should be
aware of.

Any takers ?  :-)

Read the piece about the USA/Iraq  vs Iran history of the 80's vs the
swithchback/backfire
of the 2000's

So maybe there is  truth when Osama said the chickens were coming back
to roost in relation to 911.

A question to pose today is whether a similar relationship with Korea's
nuclear program as a ploy to deal with some perceived menace from
China/East-Asia or the middle-East  could some day come back to bite us
all.

When you play with fire you always risk getting burned.
What is apalling is how much of civilization's productive capacity is
devoted to self-destruction.

Basically.  It tends to be more efficient at that than banana
republics -- at least the examples of the latter I know of, such as
Mexico in former years (though the jury still out on whether it's gotten
past that stage recently).

This is true if only because enforcement because easier with better
transport and communication technology.

I'd like to believe that too, but the truth is the profusion of laws has
led to those who are more politically connected or legally astute being
able to use the law against those who are not so connected or who are
ignorant.  In some cases, no doubt, this helps the cause of individual
liberty, but that's sort of like the broken window fallacy applied to
law.  Some bad laws or bad legal systems have unintended good
consequences.  However, I suspect this legal chaos actually serves the
opposite cause -- here allows the government to use all kinds of
provisions to protect itself and attack others.

For those who can afford it, maybe.  For those who can't, if your cause
is unpopular or not worthy of attention from the Media, you might be in
dire straits.  Also, a lot more today is illegal or falls under some
government provision at any level.

Do not make too big a deal of this.  I just rushed the email off.

Those -- with maybe the exception of 1846; I'm not as familiar with the
Mexican-American War -- years were years of explosive growth in
government which lends support to Robert Higgs' thesis in _Crisis and
Leviathan_: that government grows most during crises and then never
shrinks back to its precrisis size.  To take but one example, during the
US Civil War, the Federal government intervened severely in the banking
system.  After the war, the banking system did not go back to the
[semi-] free banking system that existed before it.  Instead, the
Federal government continued to meddle in the banking system extending
its powers (sometimes at the behest of powerful interests in the banking
industry, such as the Morgans) until eventually the Federal Reserve
System arose.

Anyhow, this racheting up of government power was not something I was
denying.  I do not see it as a steady growth, but periods of relative
stability, followed by periods of rapid growth, followed by periods of a
little pull-back.  Even so, the 20th century appears to have been a
watershed.  Government growth -- in the US and Europe -- has really been
rapid.  Crises appear closer together and the spread of democracy has
removed most brakes on power.  (I'm not sure there're more crises by any
measure, but the kind of special interest organization coupled with the
growth of government intervention in all aspects of life has led to any
crisis being a chance for any group to make a grab for something.  In
former times, such crises probably had a similar rate, but the state and
special interests did not have the apparatus to exploit them.)

But the truth is, there has been no declaration of war.  Without such,
don't you think these legal machinations should be curbed?  I don't mean
letting them run their course will find all of us locked up by
Independence Day, but it certainly does not paint an optimistic picture
for the future of freedom in America.

Happily, no city since 1945 has gone up in a nuclear blast.  If that
happened again, yes, I agree, more people would be calling for more
draconian measures.  However, if that happened long enough -- if cities
kept going up -- the government would probably not last long as a unit,
since it would not be able to defend itself.  Surely, local units and
the military would probably assert themselves, but only at the expense
of Federal power.

I'm not looking forward to such a prospect.  Also, there's little the
current government or any government could do to stop this scenario from
eventually playing out.  (I'm not sure how much it can do to delay it
either, since by getting more involved, this would only make more pariah
states and groups rush frantically to get and use such weapons, don't
you think?  What would you do in their shoes?)  Let's face it, nuclear
weapons are going to proliferate.  If not next year, in the next ten or
twenty years.  (Heck, look at the track record of the last ten years.
At least two new nuclear powers have been added to the list -- India and
Pakistan -- and one of them is a military dictatorship that sponsors
terrorism against the other.)  This is why, again, I advocate space
migration.  Let's leave the madhouse instead of debating over whether
government X or government Y is better.  (Or, at least, move away from
any likely targets, such as large cities or capitols.)

Best wishes for 2003!

I don't know why you are having trouble getting to these sites or  
having trouble understanding them when you get there.  Here is a repost  
of the new articles that I listed.  I have double-checked all of them.   
They are still available.  They all reference secret evidence being  
used by the current administration against Muslims after 9/11.  The all  
reference events for the dates I have quoted.  They all contain the  
exact quote I gave as the specific line of evidence.  I don't see how

Yes this story describes a case four years ago, but it also describes a  
Muslim leader jailed on secret evidence this past January by Ashcroft  
and the Bush Administration.

Are you seeing the same articles I am when you click on these links?   
Are the quotes there?  Are the dates the same?  I'm really confused at  
your claim that none of my citations contained any of my claimed

me, and present the evidence I claimed.

Once we get the transhuman engineering up and running we can develop new
species specialized to life on less hospitable worlds.  Places like Jupiter
and Saturn might not be that bad.  Just going there and leaving alive  and
communication are not
yet feasible.  There may be non-organic devices able to use novel
communication means like X-ray generators able to pioneer/explore.

Anyone know who these guys are? They seem to be "watching" or 
 "catching" this list at present.

I typed in my name to Google to see if they were operating as I'd 
done on previous occasions and there they were. My recent
posts along with those of others. 

Seems they "javien" are not alway catching the extropian list so I wonder
when they are and when they aren't.

Harvey,
       You have discovered a case that I referred to you in an email via this 
list several days ago.
       The other citation you offered me is a case where the judge closed the 
courtroom in the interests of national security.  It is not a case, insofar 
as I can see, of keeping evidence secret from the defendent or the judge.
       You have illustrated the problem with your labeling things "secret 
evidence."  That label is not precise in its meaning and you give us no clue 
as to exactly what you are talking about.

I don't know.  I have read that section of the Constitution and while I don't 
remember it clearly I am pretty sure there is no precise set of procedures 
for how Congress declares war -- I seem to remember that it just says that 
Congress shall declare war.  The Constitution also leaves the purse strings 
in the hands of the Congress.
       I listen pretty closely to the Congress after the 911 attack.  I 
believe they gave the President permission to attack and authorized him 
spending the money.  Is that a Declaration of War.  I think so but I'll 
listen to the Constitutional lawyers.

Of course, in the interim, a nice little disaster or setback could
confine us to Earth until something else takes us out.  I.e., why wait?

Best wishes for 2003 and beyond!

Javien.com is a company whose employees/owners/associates, most notably
David McFadzean, have provided Extropy Institute with a number of services,
including that Javien Forum archive. That archive, as well as the ExI BBS
archive (also put together by David, incidentally) has been linked to on
the official Extropians email lists page http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists
for the past two months (although it has been available online for longer
than that, we were using an outdated version of the lists page until then).

The Extropians list archives have been publicly available since 1996, in
the Majordomo archives. The Javien Forum archives were added at least a
year and a half or so ago, and the BBS archives were added on April 14,
2002. All of these, with varying search functions and message/thread
display formats, are accessible through the above link. Occasionally one
of them will miss a few messages for whatever reason.

These two citations don't sound like the list of a eight news stories that I
posted.  I still cannot tell if you are looking at the list I posted twice.
They specifically stated that "secret evidence" was used, using those exact
words.  I don't see how you can miss this with deliberately doing so.

I have not labeled anything thus.  The headlines and newspaper articles used
the exact words "secret evidence".  The judge, prosecuters and Ashcroft
himself are quoted using the words "secret evidence".  How can you read this
and still claim that I am reading the concept of secret evidence into what
they are saying

You are either very confused or deliberately lying about these articles.
Unless you can point to a specific link and explain why the words "secret
evidence" don't really mean secret evidence, I can't respond to your vague
dismissals.

Thanks Ziana  for taking the time for the heads up, it was the number of
times the ExI list appeared as an example that had me wondering if an
someone from the list was involved with it. There are some pretty capable
folk about around this list :-)

Regards,
Brett

The only semi-legitimate concern I can think of is that it
adds less diversity to the gene pool than traditional breeding,
and so might allow infectious diseases to out-evolve us.  But
it would have to become a /very/ common means of reproduction
for that to have any major effect.

Harvey,
       Go back and track down our thread to see what has been said.  I stated 
that I have gone through that entire set of citations you first provided.  I 
refered to the Moslem "Charity" that was forbidden to continue operations in 
this country.  I referred to the definition of "secret evidence" used in the 
court.  I believe it was different than the one you use but that is for you 
to decide.  I referred to the fact that your long list of evidence pretty 
much came to nothing.
       In addition I referred to having tried to read every citation you 
provided but that some returned an error message or otherwise no longer being 
available.  No, I do not intend to follow up up any further.  So far the 
"evidence" you have offered has turned out to be underwhelming and I quit.

Harvey,

I think the issue here is what Bush, et. Al. mean by "secret evidence."
Secret to whom?  If the people involved in the actual trial
(particularly the defendant and judge) are being denied access to the
evidence against the defendant, there is a problem.  If it is "secret
evidence" in that the common public doesn't get to see the evidence,
that might be more excusable in this context.  In the quotes I've read
regarding "secret evidence" on this list, it is unclear how they mean
it.

Mike Read

SL4's monthly chat for January falls on Wednesday, Jan 1st, at 9PM.  Since 
this happens to be the first day of the New Year, I am declaring Wednesday 
to be SL4's Annual Chat.  To celebrate, this chat will be twice as 
intelligent as one of our ordinary monthly chats.

Please note that the monthly chat rules have changed from alternating
between Wednesday and Saturday to simply "The first Wednesday of every
month, at 9PM Eastern Time."

To participate through a standard IRC client, connect to "sl4.org" on a
standard IRC port (for example, 6667) and join channel #sl4.
     irc://sl4.org/sl4

To participate through Java applet, point your browser at:

To clear up any confusion about timezones, go to

I would be happy to copy the articles and send them to you.  But you seem to
have ignored the quotes that I already posted.

Or you could ask one of your trusted friends to do so as well, but they
probably aren't interested in this evidence either.

Or you could try to fix your unreliable browser, which seems to
coincidentally only fail to retrieve articles that you don't want to see.

Or you could paste the links into Google and look at their cache copies of
these articles.

Or you could just quit as you indicated and not try to review any evidence
that contradicts your world view.

Somehow, you still characterize my evidence as "underwhelming" even though
you seem unwilling or unable to look at it.  I don't know what else you
expect me to do since all the difficulty seems to be on your end.

Autogen develops computer program to search for genes
Sydney
December 30 2002


Australian biotech Autogen Ltd says it has developed a computer program
which would revolutionise the search for disease causing genes.

The company said it would make the program available free to all academic
institutions and their researchers.

Autogen said its "GeneSniffer" program would allow scientists to search
through all published gene databases in just minutes.

Previously such gene searches could take weeks to find the desired match,
Autogen said.

Autogen said there were many errors and gaps to be filled in the current
public databases which provide information on genes and mining through this
information was tedious and time consuming.


GeneSniffer sidestepped these problems allowing researchers to download and
annotate gene sequences, Autogen said.

"The output of these scripts is in HTML format (downloaded) directly to our
intranet Web site to allow all team members access to the latest
information," it said.

The Geelong-based company developed the GeneSniffer program with the
International Diabetes Institute.

Autogen, whose major shareholder with 19.9 per cent stake is Charter Pacific
Corporation Ltd, is working on treatments for stress, obesity and diabetes.

Secret evidence means the defendant and their lawyers cannot see the
evidence, cannot cross examine the accusers, and cannot be given details of
the crime of which the defendant is accused.  Sometimes the judge is allowed
to see the evidence, but sometimes even the judge is asked to trust the
evidence sight unseen.  In extreme cases, Bush and Ashcroft have argued that
the military should hold a secret trial without even informing the court
system of the event.

Although most people accused of crimes are assumed to be innocent until
proven guilty, this is not the case with terrorists or enemy combatants.
They are assumed to be guilty from the start.  As such, they have lost their
right to a lawyer, trial, review of the evidence, facing the accusers, etc.

Damien reported a similar problem.  Now , I suspect
that most list readers know what the problem is, but
for those who don't...

The links below, like Damien's, are (my guess)
identified by the list software--I would guess the
string "http:" that all urls start with is the flag
for the software--and converted automatically to
links.  But no more than one line makes it into the
url.  If the url is a long one extending more than one
line, you will note that those additional address
elements appear in the subsequent lines neither
underlined nor highlighted in blue.  More to the
point, they are not included in the url/address that
will be looked for when you click on the 'apparent'
link.  Instead the truncated address will be looked
for and, since it's not a 'real' link, and doesn't
exist, a message announcing that fact will appear on
your browser screen.

Here's the solution to the problem.  Copy the part of
the address that has been cut off, and then click on
the link, and then paste the cut off portion back onto
the back end of the address in the address bar, and
then hit the 'enter' key.

see the weird symbol (between 2002Oct29 and Found) on
the following link?  Or maybe you don't, which is why
your computer accesses it.  Anyway it's a dash, with a
vertical line off the end, if you paste it into word,
recopy it, it won't even paste back.  I've never seen
it before, and it seems to be preventing this link
from working.  It turns into " %C2%AC " after
attempting to access the link.  If you truncate
everything after 2002Oct29 it will work though.

Power and Vulnerability
by Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.

Worrying about centralized power is the job of all libertarians
everywhere. But not everyone shares this fear of despotism. Sam
Tanenhaus, writing in the Wall Street Journal, seeks to demonstrate that
Bush is no Imperial President, and neither were his predecessors Nixon,
Kennedy, and FDR. They were not imperial or powerful, says Tanenhaus;
they were just presidential.

The crucial thing to ask about a piece like this is: what is his
standard? How can we judge whether a president is imperial or not? There
are three forms of presidential imperialism: being belligerent
internationally, being intrusive domestically, and running roughshod
over another branch of government. In all three ways, it would seem
obvious that the Bush presidency is imperial. From a rhetorical point of
view, it would seem a better tack to admit it and defend the idea, as
Wall Street Journal writers usually do.

I think your second sentence nails that concern almost immediately.

The risks of not having genetic diversity are pretty well known.
There were cultural taboos against incest well before genetics were
well understood. I think these would nicely kick in and act as a
counterweight if necessary. Especially with a very little education .

Also I don't think many people would opt for reproductive cloning
other than the rare "parent" who is unlikely to opt for
a whole bunch of "Daryls" or "Daves" that are too much alike.
(Interestingly "armies" of Daryls or Daves - a concern often voiced
in the popular media would be particularly susceptible to custom
made microbes - another reason why that would be a dumb/inefficient
option for a bad guy dictator).

The fight between viruses and bacteria and humans is an old one.
Up until relatively recently say the time of Pasteur and Koch and
the "germ theory", we were fighting (like other host animals) in the
dark and *our* genetic diversity was *our* best group defence.

Increasing we are fighting in the light. Sure microbes that see
humans as their natural habitat and have a exceptional capacity
to evolve are giving us some challenges in the areas of antibiotics
etc, but we are not fighting blind anymore we understand the
genetic mechanisms.

The problem of antibiotic resistant strains of microbe arises with
or without clones. Our best *general* weapon against the brute
force threat of the microbes (with their exception power to throw
up variation and then reproduce quickly) is our understanding of
microbe genetics.

Understanding human genetics and immunity better helps too.
Today it is this understanding not simply randomly dispersing our
genes in many baskets that gives us the chance to come up with
*specific* weapons (antibiotics and vaccines) much more quickly
than previously.

And whilst microbes can move fast between countries in hosts
on planes. We can send media warnings faster. As always, if they
work too well and kill to quickly they wipe out their means of
spreading. If they work slowly but surely (a more effective
approach) we now have far better means of detecting them lurking
(HIV and HepC like) and we have better lead times for working out responses.

by Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.

Worrying about centralized power is the job of all libertarians everywhere. But not everyone shares this fear of despotism. Sam
Tanenhaus, writing in the Wall Street Journal, seeks to demonstrate that Bush is no Imperial President, and neither were his
predecessors Nixon, Kennedy, and FDR. They were not imperial or powerful, says Tanenhaus; they were just presidential.

The crucial thing to ask about a piece like this is: what is his standard? How can we judge whether a president is imperial or not?
There are three forms of presidential imperialism: being belligerent internationally, being intrusive domestically, and running
roughshod over another branch of government. In all three ways, it would seem obvious that the Bush presidency is imperial. From a
rhetorical point of view, it would seem a better tack to admit it and defend the idea, as Wall Street Journal writers usually do.

If you read a treatise like John Densons Reassessing the Presidency, and judge the presidency against Americas founding fear of
executive rule, most presidencies have been excessively imperial, but particularly modern ones, though some more than others (Carter
is looking better and better in retrospect, for example). The Constitution gives the chief executive very few functions, and most of
those can be carried out only with the advice and consent of the Senate. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches were
supposed to be of somewhat balanced weight, jealously checking each other.

But today, the imperial nature of the presidency is proven by this fact alone: it has the power to destroy the world with the push
of a button, without consulting anyone. This is no idle threat. The US remains the only government in human history to have dropped
nuclear weapons on people, it has far more weapons than anyone else, and remains the only country that reserves to itself the right
of first strike. How would Washington or Jefferson have viewed that?

Still, Tanenhaus denies that the Bush administration is imperial, while nowhere giving us an example of a president  or any
government leader anywhere  who can rightly be considered imperial. How are we to recognize an imperial presidency on the off
chance that one should come along?

He does offer this critique of the thesis that presidents have been, and that Bush is, imperial. His proof comes down to two
sentences. "Every modern president has found power to be elusive, slippery and at times treacherous," he writes. "They occupy an
office fraught with risk and are never more vulnerable than when their power seems greatest."

That's it  a criterion that we might call the vulnerability test. In Tanenhaus's view, if power is vulnerable it is not imperial.
If power is imperial, it is not vulnerable. What he has in mind here is that the president is always worried about polls and
political rivals, about making deals in Congress and having his appointees rejected or dragged through the mud. The presidency must
constantly care about internal leaks and betrayals and plots, to say nothing of the legacy of the administration. In this sense, the
presidency does not have absolute power because he cannot always command unquestioned obedience.

All of this is true enough, but does it really prove the absence of imperial power? What about the possibility that power and
vulnerability go together? The more powerful the president, the more he uses the power he has to build the state and concentrate its
decision-making authority within the White House, the more he must concern himself with keeping that power and deterring threats to
that power.

This is certainly the case with historys most notorious despots. Nero was obsessed by the plots against him. Stalin believed
himself to be constantly vulnerable, and made it his mission to kill his rivals before they killed him. Byzantine and Ottoman
emperors typically killed all their male relatives. Hitler was paranoid about the prospect of tyranicide. Ceausescu lived and ate
deep in a bunker, and, like despots of old, had tasters check his food.

To be ruled despotically is contrary to the nature of man; thats why every dictator feels himself vulnerable: he knows that what he
is doing upsets the natural order. Nor is this behavior limited to autocrats. Indeed, security of themselves and their government is
the first concern of all heads of state. Why is that? Power is never absolute. The more it attempts to be, the more it can awaken
the human longing for freedom, and inspire the desire to resist.

Ultimately, as Hobbes demonstrated, the use of power requires the cooperation of the subjects. People must be willing to obey. It is
for this reason that the more power is used, the more it comes under question. In this impulse and dynamic we find the basis of
revolution. To prevent revolution, every dictator would like to will away the freedom of people to think for themselves.

Thomas Jefferson thought that to awaken the revolutionary impulse, and to remind powerful governments that they are vulnerable is a
good thing. "When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
absolute Despotism," he wrote in his Declaration, "it is [the people's] right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and
to provide new Guards for their future security."

The small, unintrusive government faces few threats to its limited power. Until Lincolns day, for example, it was possible to walk
around Washington unencumbered. One could knock on the White House door and be greeted by the presidents butler. No office was
closed to citizens. It was like any other town. There was no great fear emanating from the presidential quarters or any other public
office. Why? Because power in the modern sense was so small. No one in government had good reason to feel threatened by anyone.

But as the power of DC has grown, so has its fortress mentality. Walking around Washington today, you have the feeling that you are
constantly watched. Streets are sealed to traffic. Forget trying to visit any bureaucracy. You can't get in the door without an
official invitation. Every movement on the streets is recorded on camera. Employees of every bureau are prone to jump at the
slightest odd noise, and arrest anyone who behaves unusually. These are all indications that DC considers its power slippery and
treacherous  while, at the same time, being proof of overweening power itself.

Some people rule out the possibility of abusive power in a democracy, which means rule by the people. But Bertrand de Jouvenel
describes the reality: "The history of the democratic doctrine furnishes a striking example of an intellectual system blown about by
the social wind. Conceived as the foundation of liberty, it paves the way for tyranny. Born for the purpose of standing as a bulwark
against power, it ends by providing Power with the finest soil it has ever had in which to spread itself over the social field."

Of what does the imperial power of the Bush administration consist? There are the accumulated precedents of all predecessors  every
despotic act of every "great" president can be invoked to justify just about anything he wants to do. Then there is the
nuts-and-bolts power of the executive branch, which is vastly larger and more managerially invasive than the other branches.

There is the power over public opinion that comes from the media's and people's view that he is somehow the Maximum Leader of the
nation. There are his hundreds of billions of discretionary funds to be spent in the course of four years. There is his own moral
conviction that he is right and leads a country that is blameless, even infallible, in foreign policy. Finally, there is control of
public opinion, which shifted towards passivity in the face of government claims after 9-11.

Now, to say that Bush is an Imperial President is not necessarily to make a personal critique of the man. Benjamin Constant observed
that when people are angry at power, they should remember that "it is the measure of force that is the culprit, not its holders.
Your indignation needs to be directed against the sword and not against the arm. There are weapons which are too heavy for the hand
of man."

We can think of many examples: To seek to "grow an economy," to rid the world of evil, to right every domestic wrong, to manage the
evolution of community life, to control the politics of every state and nationthese are absurd ambitions. To seek them is to be
imperial, and with empire comes delusion, which intellectuals collude in heralding.

Why can't intellectuals recognize power and its evils, and call it what it is? Aside from their personal interests, it has something
to do with the blinding mystery of government itself. It is for the same reason that taxation is not called theft, that the draft is
not called kidnapping, that war is not called murder. Wrote St. Augustine:

What are thieves' purchases but little kingdoms? For in thefts, the hands of the underlings are directed by the commander, the
confederacy of them is sworn together, and the pillage is shared by the law amongst them. And if those ragamuffins grow but up to be
able enough to keep forts, build habitations, possess cities, and conquer adjoining nations, then their government is no more called
thievish, but graced with the eminent name of a kingdom.

Our modern despots are graced with the eminent name of president.

Lee:  The author makes many good points about power
with some good historical examples.  I enjoy the fact
that the federal government was actually *smaller*
in 1855 than in 1800.  Then (as the author says)
the Civil War came.

The author seems to imply that today it would be
possible for one to still knock on the front door
of the White House and be greeted by the butler
if only the Presidency hadn't become so powerful.

This is nonsense, of course.  Given modern transportation
and the fact that so many people have so much free time
on their hands, by 1880 the President of the U.S. (just
like the Governor of Alaska) would have to be beyond
reach.  Why, a few years back, you couldn't even knock
on Robert Heinlein's door a few miles south of here a
few years back.  Which is sort of obvious.

An important shift occurred after the invention of the
telegraph, and later was tremendously accelerated with
possibility of wars that could be all over in half an
hour.  Some systemic forces compel a nation's leadership
to be more focused.

One hundred and fifty million kilometers away, a stable thing lights the 
darkness.  It is an accident, this stable thing; a chance coalescence of a 
cloud of interstellar dust.  It is an accident billions of years old, 
persisting to this day.  Even in an accidental universe, some accidental 
forms survive long enough, or happen frequently enough, to be seen: 
burning stars, falling raindrops.

One hundred and fifty million kilometers away, a self-sustaining fusion 
reaction burns.  Hydrogen becomes helium; two nuclei become one nucleus, 
as the star's heat and pressure imparts the two nuclei with enough energy 
to pass over the lip of a potential energy surface and fall into the 
central well.  Like two planets accelerating toward each other under the 
influence of gravity, and colliding, converting gravitational potential 
energy into kinetic energy, and eventually heat; so the two nuclei, once 
over the lip, are attracted to each other by the strong nuclear force. 
Potential energy becomes kinetic energy, and then heat.  And eventually, 
as the heat works its way outward from the star's core, electrons rise and 
fall in their orbitals and photons are emitted from the star's surface, 
into space.

Photons cross one hundred and fifty million kilometers of distance, to 
warm one side of the Earth; on the other side, heat radiates away into the 
background cold of the cosmos.  One hundred quadrillion seconds ago, these 
photons fell on a chance mixture of chemicals, a primordial soup where 
molecules randomly wandered in and out of stable attractors.  It was the 
sun, ultimately, that powered this wandering.  A solar photon carries 
energy that originates in protons and neutrons crossing the potential 
energy surface of the nuclear strong force.  In the day, solar photons 
raised the temperature of the primordial soup, and provided chemicals 
within it the energy needed to cross the weaker electromagnetic barriers 
that separate one molecular configuration from another.  In the night, 
heat radiated into the cold, preventing the primordial soup from growing 
steadily hotter until no molecular bonds could form.

One hundred quadrillion seconds ago, the process of evolution began, with 
the accidental rise of a complex molecule that could construct copies of 
itself from the other stable molecules in its vicinity.  But evolution 
requires, not just replication, but mutation.  When the second 
self-replicating molecule came into existence, and the third, and the 
fourth, it was the continuing breakup of molecules by the Sun that ensured 
the presence of raw materials for these fitter molecules to construct new 
copies of themselves.  It was the light of day that broke up the molecules 
of the past generation and ensured that new replicators did not run out of 
raw material to replicate themselves.  It was the work done by the Sun 
that allowed evolution to produce order from chaos within the 
thermodynamic system that is Earth.

As, later, it would be the sunlight of day that allowed plants to break 
down the dead bodies of evolution's debris into the simpler molecules that 
would be turned into the phenotypes of the next generation.  As, later, it 
would be the cool of night that allowed the entropy produced by 
evolution's computations to radiate into space.

Today our planet completes another orbit around its original source of 
order, according to an arbitrary social boundary, rounded to the nearest 
planetary rotation.  A year is a useful time period for humans to reflect 
on; not too short, not too long.  The boundary must fall somewhere.  It 
falls today.

On that boundary day, in addition to the tradition of reviewing the past 
year, we created the symmetrical tradition of reviewing the year to come; 
looking forward to the future to state predictions or goals.

The Earth rotates on its planetary axis, and the succession of heat and 
cold, light and dark, slowly drives the ratchet of evolution.  Each 
succeeding generation is a little more interesting than the last.

Like a wheel, the Earth is going somewhere as it rotates on its axis; like 
a wheel, the cycle of life and birth moves forward as it repeats.

Nature's morality is not our own.  "Survival of the fittest" is a 
misleading name for a war in which even the winners die.  Evolution is a 
poor design method, an incremental accumulation of fortunate accidents. 
If evolution moves in the direction of greater complexity, then that is 
only direction, and not purpose.  As the price of our existence, evolution 
has charged a toll measured in the death of billions of sentients and 
countless quadrillions of nonsentients.  The cycle that repeats with each 
birth and death is a cycle of war.

But evolution's endless war is a cycle that moves forward as it turns. 
Not a traveling vehicle steered by an operator, only a log rolling down a 
fitness landscape.  Direction, but not purpose; a destination, but not a 
target; nonetheless, the cycle is heading somewhere as it turns.

It's heading for the end of the war.

One way or the other, it's heading for the end of the war.

The orbit of the Earth around the Sun, its source of order, also 
determines a cycle, the cycle of the seasons.  From the perspective of 
biology, the seasons are the cycle that turns to drive the evolution of 
the shorter-lived forms of plant life.

But from our perspective, a year is the cycle that turns to drive an 
individual human lifespan.

Here is the place where we mark the end of one cycle and the beginning of 
another.  It's an arbitrary placemark, but it's a communal placemark.  A 
time set aside by tradition to ask each other, and more importantly, 
ourselves:  "The wheel has turned; did it move forward?"  One day, within 
the year, set aside as a reminder of the cycle; like one second, within a 
day, set aside for your alarm clock to ring in the morning.

Evolution has direction, but no purpose.  Purpose is the privilege of 
intelligence alone.  Are you taking advantage of it?

What was the direction of last year's cycle?
What purpose do you have in store for this one?

What will you do with the gift of 2003?
