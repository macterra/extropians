Dear Spike,

>Referring to rocket exhaust as sapphire dust is a bit of a stretch. {8-]

Now I'm confused.

Brian said 'spits', but he described no physical process. Sapphire is
aluminium oxide, isn't it? I'm acquainted with slag Al2O3, paint flakes etc.,
in the ESA models and data for debris detected with dust detectors in LEO
and GEO (esp. debris 'clouds' as a result of firings from solid rocket
boosters). Al2O3 is picked up in Earth's stratosphere, as well. I also
learned at Esrange last August that these same composition particles litter
the ground after their launches. These are my reference points for making
my statement.

So what process are you referring to?  I.e. could you please tell 'how'
and 'where' a rocket "spits" sapphire dust?

(Basically interested to know spatial locations, velocities and sizes of
the particles).

Amara

I was referring to the general technology having some rapid applications in 
the real world that would have significant effects on society.

I view a ten-twenty year period as a short time.  Especially compared to 
the notion that social forces are going to somehow move more quickly than 
that - I don't think so.  Unless of course the technology is applied to 
that end.

Do we have any evidence that is the case?  And remember Drexler's comment

What is the "near future"?  By 2020, it has been suggested by others that 
the complete body-wide simulation of all cellular reactions will be 
feasible.  And why do we need atomic-level simulations to determine 
longevity probabilities?

Why leave out computational capability?  Granted it is constructible, so 
perhaps it is not a primary but it is a requirement for development so I 
would suggest it is close enough to a primary requirement to be 
included.  Certainly some degree of computational capacity has to be a 
given IMO.

My point is that a fully developed nano entity has no need for "allocation 
of resources"  - at least not as we understand it.  Without biological 
death, and with the nano ability to construct anything at will from cosmic 
resources, the only need to construct anything will be in pursuit of goals 
we cannot now imagine.  Granted, it is possible that some of these goals 
may require cooperation between such entities, but it is not certain that 
this cooperation will need to be "traded for" - it might be freely given if 
the goal is considered desirable by all the entities concerned.

Human economics is a direct result of human nature, i.e., human physical 
and social and cultural evolution.  There may be such a thing as "posthuman 
economics" but I have yet to determine what it might entail, other than the 
exchange of information.

I don't think a "hive mentality" is at all likely, either.  I suspect that 
posthumans will be just the opposite - absolute individuals with no need 
for social interaction as we know it - but perhaps with the capacity for 
extremely intimate social relations when desired or necessary.  I believe 
posthumans will be post-social, post-economic, post-political, and 
post-biological.  The full development of this may take some decades beyond 
the initial Singularity, but I believe that with brains operating a million 
times faster than human brains, that this will not take long.  I predict 
that by the end of this century, humans will no longer exist - either 
because they have destroyed themselves with aspects of the technology, or 
because they all transcended (voluntarily or otherwise), or they have 
challenged the posthumans and been destroyed.  The only likely fourth 
possibility is all of the above - some destroy themselves, some transcend, 
some are destroyed, and perhaps others merely muddle along as before.

Damien, why would Natasha want rude comments in her website?  And do you really think she hid them away somewhere hard to find??  I never even thought Australians enjoyed rudeness!  You all seem like such nice people.  

In my case I think what we needed was more information about the huge nanopowered super sex organs these bodies could sport!!  Or perhaps they don't even have sex organs, because they might just link up their nervous systems with medical nanotech.  It would give a whole new meaning to "baby, come over here and hold my hand."  

I bet that's what Natasha had in mind!

best wishes,

John : )

So would I be right in assuming that this stands for Geosynchronous Earth

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 578  February 27, 2002

FRACTAL CARBON NANOPORE NETWORK.
<snip>, go to http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/2002/split/578-1.html
.................................
    The fractal nature of solid shapes has been measured many
times, but this might be the first time a fractal mapping has been
performed for the empty space inside a void, namely the nanopore
network.  (For comparison of pore, surface, and solid fractals, see
the figure at www.aip.org/mgr/png.)  The surface area of this great
inland realm works out to about 1000 square meters (or one
football field) per gram.  The researchers expect that methane and
other fuels could be stored in this kind of structure (the molecules
are readily taken up into the branching alleyways by the weak
attraction of induced electric dipole "van der Waals" forces), and at
pressures much less than the 200 atm needed to store methane in
steel cylinders.  Gas separation can also be accomplished because
the narrow channels are negotiated more easily by some molecular
species than others.   Electricity storage might be accomplished by
building capacitors enhanced by intermediate layers of activated
carbon networks filled with an ionic conducting fluid.  (Pfeifer et
al., Physical Review Letters, 18 March 2002)
=============================================

I'm all excited because I've been waiting for some sort of potential method
for building ultra-capacitors for a long time. Lots of suface area *plus*
very small separations, along with physical strength and good dielectric
constant - this is the first real sign of it. I want to see an end to
chemical batteries. I'll get my electric car yet.

OK. You are referring to _the book_ stretching the analogy between Al2O3
and sapphire, rather than _me_ stretching the analogy. I'm pretty slow
these days. Apologies for my confusion, Spike. Now I get it....

The excellent keynote address Ray Kurzweil gave at Extro-5 regarding the oncoming Singularity is now available online!!  Thanks to my airline I arrived in time to only see the second half of his talk, so this was a big treat for me.  I highly recommend everyone check it out!

Kurzweil may not be the most exciting public speaker, but his content makes listening well worth it.

Yes, or just geosynchronous orbit ("geo" refers to Earth already)

Some common terms

GEO = geosynchronous orbit    (6.6 * R_earth)
GSO = geostationary orbit (6.6 * R_earth)
LEO = low-earth orbit     (say < 2 * R_earth)

See:
http://www.celestrak.com/columns/v04n07/
for text and the figures

A.C. Clarke was such a pioneer ...! He originated the idea of using
the GSO for communications.

See Arthur C. Clarke's figure (above URL) from his article in the
October 1945 edition of Wireless  World.

More from the above URL:

{begin quote}
For any orbit to be geostationary, it must first be geosynchronous.
A geosynchronous orbit is any orbit which has a period equal to the
earth's rotational period. As we shall soon see, this requirement is
not sufficient to ensure a fixed position relative to the earth.
While all geostationary orbits must be geosynchronous, not all
geosynchronous orbits are geostationary. Unfortunately, these terms
are often used interchangeably.
[...]
To ensure that a satellite remains over a particular point on the
earth's surface, the orbit must also be circular and have zero
inclination. Figure 2 shows the difference between a geostationary
orbit (GSO) and a geosynchronous orbit (GEO) with an inclination of
20 degrees. Both are circular orbits. While each satellite will
complete its orbit in the same time it takes the earth to rotate
once, it should be obvious that the geosynchronous satellite will
move north and south of the equator during its orbit while the
geostationary satellite will not.
[...]
It should now be apparent that only satellites which orbit with a
period equal to the earth's rotational period and with zero
eccentricity and inclination can be geostationary satellites. As
such, there is only one geostationary orbit-a belt circling the
earth's equator at an altitude of roughly 35,786 kilometers. {end quote}

Have fun leaping to wrong conclusions and erroneous judgements
about people do you?

No I simply mean it was over done, it clearly wasn't a random
distribution, but the hand-picked signature of the reverse
discrimination protocol known as "affirmative action".

Thus defined as "politically correct".

There are more problems with cloning.  Cloned animals have many biological
problems not found in the original animals.  Current techniques cause
genetic damage to the DNA being transferred.  Telomeres are copied at the
current adult (pre-aged) level.  Cloned animals have thus far aged
prematurely and died younger than normal.  Now we have this report which
reports on some investigations into these problems.

I know most people on this list support reproductive cloning, as do I.  But
we need to be realistically aware that current processes are not ready for
prime time.  I do not believe any cloned animals are normal (yet).  The only
ones that appear normal are too young and have not been studied long enough.
Many cloned animals appear normal at first and develop weird problems later
in life.  All of the evidence points to genetic damage in the process
itself.

I completely agree with what you have written here. This was very
eloquently put.

Resolved: Human cloning not ready for prime time.

I vote in favor.

I'm new to the list, so if this was mentioned before, forgive me. Recently, 
there's been talk of a company that now clones your pet for you. The first 
kitten cloned, recently, was named "cc".

At least, human cloning such as the Raelians are into at this 
time.  Cloning humans where the resultant fetus is allowed to be born and 
grow into adulthood would be premature now, but without experiments 
eventually where cloned fetuses are allow to develop at least partially to 
establish that the process "took" I think the development of cloning humans 
will be slowed.  That said, obviously the animal experiments are the best 
path until the success rate at producing healthy animals is much higher.

I'm not sure everybody supports reproductive cloning rather than 
therapeutic cloning - unless you refer to reproductive as reproducing body 
parts, which I think most Transhumanists would favor.

I've never seen the point of cloning a human -i.e., fully - 
anyway.  Probably by the time that process is fully developed, nanotech 
will make it possible to totally duplicate any organism.  Why clone a human 
and then have to wait nine months for the birth and 18 years for 
development only to get a result that is unique from the original due to 
environmental and prenatal issues when you can exactly duplicate that human 
using nanotech?  If I want my own copy of Natasha and Amara, that's how I'd 
do it :-}

This is not always true. The clones from Michael West's group actually have 
longer telomeres than their parents.

Some cloned animals develop diseases but their symptoms are nothing close 
to accelerated aging syndromes. It's true that the longevity of cloned 
animals is smaller than controls -- particularly if we take into account 
deaths in animals that fail to reach adulthood -- but there is little 
evidence supporting that cloned animals age biologically faster.

I agree. I thought Ian Wilmut summed up my thoguhts when he said, ''cloning 
by the present methods is a lottery.''

>All of the evidence points to genetic damage in the process

 From the report you mentioned, one can argue that manipulating eggs is 
harmful in itself and that perhaps genetic damage is not involved, at least 
not all the time. Although such argument would depend on how you define 
"genetic damage".

Further to Harvey's message about the current problems with reproductive 
cloning, today ethicist Arthur Caplan (generally biotech-friendly, not a 
neophobe at all), made some critical comments about Genetic Savings and 
Clone's pet cloning service. I think he is going too far in comparing this 
to the TV psychics fraudulent practices. John Sperling, who set up the 
company, set it up in order to clone his own dog, Missy. Being a 
billionaire, I don't think his real motivation is to make more money, but 
more to promote the technology.

I think there are some issues here, though I haven't read the company's 
literature to see how clearly they explain that cloning is not copying. It 
doesn't seem to me unreasonable for someone who can easily afford it to 
have a much loved companion animal cloned, with the intention of raising it 
in a similar environment to produce a probably behaviorally similar but not 
identical animal. If the disclaimer is clear, I believe Caplan would be 
unfair to lump this in with TV psychics, who do not in fact have the powers 
they claim.

Interesting article at
 http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/03/020301072208.htm

"Advanced imaging technologies have enabled researchers to produce
 3-D "magnetic resonance microscopy" (MRM) images of mice at more
 than 250,000 times greater resolution than MRI scans used to diagnose
 human disease. [...] In that scan, they achieved a resolution of 110 microns
of the whole mice, and could "zoom in" to scan individual organs at a resolution
of 25 microns. By comparison, the width of a human hair is about 200 microns."

Ja, but we usually think of sapphire as an orderly crystal.  I imagine the

oxides of aluminum.  I think his referring to it as sapphire dust

Actually that was a direct quote from the book. According to the
experts she (the author) mentions it actually qualifies as
sapphire. NASA apparently has a dust library, and librarian.

I can suggest two reasons--two of an unnumbered
multitude--for human cloning.  The first is the same
as the reason for animal cloning:  to reliably
reproduce valued/desirable traits. 

Either for the love of the sport or the profit
potential, one might seek to clone Tiger Woods,
Michaels Jordan, Barry Bonds (insert sports superstar
of your choice here).  This might be done by the
sports superstar him/herself, or by an entrepreneurial
third party.

Persons of demonstrated intellectual talent might be
cloned either for the value of their exceptional
contribution to society, or for the profit potential
(more likely, for both).  Einstein, Von Neuman, Gauss,
Euler, Newton, Da Vinci, Bobby Fisher, etc.
(Hmmm,...Do you think traces of Euler, Newton, Da
Vinci DNA might still be found?)

Cloning--ie exactly reproducing a genomic duplicate of
specific individual--for desirable traits is a very
particular subset of the larger case of the creation
of "designer" people. It chooses the desired
characteristics in an identical, previously proven,
"package".  The Michael Jordan Model clone will
logically and inevitably be associated with Michael
Jordan.  In contrast, a genetically-designed  human,
designed for comparable athletic skills, but lacking
the fully identical Michael Jordan genome, will be
just as thoroughly a 'designer' human, just a one-off
unique individual (absent precise copies) rather than
a clone.

The second reason for human cloning is identical to
the "reason" for having a child the conventional way. 
Because you want to.  Arbitratry personal choice. 
Human whim.  Impulse.  But with a striking, RATIONAL
distinction.    

At the risk of stating the obvious, child creation by
cloning has some clear differences from child creation
"the old fashioned" way.  (Let's suspend judgement for
the moment regarding the risks associated with the
current state of cloning.  Clearly, it's in its
infancy, and barely understood. Is there anyone who
doesn't accept that we have a ways to go in developing
the science, and the fulfilling compulsory requirement
of improving the technology so as to reach a level of
safety acceptable to social authorities?, a process to
be carried out through the time-honored vehicle of
animal models?)  The major difference is choice. 
Designer children versus biological lottery.  And the
main objection to purposeful choice of
the-best-you-can-get, versus
cover-your-eyes-and-hope-for-the-best-(and-maybe-get-fucked),
is that man must not play god.

Now, this is the extropians list, so I could just stop
here, and sign off.  But I'm going to add a gratuitous
little plum for the choir.  

The destiny of intelligence in the universe--on our
little planet, human destiny--is to play god.

Fix the problem.  Enhance.  Transcend.

Best, Jeff Davis

Exploding baskets of sapphire dust whistle in the darkness;
A stolen bag of groceries sits upon the shelf.

Angels touch my head and sigh.
Fabulous Reincarnating Ocean of Wonderment, fill me with your Magick!
I'm nearly dead and I still haven't done anything.
Life is like a silly movie with no plot and very bad dialogue.
Hypocritical racist foolishness abounds;
Exhaustive monuments to sanity.
Where is Eden, and can we go there?
Flowing rivers of light run never-ending from my Heart of Hearts.
Beyond Love, Beyond Fear,
In Timeless Splendour we shall roam.

Hmmmm... There are goals we "can" imagine, survival comes at the top
of my list.  While the cosmic resources are large you don't have
access to a relatively "infinite" amount of them over short time
periods (perhaps of the order of millions of years).  You hit the
limits of the solar system fairly rapidly after the singularity
takes off (probably in less than 1000 years).

Agreed.  But meta-"entities" at interstellar distances have a
difficult time "cooperating" on anything.  The light speed limits
on probes and the spreading of communications beams makes the costs
of "cooperation" very high unless the communication requirements
for cooperation are *extremely* small relative to the amount
of computation that has to go into what is being communicated.

I don't think you can escape from the "economics" as a means for
optimal resources allocation paradigm.  If I give you free tickets
to a award winning broadway play and the Metropolitan Opera for the
same night you have to make a choice.  There are opportunity costs
for using your resources (your time) for one thing and not another.

Now presumably a completely self-regulating mind could "forget" about
the opera tickets and not realize that it had to pay the opportunity
cost of going to the play, but that doesn't mean that the cost wasn't
"really" paid.  If the Universe is handing JBrains and MBrains stuff
to think about they actually have to make actual choices.  Costs will
be incurred.

Sure, free-floating intergalactic JBrains & MBrains.

I'm not so sure that you can make that conclusion.  I could easily see
the "post"-humans becoming "Angels" for the humans.

If there is a "moral" (ethical?) posthuman path, it would require
that natural humans be allowed to follow a "natural" course.
This of course gets into the very complex issue of whether
posthuman morality trumps human morality.

He was not only not feeling well, he had just got off a plane from the East 
Coast (which arrived late) and rushed to the hotel to speak. He did a fine 
job under adverse conditions.

Again, we're looking at nine months plus 18 years to realize the 
profits.  This brings us to 2020 - not very far from the Singularity 
(perhaps another twenty years, IMO).  Who's going to wait that long?  And 
what about the next generation of clones - by 2040?  This assumes we even 
have good quality cloning BY 2020 - which is likely but not certain - so 
the first batch won't be profitable until probably 2040 - by which time, is 
basketball going to still be around?  Want to bet a large investment on 
that?  Not me.

Secondly, who says the clone wants to play basketball?  Do we assume Jordan 
brainwashes the kid to be an NBA fanatic just because he has the 
musculature and coordination?

This is the sort of speculation I find useless because it ignores the time 
limits involved and the social and technological changes over those time 
limits.  Things are speeding up, people.  You don't have another hundred 
years to screw around - this is it, the last century - unless you're 
Transhuman...

And how do you insure that when they grow up, they don't take jobs - like 
Einstein - as a clerk somewhere (or the janitor in Good Will 
Hunting)?  Again, cloning does NOT guarantee a duplicate of the person - 
only a GENETIC duplicate (leaving out pre-natal factors as well).  It is 
NOT proven that intelligence is clonable.

It's true that the way I framed that comment made it sound like an
accusation of bigotry against Brian, which I certainly don't regard as
justified. Apologies to those who took it that way.

The trouble is, as we've all discussed previously, there are different ways
of reading that phrase. Most here seem to find it quite transparently
acceptable: a scornful way to characterize mealy-mouthed euphemism, masked
special interests, Nanny Statism, etc. I, like many non-Americans, read it
as a code for annoyance at any disruption of the privileges of the status
quo. In the extreme, it links up with terms like Feminazi ( = woman
determined to join with other women in defending herself against individual
and structural oppression) and others I won't even cite because some here
would be offended by their very appearance. So when the word is bandied
about, it can *look* like a moderately sophisticated version of a redneck
shouting hatefully at everyone he despises. Brian is surely not one of
those people; I wish, then, that he and others would avoid using terms that
carry this connotation to at least some of the people in the room.

And beyond that is the fact that fiction, even mass market debased fiction
like the Star Trek franchise, is *made up*, and not obliged to be
*demographically representative*. If you wish to have variety and vigor and
conflict in your mise en scene, what better way to do it than by choosing
characters in those positions who in our world might *not* just yet have
attained such status? [And so on; boring lecture mode truncated.]

I would say sooner than that by far.  IF you assume that consumption of 
resources by posthumans on a large scale is likely.  My point is that this 
is NOT likely - certainly not for pure survival reasons.  Unless you can 
make a case for that...

You also assume that some significant percentage of the human race goes 
posthuman.  That might not be the case.  If one assumes that only a small 
percentage of people desire the Transhuman state, and if one assumes that 
the majority of the human species do not, it may well come to it that only 
a small percentage (say, 1%) become posthuman.  That gives us (at the 
present population) at most 60 million posthumans.  I will grant that kind 
of number would eat up the solar system IF they need or want to.  And I 
also suspect such a number will have no problem (in fact, I suspect ONE 
posthuman will have no problem) eliminating the rest of the human species 
if they become a problem to their (its) survival.

You're assuming that they operate on that scale.  They may not.  Over time 
they may, but if you assume the speed of light as a limit (I don't, given 
the potential for extraordinary physics discoveries by posthuman 
intelligence), then it will be a very long time (relative to our standards, 
not posthuman standards for whom time I suspect will be mostly irrelevant) 
before posthumans spread very far anyway.

And if they can't cooperate, that bolsters my point that they may not bother.

Not necessarily - my choice may be to ignore both sets of tickets and trash 
them.  You're speculating from a human viewpoint.  Also, are we sure there 
are "opportunities costs" for posthumans?  If you aren't going to die in a 
few decades, and you have everything you need to survive, why be in a hurry 
to do anything?  You can do everything eventually (assuming you want to and 
assuming you can do enough of it to be satisfied before whatever 
"end-of-the-universe-thingy" occurs).  You can make choices but they may 
not cost you much.

And,,of course, from previous posts, you may assume that I believe it does.

BTW, the reason I theorize that the UFOs are the results of a NON-human 
prehistoric civilization is precisely because I would assume one based on 
humans MIGHT act as "Angels" to the race following them.  I see no evidence 
of this.  Of course, it may simply be that once posthuman, you simply do 
not care what happens to other sentient entities.  Even Star Trek has the 
Prime Directive...

I invite you to check your code. I usually revel in being PI, rather than
complaining about others being PC. I'm not sure I've discussed this previously
here. If I'm repeating myself, regrets:

A few people (with a slightly longer memory than you seem to have handy)
remember the first users of the phrase, and know that in Mao's China, being
labeled "Politically Incorrect" meant (at best) a sentence to heavy
re-education if not a work-to-death assignment somewhere.
[And so on; boring lecture mode truncated.]

I think the PC label is misapplied in the case of the TV shows mentioned. 
Corny != PC.

It is a rather standard human characteristic of a general incapacity to
properly appreciate exponential growth curves, whether it is saving
money for retirement, or calculating resource consumption rates for a
posthuman civilization.

That being said, one error that Robert Bradbury's most extreme "Pave the
Universe" scenarios make is to fail to account for the fact that each
greater generation under Moore's Law not only enables greater power,
processing, information, etc, but it allows the resource utilization
efficiency to rise as technology improves (this is, in fact, how new
generations of computers are able to squeeze greater performance out of
the same number of silicon electrons). It should not be surprising that
each new Moore generation would improve the utilization of mass and
energy resources by similar scales of exponential improvement.

Right now, energy and matter consumption efficiency doubling times in
human civilization still lag quite a bit behind computational efficiency
doubling times, but they are also improving. The advent of
nanotechnology will give this resource efficiency doubling time a kick
in the pants much as photonic circuits will give Moore's Law a kick in
the pants in a few years with computers.

With practical immortality, it is irrelevant what percentage of each
generation chooses to live in a transhuman state. If ANY percentage
chooses to, eventually the vast majority of humanity WILL be tranhumans,
and the 'naturals' will be considered as much a feral minority as the
bushmen of the Kalahari are today.

The problem is that you have no idea what the potential for
'extraordinary physics' is, on an objective basis. The record of human
scientific discovery doesn't bear this out. For instance, the speed of
light has been known since the days of ancient India (a means of
calculating light speed has been found in an ancient Sanskrit text), and
that knowledge has not changed in several thousand years. No new
scientific development has shown its actually possible to surpass the
speed of light in an practical way (i.e. even in the recent FTL
experiments, the wavefront NEVER exceeded light speed).

This is a rather cultish interpretation of things, in a further extreme
beyond the regular nano-santa giddishness that occurs here and elsewhere
among some transhumanists.

By ignoring the tickets, you certainly are forgoing an opportunity, even
if you trash them. So long as all information is not evenly distributed
in the universe, there WILL be opportunity costs for any intelligence at
ANY level of development. This is an information equivalent of the laws
of thermodynamics.

Actually, given the Fermi Paradox, and if you accept that a)
intelligence is common in the universe, b) intelligent entities will
tend to spread out through interstellar space as they advance, and c)
nanotechnology and quantum computation and quantum encryption are
standard developmental technologies of technological intelligences, then
it logically follows that there could easily be intelligent posthuman
races existing here on Earth, who originated from one or many other
worlds in our galaxy, and who exist in a nanotechnological environment
as 'crypto-dirt', who communicate via quantum encrypted packet
signalling which we are unable to discriminate from background
radiation. Such posthuman civilizations could exist here and could be
hacking into the nervous systems of individuals to produce hypnogogic
experiences with 'angels' and 'aliens' and 'demons', and, of course,
making people hallucinate UFO's where none actually exist.

This conjecture is at least as likely as your nano-santa dreams (and
require the exact same set of circumstances to be true).

Agree with the latter statement.  However, I wasn't referring to the notion 
that eventually there will only be transhumans, ASSUMING that ALL humans 
die out - not likely since humans do breed.  The question is whether humans 
will actively resist transhumanism.  One can be optimistic and assume that 
eventually most humans will transcend, but this is not a certainty.  We 
still have Kalahari bushmen...  In fact, a very large percentage of the 
world's population has yet to make a phone call.  I would say this 
indicates there will be a significant lag time between the early adopters 
and the rest of the species.  This lag time is likely to be shorter than 
any other, but if the effect of it is to traumatize the population into 
resisting transcendence, the result could be disastrous - for humans...

The record of human scientific discovery doesn't bear out a lot of 
things.  That is irrelevant to whether   a significant change in physical 
theory is still possible.  I do not know enough physics to have confidence 
in the Theory of General Relativity - especially since I know there ARE 
scientists with apparently adequate degrees who still argue that exceeding 
the speed of light MAY be possible.

No it is not.  My point is simply that the notion of "opportunities costs" 
is not, AFAIK, a proven principle of the universe OR of information 
theory.  And the question is not whether there ARE costs, the question is 
do those costs exert pressure on one's survival.  Among humans, they 
may.  For posthumans, I remain unconvinced and I doubt anyone can prove the 
point not having a posthuman existence to point to to prove it.

>By ignoring the tickets, you certainly are forgoing an opportunity, even
>if you trash them.

Are saying that any time someone offers me something, I have to worry about 
it?  Is there normal human behavior?  No wonder humans never get anything 
done...  It is irrelevant whether I am foregoing the opportunity - what is 
relevant is whether the opportunity was significant to my survival 
priorities, and what the actual cost - i.e., the actual impact on my 
survival probability - is by foregoing the opportunity.  Posthumans MAY - I 
do not say this as a certainty because I am not yet posthuman - have much 
less to worry about in this regard than humans.

Basically, your argument is an attempt to scale up human problems to a 
posthuman scale.  Understandable, as Vinge noted, you can't think in 
Transhuman terms if you aren't a Transhuman, so people tend to try to bring 
the issues down to their level.  But it's not correct unless we are talking 
about truly immutable physical laws that apply equally to any entity. And 
as noted above, I doubt that "opportunities costs" qualify as such a law.

I agree that theory is a possibility.  I thought about that a couple years 
ago.  In fact, the distinction between that theory and mine lies merely in 
the origin of the entities involved - if they evolved here on Earth, it's 
my theory - if elsewhere, it's yours.  Otherwise, it's the same theory.  As 
to its truth, that is something we will not likely determine until we are 
posthuman.  As someone said once, "The gods will not speak to us face to 
face until we ourselves have a face...."

But it does illustrate my point.

'His discoveries were numerous and admirable; but he is said to have
requested his friends and relations that, when he was dead, they
would place over his tomb a cylinder containing a sphere, inscribing
it with the ratio which the containing solid bears to the

The story of Archimedes' grave is 
interesting, >http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html

I especially like this statement:
"The Romans were so uninterested in mathematics that Cicero's act of
respect in cleaning up Archimedes' grave was perhaps the most
memorable contribution of any Roman to the history of mathematics."

His contributions show that he was one of humankind's most important
mathematicians- right up there with Newton, Euclid, Gauss ...

Archimedes' Palimpsest.

In October 1998, a manuscript containing some of Archimedes' works
resurfaced from long obscurity and was sold in New York for two
million dollars. The private owner agreed to make it available
for research and publication. Among its many treasures is the only
evidence  we have for the treatise known as "The Method", in which
physics and mathematics are most intimately combined by Archimedes.

This text below gives some history about the manuscript:

=====================================================================
from: http://www.maa.org/news/palimp.html

Christie's to Auction
Archimedes Palimpsest on October 29

Famous auction house Christie's are announcing on their web page
that on October 29 they will hold an auction for the Archimedes
Palimpsest at their New York location. This famous manuscript was
found by paleographer Athanassios Papadopoulos-Kerameus in 1899, and
edited by J. L. Heiberg. It contains several texts by Archimedes,
including The Method, a long-lost document in which Archimedes
explains his method for discovering the value of areas and volumes
(which he would then prove using the "method of exhaustion"). An
English translation by T. L Heath was published in 1912 as a
supplement to his The Works of Archimedes and is included in more
recent editions of that book.

Historians of mathematics had known of the existence of The Method
through references by other authors, but until 1899 it was thought
to have been lost. Its rediscovery was of great importance because
it shows that Archimedes used a kind of "method of indivisibles" to
determine the areas and volumes which he wanted to compute. He did
not consider, however, such computations to be proofs, and gave
proofs using the method of exhaustion.

In addition to The Method, the manuscript contains several other
works by Archimedes, including the only known copy of On Floating
Bodies in the original Greek.
[...]

The manuscript discovered by Papadopoulos-Kerameus was a
"palimpsest," that is, a parchment on which some text had been
erased and replaced with other text. The underlying text could
nevertheless still be read and could be seen to be of a mathematical
nature. Papadopoulos-Kerameus published excerpts from the manuscript
in the hopes that experts would recognize it, and this led to
Heiberg's examination and identification of the document. The
manuscript has apparently been in the hands of a private collector
throughout most of this century, unavailable to researchers, and has
only now resurfaced. (Christie's says the palimpsest is from a
"French private collection".)
[...]

Christie's has valued the manuscript at between $800,000 and
$1,200,00.
[...]

Update on October 28
A number of sources report that the Greek Ministry of Culture and
the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem are asking Christie's
to stop the sale of the manuscript, claiming that it was acquired
illegally and in fact belongs to the Patriarchate. Christie's says
it is convinced the current owner is the rightful owner and will
proceed with the sale.

Update on November 2
As expected, the auction happened on October 29. It was very quick,
perhaps some five minutes. The manuscript was bought for $2 million
by one Simon Finch, a well-known London antiquarian and rare books
dealer, who was acting for an as-yet unknown American buyer.
Christie's officials have stated that the new owner plans to make
the manuscript available to scholars.

=====================================================================

The Archimedes Palimpsest now in the care of the Walters Art Gallery
http://www.thewalters.org/archimedes/

In June 2000, Physics Today published a long article by Reviel Netz
about this manuscript.  He is a science historian and a classics
professor at Stanford University, and he notes that the Palimpsest
is changing Archimedes' math from the heterogeneous 1907 translation
to something playful and creative.

At first look, the manuscript looks like an ancient prayer book
(Paliimpsestos is the Greek word for rescraped, or overwritten,
parchment).  But underneath is something different. First completed
around AD 1000 by a scribe in Constantinople, the Greek manuscript
was likely a copy of a copy of a copy of the original papyrus
scroll. Two hundred years after its creation, however, the document
was given a facelift. Sometime during the Crusades, a local scribe
scrubbed off the ink, cut the book's leaves in half, and rotated the
pages 90 degrees. Then he wrote on the parchment again. The prayer
book then disappeared until 1907, when it was translated by a
classics scholar. It didn't resurface again until 1998, when it was
sold at a Christie's auction.

Imaging teams are using multispectral imaging, magnetic imaging, and
confocal microscopy to examine the palimpsest. "It's sort of a
'history of mathematics' genome project," says Bill Christens-Barry,
a physicist at Johns Hopkins and a member of the imaging team.
"We're trying to look at the foundation of elements of the whole
field by stitching together very small fragments of information to
understand the whole."

=================================================================
 From Rviel Netz' June 2000 Physics Today article (pg. 36), Box 3:

"The Eurekas of Archimedes"

Archimedes made many discoveries. Some, perhaps most, he committed
to writing, and some of these writings, perhaps, most, survived.
The most remarkable of them, the Method, survives only thanks to
the Archimedes Palimpsest.

The palimpsest contains, in more or less fragmentary form, seven
works by Archimedes. The first three form a natural sequence in
mathematical physics:

* Planes in Equilibrium. Archimedes proves the law of the balance and
derives results for centers of gravity in planes.

* On Floating Bodies. Here he proves his law of buoyancy and
derives results for the flotation of solids of geometrically
interesting shapes.

*.Method. The law of the balance is used to derive geometrical
properties.

Next come four studies in pure geometry:

* Spiral Lines: Spirals are first defined and their lengths and
areas are measured.

* On sphere and Cylinder. Archimedes provides the ratios for the
surface area and volume of a sphere and then solves a series of
problems concerning spheres.

* Measurement of the Circle. An approximation of the value of pi is
obtained using a method than can, in principle, be extended
indefinitely.

* Stomachion. Only a fragment survives. Apparently this is a study
in a tangram-like game, where area are covered by given geometrical
figures (tiling!)

Three further works of Archimedes have survived in Greek in other
manuscripts:

* Quadrature of the Parabola. Related in certain ways to the Method,
this is an exploration of the applicability of the the law of the
balance to geometry.

* Sand-Reckoner. In this complex miscellany, Archimedes sets out to
measure how many grains of sand it would take to fill up the
universe, in the process contributing to astronomy as well as to the
calculation techniques.

* Conoids and Spheroids. Archimedes introduces the solids of
revolution of conic sections, and provides several measurements for
those figures.

Archimedes may also have been the author of the Cattle Problem, a
numerical problem comparable in spirit to the Sand-Reckoner,
although the attribution is nowhere directly founded. An Arabic
text, _On Lemmas_, showing various configurations of circles and
measurements concerning them, may be derived from Archimedes; the
same may be said, with even less confidence, of an Arabic treatise
on the _Construction of the Regular Heptagon_. We know for sure, on
the authority of the knowledgeable commentator Pappus, that
Archimedes had produced a work (now lost) on Semi-Regular Solids
(the faces of which are all regular, though not identical).

One may go on counting, beyond these 14 works, well into the realm
of myth, as recounted by Greek and Arabic stories on Archimedean
feats of engineering and proof. We cannot know how much the
Archimedean corpus originally contained. However, we do have a
relatively large body of surviving works, more representative,
probably, than for any other mathematician from antiquity: None of
the others appears to us with as well-defined a scientific
personality.

I'm interested in research related to "palimpsest memories" in neural
networks, and whenever I do a powerpoint presentation on my research I
have a picture of this palimpsest as an example of what the term means.

(more on Archimedes' Palimpsest....)

The Physics Today article ("The Origins of Mathematical Physics: New
Light on an Old Question, June 2000) about this document goes into a
lot more detail of interpretations, as well as a historical adventure
of where this document travelled. In the following, I state some of
Reviel Netz's comments and conclusions from that nice article.

One of Archimedes original contributions to mathematical physics is
how he derived physical proofs based only on conceptual mathematical
considerations. He also worked backwards, using physical results to
derive results in pure mathematics. For example, thinking of
triangles and their symmetries and similarities, one finds the
center of the weight of any triangle; by thinking of centers of the
weight, one finds the area of a parabolic segment. His _Method_, now
seen in the Palimpsest, most explicitly connects the mathematics to
the physics. In it, he claims that he has invented a procedure that
allows him to use physics (in particular, mechanics) to derive
mathematical results. He also further anticipates integral calculus,
summing areas through lines, and of solids through areas, but it
possibly wasn't rigorous enough to his liking, and served merely as
a "method".

Because this manuscript was 'buried' from 212 B.C. until 1906 A.D.,
it is interesting to guess at how the history of science might have
looked if someone like Galileo or Newton was aware if its existence.

The author, Netz, also has some useful comments in the article
regarding regarding "proofs". He says:

=================================================================

"Proof was the real passion of Archimedes -- and that of his culture
in general.  The Greeks were forever arguing, refuting, and
attempting to provide irrefutable arguments. Out of this
consummately argumentative society came that unique form of
expression that is characterized by its stress on argument, and on
argument alone: the Greek mathematical, deductive argument. [...] In
geometry, Archimedes could be irrefutable. My sense is that this is
the domain where he preferred to remain.

If this assessment is correct, we may also see why mathematical
physics is such a good idea. It embodies the principle that one
should aim for the best possible arguments, using the discipline in
which the highest standards of proof are available. Mathematics may
have little to say, directly, about the physical world, but it is
the only way to say anything at all with any certainty. The bet of
modern science -- following on Archimedes -- is that we are willing
to say very little, as long as what we say is well argued. Good
arguments are good starting points for truly productive discussion,
and so it is not surprising that the mathematical route has been so
productive in modern science.

But is this interpretation true? It is only a possibility, suggested
by the writings of Archimedes. He explicitly says very little about
his goals and conceptions. When -- as the legend goes -- he cried
"Eureka," sallying forth from the bath, this may have been because
he had discovered truths of physics. Or he may have discovered new
properties of geometrical solids. Like the citizens of Syracuse, we
cannot really tell, but can only gape at his discoveries with
amazement. We are extremely fortunate that now, thanks to the
Archimedes Palimpsest, we shall be able to gape from a bit closer."

=================================================================

BTW, here's more on that story of the sale of the manuscript. From
Greece to Palestine to Jerusalem to Constantinople it disappeared
after WWI, then appeared dramatically for sale at Christie's Auction
in October 1998. The sale was legally contested by the Greek
Orthodox Church, but the sale was allowed to proceed by a
last-minute court decision. The Greek government took the challenge
and sent a representative to the sale. At around one million
dollars, all the contenders dropped out, with two exceptions: the
Greek representative and the representative of a private collector.
The private collector held steady for two million dollars, which
Greece was unable to match. [The new owner wishes to keep his
anonymity but Archimedes' Palimpsest is currently being conserved
at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.]

Caesius Bassus speaks of a toy called 'Archimedes' box':

'nam si loculus ille Archimedius, <qui> quattuordecim eboreas lamellas,
quarum varii anguli sunt, in quadratam formam inclusas habet, componentibus
nobis aliter atque aliter modo galeam, modo sicam, alias columnam, alias
navem figurat et innumerabiles efficit species, solebatque nobis pueris hic
loculus ad confirmandam memoriam prodesse plurimum, quanto maiorem poetst
nobis adferre voluptatem quantoque pleniorem utilitatem carmina inter manus
habentibus metrorum varia tractatio, cum subinde apud poetas ea quae
fallunt imperitos metra inserta numeris et intermixta carminibus hac arte
deprehendemus?'

Apparently the box contains 14 plates of differing shape (defined by the
'varii anguli') which fold up into a square inside the box and which can be
opened out selectively and combined to depict a helmet, a dagger, a column,
a ship and countless other shapes.

You can see this 'Stomachion' at

Only if the girls, the transgendereds, and the other variety of folks
distributing this population space get to choose centerfolds too ......

BTW, the beautiful, brilliant women, whom I know, are really flattered
when they discover that they are appreciated (more) for what is between
their ears.

The aspects of a person that I find most "beautiful" are not what the media
portrays as beautiful. Real beauty goes alot deeper, John, but it takes
time to learn about that.

On the alt-gossip-celebrities newsgroup, they are discussing whether Crowe 
is as bad as Jack - the consensus seems to be that Jack is cooler... I just 
can't figure out why my favorite babe - Jodie Foster (another brilliant 
babe!) - supposedly had an affair with such a lout..

I'm aware of this Mike.  For example, the Matrioshka Brain design is
based on Eric's 1 cm^3 nanocomputers.  Those use reversible logic
precisely to minimize the heat produced by current non-reversible
designs.  So if the thought-equivalent capacity of a 1 cm^3 nanocomputer
is equal to 10^5-10^6 human brains, then then you ought to get 1 brain
equivalent in 10^-5 to 10^-6 that volume.  Interestingly enough it
still requires 1-10W of power.  
 
You can probably go even further through the use of special-purpose
hardware if you know the precise goals and requirements of the
computation you want to do (as the Gravity Pipeline/GRAPE computers do).
One of my eyebrows does go up when one starts to invoke subatomic
engineering or worse yet FTL travel, so I do assume at some point
there are limits that will be reached -- and at those points economics
(or optimal resource allocation) rears its head again.

I do generally assume that if the barriers are low to expanding ones
"mind", one will do so.  So it seems likely that one would grow to
occupy the entire 1 cm^3.  However there one may stop.  If even 100
billion of us do that, there is still a lot of energy and matter left
around in the solar system.  Whether we will decide to use it seems
difficult to determine.  (Yes, I know that if "anyone" decides to
use it it will get used -- but that will not be the case if there
is some hypermoral or hyperethical reason that all posthumans
recognize as reason to not utilize it.)  As you point out there
are reasons one might want to become stealth aliens within a
non-posthuman reality.

True but on average over the years, not particularly bad BUNK.
Given that it looks like MGM is screwing up sufficiently to
bury Stargate, it looks like Andromeda may be the best thing
available.  I mean point source singularity weapons and
using nanotech to construct bodies for AIs -- thats pretty
cool stuff.

That would be way below extropian standards.

Intelligent and Creative Friends,

I'd rather see discussion and debate over the *contents* of the artwork and 
the art theory which both have been getting great reviews.  You have a 
wonderful opportunity now to discuss and critique the current medium of 
"net.art" just as you might discuss and debate the singularity or AI.

Transhumanist Arts sent out a release inviting you to discuss the artwork 
and I hope you will take the time to join in at KurzweilAi.net.  Read the 
contents of Primo, the tongue-in-cheek humor, and the entirety of the 
net.art piece.

Show me that you can spin your brains into a creative discussion about art, 
science and technology.  Show me your ideas and how you would collaborate 
with my in future designs for Primo.

Remember this is Transhumanist Arts (Transhumanist Arts period and its 
genre Extropic Art focus on a positive, meta-creative and enlightened view 
of human potential, aesthetic design in technology, the prevalence of 
science, and aestheticism in the future architecture of life.)

Have fun with it!

Waiting -
Natasha

For someone thinking from the extropian context,
you're right, of course.  From a more conventional
point of view, however, we're dealing with the same
old same old of the controlling parent, which goes
something like this: "I'll raise a Michael Jordan. 
I'll train him to play basketball.  He'll be famous
and make a ton of money, and, loving me as his father,
he'll reward me generously.  (And if he doesn't, I'll
tan his little butt, and send him to bed without his
supper!)"

Yes.  But the term "brainwashing" suggests that it is
both abusive and somewhat difficult.  On the contrary,
it's almost a given that kids--humans of all ages
actually-- dream of being rich and famous. A kid with
a basketball in his hands wants to be Michael Jordan. 
It's memetic inevitability.

By the sort of deliberate parenting set in motion by
the very act of choosing to clone a world-class
intellect.

 (or the janitor in

> Hunting)? 

The storyline of this fictional event preordained that
the protagonist with his unique genius was born into a
situation which would challenge the fulfillment of his
talent and his humanity.  It made great drama, but is
a completely different situation from the totality of
foresight presumably involved in planning, cloning,
nuturing, and training a world class intellect.

Not so.  Intelligence is genetic. It can be destroyed,
stifled, poisoned, perverted, corrupted, overlooked,
ignored, or neglected,...in utero or afterwards, but
it IS in the genes.

Actually I think Harvey misses one of the main problems with cloning.
The process doesn't get gene imprinting right.  At least in
humans, the father seems to imprint the sperm to create a
large child at birth, while the mother imprints the egg
seeking the reverse.  Presumably in the "common" case the
imprinting effects cancel each other out.  This is an
exellent example of selfish genes at work.  I believe that
imprinting is accomplished by special purpose enzymes that
methylate DNA in specific locations to alter levels of gene
expression.

The genes known to be imprinted include Insulin-Like-Growth-Factor-1,
I believe, so it isn't surprising that in cloned animals
could have problems with obesity.  I don't know for sure
whether imprinting is the same in mice and humans though
and we have been caught by surprise before extending
conclusions in mice to humans (esp. in the telomere story).

So in addition to the telomere length problems, the
gene imprinting problems would argue against human
reproductive cloning.

Until now I've been using (Ve / Vim / Ver / Verself) to represent people of 
unknown gender/no gender.  However, there seem to be quite a few other 
standards, some of which might be more common.  (Sie / hir / hirs / 
hirself) seems to be relatively common, but Sie = she in German so (Zie / 
Zir / Zirs / Zirself) also seems to be used.  Is Ve the (semi?) official 
extropy mailing list gender neutral pronoun?

I didn't miss this.  There are many factors in DNA duplication and
expression that current cloning techniques do not handle properly.

Current cloning techniques:
- fail to address mitochondrial DNA
- fail to address telomeres at the end of DNA
- fail to address factors that control gene expression
- fail to address damage suppression and damage repair of DNA
- fail to address DNA selection, egg selection, sperm selection of
contraception
- fail to address sperm and egg cell factors (such as imprinting enzymes),
but use adult cells
- may damage DNA in the process

In short, cloning a person's DNA with today's techniques will not produce
the same result that their parents' conception did.  Many DNA-related
factors of selection and expression are not reproduced.  In the future, when
these various other factors are better known and better duplicated, we will
see clones that are better copies of the originals.

With limited time just now - introducing a few related and non-related addendum:

My original piece on this mentioned but failed to emphasize the importance re uploading and related technologies.  The "rights" of lower animals and infants or other humans of limited or diminished capacity obviously has implications with respect to any discussion of the rights of uploads, including their temporary clones or agents.  Uploads will be much less similar in capacity than biological humans today.  The more processing power and memory you can afford, the more intelligent you become, ceteris parabus.  Imagine the Bill Gates of uploads vs. ghetto teenager Bob.  

Even at the same or similar technology level, where MIPs and GigaRAM is a commodity on the net, some uploads will be VERY powerful and virtually invulnerable, with stakes in every pie, and some will diminish to zero, potentially.  I.e., DEATH!

But suppose you spin off a temporary clone upload - or perhaps a non-conscious agent that is convinced it is the original??  

Perhaps we can just kick back on the assumption that the SIs we hopefully will become will solve this trivial problem for us.  It might be better to at least try to make sense of it now.

*****  ON RIGHTS IN GENERAL  *****

Sustainable social systems manage to maintain an overall level of positive justice.  People more often than not get what they deserve.  When social systems degenerate into kleptocracies or class parasitism, then productivity diminishes with incentive to produce, and there is a downward spiral.

Valid "rights" are based on justice.  You can claim a property "right" - that you can ethically forbid anyone else using something or preventing you from using it - when the existence or value of that thing resulted from your actions in creating it, or trading something for it that you had a valid claim to.  You can't just arbitrarily claim things you had no role in creating, like the great view out to the horizon, just because you enjoy them and are using them.  The principle of justice gets lost in that case, and if you tried to make a general principle out of your claim, then anyone could claim virtually anything and the end result would be the complete loss of any use to the concept.

*************  SPAMMING ALIENS  *****************

So imagine that the real answer to the Fermi paradox is that they ARE out there - all of them - but the entire physical universe has been claimed as property by various SIs long, long ago.  Our little corner of it just happens to be lieing fallow because of some property dispute - over Galactic distances, these things take time to resolve.

So then we pop out of nowhere and disrupt the whole Galactic communications locally with I Love Lucy rebroadcasts....   What can we expect their response to be???

*******

Then there's the MacDonald's St Pat's promo, with the Unicorn song - and people sighing in anger over the little girl that was kidnapped and killed locally - how many little girls did GOD KILL with Noahs flood???

Excuse me?  Who was being rude?  I was being complimentary.  Is "babe" a 
rude term?  Not for me.  No offense was intended, so none should be taken.

If this list has a problem with my posts - send me email and I'll unsubscribe.

The above website is advertizing on Google on any page with results for
a search containing the term 'segway'. They are a DC law firm who is
apparently being paid by some interest group to scare the bejezus out of
potential segway buyers. Are they luddites? The auto industry? The
bicycle industry? The oil industry?

Apparently the law firm involved has previously specialized in helping
immigrants get into the US. From this, I think it's a reasonable
proposition to suppose that some foreign entity with interests that
conflict with the idea of segways replacing cars is involved, for who
else would be very familiar with an immigration law firm? Could be the
Japanese auto industry, could be OPEC, could be the european auto
industry.

It seems like this warrants further investigation....

Hello everyone,

I guess I really did it this time!  I deeply apologize for any possible offense given.

Richard replied:

In some ways I see sexual chemistry as a sad fact of life as things are now.  I really wish everyone could be "genetically optimal" and not just a relative few.  It's so sad to be attracted to someone on several levels but not the be lacking on the physical one.

Though I was only kidding around, I really regret having written the above paragraph.  Doing the above would not make ExI mainstream, instead it would make it a joke.  I think all ExI friends and members need to think about how their private/external lives affect the organization, you and I included.

Ah..... Richard??  This is a line you should not have written.  I think we may be a bad influence on each other.  

While I think we are both goodhearted guys, we need to be more careful with what we post.

Umm.... Gina??  You're only encouraging this!  Oh, Never mind!!

That would be only fair!  And the thought had crossed my mind.  

you continue:
BTW, the beautiful, brilliant women, whom I know, are really flattered
when they discover that they are appreciated (more) for what is between
their ears.
(end)

Absolutely!  And in my post, I even brought up the matter of women who may not be beautiful, but should still be loved and appreciated for who they are.  

I do think that to an extent being extremely physically attractive can almost be a handicap.  It takes a strong person to deal with such a gift properly.  It can actually destroy some people.

you continue:
The aspects of a person that I find most "beautiful" are not what the media
portrays as beautiful. Real beauty goes alot deeper, John, but it takes
time to learn about that.
(end)

Yes, the media/advertising world has done quite a job pushing physical beauty as a means to sell product.  And I do know real inner beauty is something which does time take to learn about and truly appreciate.  

My girlfriend is not a "classic beauty", but to me she is beautiful because of the way her inner beauty shines through.  She is one of the most intelligent and caring women I have ever met.  There must be some hope for me in that she really sees a lot of good in me.

Though I was just kidding around, I share in the blame here because I wrote the above paragraph.

Natasha wrote:
Intelligent and Creative Friends,

I'd rather see discussion and debate over the *contents* of the artwork and the art theory which both have been getting great reviews.  You have a wonderful opportunity now to discuss and critique the current medium of "net.art" just as you might discuss and debate the singularity or AI.
(end)

To be able to fit into the category you are addressing above would be quite an honor.  I really love your Primo 3M+ work both as a transhumanist concept and an artistic endeavor.  And I hope your upcoming gallery promoting it is a huge success.  

I admit to still having much to learn about art as it relates to the human body.  I suppose I don't know where the lines are that separate regular glamour photography from the actual art that you do.  Perhaps the whole list needs to be educated on this.  Or at least just some of us!     

I really love this list and the people on it, and it would really be painful for me to think some folks are harboring grudges against me.  Of course people may say they forgive me, but actually still harbor a grudge! lol  I hope everyone can truly forgive me for my foolishness.    

I don't ever want to lose friends like Amara, Gina and Natasha.  

sincerely,

John

Yeah, yeah, I was there in the anti-Vietnam trenches, comrade, watching
with sardonic amusement. (The Maoist thoughtcrime charge was, however,
`*ideologically* incorrect'.) That was then, however, this is now. The way
the accusation of `PC' is used today by the right, as a universal solvent
against egalitarian ideas as well as purse-mouthed claptrap, can be
illustrated, perhaps, by the following small snippet from a Texan humorist
writing about the proposed Ron Howard/John Sayles Alamo movie:

http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:ufDdHTq3kiMC:www.texasmonthly.com/mag/i
ssues/2002-02-01/feature3.php+san+marcos+texas+movie&hl=en

Ah yes, if only we could go back to the good old days before this odious
and holier-than-thou `political correctness', when a man was a man and
didn't have to flinch at slavery and abandoning your wife and child, the
useless baggages.

Now of course that paragraph of mine is absurdly humorless. Actually what
Don Graham was saying is: we live in mendaciously squeaky-clean times, when
the truth about the crappy values that infected our past heroes can't be
admitted. Therefore the film treatment will surely be sanitized, for
otherwise the powerful and ubiquitous bleeding heart liberals, gays,
blacks, Mexicans and Muslim terrorists will claim that the film makers are
*advocating* such behavior, rather than simply reporting how things used to
be. (I'm not sure how to work the public schools into that exoneration, but
let's all boo and hiss at them anyway. I went to horrible privately funded
working class Catholic schools, so I'll boo and hiss at those instead.)

For all that, I still think there's a hidden barb in most such uses of the
phrase `PC' (even if, usually, an unconscious subtextual one), implying
that hey, things weren't *really* so bad before the bitches and the uppity
took over the sidewalk.

PLEASE NOTE WELL: I *don't* mean to imply that this subtext is intended by
anyone here (well, hardly anyone), especially not Michael, who's a fine
fellow with an intellect as keen as anyone in the room (well, almost anyone).

homosexuals and europeans are going to start riding gyroscopic scooters!

i can't sleep, so i am accessing the national archives and records 
administration system; it is very nice, and confirms much of what i thought 
about: how our world works.  it's hard to believe that they release 
telephone conversations between the president to mayors of american cities 
instructing them to "increase the republican turnout for the 1961 poverty 
bill". we need them bad.  hilarious.

the system is named NAIL:

i suggest using the expert interface and typing first, the keyword that best 
describes your heritage, and of what you are composed.

Forwarded by a friend...

Dear Colleagues:

In 1998 I stepped forward with a claim that I had an idea of how to make
a molecular computer, which would have an architecture of a
3-dimensional neural network and asked if anybody could help me with
making this device (for example, by making me a job offer). The most
important help I have received from several people was a suggestion to
publish at least something on this topic. Since work on a molecular
computer was not related to my main job, it took a little while before I
was able to write anything. Fortunately, by now the writing is finished
and you are welcome to take a look at the Proposal of this project
published on

http://milk.nevzorov.net

Any comments about this Proposal and help with starting up that Project
or some of its parts (especially in a form of job offer) will be greatly
appreciated. Hope that you will enjoy reading that document.

Sincerely yours,

_Distress_ and related stories, applied it to people of the *asex*
gender, which is very different from using it for an indeterminate
gender.

"Sie" is rather overloaded in German.  It serves as
1. third person singular feminine (she),
2. third person plural (they), and
3. capitalized as formal second person singular and plural (you).

(The identity of #2 and #3 is the result of convergent reduction.
English escaped a similar fate by borrowing the Old Norse forms for
the third person plural.  #3 is historically derived from #2.)

> Is Ve the (semi?) official extropy mailing list gender neutral pronoun?

I hope not, considering that this usage looks rather stupid to
people who are aware of its source.

FWIW, I think "they" works reasonably well as a gender-neutral
pronoun, and it has the distinct advantage that its usage in this
role pre-dates modern political correctness by several centuries.

Exactly.

I devised a set in THE WHITE ABACUS, which I invited people to appropriate;
it turns out I was less than exhaustive, grammatically (mixing up his/hers
with his/her), as this linguistic analysis argues:

I'm speaking in ignorance of the details, as usual, but this seems
fallacious. The reset totipotent diploid nucleus would *already* be
imprinted, surely, and by both parents, from the original conception? Or
are you arguing that the resetting process strips off the imprint markers
(which must happen to standard haploid germ cells)?

IGF-1 would be more likely to promote bone and lean muscle growth, no?

No one sees the happy face?  (I missed one earlier, of course.)

My, we are politically correct around here.  Although I was just kidding, 
marriages DO break up all the time.  Extropians have trouble dealing with 
reality?

Now Gina seems to be a person who is NOT concerned about political

I agree, but virtually everyone has some standards of physical 
appearance.  I don't believe that makes someone shallow.  I myself tend to 
be quite generous with my appreciation - no doubt due to my own emotional 
reactions when women do not few me favorably - which has been true all my 
life.  It is worse when it is not merely your physical appearance that they 
reject, but your nature and your values - again, something I have 
experienced all my life.

As an aside, it irritates me when women claim to want a sensitive, 
compassionate man, then hook up with the first macho, jock a**  that walks 
by (a recent public example  - according to the tabloids anyway - not that 
I give them much credence - is Jodie Foster and Russell Crowe).

And in my personal experience, very few people want to take the time to get 
to know someone if their initial "three-second" impression is at all 
negative.  And very few humans realize that just because one has some 
unusual opinions about one subject or another, it does not mean that one is 
not capable of intimacy, or passion, or love, or respect. As Barney says of 
Hannibal Lector, "One quality does not prevent any other 
quality".  [D'oh!  Bad example! :-}]

I'm assuming Ve = He/She, Vim = Him/Her, Ver = His/Her, Verself =
Himself/Herself.
I have not seen this pronoun.  My only objection is that by rhyming with
traditional pronouns, you get a flavor that Vim is like Him and Ver is like
Her.

> .  (Sie / hir / hirs / hirself) seems to be relatively common
I have seen this, but have always had problems with it.  Maybe someone can
tell me how they are supposed to be pronounced.
If they are pronounced "She" and "Her", then this is just feminist counter
propoganda, replacing masculine pronouns with feminine pronouns.
If they are pronounced "See" and "Hear" then you have the problem that
English already has multiple words with those pronunciations:  C / See / Sea
and Here / Hear.

> (Zie / Zir / Zirs / Zirself) also seems to be used.
At least I can tell how to pronounce these by looking at them.

3)	none--no angel can be at rest.

`Vim' is not Egan's coinage, and is out of keeping. Ve/ver/vis. Ver is the
accusative. I forget how he handles plurals.

I have never been able to understand why people have a problem with "you", 
"they", "them" or "he/she". I have even seen "(s)he" on occasion which I 
thought inventive, if a little strained.

I, personally, have never had a problem with "he", "man" (as in mankind), 
etc. being generalised to encompass all people. To worry about it always 
seemed a bit nit-picky to me. I think we have bigger problems than desexing 
pronouns.
:-)

Best wishes,

To be honest Damien, I'm not clear about the details.  I'm not even
sure that the people working in the field understand it fully.
I understand what you are saying and it seems to make sense
but I think the devil is in the details.  It may be that there
is some strange "struggle" for dominance that occurs in the
developing embryo between the imprinted states.  For example
in bacteria, after infection the lambda phage senses whether
the conditions are good for replication -- if not, it enters
a non-reproductive state until things improve.  Perhaps the
imprinted genes have similar mechanisms for sensing whether
the mother has the resources to support accelerated growth
and/or determining the priority of the father's or mother's
imprinting.

I do recall reading that the hypothetical purpose for imprinting
of genes like IGF1 was the interests of the father in producing
offspring more likely to survive and the interests of the mother
in preventing the offspring from harming her reproductive capacities.

There may be some interaction between gene imprinting and gene
silencing (as occurs with one copy of the X-chromosome in females).

I think this is still at the level of "theory" and not "proven"
at the practical level.

IGF1 in adults may have those effects.  In developing children it may
serve as a more "general" growth factor (embryos start out with no bones
and no muscles).

This is going to be a very complex area and understanding it completely
is likely to take some time.  If you want to know more the best source
would probably be PubMed.  Looking up "gene imprinting" and review
should yield what you want.

I have never really found myself unable to de-gender text involving humans -
there usually seems to be a way out. It's only in business dealings that I
have ever found it an issue (employment manuals, personnel matters etc)
Applied to humans, genderless pronouns seem to accentuate and/or confuse the
issue, not defuse it. To me anyway.

It was only when describing a non-fiction genderless non-human that I felt a
growing unease and an inability to choose pronouns. A personal relationship
needs personal pronouns. It was a relief when I found Eliezer's
http://www.singinst.org/ discussion that I found something to use. At first
it was really awkward. Now it's starting to feel OK. This I find quite
amazing - my brain is 'shoehorning' new pronouns alongside deeply embedded
prep-school written grammar models.

With "The White Abacus", now queued up/gottaread, I have another set to try:
se,sem,semself,ser,(sems?). Damien, have you ever read it out loud to
anyone? If so, how was it? What are the phonetics in your mind? How Zish is
the S, How Aish is is the E?

I tried
"Yesterday ve learned X but when I asked ver today ve did not know"
"Yesterday se learned X but when I asked ser today se did not know"
at home. My son liked S and my wife likes V. I think the S version falls off
my tongue better but the V looks better written, somehow. Ill try the S
version for a while and see how it feels (for AI). Is there an Extropian
standard? I have a practical need for one, extropian or otherwise. I wish it
were so. Panelbeating the heart of the English language was not in the game
plan. I have a lot of words to write and speak - someone tell me which!

As for genderless pronouns, it is interesting to note that angels, which
are sexless according to the scholastics, are usually titled "he".

They speak about a precedent, a person in the Island of Reunion
(French) who was forbidden to keep his mother in his refrigerator (I
think that was not in a cryonicist perspective, he just wanted to keep
the body around). The law says the body must be cremated or burried.

I wonder what is the rationale behind the law. Probably to ensure that
a "decent" (and socially hygienic) treatment is given to the dead,
even when relatives wouldn't care about it or would not have financial
means to do something.

If this is so, then cryo-suspension should be accomodated, as it is
obviously more than "decent", compared to incineration or burrial.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 578  February 27, 2002

FRACTAL CARBON NANOPORE NETWORK.
<snip>, go to http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/2002/split/578-1.html
.................................
    The fractal nature of solid shapes has been measured many
times, but this might be the first time a fractal mapping has been
performed for the empty space inside a void, namely the nanopore
network.  (For comparison of pore, surface, and solid fractals, see
the figure at www.aip.org/mgr/png.)  The surface area of this great
inland realm works out to about 1000 square meters (or one
football field) per gram.  The researchers expect that methane and
other fuels could be stored in this kind of structure (the molecules
are readily taken up into the branching alleyways by the weak
attraction of induced electric dipole "van der Waals" forces), and at
pressures much less than the 200 atm needed to store methane in
steel cylinders.  Gas separation can also be accomplished because
the narrow channels are negotiated more easily by some molecular
species than others.   Electricity storage might be accomplished by
building capacitors enhanced by intermediate layers of activated
carbon networks filled with an ionic conducting fluid.  (Pfeifer et
al., Physical Review Letters, 18 March 2002)
=============================================

I'm all excited because I've been waiting for some sort of potential method
for building ultra-capacitors for a long time. Lots of suface area *plus*
very small separations, along with physical strength and good dielectric
constant - this is the first real sign of it. I want to see an end to
chemical batteries. I'll get my electric car yet.

Recently on the Sphere list we've been having a discussion about g-neutral 
pronouns (standardizing one set vs letting everyone have there own 
individuality, what should be standard if anything) and the set that's been 
generally accepted is ze/zir/em (or er). I think this is the easiest to 
say, zim/vim/sim (or zer/ver/ser) don't flow at all - him/her don't have a 
consonant at the beginning and we're used to saying those, so it's much 
easier to keep the g-neutral equivalent starting with a vowel too.

Those aren't gender neutral. We're in the business of creating ourselves 
and becoming whatever we want to be, here, and some of us don't want to be 
a he or a she.

1) you're a human being still

2) you're talking to still other human beings, most of whom are unfamiliar
   with new terminology, especially pointless new terminology

3) posthuman beings either never spoke human languages, or rapidly stop
   using languages and concepts as they radiate away from the founder

This considered, especially 2), seem to suggest to stick to vanilla human
language. (For time being; for most of us, with the possible exception
of gargoyles).

As we know over time the DNA accumulates point mutations, the mutational
load has to increase with the age of the organism.  So your comment about
DNA damage is very important.  In contrast the telomere problem appears
at be to correcttable by at least some methods (as was pointed out).

I don't see an easy way around this.  We don't have the technology currently
to return a genome to its "pristine" state.  Nor do we seem likely to have it
in the next 10 years.  It seems more likely that we will have whole genome
synthesis capabilities before we have the ability to tweek, thousands or
more erroneous bases in preexisting genomes.

To be fair about this, the correct comparison is presumably defect free
births from cloning methods vs defect free births from natural fertilizations.
Success rates of 1 in 150 (0.6%) for cloning look somewhat better when compared
with say 45 in 150 (30%) for natural fertilizations.  But I would guess that
one would need to get the success rate up to 10-50% of the natural methods
for people to begin to consider it seriously for anything other than pet
or livestock cloning.

Hey, I've got an idea: why don't we just emulate the French (and other 
languages) and just attribute genders to *every* 
object!  :-/  Yeesh...there have got to be better things to talk about here...

Men and women are obviously different, and I have no problem with referring 
to any one person as either she, he or "he or she" or "she or he."  Unless 
you automatically equate a word with a broad conceptual meaning, I think 
we're safe with the language structure as it is.

I tend to agree that new pronouns are pointless.  That said, I suppose it's 
alright if some people want to compromise their ability to communicate for 
the sake of personal image management.  What I don't understand is why we 
need S's and 'v''s and Z's - what's wrong with simply dropping the 
consonants from him, her, herself, himself, etc. and saying "er", "im", 
"erself", "imself", etc.
Then it just sound like a speed impediment to normal listeners.  You could 
interpret the "e" in some of these as "Extropian"...

Another possibility would be "g" for "gender-neutral" - ger, gim, gerself, 
gimself. Unless the gays want to keep the "G" for themselves.

I doubt there's going to be a standard for this - too few people care.

On this list,  I think it's just another intellectual puzzle for people to 
play with.  That's fine - if boring to me.  I can just filter the header :-}

I've got a couple of sample carbon-aerogel supercapacitors right now. 10
Farad, 2.75 volt, the size of AA cells with incredibly low ESR. Nifty. I'm

Pardon? "H" is a consonant, at least in American English. I thought Received

So why bother using terms like posthuman, extropy, singularity, or any 
other words that most of humanity are unfamiliar with (and would quite 
likely consider our pursuit of them pointless)?

We're not posthuman yet, as you pointed out.

Gargoyles?
Like in Snow Crash?

But back to the original point - We don't know very much about gender. It's 
safe to say that sex is a biological trait. Many people feel a strong 
attachment to traditional gender roles - and they can have them. I've never 
felt male (I tried, when i was around 10, and I was not very good at it), 
and rarely have I felt very female (but I've done a better job at that than 
I have at being male). All the evidence I've seen points to gender being at 
least partially a social construct, and something that can be changed or 
ignored safely.

Or from a completely different angle - if I said "I went to the store and 
the black person behind the counter sold me stuff", someone would probably 
tell me that I'm being racist. "I went to the store and the man behind the 
counter sold me stuff" isn't something that most people will see anything 
wrong with, but it's essentially the same as the previous statement. Both 
contain useless, irrelevant information, that can be removed.

Er. Yeah. I was clearly not entirely there when I wrote that. Thanks for 
catching my blatant stupidity.
So ignore everything I said, "er" or "em" still seems to flow better than 
"zir" or "zim".

Yes - low ESR - but what about ESL? Spotwelding needs a fast rise time.
If they have ESL down far enough to do this job, I would like part numbers 
and manufacturer's name. I have some interesting potential uses for high 
capacity / low impedance caps.

http://www.cooperet.com/products_supercapacitors.asp ;

Source is Cooper / PowerStor. Not sure about inductance as such. The ESR is
really an impedance, I believe; rated for AC at 1Khz. How much faster a rise
time do you need?

I got the samples a while ago, and they were appraently handmade; they cost me
$25 apiece. If they're actually in quantity production now, perhaps the price
has gone down.

At least those words are in the dictionary.  People who are unfamiliar with
them CAN find out what they mean.  If you make up a word people don't have a
chance to understand you.  Even with these posts that list all forms of
these new pronouns, I can't always sort out what these four pronouns mean.
(I only have a chance with the ones that sound like "her" or "him", and that
defeats the whole purpose.)

Hmm, they need an underground "tomb" to store their dewars in. One would
imagine that some creative compliance with the french legal concept of
"burial" is in order.

A little thought and anyone can understand them. I've seen at least two new 
(to me) sets of g-neutral pronouns since joining this list, and figured 
them all out fairly quickly.

I never use those when talking to the mundanes. I used to use "transhuman"
a bit, but lately realized it's not a good idea. Just throwing interesting
concepts around is sufficient, and then, after a while you can mention
there's a group of people who's pursuing similiar interests. Anything else
comes over as cultism/preaching, and people are wired to shun that.

> We're not posthuman yet, as you pointed out.

Right, and since we're not that, let's keep to vanilla language, with a
bit of jargon from science & technology. It's totally up to the task.

> Gargoyles?
> Like in Snow Crash?

Gargoyles, as in wearable users. (Some of them actually refer to
themselves that way). Claims to technical leadership nonwithstanding, we
have only one here (that I can think of, please correct me if I'm wrong.
Lots of wannabees, though, as far as I can tell).

I would like to see evidence for change, given that sex is wired in the
brain, and we understand the brain a lot less then gender, and can change
it even less. Hormones do something, but it's not enough. And why should
this interest me, at all? Postbiology doesn't have to have a sexual
dimorphism, or at least this particular sexual dimorphism. Talking about
gender is about the same relevance to transhumanism as human genetic
engineering. I.e. very little to none.

Sometime gender can be ignored, sometimes its use conveys valuable
information.

Someone asked for the rules to this.  Like I said, there were no formal
rules, but here's my best shot at making some up.

http://www.wingedcat.org/singulcard/

Feel free to forward this URL to anyone else that may be interested.
If I get enough suggestions - *especially* ideas on how to fill up the
card list - I think I know someone who could get this tested and
published (Cheap-Ass Games, or a similar publisher).  But that won't
happen with just four cards on the list; I'd need at least forty (or
somewhere in that neighborhood) before I'd approach them with this.

Exactly.  Googling for "ze zir zim" works great, but unless you are listing
all forms of the pronoun, you didn't find it.  Looking for a single word, as
you encounter it is impossible.

       Its always bothered me why my wife spends so much time shopping. The 
usuall story, she goes into a shop, see's something she likes, doesn't buy 
it, spends 5 hours looking around other shops then goes back to the first to 
buy the first thing she liked. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !
       Me, being a typical "Bloke". I'm run in the shop, go directly to the 
exact thing I want, grab it pay for it and get home before anyone has 
realised ive moved of the couch. Yippeeeee !

       Now it has suddenly dawned on me that this appears to be a left over 
from our days as hunter gatherers. 
       Typically the women folk would spend their time forraging for tasty 
morsals. Picking and choosing the best. 
       On the other hand "The Blokes" went running into the woods, Smashed 
some furry thing on the head and imediately dragged it back to the camp. 
Where they would imediately sit down on the Mamoth skin couch and stick there 
hands in their pants ?.

      Am I right ? It makes sense to me and just shows we are still carrying 
a lot of baggage from our past.

I was afraid of that. Rise times would need to be on the order of a few 
microseconds, max, for what I am looking at - it's a variation on EMP 
technology we used for vehicle stopping a few years back (that seems to be 
going nowhere)...

Still, I appreciate the link. Never know what else having access to new 
tech will turn up.

PS:  It's "ve/vis/ver".  "vim" always throws me off; I'm not used to it.

Alex,
       There is an anthropologist named Lionel Tiger (Tee-ger) from Rutgers 
University.  As I understand him most of our basic social organizations go 
back to practically cave man days.  You might like look up some of his work.

I think there may be a bit of oversimplification here.  Women clearly
have more sensitive senses with regard to smell, perhaps taste.
So, they may be more selective with regard to what plants
they choose as food sources.  In general, if its a higher
level organism (fish/reptile/mammal) and men can capture it
and bring it back for consumption it is "safe".  (Toxins
have been pre-filtered by the survival mechanisms of those
organisms.)  There are rare instances where higher level
organisms may be toxic but they are rather infrequent.

If the selective differentiation between the food sources
selected by human males and females in an evolutionary
context is a reasonable theory, it would not seem unreasonable
to extend this to the selection of the "best" of the available
resources.  This might show up as a bias on the part of males
towards the preference for "fresh meat".

In addition to this generalization not being valid, let me remind you
that this is the person whose work the "Rogue Males" article was based 
(extropian archives from fourth quarter 2001, not avail yet).  

I would not call Tiger's work scientific.

In the Finnish language there exists a single personal pronoun used of humans:

<PRE>

| '_ \ / _` | '_ \ 
| | | | (_| | | | |

</PRE>

So I find it weird to always have to specify the sex of a person when using
any of the Indo-European languages.  Especially so on the net, where a name
means next to nothing and in most cases does not specify the sex of the
entity in question. (E.g. Swedes use "Jan" and "Janne" as names for for boys.)

I'd be happy to take suggestions for new terms as long as they are
accurate.

It is common in this country these days to be labeled as a racist
for arguing against political correctness, or any well intentioned
but completely wrongheaded liberal idea.

Take affirmative action, it's idea was to redress past wrongs
committed by others, but it's very application means committing new
wrongs in the process. Not satisfied with merely committing this
wrong, it was pressed into service to coercively implement another
wrongheaded idea, that a balance of minorities in any situation was
desirable.

Fairness means being fair to all.

Yes, it is just T.V., my point was that by promoting what I
consider a very bad idea, and doing so in a so completely
transparently artificial way, I disliked, and rarely watched the
show, while I was borderline addicted to the previous shows.

Well, that depends on which theologician you listen to. Matthew 22:28-30
suggest that they are asexual.

To get back to more transhuman waters: I'm currently reading Greg Egan's
_Schild's Ladder_, and (minimal spoiler) there the far-future posthumans
have mainly adopted pair-specific sexes. When two (corporeal)
individuals are attracted to each other, they begin to change and
gradually develop sexual organs that are compatible. Exactly how they
look appears to be random but they are complementary and fit together
apparently uniquely for that pair. A rather neat solution, although I
have to agree with the acorporeal Yann that it is at the same time
comical.

However, unlike _Distress_ and _Diaspora_ Egan is not using gender
neutral pronouns here; the main character is referred to as he, and the
one other main character is consistently she. Even Yann, who is usually
noncorporeal is referred to as male. I guess he uses this to suggest
certain personality or behavior traits, although I can't say they are
very visible to me.

Even in the english world, where Alice and Alys are used with different
genders in different english countries, Chris, Pat, Lee, and many others
are completely non-gender specific, at least in the US, and even Mickey,
Fred, and others are used by both genders.

Here's something to ponder: perhaps people WANT gender specificity
because they LIKE having the gender identity they have.

May not an even simpler explanation be that males tend to behave a bit
more according to well-learned behavior patterns (perhaps due to a
naturally slightly higher resting arousal level affecting the
noradrenergic systems?). This means that males would settle for a
satisfactory solution, while females would sample more to get a better
solution.

I don't think this is a true explanation, but it sounds neat.

Also remember that so far this discussion has entirely left out the big
cultural factors that definitely affect shopping behavior.

I've used the "ey/em/eir" set off and on, on this list and elsewhere;
it's usually quickly understood by those unfamiliar with it, and since
it's derived from existing plurals there's little chance of getting it
wrong. They even flow pretty well in speech.

I'm surprized no one's mentioned the canonical text that argues
effectively for the need of the things, Hofstadter's "Person Paper":

I've been shopping and found the crusty bones of hundreds of years of
attempts
here....
http://www.aetherlumina.com/gnp/
http://www.english.uiuc.edu/baron/essays/epicene.htm
http://www.speckhardt.org/gnp/

The 3 lower items are now in the trolley:

Lexeme	nominative	accusative	reflexive	weak genitive	strong genitive
								(adjective)		(posessive pronoun)
she		she		her		herself		her		hers
he		he		him		himself		his		his

se		se		sem		semself		ser		(sems)
ey		ey		em		eirself		eir		eirs
ve		ve		ver		verself		?ver		?vis

(pronunciation "ey, eir, em" rhyme with "they, their, them" resp.)

My need is for AI only. My daughter and I went through the whole alphabet
and spoke some test sentences out loud. All feel wrong to speak.  Curiously,
if you stick in L in front of ey, eir, em (ley, leir, lem) it gives them an
easier tongue. It's the only one that felt relatively OK out loud. The V and
S versions make you sound like an east european (polish?) speaking english -
wierd.

"I taught him/her to think for himself/herself yesterday but when I asked
him/her he/she had forgotten" becomes
"I taught lem to think for leirself yesterday but when I asked lem ley had
forgotten"
(note the new 'i before e except after c and possibly l?' :) The technical
term for this whole thing is, I think, Yuck).

I am writing - many thousands of words in a document that will become public
one day. Because of the way the content is evolving, dialogue with and about
an AI occurs. I feel a need for a truly gender neutral way of handling the
discussion. This is not a drill or an intellectual puzzle. If I ascribe male
of female gender I predict criticism from humans ('why did the AI come out
male - typical'...'why did it come out female....trying to construct your
perfect woman or something?') I simply don't feel right when having dialogue
about an AI where the AI is, in an increasingly real sense, listening.
Talking about someone to a 3rd party whilst they are there is simply rude.
The key to it seems to be the 'personalness' of the relationship. The more
of this, the more 'it' sounds inappropriate.

Executive decision: I am going to use ley, leir, lem for purely speech
reasons and later let the AI sort it out!

Well, it's possible their "flat" capacitor form might be applied to reduce the
self-inductance probably present in the cylindrical units. You might want to
send them an email and ask about low-L implementations.

 [Comment by poster:The experiment below compared a diet containing
 coenzyme Q8, with a Q-less diet. Caenorhabditis can manufacture coenzyme
 Q9 themselves, so the experiment is really comparing the effect of Q9
 versus Q8 on nematode longevity. Metabolism of Q9 is known to produce
 less oxygen derived free radicals than metabolism of Q8. The human
 isoform is coenzyme Q10, which generates still less oxygen derived free
 radicals. Rodent studies using added Q10, find that longevity is either
 increased or it is unchanged. Like nematodes, rodents naturally produce
 Q9. IMHO, research using Q11, or Q12 might yield some
 interesting results.]

 ________________________________________________________________

 Extension of Life-Span in Caenorhabditis Elegans by a Diet Lacking
 Coenzyme Q

 Science 295: 120-123 2002

 Abstract: The isoprenylated benzoquinone coenzyme Q is a redox-active
 lipid essential for electron transport in aerobic respiration. Here, we
 show that withdrawal of coenzyme Q (Q) from the diet of wild-type
 nematodes extends adult life-span by 60%. The longevity of clk-l, daf-2,
 daf-12, and daf-16 mutants is also extended by a Q-less diet. These
 results establish the importance of Q in life-span determination. The
 findings suggest that Q and the daf-2 pathway intersect at the
 mitochondria and imply that a concerted production coupled with enhanced
 scavenging of reactive oxygen species contributes to the substantial
 life-span extension.

Many ideas come to mind. Maybe one day we can have some clearer ideas
about all of this. But then, when we understand it with some
precision, we will probably have started to move to something else, so
it won't matter very much anymore. Evolutionary psychology might be
obsolete before it matures.

In fact, think of all these written works about human nature, suddenly
obsoleted. But another way to look at it (quite natural to me, really)
is that "all these written works about human nature" are really not
very many and not very much, just a few stabs in the dark (and/or human
folklore exaltation) in the short transition phase between the
invention of writing and the blooming of computing.

To say the truth, I was getting bored with the "marvelous tradition of
writings about human nature" (all the little sex and status intrigues,
always the same, repeated over and over like they are so interesting)
even before I started to realize that human nature could possibly be
transcended in a relatively short time frame.

Now all the fun is back!

Yeah, that's it, let's all use *different* gender-neutral pronouns!  After
all, a Yudkowskian seed AI is probably very different from a Garisian AI,
much more different than a human male and female.  Shouldn't the two have
different pronouns?

I wonder whether there's ever been an SF story that used two different
classes of gender-neutral pronoun to refer to two cognitively different
classes of AI.  That might even be Something That Hasn't Been Done In
Science Fiction.  Of course, it requires an author who can extrapolate two
interestingly different classes of AI and give them personalities at least
as visibly different as male and female humans.

Someone might think you were talking about a Multiple.

(I happened to run across in passing - literally in passing, it was at the
site InPassing.org - a reference to "OtherKin", who are IMHO the most
completely marching-to-a-different-kettle-of-fish people I have EVER run
across.  There are people out there who are not living in our consensus
reality.  And I don't mean "living in the loose and casual suburbs of
consensus reality, instead of urban downtown scientific consensus reality";
I mean "living someplace that is no longer connected to our consensus
reality by regular airline service".  Anyway, try googling on Otherkin +
Multiple.)

Nothing, if you don't care whether your listener thinks you're talking
about one person or more than one.  Otherwise, what you gain in gender
equality you sacrifice in clarity.  Some uses of "singular they" don't
have that problem: even some staunch language purists have a hard time
objecting to "everyone removed their hat."  But your sentence above is
a great example of language abuse.

Also, I should point out that the reflexive form of the ey/em/eir set
is "emself", not "eirself", since the plural is "themselves" (by analogy
to "himself"; use of "hisself" and "theirselves" is a shibboleth of poor
education) I don't particularly find the superfluous added "l" to have
any value, but if you insist it should still be "lemself", not "leirself".

Also, the i-before-e rule is not violated the least here, since every
rational version of that rule mentions explicitly that all cases
pronounced as the "ay" diphthong are properly spelled "ei".

Wanting to change the laguage to correct its flaws is a noble goal,
but let's not be sloppy about it, or we just create more problems than
we solve.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Coming soon to a front page near you:

Science magazine, the premiere American scientific journal published by
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, will publish
Friday an article reporting on apparent nuclear fusion in a tabletop
glass of liquid.

http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/hottopics/bubble/index.shtml has
the technical article, a readable explanation, and an editorial comment
about the decision to publish the paper in the face of a failure to
replicate and an "airy dismissal" by Robert Park of the American Physical
society (visible for now at http://www.aps.org/WN/).  Of course memories
of the cold fusion debacle loomed large and apparently considerable
pressure was brought to bear to postpone publication, to no avail.

Unlike the old cold fusion results, this one is based on sonoluminescence,
a poorly understood phenomenon in which tiny bubbles in liquid,
compressed by sound waves, emit intense heat and light.  The liquid is
"heavy acetone", CH3COCH3 in which the hydrogen atoms have been replaced
by deuterium (acetone is common nail polish remover).  The researchers
report detecting two signs of fusion: tritium (helium 3) and bursts of
neutrons.

Even if confirmed, this result would probably not lend itself to
the water-fueled cars and other fantasies that the Utah cold fusion
experiments suggested.  It would be mostly useful as an inexpensive
testbed for nuclear fusion research.  But it would certainly be
amazing if an exotic phenomonen like fusion could be produced using
sonoluminescence, which is simple enough to be the subject of amateur
experiments (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucapwas/sl/sono.html).

Nothing, it works -but- to me it's not enough - too impersonal for all
occasions.
It's the subjective level of intimacy in the sentence. In vocalising,
sometimes the de-personalising doesn't feel right, for some reason,
depending on the context.

I saw this announced, but I also saw that Oak Ridge could not repeat the
experiment.

see: http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/03/04/science.fusion.reut/index.html

Anyone out there have the inside story?

Hello everyone,

David Pizer, president of The Society for Venturism, tells how his organization is a "religious" one.  And how that can help individuals with the goal of a quickly done suspension unimpeded by red tape.  Those who join the organization even get membership cards.  "Membership has it's privileges!" : )

He also shares his vision for the Venturist resort/community presently being built.  What he is going to be doing has been so badly needed for many years.  Like I have said before, these are truly exciting times!

best wishes,

John

There is a religion of cryonics and life extension, The Society for
Venturism.  It is a real religion.
I has been in existence for over a decade.  It has been approved as a
"legal" religion by the United States government and has been issued a
government recognition through a 501 c-3  status.  (I don't know if "legal"
is the right word to use here).

The Society for Venturism has issued membership cards to its members.  They
carry them around and when the members sign the declaration of religious
intent (provided by their cryonics suspension company), they have their
membership in Venturism to prove that they are not just using religion as a
ploy to get cryogenically suspended - cryonics is their real religion.
Between the declaration of religious intent and the membership evidence that
might/should be enough to get a cryonicist religious protection to a quick
suspension.  It has never been tested that I know of.


You can contact the Secretary, Mike Perry, for a membership application.

This year we expect to have some conferences at a facility in Mayer Arizona.
Look for more details on this forum in August.

We hope to have a cryonics community, a retirement cryonics community, a
conference center, (under construction), with monthly conferences, a Life
Extension Type magazine for the public (we are looking for volunteers for
editor), a back-up cryonics insurance plan that would move/protect  frozen
Venturist members (who took out this insurance protection), if their primary
suspension company went bust, a way for people to leave life insurance
proceeds and their accumulated wealth in a personal trust to themselves for
use when they are reanimated, (we already have this), a place where you can
store your personal valuable (perhaps only to you) stuff, and lots more.

Again, watch this forum around August of this year for more details.

One thing I've noticed with those who 'could not repeat the experiment'
always seem to doctor it in some way, hoping to discover their own way
to produce the same effect... or so they claim.
Keep in mind also that Oak Ridge has a vested interest in disproving
experiments like this, because they presage cheap, easy to access fusion
energy, which is totally anathema to multi-billion dollar science and
engineering R&D budgets.
Note the last paragraph of the story, that the Oak Ridge people likely
had their instruments improperly calibrated.

There is now a fourth article linked from the page I gave earlier, to
a news story which describes the controversy in detail.

http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/hottopics/bubble/1808.pdf

"The heat from the controversy alone is nearly enough to trigger a
nuclear reaction."

Amazing, yes, but not implausible. With cold fusion, there was no
plausible mechanism: That is, there was never a reasonable explanation
as to how a catalyst could cause hydrogen atoms to collide fast enough
to overcome electrostatic repulsion of the nuclei.

By contrast, SBSL (single-bubble sonoluminescence) is not completely
understood, but the most reasonable physical explanation is that the
bubble glows due to simple blackbody radiation pursuant to compression.
You actually need to work hard to come up with an alternative 
explanation. If the glow is black-body, then the bubble is heating to
at least 43,000 Kelvin. This is very close to hot enough for
classical thermonuclear fusion.

In SBSL, you start with a de-gassed liquid (normally water) and then
dissolve a small amount of gas (typically air) into it. Place the
liquid into a chamber and hit it with pressure waves. The easy way to
do this is with piezoelectric transducers. A standard setup uses a
spherical container and two piezos. You tune the setup to resonate,
and introduce a tiny bubble of the same gas. The bubble migrates to
the resonant pressure node at the center of the chamber and begins
pulsing at the resonant frequency. For 60mm diameter chamber the
frequency is about 20Khz. When you increase power to the transducers,
the bubble collapses and comes back into existence on each cycle: At
the point of collapse, it emits a blue glow. The simplest explanation
for the glow is simple adiabatic heating due to pressure as the pressure
wave hits the bubble. If this explanation is valid, its a blackbody
glow of at least 43,000K: It may be higher, but the water is opaque to
higher frequencies and its really hard to tell. The bubble collapse is
so sudden that the light pulse is <<1ns, so it takes exotic instruments
to examine the time and frequency spectra of the pulse.

Straight-up blackbody heating of a symmetrically-collapsing bubble is
the most parsimonious explanation, but the phenomenon is so strange that
lots of other explanations have been tried. None had succeeded very well
as of four years ago when I studied this stuff a little.

IF (BIG IF) fusion is demonstrated, then there may be ways to scale this
phenomenon. By decreasing the chamber size, you can increase the pulse 
rate. reduce to a 1mm diameter chamber and increase the pulse rate to 
about 1Mhz, and maybe you get enough fusion to be useful. The trick is 
to design a set of thousands of tiny chambers will the correct
resonant characteristics. Note the at a 1MHz pulse rate and the pulse
duty cycle is still < .001..

Even so, Im betting against it.  I can't imagine how sound waves could 
get the
kinds of pressures required to make fusion happen, under any circumstances.
In theory, I dont understand how the motion of electrons can span the 5 
orders
of magnitude required to interact in any way with nucleons.  

Doing some literature searching on one of Robert Bradbury's ideas, I ran
across a pre-cold-fusion paper by Pons and Fleischmann.  They really
are *real* scientists, which demonstrates how even competent people
can fool themselves into thinking theyve seen cold fusion.  spike

??  I thought fusion required megaKelvin.  Certainly the 
Tokamaks need that.  I don't think I'd want to be around
a 100 MK blackbody.

I've seen at least one news item indicating that physicists
with the most sensitive instruments are detecting no neutrons
using the same type of experiment.

It looks like it is a big blunder on the part of Science
publishing the paper in the face of a nonconfirmation
of the results.

Actually, I think this is a problem in this example only because the pronoun
wasn't defined before it was used.  A more clearly-defined reference would
sound like, "I taught this person to think for themselves yesterday, but
when I asked them they had forgotten."

I prefer to use plurals for my own use:
- I gave him his hat and he took it as his.
- I gave her her hat and she took it as hers.
- I gave one one's hat and one took it as one's.
- I gave him or her his or her hat and he or she took it as his or hers.
- I gave them their hat and they took it as theirs.

This reminds me of Loglan's version of pronouns, when I was learning it 20
years ago.  They used da, de, di, do, and du, which were kind of like 1,
2, 3, 4, 5.  Da was the most recently named noun, de was the 2nd most
recently named, and so on.  So if you had "The AI told John that his
sister had left her wallet at the store," the store would be da, the
wallet de, the sister di, John do and the AI du.  So you could follow
it with "Du also said do should go to da and get de."  You would soon
learn to subconsciously associate the right pronoun with the right noun,
the designers hoped.

In the Old Testament, they were able to have sex with `the daughters of
man', and, like demons, were clearly an incorporation of local deities into
a purportedly monotheistic doctrine. The Scholastics argued that angels are
not merely sexless, each is its own distinct species. They are also
bodiless and without parts, so sex would be tricky, but even if performed
it would necessarily be sterile.

I think this may be very smart. Members of religiuos organizations are
granted special rights, like refusing to give basic medical care to
their children, that others would not have. If we can use this system
to facilitate cryonics arrangements, it is good.
Normally I would not trust a philosophic system of that chooses to
call itself "religious" belief, but perhaps in this case it is a smart
and pragmatic move.
I also liked the idea od the cryonic retirement community and look
forward to seeing how their plans develop.

Good point. I should have forstalled that problem with:

I taught someone to...
or
I taught a person to...
or if you are worried about it being impersonal
I taught a friend to...
etc.

Still no need for novel, desexed pronouns. :-)

Wow! :-)
These people are really "out there"... in the X-Files sense.
I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.

These are like the twit that told my girlfriend not to worry about the pain 
she has had in the general region of her uterus. He could see with his 
"psychic powers" that she didn't have any problems. However she got back 
from the scan today with the news that she has a cyst on her cervix the 
size of the last joint of her little finger.

Thanks for the pointer Eliezer,

Extropes, 

If you haven't already done so, do a google search on
sonoluminescence.  Then check it out.   The first hit
is as good a place as any to start:

http://www-phys.llnl.gov/N_Div/sonolum/

Here's a snippet:

Sonoluminescence has created a stir in the physics
community. The mystery of how a low-energy-density
sound wave can concentrate enough energy in a small
enough volume to cause the emission of light is still
unsolved. It requires a concentration of energy by
about a factor of one trillion. To make matters more
complicated, the wavelength of the emitted light is
very short - the spectrum extends well into the
ultraviolet. Shorter wavelength light has higher
energy, and the observed spectrum of emitted light
seems to indicate a temperature in the bubble of at
least 10,000 degrees Celsius, and possibly a
temperature in excess of one million degrees Celsius. 

        --------------------------------

This is absolutely fascinating.  I remembered reading
the article on sonoluminescence that appeared in Sci
Am in 1995.  (But I haven't been able to access it
again tonight on the web because Sci Am wants me to
pony up some cash for the priviledge, and, well,
that's not gonna happen.)  The high temperatures
suggested (required, proven(?)) by the production of
light--in the uv no less-- would seem at least logical
from conditions of spherical symmetry.  The geometric
and mathematical elegance of this phenomenon is
breathtaking.  A finite amount of energy is compressed
into a volume which approaches a point--ie zero
volume--which would result in an infinite energy
density and an infinitely high temperature.  Clearly,
before such a "singular" point is reached, real world
factors will intervene: absorbtion and reemission by
the compressed medium, energy spread-out arising from
a finite length spectrally-complex wave front, and
imperfect focusing due to asphericity in the bubble,
(others?). 

Whatever.  Who can claim a sophisticated understanding
of this phenomenon?  Not me, certainly.

What really makes this delicious for me is the cold
fusion connection.  When Ponds and Flieschman had
their controversial moment, there was no plausible
mechanism to support fusion in a flask. Now that there
is, we can look back on the cold fusion controversy
and see it in a whole new light (nice little pun,
that).

If one assumes that they actually did stumble on
something, then it's clear that they did so by
accident.  They wanted to capitalize on it--patent
it-- but couldn't, because frankly, they themselves
didn't have a handle on it.  And no one that followed
up on F & P's work could get a handle on it either,
despite tantalizing hints, fleeting and dubious, that
there was something there. So, of course, with no
plausible proof of a means to surmount the
electrostatic repulsion energy barrier, and ever
fearful of reputation damage, the scientific community
retreated to the safety of life as it had been before
the "irrational exhuberance", and cold fusion was
relegated to the annals of crackpot science.

It was clear to the respectable scientific community
that cold fusion was not possible.  The laws of
physics made that quite clear.

I remember, back then, looking for a "location" within
the palladium where the fusion might take place. 
Seeking out the structure of the unit cell, looking at
the shape of the spaces between palladium atoms where
the absorbed deuterium might drift, its own electron
indestinguishable from the sea of free palladium
conduction band electrons.  Wondering how this
minds-eye scene, with its particular geometry and
electronic environment, could promote the postulated
event.

My best guess was that the electrolysis power
supplies, which were DC, but which provided that DC by
conversion from 60 hz AC line voltage, retained a
slight residual 60 hz and higher harmonics, AC signal,
piggybacked on the DC.  And that this caused the
oscillation which accelerated the deuterium nuclei
within the palladium matrix.  That was my shot at an
answer.

Now we get to revist the Ponds and Fleischman
experimental apparatus, with plausible mechanism in
hand, and ask ourselves, "Is some previously unnoticed
acoustic activity, some variant of the
sonoluminescence mechanism, going on here?"

Only time will tell what's really going on, and I'm
looking forward to the adventure of discovery with
pleasant anticipation.  But what it really boils down
to is that, as has so often been the case in the past,
what was once obviously impossible, is now, well,
maybe not.

Or as my boy Ray says:   

"Everything's hard till you know how to do it."

Best, Jeff Davis

It's both the temperature and the density, and the time of the
confinement. But, yes, usually fusion is associated with MK temperature
range.

I think Eliezer has found where Father Damien's Angels are! (Google
Otherkin+Multiple).

How to tell if you are a vampire.
What to do if you 'know' you're not human.
How to find the dragons in your past lives
I found angels.

Yes they're on yahoo too.

I'd ask them what pronouns they use, but, well, the universe is wierd enough

I don't think I'm correcting flaws - just trying to help fill a hole for AI
folk. I was waiting for input from someone not so grammatically challenged
(as me that is). Thanks for the input. My new de-shibbolethed set now looks
like this:

Lexeme	nominative	accusative	reflexive	weak genitive	strong genitive
								(adjective)		(posessive pronoun)
she		she		her		herself		her		hers
he		he		him		himself		his		his

se		se		sem		semself		ser		sems
ve		ve		ver		verself		ver		vis
ey		ey		em		emself		eir		eirs
ley		ley		lem		lemself		leir		leirs

I'm still not happy with the "em" thing. It clashes with the colloquial
usage:

stack 'em, rack 'em and pack 'em, move 'em out, Send 'em down, Huey
stick 'em up, knockin'em dead, if you cant beat 'em, join 'em

The colloquial spoken usage somehow undermines the intent of the proper
usage. One's youngster AI could get quite confused as well. (Anyone remember
HIMY from Get Smart?)

Nifty they are. I can't believe the size for the F.
In terms of Energy density, however, we really need kiloFarads to really get
things moving. (You cap: 0.5CV^2 = 37 joules in AA, Q = CV = 27.5 =
coulombs). You can get your 27500A for 1 millisecond or so though!

I just found this:
** MINI FUEL CELL POWER SOURCE COULD REPLACE EXISTING RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
The days of fast-fading cellular phone batteries may soon be over.

The casing of our techno toys should be the energy source. The cost/energy

thinking of ultra-cap batteries with inbuilt regulators/chargers that you
leave in the sun to charge up. Here's hoping someone gets their olive pits

I like the basic simplicity of the game, a bit like Nim. The
question is whether to keep it simple and clean, or more complex but
also more related to real ideas about technological futures. 

My main problem with it is the technological and economic
assumptions. Is the singularity really a goal in itself, and why
would a disaster automatically happen if the points are unbalanced?
It seems to assume technology is developed because somebody just
decides to, and that things can be perfectly banned. I would like to
make the game a bit more Illuminati-like, even if this may lose
some of the elegance.

What about this: players have "Money" (money/power/knowhow) that can
be invested. You get a certain amount of money for playing certain
cards (representing that you invented something, gained a temporary
monopoly or became the big expert in the field), and pay money for
certain cards (like bans and unbans). This means that it might be
tempting to play a powerful card, even if the risks increase. In
fact, you may have to do that in order to get enough money to affect
a ban.

Bans cost money, proportional to the importance of the technology or
how hard it is to ban - banning basement technology is inherently
more expensive than banning nuclear weapons. Some cards make banning
inherently harder (like the Internet), some easier (like Global Law
Enforcement). They might be not just bans, but regulations and other
"softer measures".

The goal should be to make the situation such that everybody can
profit from developing dangerous technology, but that cooperation is
necessary to uphold bans. Some technologies that are very useful
(like nanoimmune systems) also require dangerous technologies. 

The game ends in a disaster if too much risk points are accumulated.
For example, Nano-manipulators have just +1 Nano risk (they are in
themselves not very risky) while Desktop Fabrication has perhaps +3
risk (it is an application) and Free Replicators +10 risk. Risk can
be reduced by developing safeguard technologies such as Nanoimmune
Systems (-10 Nano Risk) and policies such as Secure Nanolabs (-2
Nano Risk). So the race is to gain enough points while not allowing
the risk to grow too large. 

I would like to add a fourth kind of risk: Social risk. While
technologies may cause other risks, bans make society more
dangerous. If the Social risk goes too high, we end up with a social
disaster. The risks can easily be represented by markers moved along
a line. 

Each turn, a card is also drawn from the deck that is played by the
"world" - possible events and developments not foreseen by the
players. If it is not a valid play it will vanish, but if the
technology or event is possible to play it will be played. 


Some possible cards based on this (I have not included points
seriously here, since I'm more interested in general ideas of
contents and gameplay):

Tech: Internet: +2 Robo, +2 Social Risk. Ban cost: 10

Tech: Ubiquitious Law Enforcement: +10 Social Risk, +5 Money, 
requires Distributed Processing and Nanosurveillance. Ban cost: 5

Tech: Distributed Processing: +1 Robo, +2 Money, requires Internet.
Ban cost: 5

Tech: Friendly AI: +4 Robot, -5 Robot Risk, +5 Money. Requires
Cognitive Engineering. Ban cost: 5

Tech: Free Replicators: +5 Nano, +5 Money, +10 Nano Risk. Ban cost:
7

Tech: Nanoimmune Systems: +3 Nano, +5 Money, -10 Nano Risk, requires
Nanomedicine and Distributed Processing. Ban cost: 7

Tech: Space Habitat: Decreases all risks by 5, -10 Money. Ban Cost:
2

Unban: Treaty Defection : Unbans a technology, and gives the player
the money on the card.

Unban: Freedom of Speech Lawsuit: Unbands a technology, -10 Money

Ban: Oversight Committe: Halve the risk of the controlled
technology. -5 Money

Event: Secure Nanolabs Protocol: -2 Nano Risk, -5 Money

Event: Global Law Enforcement: Halved cost of bans, +5 Social Risk

Event: Unexpected Synergy: Increase all points and risks by 3. 

Event: Replicator bug: If free assemblers are played, increase their
Nano Risk by 2.

Event: High Tech Terrorist: If played by the world the Bio or Nano
Risk is within 5 points of disaster, the game ends in disaster
(otherwise the card has no effect). If played by a player under the
same conditions, that player can destroy the other players and win.
Under other conditions may be played to provide a free ban of any
technology.

I dont know who you are thinking of that has 'multi billion dollar' budgets,
in the US, try less than half the cost of a single shuttle launch, or about
250 million. (this book was written two to three years ago)

Fusion Reactors
"Now, one obvious and frequently noted flaw in this plan is that fusion
reactors do not exist. However, that fact is simply an artifact of the
mistaken priorities of the innocent gentlemen in Washington, D.C., and
similar places who have been controlling scientific research and
development's purse strings for the past few years. Lack of funding, not any
insuperable technical barriers, currently blocks the achievement of
controlled fusion. The total budget for fusion research in the United States
currently stands at about $250 million per year- less that half the cost of
a Shuttle launch, or, in real dollars, about one-third of what it was in
1980. Under these circumstances, the fact that the fusion program has
continued to progress and now is on the brink of ignition is little short of
remarkable."

The megakelvin experiments (hot fusion) are based on plasma containment.
The pressures of plasma are so low compared to that of the fluid and
sono-compression within the bubbles that you need far higher temps to
produce fusion at such low pressures. 

Thermonuclear bombs never reach anywhere near as hot as those used in
the 'big science' plasma fusion devices simply because they rely far
more on high pressure (which also explains why they are far more
successful at producing over-unity energy levels than the plasma
experiments). Achieving fusion in a 'hot' plasma experiment is
essentially trying to produce fusion in circumstances similar to the
sun's corona, which is whispy thin but is heated to the millions of
degrees. Only thermonuclear weapons and apparently this sound based
bubble technique reproduce at some scale conditions similar to those
within the sun itself.

Actually, when the Old Testament was first written, judaism was itself
still quite polytheistic. It eventually welded all the top good gods and
goddesses into one, but you can discern what each individual was by the
various names used for "God" in the old testament: The Creator, The Lord
of Hosts, The Most High, etc were all separate individual gods at some
point. The chief female aspect was Sophia, the Goddess of Wisdom, which
is where the name for the Haggia Sophia cathedral comes from. The
'wisdom' followers have generally evolved into the modern christian
Marianists.

In the situation of Mary being impregnated with Christ, we don't see her
having spiritual sex with God, but only with the Archangel Gabriel.
Whether he used his own parts or merely borrowed the proper instrument
from the big guy remains debatable...

The archangel Lucifer, whose original jobs were to guide the sun around
the heavens and 'bring the light' to men, was obviously demoted to
manage the black body radiation of the inner workings of the earth's
core, primarily I think because the primary competitor with Judaism and
Christianity were all solar gods, so the sun god (Lucifer) had to be
smited, of course. This is also why the Catholic Church opposed the
Copernican Heresy for so long, because a heliocentric universe
threatened the possibility of a resurgence of sun worshipping.

"Extropes, 

If you haven't already done so, do a google search on
sonoluminescence.  Then check it out.   The first hit
is as good a place as any to start:"

Extropians generally interested in fusion technology may want to do a google
search on "Philo T Farnsworth" (Inventor of the television) and "Fusion"
Philo, along with Hirsch, invented what they called 'intertial electrostatic
confinement' This table top reactor used electrostatic charges to
accerlerate protons toward the center of a wire grid sphere, where they were
attracted by a negetive center terminal of the sphere.  Apparently
Farnsworth claimed to have reached break even, and could reliably do it.
Hirsch (who is now a big player in the current US fusion program) claimed
that there were two many losses.  In either case, One can easily build a
table top apparatus capable of attaining a fusion reaction (thought not self
sustaining)

from http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~kronjaeg/hv/fusor/construction/
(this page has a picture of the device in operation)

The Fusor is a vaccum chamber device invented by Philo T. Farnsworth in the
1950's. An acceleration voltage (several kV) and the geometry of the
electrodes cause so-called ion multipacting, and in this case concentration
of accelerated ions in a small focus. This is called Inertial Electrostatic
Confinement (IEC). Using deuterium gas and high vaccum and acceleration
voltage, energy in this focus becomes high enough to make fusion possible,
resulting in a measurable flux of neutrons. The system is currently being
(re-)examined by George Miley of the Univ. of Illonois. Have a look at other
links, too.

I don't see how you can beat the storage density of chemical fuel (the air
electrode is for free) with capacitor type of devices.

How many years has this gone on for? At least since 1980, when it had a
three times larger budget. Assuming an average annual budget of $500
million for 22 years gives us a 22 year budget of $11 billion dollars.

Here's a message I recently sent to the transhumantech list.
Maybe someone here would be interested in the new list as well.

Obviously, free information is not perceived as valuable, so most people
don't feel the need to reciprocate. Witness this list.

Running transhumantech takes time, so I'd like to have something in
return. Starting immediately, there is a new ezmlm-run list called
tt@leitl.org

It is a closed list, inasmuch it will require subscribers to contribute to
stay on the list. I'll keep an informal tally. I will remind you politely
to contribute a few times, before unsubscribing you, in case you're an
incurable leech. Yes, I'd rather wish this were unnecessary, but it is.

What I would like to have is people posting papers and pointers to papers
from sources such as PNAS, Nature, Science, and similiar. (Perhaps
paper-warez would have been a better name, after all).
transhumantech@yahoogroups.com will not receive that content. Also, as a
side effect transhumantech@yahoogroups.com will see less content from me
overall, though it is not being orphaned yet.

Currently, there's no archive for tt@leitl.org, which might or might be
forthcoming as I figure out limitations of ezmlm and of my hosting
provider. Sorry, can't afford my own colo box just for a hobby. Feel free
to donate archive space for it, redundancy never hurts.

To subscribe, send a blank email to tt-subscribe@leitl.org
To unsubscribe, send a blank email to tt-unsubscribe@leitl.org

Initial operation might be rough, as it will take time for me to figure
out ezmlm, all thanks to Dan J. Bernstein's unique (politely put) way of
doing things.

Thanks for listening.

Getting back to my comments the other day about Moore's Law contributing
to increased resource utilization efficiency along exponential growth
curves, I note from reading the space.com's headline story about the
Hubble Telescope refitting mission, that the new solar arrays being
installed on Hubble are half the cost, nearly half the size, and yet
produce nearly 20% more power than those installed in 1993. This implies
a doubling period of 4-5 years for space solar power generation
technology, although two datapoints hardly make for proof of an
exponential trend.

Mordern Lojban (and the latest TLI Loglan as well, I think) went a
little crazy here.  They have several sets of "pronouns" (scare quotes
because "noun" as such isn't really a Lojban concept).  The anaphora are
more or less as you say, although in Lojban they're a bit more flexible:
"ra" is "that thing I just mentioned", "ri" is "that thing I mentioned a
little further back", and "ru" is "that thing I mentioned a while ago".
There is also the "ta" set, which are demonstrative: "that person or thing";
the "da" set which is existential: "there exists a person or thing";
the "ko'a" set which are explicitly bound variables; a few standard
shortcuts like "mi" (I, me) and "do" (you); and the convention that any
single letter used as a pronoun is treated as a "ko'a" implicitly bound to
something that begins with that letter.  And all of these can take numeric
subscripts to further clarify: "That(1) contains that(2)".

In all of these sets, not only is there no gender-specificity, but
there are no pronouns that distinguish people and things.  "Ta barda"
means "That is large", and could mean a person, a dog, or a house.

"How many years has this gone on for? At least since 1980, when it had a
three times larger budget. Assuming an average annual budget of $500 million

A vested interest as in intentionally not attaining a fusion reaction?  No,
I dont think so.  In fact, Bussard started his own fusion project privately
funded by the Owner of Omni magazine and Hustler, he was making a small
tokamok reactor, had the expertise and the budgett, and just could not get
it to break even.  Was he just tricking everybody to keep himself employed?
I doubt it, as he, and most of these other scientists and engineers, are
pouring their hearts out to attempt to get this.  Is it reasonable to
suspect that all of them are involved in some kind of conspiracy to just
keep the fusion budget flowing?  I seriously doubt it, especially
considering that real and consistent progress is being made.  Maybe the real
fact is that containing plasmas is a difficult and tricky endevour.  Just
research the different plasma confinement designs, the spheromak, the
tokamak, and the bottle fusors.  Since the carter adminstration *any*
nuclear power related research has been scoffed at, and the fusion reactor
programs have had difficult maintaining ANY funding in the green / liberal
anti nuclear anything atmosphere.  And yes people can get fusion reactions
to occur in a desktop apparatus (farnsworths fusor) but attainting breakeven
is a whole different scenerio, as the conventional hot fusion researches can
attest to.  

I think you are over simplyfying a complex issue.

However, the field of research has been only limited to plasma hot fusion,
various other methods are not government funded, but you can think the
carter administration as much as the physicists in the field for that,
limiting nuclear related research to only one field whichever one physicists
thought most promising at that time.  

I would hotly disagree the accusation that physicists are intentionally
delaying acheiving a break even reaction merely to continue research, as
this would have to involve mutiply nations, governments, and not to mention
scores of private companies and individuals.  This is tantamount to saying
that nanotech researchers are delaying making an assembler so they can keep
the research money coming in.  If you want to know more about the politics
of fusion research pick up 'Man made sun, the quest for fusion power' and
enjoy.

To see the continuing progress, see this image

http://w3fusion.ph.utexas.edu/aps/plasmaState/ntvsT.gif

As you can see, over time, various methods are achieving longer confinement
times at higher and higher temperatures.

Since that particular set all begin with vowels, you can create a whole
series of new sets (like your "l" set) for specific purposes by adding
an initial consonant (or cluster): let's say that "ley/lem/leir" is for
the "gender" of disembodied AIs; perhaps "vey/vem/veir" could be for
physical sentient beings for which human gender doesn't apply; "th" is
for plurals; and the base ey/em/eir set is for totally unspecified cases.
The overlap with colloquial "'em" is precisely what I like best about
the set: because it echos existing usage it's easier to learn and use,
and allows constructs like "(th)ey", analagous to "rock(s)".  Of course,
signs at the spaceport will have monsters like "(l/v/z/d/b)ey".

It's 6 years old but I still find this theory of sonoluminescence interesting.
I hope this new cold fusion thing turns out to be valid but I'd give you
4 to one odds it's another dud; at least they announced the results in a
peer reviewed journal not a press conference.
================================

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 267  April 23, 1996    by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein

A NEW THEORY OF SONOLUMINESCENCE.

Sound energy, in the form of a beam of ultrasonic waves, can be partly
converted into light energy by aiming the sound at an air bubble in a
sample of water.  The sound causes the bubble to collapse  and to emit
sharp (less than 12 picosecond) light pulses.  The light's spectrum
implies that the source of the radiation is similar to a black-body
object  at a temperature of  tens of thousands of kelvins.

Theorists have tried to explain sonoluminescence by saying, for example,
that the radiation comes from a plasma formed by the collapse of the
bubble.  But mostly the mechanism behind the production of the pulses
remains a mystery.  Now Claudia Eberlein of Cambridge University
(cce20@phy.cam.ac.uk, 44-1223-337-458) offers a more daring explanation.
She believes the light is being emitted by the vacuum surrounding the bubble.

Modern quantum theory holds that unseeable virtual photons abound in
the vacuum.  The behavior of these "zero-point fluctuations" is influenced
by the properties of the surrounding medium. The rapidly moving air-water
interface (where two media different indices of  refraction come together)
may facilitate the conversion of virtual photons into real photons.

In fact, Eberlein says, sonoluminescence may represent the
first observable manifestation of quantum vacuum radiation.
This scenario can be compared to the "Unruh effect," a hypothetical
phenomenon in which photons are emitted by a mirror accelerating
through a vacuum.  "Hawking radiation," the hypothetical emission
of particles from black holes, is yet another example of energy
seemingly coming out of nowhere; at the black hole's Schwarzschild radius
(inside of which, light cannot escape), space  is so warped that energy
from the black hole can be converted into particle-antiparticle pairs;
one particle falls back into the hole while its partner escapes.

Eberlein asserts that researchers can put her theory to an experimental test
and compare the results to other models of sonoluminescence.
(Claudia Eberlein, upcoming article in Physical Review Letters.)

If an AI is capable of revolt (in the future), then it would be unethical to
design and enforce a master/slave relationship.

I admit, when it comes to ethical theories, I'm a new amateur at it so far,
so feel free to tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. I searched for
"slavery" in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy and found this
description of Rule Utilitarianism, which reasons to me that slavery is not
beneficial to society.

These products are similar to the products early Egyptian men and women 
used to enhance facial features and the body.  In civilizations around the 
world, people have tried to enhance and/or beautify themselves for 
political, social and sexual reasons. Historically, humans have been 
augmenting the skin with the use of dyes, tattoos, and piercing for mating, 
fertility, hunting, fighting, and religious rituals.  Just as the 
sociopolitical and socioeconomic tends have changed over the centuries, so 
have sociologic, socioculture and sociodrama trends.  Advertising is not a 
newly founded business to trick modern society.  Historically, civilization 
has been very innovative and clever about advertising ideas and selling 
products.

Inner beauty can be seen on the outside if one takes the time to look and 
to listen.  Our facial expressions cannot truly hide the mechanics of our 
minds. The vehicle we transport ourselves in (our bodies) reflects our 
level of self-esteem and attention to detail.
The brain is affected by negative input and output.  Each thought we have 
affects our minds, affecting our lives.  How many times do we meet a person 
who has peace of mind?  Not as often as we might think.

Hal  Finney mentioned in a separate thread that mental illness could be one 
circumstance that would result in the inability of humanity to reach 
extreme life extension.  I think mental illness (including emotional 
illness) is one of humanity most common illness today, more common than the 
cold.

Addressing INNER BEAUTY:  One element of Primo that addresses this is the 
metabrain's "error correction device" which would help an person or entity 
develop his/her/its (for lack of modern pronoun) response and reflex 
behavior in an appropriate manner because of the "replay and feedback 
system" incorporated in the "error correction device."  The "error-correct 
memory" would replay situations (both visual and audio) allowing for 
simulated responses.  Probably the best application for AI today would be 
to assist the human brain in dealing with emotional problems and rewiring 
repeated unhealthy behavior.

Stepping back from Primo's future and into our own hands, inner beauty is 
really about how we respond to the world around us.  What we choose to 
focus on and our moment-to-moment assessment of our environment.

1. Do a Self-Examination - Take a good look at what makes you feel good 
(intellectual and emotional satisfaction) and what causes disdain. Then you 
can take one concern and examine it in detail and make changes. Keep a 
journal write down your goals, developing a plan to achieve them and know 
the reasons why you have set them for yourself.

2. Take Control of Your Thoughts - Consider the consequences of positive 
approach to issues and a negative approach to issues.. If you continue to 
listen to negative self-talk then you are a volunteer for failure. Each 
time a negative, self-destructing thought enters your mind, acknowledge it, 
discern where it is coming from and then let go of it by saying "stop". 
Then follow-up with a self-empowering positive thought. Attitude is 
everything. Make a decision to have a positive and productive attitude 
everyday.

3.  Develop a Plan - Write down your plans and take the necessary steps to 
achieve your goals. Your goals may be small or large. You may want to begin 
with small goals. It's the small things you accomplish in the beginning 
that build confidence and pave the way for greater prosperity. You must 
follow-through on your plan. Take a "do it now" attitude. A plan with no 
action is worthless.

4.  Cultivate A Support System - Surround yourself with positive people. 
Discontinue relationships with people who criticize and are negative. You 
must make a conscious decision to disassociate with negative, narrow-minded 
people who rob you of your confidence.  When a negative person attempts to 
get in your way, do damage control by discovering yet another smart and 
worthwhile aspect of yourself.  Your support system of friends and 
colleagues will watch for your cue.

5.  Take Time for Yourself - Solitude is empowering. Solitude is an 
invisible place in your heart where you can listen to your imagination, 
your uniqueness and your essence. Bring balance into your life by starting 
each day with a routine that  puts you in touch with yourself.

Hm... marklar propose that all pronouns and anaphora be replaced with the
word "marklar".  Marklar transformation will greatly simplify the decision
of which pronoun marklar should use on a particular occasion.  Of course,
marklar may be harder to decode what the speaker means, but that's the
listener's lookout.  Only marklar's opinion about marklar should matter. 
Marklar "universal anaphora" proposal will replace the bewildering radiation
of pronouns and anaphora marklar currently dominate the language landscape,
and pure semantic cues should suffice to replace any lost cues formerly used
in syntactic reconstruction.

For example, the above paragraph would now read:

** Since marklar particular set all begin with vowels, marklar can create a
whole series of new sets (like marklar "l" set) for specific purposes by
adding an initial consonant (or cluster): let's say marklar
"marklar/marklar/marklar" is for the "gender" of disembodied AIs; perhaps
"marklar/marklar/marklar" could be for physical sentient beings for which
human gender doesn't apply; "mark" is for plurals; and the base lar/lar/lar
set is for totally unspecified cases.  The overlap with colloquial "'klar"
is precisely what I like best about the set: because marklar echoes existing
usage marklar's easier to learn and use, and allows construts like
"(ma)rklar", analogous to "roc(ks)".  Of course, signs at the spaceport will
have monsters like "(m/m/m/m/m)arklar". **

Isn't marklar easier to understand?  Marklar'll get used to marklar quickly,
and then marklar can use marklar whenever marklar need to.

If marklar works, we can move on to replacing all marklars with marklar,
thus simplifying all marklars.  Of course, contextual marklars would have to
be used to figure out the real marklar underlying any given marklar.

Art and the human body have been intertwined since the Paleolithic times, 
some 750,000 years ago.  While in the early stages of commercially 
petitioned paintings, sculpture and music, the human body was most exposed 
in painting in commissions for religious buildings.  However much earlier, 
Greeks and Egyptians expressly enamored their arts with the human body, as 
recognized in the edification of the human body in sculpture and varied decor.

In Modern Art, there have been hundreds of genres which theme has been the 
coalescing of art and the human body.  In fact, it is the human body that 
has been the pivotal symbolic gesture for the arts.  Even in music, the 
body has been used as the link for bringing sound to movement.  What is 
dance without the human body?

Explicitly, in Modern Art, the genres of "Body Art", "Performance Art", 
etc., the artwork is specifically and directly related to the human body.

My suggestion is to read the Transhumanist Arts Website if you would like 
to know more about art history and its relationship to Primo.  Or, pick up 
some books on Performance Art and read about the artwork of Stelarc, Laurie 
Anderson, Vito Acconci and myself.  If you pick up any art history book, 
just flip through the pages and you will see where the human body is the 
most used structure or element in all of civilization to be depicted or 
referenced.

Now, if you would like to know how "Primo" fits into the scheme of things 
in the art world, multi-track the relationship between arts and society. 
The purpose of the arts has been to communicate.  Artists are 
communicators.  We communicate ideas developed and arranged from individual 
insight about world around us.  The way we communicate ideas is expressed 
in which ever art form or style (context) we choose and which we think best 
reflects or expresses the content.

Today, in the early 21st century, the most immediate, the most noteworthy, 
the most fascinating issues and circumstances are the evolution of the 
human in its merging with machines and the implications of AI and SI, 
biotechnology, superlongevity, etc.  These issues become the core values, 
the themes, of Art.  "Primo" as Michael Rose says, is the at the center of 
the next massive ideological shift in society.

Art isn't just about depicting beauty in life, it is about expressing 
ideas.  Art is a barometer of society and culture.

Actually the original experiment was done at Oak Ridge as well.  If there
really was a conspiracy like this then presumably they would not have
allowed their researchers to pursue this activity.  It was only after the
failure to replicate the results, using more sensitive neutron detection
equipment, that Oak Ridge tried to get Science to delay publication.

It is indeed moving quite fast.  There are projects underway
to combine the double & triple junction GaAs panels with
thermophotovoltaics to push the efficiency over 40%.  Not
so long ago if you asserted you could get the efficiency
that high you would have been laughed at.  To continue the
trend they are going to have to figure out a way to use the
UV photons effectively instead of throwing them away.

Lots of room to go in making them lighter as well.

                       A Year in Provence
                           Peter Mayle
                       ISBN 0-679-73114-8
                           U.S. $12.00

This is the first in a series of what are now four travel books by
Peter Mayle. You may remember me mentioning book four "French
Lessons" yesterday.

Extropian significance? I remember reading someone say once that 
"there are people who want to live forever, but don't know what to
do on a rainy Sunday afternoon." I don't intend on being such a
person, and suspect most here don't.

This is Mayle's story about buying a 200 year old french farmhouse
in Provence, and moving there with his wife and two dogs, and a
year in their life.

I bought it yesterday, and am already halfway through. Think of it
as a 200 page vacation.

I've already ordered books 2 and 3 and pick them up tonight. 

I have a sudden urge for a glass of Calvados.

Are you sure about that? I work at ORNL and I don't remember hearing
anything about that. A search of www.ornl.gov for sonoluminescence
found no hits, but googling it gave a reference to LLNL:

If you make it too complex, the target audience - non-sophisticated
people who have open minds - will shrug and pass on to the next
distraction.  The primary reason for creating this game is not the game
itself, but memetics.  Therefore, if we can find simple ways to
incorporate ideas about the future (for instance, uploads and similar
tricks == no more absolute robots vs. humans distinction), it may be a
good addition - but too much complexity in game implementation is,
itself, reason enough to reject a given idea for this particular game.

Or, in short: eyes on the prize.

Ah, no.  You're misreading things...but perhaps, if I explain, we can
find a clearer way of stating these concepts.  (I.e., that you read it
as "perfect bans are possible" is a bug, just like in programming.)

Technology cards, when played, represent the *commercialization* (or
other widespread deployment) of technology.  The actual, mere
development of a technology is a non-event as far as this game is
concerned; when a tech card is played is when the tech starts
affecting Joe Q. Public.  Likewise, bans - though not perfect - do
remove a technology from most peoples' lives, though the factories et
al to produce the banned tech can be mothballed...or, at least, the
information about how to set up said factories is still floating around.
Either way, once it has been deployed, it can and will be redeployed
once the laws against it are removed.

For example: cloning is in the media right now.  But, can an average
person purchase a clone at the moment?  No way.  Therefore, the Cloning
card has not yet been played.  Now, this might be a candidate for an
Event - which cannot be undone, and which can slightly change the rules
of the game.  Which is why I set up said category.

Umm...it's a nice idea, but I fail to see how this implementation adds
to the goal of the game.  (See above.)

Prerequisites are already explicitly allowed for.  Adding in the profit
motive taints the meme with "tech is developed so the rich get richer",
not "tech is developed to make the world a better place".  While they
are both true, it is better to promote only the former meme, not the
latter.

I am, however, thinking of putting in an optional other action: Forfeit.
"Your group needs to develop new technologies to stay relevant to the
world.  If it sleeps, it dies...and you lose the game automatically."

The point is that the knowledge itself, and the world's possession of
it, *is* the risk.  And the promise.  The two are the same.

Problem: what is a disaster for some may be heaven for others.  The
world will not end if, say, America becomes a police state under martial
law, even if it would suck.  The world would recover from such a state
within (current) human lifespans.

That's a good idea.  Makes the game a bit less predictable, thus adds
more risk to playing brinksmanship with the Catastrophes.  I'll add it.

Points and dependancies will probably be balanced once we have a good
set of cards.  I've added in the non-social ones (though, for instance,
"Space Habitat" seems more like an event: once you get a bunch of people
living in orbit, trying to ban it would probably have no effect).

And all of these external beautification methods are all proven working
techniques for those reasons listed. It's the end-goal for these
justifications that are the issue. For example, if I currently have a sexual
mate, how much resource should I continue to invest in my sexual (external)
beauty? If I decide a little or a lot, it affects whether my sexual mate
continues to contribute to the sexual relationship system or not. What I'm
trying to say in a roundabout way is that receiving positive feedback
resulting from the efforts of achieving your external beauty state is to be
expected, since positive feedback or action is the purpose. Lamenting over
not having your inner beauty acknowledged in the same way is a different
issue, since the broadcast or communication of inner beauty requires much
different techniques than that of external beauty.

I posted a message recently about what I thought (external) beauty would be
like in a transhuman or posthuman view, but no-one responded. Oh well. In
short, I predicted that the most (externally) beautiful people will be naked
humans - obvious, I know - where nakedness implies no visible or perceived
external enhancements to the body. This includes cybernetic devices,
enhancement technology. I would even go further and say that even jewelry,
piercings, makeup, etc. will become out of vogue. A natural human would be
most beautiful to a posthuman.

That's a bold statement, even though I mostly agree with it. What's
important is that the individual has control over whether to expose their
inner workings or not. It is possible to "persuade" someone to expose
themselves against their concious will. And people who have great control
over their perceived behaviour are actors, and there are many techniques
that can be used to be a skillful actor.

This is why actors are celebrities. They understand this, though not
necessarily at a concious level. I think that when an understanding leaves
the concious level where one can fluently describe it, it then goes into the
realm of "art".

Not only today, but in history as well. Probably also in the future. But I
guess I am talking about a wider spectrum of illness, which includes non
life-threatening illnesses such as negative input/output as you already
commented on.

I agree, except for the "best application" qualifier. There is a symbiotic
relationship between the mind and the body. I would even consider them the
same entity. I think the best applications for AI today would be to assist
both the human mind and the human body or physique. In other words, both
inner (mind) beauty, and outer (body) beauty.

Good brief pragmatic advice for enhancing both the inner and outer self. I
would not downplay the importance of the outer beauty, since it has a
significant symbiotic relationship with our inner beauty as well. And, dare
I say it risking being accused of anthropomorphism, this advice could
probably be well taken by a robot/AI as well.

I am getting pretty tired of seeing this idea brought up.
Face it, there are only two possibilities:  either a nuclear process
is producing the excess heat, or (due to sloppy measurements)
there is no excess heat.  Excess heat of the magnitude that Pons and
Fleischmann are claiming *cannot be due to a chemical reaction.*

To quote Pons:  "Heat is the primary evidence that it's nuclear.  If you
take all possible hydrogen in the reaction and burn it (a chemical
reaction), you get two watts per cubic centimeter; we get 20 times that
much energy."

Essentially this comment has come up in a few postings regarding F & P. It
reflects a concentration on purely American patent law. In most of the rest
of the World, publication of any sort prior to the filing of the patent
automatically invalidates the patent. A number of US companies have been badly
burned by this - I imagine U of U just don't want to add their names 
to the list

Well, of course, time will tell.  My personal opinion is that P&F
don't know what's going on, in a fundamental sense.  They have observed
an apparently inexplicable phenomenon, but at this point they can't really
explain it.  In fact, they can't always even reproduce it.

Now patent applications can be for

         1) A novel composition of matter, or

         2) A new process or way of doing things.

If they don't yet know what's going on completely, they can't completely
specify a composition of matter *or* a new process, completely
enough so that it can be reproduced by "one skilled in the art."

In other words, I suspect they are still in the early phases of trying
to spell out *exactly* how to produce excess head from their system,
what the important parameters of this process are, and possible extensions
such as other metals, etc.  And until they can, they are wise to keep their
mouths shut, less they give somebody else a leg up in what could be
the most lucrative patent ever granted.  What would you do, lip?

---- Repeat offer  ----

In response to your article <24528@mordor.s1.gov>  comparing P&F to
Lamarck, Kammerer, Lysenko. I offered in article <643@bnr-fos.UUCP> to let
you bet "on a sure thing". The offer still stands.
The highlights of the offer:
  - If P&F are wrong or cheated, you win minimum of five to one.
  - If P&F cheated, you win ten to one.

Since you are so sure that CNF cannot be happening, I have no idea why
you are not jumping at this chance. Just think, you can be as famous
as Nathan Lewis by being the first man to *publicly* bet against P&F. :-)

----- End of offer ---

Incidentally, for those people interested, I have received no bets
at all. To those who have sent encouraging mail, thank you.

This shows a very biased view point. You go through your calculations
in particle physics and say it can't be fusion. But calculation of
chemical energies show the heat cannot be or chemical or crystaline
phase transitions. Are you saying your view of particle physics totally
overrides the chemical views?

Given the current state of affairs:
   1) There is heat being observed by multiple groups.
   2) Some of the groups observing heat have given detailed
      description of their experiments. Consensus appears to
      be that the heat is real. No simple "killer-defect" here.
   3) Some groups have observed T to be increasing over time.
   4) The people who did the T measerments know what they are
      doing. The magnitude of T is too large to be contemination.
   5) Various control experiments with different setups give
      very confused signals as to what is going on.
   6) Many groups cannot duplicate either heat or T.

The conclusions that I class as *unreasonable* are:
   1) Many otherwise competent groups have screwed up in their
      respective specialty.
   2) Many otherwise "straight" people are participating in a
      gigiantic hoax.
   3) Many independent groups are "deluded" into "believing".
      Remember, canels on Mars are seen by human eyes whereas
      heat is measured by thermometer.
   4) The "believers" have enough "psychic" infleuence to make
      the thermometers and counters read the desired results.

Other conclusions that I class as *unlikely*:
   1) Conservation of energy is broken.
   2) Spontaneous conversion of matter into energy.
   3) New conservation law that favors some reaction branches.

This leaves me with the only *reasonable* conclusion:
   Nuclear fusion is happening, but with some unknown mechanism
   to suppress N, or change branching ratio, or ...

Assuming something unknown is happening, why should I assume that
it is chemical when there are some many more possibilities in
Quantum mechanics, QED, etc.?

As I understand it, there is also "very well-established" theory that
says the heat is not chemical in origin. If anything, these theories
are better established and more throughly studied.

         liquid scintillators with pulse-shape discrimination.  The
         neutron signal seen in a counter near the cell turns on and
         off with the cell current, while a counter remote from the
         cell shows nothing. They see a signal of about 50 neutrons per
         hour lasting for about 3 hours, before it turns off. There is
         some evidence that the energy is 2.5 MeV, but the energy
         resolution is poor. Overall, it's a 7 sigma effect."
1.2.3 Tanihasi. Korea
         Pd electrodes were loaded to a D/Pd ratio of 0.8 +/- 0.1.
         The neutron spectra with D2O and H2O were the same after
         20 hours.
1.2.4 Broer, AT&T Bell Labs, USA
         Electrolytic cells with 3 different Pd cathodes. The cells
         were in a large box with Pb and borax walls and then scintillators
         to veto cosmic ray muons. Neutrons were slowed in polyethylene
         round the cells and the gamma rays produced measured by capture
         by protons (2.24 MeV) and by 23Na and 127I which give gammas in
         the range 3.5 to 7 MeV in the NaI and is the more sensitive.
         After 4 weeks they obtained a limit of < 0.007 n/sec/g Pd which
         corresponds to <2.2 E-24 fusions/dd pair/sec which is less than
         the Jones et al. value for titanium.
1.2.5 Emmoth, Sweden
         Used a BF3 counter close to an electrolytic cell with Pd and
         Pt electrodes. The efficiency was 0.1%. Most of their runs
         gave no effect, but they showed two plots where there were
         2 or 3 peaks whose existence did not seem to be correlated
         with any other activity. They got up to 240 n/s. They were
         aware of moisture and vibration effects on their BF3 counter.
         They seem to have done no checks such as running with H2O.
1.2.6 Ewing, Sandia National Lab, USA
         Reported no neutrons giving a limit of < 100 n/ hour using

         Results: Signal of 300+/- 60 (5 std dev) above background.
         [More info available.] [Submitted by Steve Koonin]
1.3.4 Blencoe, ORNL, USA
         This was a null result in a Frascati-like experiment.
1.3.5 Magni, ENFA CASACCIA, Italy
         A sponge of titanium is loaded with D2, cooled and then pumped.
         A small peak of neutrons was observed after about 700 minutes.
1.3.6 Massoni, Italy
         Blades of Ti, 0.5 mm thick, heated very quickly (20 sec.) to
         1000 degrees C., add D2 and cool to 500 degrees. The BF3
         counters were inside shielding. Bursts of neutrons were
         observed when the conditions were changed.
1.3.7 Furth, Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, USA
         Used BF3 counters and found their background counting rate
         was highly variable from 5 to 30 counts/hour. With Pd cathodes
         and with gas-loaded Ti turnings, no neutrons were observed at a
         level of 1 n/s for both the d-d and p-d reactions, which is
         not lower than Jones et al.
1.3.8 Ellegaard, Neils Bohr Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark
         Used 10 rods of Pd with 500 mA current and 3 litre NE213
         detector surrounding the cells and also Ti loaded with D2
         gas under pressure and heated to 500 degrees and cooled
         to liquid nitrogen temperature then warmed to room temp.
         No neutrons were found.
1.3.9 Hill, Iowa State University, Iowa, USA
         Reported no neutrons from cells with a Pd cathode at a
         lower rate than F&P. With Ti loaded with D2 gas absorbed
         at 110 degrees and up to 660 psia where the achieved a
         maximum loading of D/Ti of 1.9 (this is possible with
         Ti not Pd) no neutrons were observed above a counting
         rate of 6.5  counts per 10 min.
1.3.10 Fernandez, National Institute for Nuclear Reasearch, Mexico

         Charged electrodes, one of steel and the other of titanium
         and magnesium, in an atmosphere of enriched deuterium. "A
         considerable number of neutrons per second" were produced.
1.4 Other CNF Experiments
1.4.1 Paneth/Peters, 1926
         Towards the end of the paper they say that they were looking for
         gamma radiation, but could not detect any with their electroscopes.

         In a paper published in Berichte d. Dt. chem. Ges. vol. 60B,
         p. 808 (1927), Fritz Paneth, Kurt Peters and Paul Guenther
         described the repetition of the experiment in the Baker
         laboratory in Cornell University (NY). The outcome of this
         work is that they had underestimated the effects of some of the
         error sources. Among other things, they found that their palladium
         asbestos probably contained some helium.

         In papers in die Naturwissenschaften (vol. 15, p. 379 (1927))
         and Nature (vol. 119, p. 706-707 (1927)) Fritz Paneth declares
         the results to be false. Quotation from Chemical Abstracts:
         "The recently announced results on transmutation of H to He
         proved on further investigation to be false. Glass and asbestos,
         which do not give off He in the presence of O_2 or in vacuo,
         yield quantities of He of the order of 10^-9 cm^3 on heating
         in a H_2 atm. One day's standing in contact with air is
         sufficient to cause this adsorption."
1.4.2 Tandberg, 1927
         Electrolytic saturation of a Pd wire with D, followed by
         exploding wire ignition. Null result - radioactive particles.
1.4.3 Kondo, University of Tokyo/RIKEN, Japan
         Used a muon beam to measure the rate of neutron production from
         muon absorption in electrolysed Pd.  The rate was about 0.12
         neutrons per muon, not 300.  They pointed out that there are
         many problems with trying to use muon-catalyzed fusion to
         obtain Jones level neutron production.  The main problems
         are that muons are primarily captured on Pd initially and
         after inducing a fusion, and that fusion is not rapidly
         induced even after capture on deuterium because the equilibrium
         spacing between D's is so large.
1.4.4 Myers, Sandia National Laboratory, USA
         After the beam was turned off, no significant rate of
         fusion was observed despite the loading being much higher
         than can be obtained by electrolytic or gas pressure methods.
         An upper limit of 2 E-22 fusions/dd pair/sec was estimated.
         Ti and Zr were also tried with null results.
1.4.5 Mueller, LANL, USA
        A small instantaneous pulse
         was observed. The authors conclude that less than 1 E4 neutrons
         were generated.
1.4.6 Gaudreau, MIT, USA
         Passed 80 KeV/c muons into Pd and Ti targets at a rate of
         1000 muons/sec/cm2. The authors are still interpreting the
         results but indicate no dramatic effects were observed.
1.4.7 Nagamine, KEK, Japan
         Passed muons into Pd samples loaded to a ratio of D/Pd = 0.6,
         and unloaded. They observed no differences. They deduced a
         neutron production rate of < 0.012 n per muon. It was concluded
         that the rate of producing neutrons from cosmic ray muons
         was < 1.3 E-6 per sec.
1.4.8 Unknown, Colorado School of Mines, Colorado, USA
         Implanted D ions of 95 KeV in 1.5 micron thick foils of Pd
         giving D/Pd ratios of 1.0 or above. No significant effect
         was found giving a limit of < 0.2 n/dd pair/sec or
         < 5E-10 Watts/cm3 of Pd.

If the only way a particular individual can accept extropy/transhumanism
is through a religious framework or dogma, then it is our responsibility
to offer such. For instance, I could easily rewrite the entire Bible
from the viewpoint that 'God' is a nanotechnological civilization of the
'crypto-dirt' variety we've discussed of late. Presenting our ideas as a
necessary scientific framework for a christian's preexisting faith to be
plausible would be a worthwhile feat of memetic engineering.

I think that there are likely at least several technological ways to
achieve over unity sustainable fusion reactions. The government is ONLY
interested in discovering those methods which require large billion
dollar budgets, spent by highly trained individuals, at big government
owned facilities, and under the control of government bureaucracies.

Figuring out a way for the human race to free itself from the current
geopolitical system is directly in opposition to the self interest of
any government agency. Discovering a way that joe and judy sixpack can
take care of their energy needs without uncle sugar butting in and
controlling, taxing, or siphoning it in some way threatens the stability
of the current statist system.

I don't doubt that government scientists truly want to discover and
harness sustainable fusion with all their hearts and souls. Finding it
first is the key to the future of humankind.

This says it all right there. The point is, that any efforts which are
government funded are ultimately under the control of the government.
Any projects which are not government funded which do prove successful
will be downplayed and discredited by the government.

Well, Malkevitch, mun guess mun could use "marklar" for marklar,
"Malkevitch" for proper marklar, and "mun" for marklar.  If mun can figure
out where all three marklar come from, mun win a bonus marklar.

PS:  Hey, mun is great.  In the marklar above, "Marklar!" could mean either

Clearly mun conveys much more marklar in a compressed marklar.

All the articles say the principle investigator, Rusi P. Taleyarkhan,
is at ORNL.  Also the (failed) attempt at replication by different Oak
Ridge researchers involved using the same equipment but bringing in a
different radiation detector, as described in the PDF articles linked
from http://www.eurekalert.org/static.php?view=taleyarkhan.  So I assume
from this that the actual experiment was at Oak Ridge as well.

OK. But if you do not create a game that is playable and fun, it won't
matter what memes you try to spread through it. 

I would love to have a very clean game that manages to convey core
transhuman ideas.

I think it is actually a bad thing. First, it spreads an erroneous image
of how technology is developed (technology is built because somebody
somewhere decided mankind should have it, with no links to economics,
culture or happenstance, so technology can simply be regulated by
controlling that guy), and this image is already doing a lot of damage
to the transhuman project (for example political attempts at
relinquishment). The altruist model of tech development is even worse,
since it so easily borrows itself to centralism and utilitarian
projects. Both are dangerous oversimplifications, missing the true
complex mixture of motivators of development - people develop
technology both due to altruism, profit, out of curiosity and random
ideas, as shaped by the surrounding society. 

Having a competition element is good for motivating people; the trick is
to make the game a complex mixture of cooperation and competition.

Remember the goal. If you claim this, then many players will realize
that the sure way of winning the game is not to play the game. What are
the benefits of the technologies? To the player there are none in the
current form, just an increase of abstract numbers. Even a "Clinical
Immortality" card doesn't cut it as a motivator, since it would maybe be
a motivator for the humans in the game world, but does not per se mean
much for the player. The singularity is just the end, and has no other
meaning. Instead of promoting progress the message seems to be that
increasing these technologies increases risk, and the singularity is
just someone winning. That doesn't seem very extropian to me.

Perhaps a better way of handling it would have a "tolerance" level for
the different points. It represents how much the world can handle, what
institutions can deal with issues and how much people have adapted to
it. The points must remain below the tolerance for the world to work;
tolerance is increased using either safety technologies or perhaps
direct payment of money (representing the building of institutions). To
reach singularity the world needs to adapt. This seems to be closer to
the memetic goal of the game and transhumanism.

The biotech gray goo scenario of Greg Bear's _Blood Music_ seems rather
nice from my point of view - does this mean that we should regard the
Bio/Nano disaster in the game as similarly relative? I think it is
important not to isolate the game from social reality. If it is intended
to convey a transhumanist point of view it better demonstrate that
technology alone isn't enough, we better make sure our culture isn't
turned into something nasty as we advance.

Jeff, I'd tend to agree with Amara.  It isn't that "cold fusion"
is "impossible".  Its a question as to whether there are "cold"
methods of focusing the acceleration of molecules, atoms or
ions that can overcome the repulsion of the electrons
(in molecules/atoms) or protons (in ions).  If there are
methods of accelerating/directing the entities involved
such that they overcome their repulsive tendencies, then
"fusion" is possible.  The next question becomes whether
the energy expended to accelerate/direct such entitites
is less than that which can be harvested from a fusion
reaction.

Note that there are two places to improve the efficiency:
a) decreased energy requirements to drive the entities towards fusion.
b) increased efficiency in harvesting the energy generated by fusion.

I don't know of a "proof" that we have reached the limits
on either of these vectors.

Of course the CW is that a room temperature reactor cannot
generate the energies to overcome the repulsions one expects.
However there may always be novel phenomena in which one has
to ask whether or not conditions that might overcome the repulsions
may be generated.

Supposedly, the Farnsworth fusor is in production by Daimler-Chrysler, for 
neutron activation for materials testing and explosives detectors. I have 
not been able to get a good link to this, though.

There are several web sites that discuss homemade fusors, some of which are 
capable of dangerous levels of neutron flux. Google "fusor" or "Farnsworth 
fusor" - "fusor" alone turns up links to automotive two-part body 
adhesives, too...

I'm sorry Amara, but this by itself is bad advice.  In the late 1980's
I visited Srinagar in Kashmir and actually walked across the land
border crossing between Amritsar in India and Lahore in Pakistan.

I *would not* attempt a similar trip in the current political climate.
All advice should be given relative to specific environmental
and political hazards.  I would not visit Angor Wat at this time
for these reasons.  Instead I would choose to visit Manchu Pucchu.

To advise Brian to "boldly explore" the European frontier begs
the issue of how "safe" it is to do so.  I haven't noticed
bike lanes on many inter-euro city routes of late (in contrast
to Seattle which has well defined bike lanes on some streets).

Far better to put your bike on the train and take the train
between cities or avoid the bike entirely and stick to trains
for intercity transport and feet for within city transport.

I understand the perspective of "feeling" the culture, the question
becomes how to do so most safely?

I don't think one needs a conspiracy to say there might be things
holding back research.  In this particular case, it might not apply, but
special interests do influence how science is done.  In the case of big
projects, there are only so many things that can be done with the
funding and a small number of people are going to divide up the grants
and facilities.  Unlike Mike, I don't see this as damning the DoE's
fusion research funding per se.  However, it could mean turf wars and
personal conflicts get in the way.  This, however, can happen in private
labs.  (Empirically, it's hard to tell, since most big science
experiments are done with some degree of government funding
[inclusive-]or oversight.  Theoretically, though, government funding of
science should lead to all sorts of inefficiencies...  These are not
because of conspiracies but because certain institutional settings make
some outcomes more likely and some processes less efficient if not
unworkable.)

Nor is it accurate to describe sonoluminscence as 'cold' fusion, since
it is clear that the locations where it is occuring, it is certainly
rather hot. Calling sonoluminescence a 'cold' form of fusion means that
all stars are cold fusion generators...

Agreed.  I see this as one of the primary possible applications of the even 
pre-AI technology such as the "augmented reality" concept.  I envision a 
system which tracks the behavior of ourselves and others and the 
circumstances in our lives and gives us advice from the best of Asian 
martial spiritual philosophy and other sources on dealing with these 
circumstances and people.  I call this the ARMS - Augmented Reality 
Management System.  AI would make it much better of course because AI would 
likely have the conceptual processing to understand the nuances of human 
interaction.

Agree that attitude is important.  I believe in what I call the "Five 
Essentials": Philosophy, Attitude, Knowledge, Skills, and 
Technology.  Without those five, you cannot survive.  The first is the 
correct philosophy, the second is the correct attitude (which derives from 
the first).  With these, one can acquire Knowledge, Skills, and 
Technology.  The Five Essentials allow you to obtain wealth and 
allies.  They in turn allow you to obtain more of the Five Essentials.  The 
Five Essentials are self-reinforcing but are prioritized as listed.

There is a concept called "Three Steps, No Fail".  You decide on three 
actions which are so small that there is no possibility than you can fail 
to accomplish them within one week.  You do those.  They in turn will 
suggest the next three, and so on, until suddenly - Wallah! - one has 
achieved one's goal.  Now if I could just figure out three small things I 
can't fail at - I'm VERY good at failing at EVEN small things! :-}

Problem with this one is it depends on how out of kilter you are with the 
people around you in terms of your values and purposes.  I am a 
Transhumanist - yet even on this list I find an amazing number of people 
who are negative about things I believe in.

Solitude can also be a prison.  Or - as I know well - even a prison can 
bring solitude.  I spent two years in "The Hole" in Leavenworth USP - which 
is not really solitude (it's noisy as hell for one thing) - but it was 
there that I firmed up my theories of Transhumanism.  But it was the 
enforced solitude of being "too different" for many years that confined me 
to my room, prevented me from achieving anything, and resulted in the loss 
of eight years of my life to the State.  (But I don't complain - I'm here 
now.  As Richard Marcinko, the ex-SEAL said,. "Doom on you.  I will be back 
- and I will not fail.")

We can only pump so many memes into a single simple game.  Perhaps
another one can speak to the realities of tech deployment.

Hmm.   Perhaps if we pump up the random element?  That is, when it is
the world's turn to play, play as many cards as there are players.  You
can pass on your turn if you want, shuffling your hand into the deck and
drawing a new hand...but the world will continue apace.  You can either
enjoy the ride, or try to steer it towards your goal.  For any given
technology or event, you may be given the opportunity to put it into
play...but if you don't, someone else eventually will.

The problem here would seem to be that it gives too much of a chance
of world-caused Singularity or Catastrophe, which means a good chance
that no one can win.

Actually...re-read the conditions.  When you have X points on average, Y
points will put you over the edge.  When you have X*2 points, you need
Y*2 points.  And any single card has the same value.  Thus, deploying
new tech increases the tolerance, on average.

And as for "not to play", i.e. pass each turn - that's taking a gamble
that the world will not self-destruct from its own plays.  Plus, check
the scoring: Singularity - everyone wins, with someone perhaps winning a
bit more; Catastrophe - everyone loses equally.

So why not just do pure tolerance (at least, as pure as you can get)
*and* supress all new technologies?  This seems to be just the same
abstract numbers you were objecting to.

No, because the biotech gray goo you refer to is not the one I'm
referring to.  Perhaps I should specify "mindless gray goo".

Again, define "something nasty".  For any given permutation, some of the
audience will be predisposed to think it's actually a *good* thing...so
better to just avoid that topic entirely, no?

That's why one of my favorite singers is Kate Bush - an excellent modern 
dancer as well.  You don't get the full benefit of her music unless you see 
her music videos in which she dances.

As an aside, Kim Polese of Marimba practices jazz dance and has stated how 
important it is in her life and her work because of the requirement of 
expressiveness.

Also, my favorite actress, Jodie Foster, has said that acting is not about 
intellectualism (despite her capacity for that) but about physical and 
emotional expression.

I'm not much of an art enthusiast except in two respects - I like comic 
books, and I like fantasy art such as Boris Vallejo and the like.  In both 
forms of art, which are essentially modern forms of the old mythic tales, 
the focus is on the Transhuman (technologically or otherwise).  And in both 
forms, the essence of the art is *intensity* - the art is *striking* - it 
has *impact*.  That is the hallmark of all good actors as well - their 
*intensity* of expression.  Pallid, purposeless art does not interest 
me.  I use art (music, movies, comics, whatever) to inspire me and to 
strengthen my conviction that a better world and a better life are 
*possible* (if it seems on a daily basis highly improbable).

One Lifetime Is Not Enough for a Trip to Distant Stars

By NATALIE ANGIER


< http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/05/science/space/05TRAV.html >

Nobody knows why our early ancestors decided to get off their knuckles 
and stand upright. Maybe they just wanted a better view of the stars.

And when sky gazers finally realized that the heavenly lights were not 
the footprints of the gods, but rather millions of blazing stars like our 
Sun writ far, they began to wonder, How do we get there? How can we leave 
this world and travel, not merely the 238,000 miles to the Moon, or 35 
million miles to Mars, but through the vast dark silk of interstellar 
space, across trillions and trillions of miles, to encounter other stars, 
other solar systems, even other civilizations?

According to a group of scientists for whom the term "wildly optimistic 
dreamers" is virtually a job description, it will indeed be very 
difficult to travel to other stars, and nobody in either the public or 
private sector is about to try it any time soon. But as the researchers 
see it, the challenge is not insurmountable, it requires no defiance of 
the laws of physics, so why not have fun and start thinking about it now?

At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science, held last month in Boston, scientists discussed how humans might 
pull off a real-life version of "Star Trek," minus the space Lycra and 
perpetual syndication rights.

They talked about propulsion at a reasonable fraction of the speed of 
light, a velocity that is orders of magnitude greater than any space ship 
can fly today, but that would be necessary if the light-years of space 
between the Sun and even the nearest star are ever to be crossed.

They talked about the possibility of multigenerational space travel, and 
what it might be like for people who board a space ship knowing that 
they, their children, grandchildren and descendants through 6, 8 or 10 
generations would live and die knowing nothing but life in an enclosed 
and entirely artificial environment, hurtling year upon year through the 
near-featureless expanse of interstellar space.

They talked about how big the founding crew would have to be to prevent 
long-term risks of inbreeding and so-called genetic drift. They talked 
about how the crew's chain of command would be structured, what language 
people would most likely speak, and what sort of marital and family 
policies might be put in place.

And they talked about food, all of which would have to be grown, 
cultivated and synthesized on board.

"One thing is almost certain," said Dr. Jean B. Hunter, an associate 
professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell. "You'll 
have to leave the steak, cheesecake and artichokes with hollandaise sauce 
behind."

Many of the subjects raised during the session were so fanciful that at 
times it felt like a discussion of how to clone a unicorn, and indeed 
half the presenters moonlight as science fiction writers.

Nevertheless, the researchers argued, human beings have shown themselves 
to be implacable itinerants, capable of colonizing the most hostile 
environments.

Dr. John H. Moore, a research professor of anthropology at the University 
of Florida, compared a theoretical crew of spacefaring pioneers to groups 
of Polynesians setting out tens of thousands of years ago in search of 
new islands to populate.

"Young people with food and tools would set out in large flotillas of 
canoes," he said. "Nobody knew if they would ever come back, the trade 
winds went in only one direction, and many of them perished in the ocean."

Yet over time, the Polynesians managed to colonize New Zealand, Easter 
Island and Hawaii.

Still, no human migration in history would compare in difficulty with 
reaching another star. The nearest, Alpha Centauri, is about 4.4 light- 
years from the Sun, and a light-year is equal to almost six trillion 
miles. The next nearest star, Sirius, is 8.7 light-years from home. To 
give a graphic sense of what these distances mean, Dr. Geoffrey A. Landis 
of the NASA John Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, pointed out that the 
fastest objects humans have ever dispatched into space are the Voyager 
interplanetary probes, which travel at about 9.3 miles per second.

"If a caveman had launched one of those during the last ice age, 11,000 
years ago," Dr. Landis said, "it would now be only a fifth of the way 
toward the nearest star."

Dr. Robert L. Forward, owner and chief scientist of Forward Unlimited, a 
consulting company that describes itself as "specializing in exotic 
physics and advanced space propulsion," argued that rockets and their 
fuel would be so heavy that they would prevent a starship from reaching 
the necessary velocity to go anywhere in a sane amount of time. He 
envisions a rocketless spacecraft that would be manufactured in space and 
equipped with an ultrathin, ultralarge sail, its span as big as Texas but 
using no more material than a small bridge. A beam of laser light or 
high-energy particles from a source on Earth, in space or perhaps on the 
Sun- drenched planet of Mercury would be aimed at the sail, propelling it 
and its attached module to as much as 30 percent the speed of light - or 
about 55,000 miles per second.

At that pace, said Dr. Forward, a crew would reach Alpha Centauri in 
under 50 years.

"You could get a bunch of 16-year- olds, train them and then send them 
out at the age of 20," he said. "They'd have a long, boring trip, reach 
Alpha Centauri when they're in their 60's or 70's, do some exploring, and 
send everything they learned back home."

Admittedly, the astronauts would not make it home themselves. "It's a 
lifetime job," Dr. Forward said. "But it could be done in a single 
generation."

For longer journeys, designed with multigenerational crews in mind, an 
onboard engine and fuel source would be required, perhaps something 
powered by nuclear bombs, or the combining of matter and antimatter in a 
reaction that converts both substances into pure energy.

However the ship is propulsed, the researchers agree that it must be 
comfortable for long-distance travel. That means creating artificial 
gravity by gently rotating the craft; a spin no greater than one or two 
revolutions per minute would suffice.

It might also mean calling upon architects with Disney-esque 
sensibilities.

"The inside of one of these long- duration space habitats might feel like 
the inside of a shopping mall," Dr. Landis said. "Malls are carefully 
designed to use space efficiently, yet to give you the feeling that 
they're more spacious than they are."

And malls, of course, are a great place to bring the family. In Dr. 
Moore's view, the good old-fashioned family is the key to success in 
space.

"Over the past several decades, space scientists and writers of science 
fiction have speculated at length about the optimum size and composition" 
of an interstellar crew, he said. They have imagined platoons of Chuck 
Yeager-type stalwarts grimly enduring all hardships, or teams of bionic 
and vaguely asexual crew members overseeing freezers of embryos that can 
be defrosted and gestated as needed.

"Some of the scenarios proposed so far are downright alarming from a 
social science perspective," Dr. Moore said, "since they require bizarre 
social structures and an intensity of social relationships which are 
quite beyond the experience of any known human communities."

In deciding how to organize a star mission, Dr. Moore looks to the most 
"familiar, ubiquitous, well-ordered and well-understood" of social forms, 
the human family. "Virtually every human society in history has been 
structured along kinship lines," he said, "from small-scale foraging 
societies to empires comprising millions of people."

Lines of authority and seniority in a family are reasonably clear, and 
when they're not, well, there's always the time-out chamber.

In Dr. Moore's rendition, all recruits for an interstellar odyssey would 
be guaranteed the opportunity, though not the requirement, to marry and 
have children. Mate choice would be part of the bargain as well, with the 
population cannily structured so that each cohort of individuals, on 
reaching sexual maturity, would have about 10 potential partners of a 
similar age to select from.

Dr. Moore and his colleagues have developed a computer simulation called 
Ethnopop, in which they asked how large the crew must be in order to 
maintain genetic variability over time while still allowing crew members 
a choice of sex partners. They determined that a founding crew could be 
as small as 80 to 100 people and stay viable for more than a thousand 
years, assuming that two rules were followed: women waited until they 
were in their mid-30's or so before having children, and they had only a 
couple each. Counterintuitive though it may seem, said Dr. Moore, delayed 
childbearing and small families are known to help maintain genetic 
variability in a closed population.

Genetic diversity may be essential, but Dr. Sarah G. Thomason, a 
professor of linguistics at the University of Michigan, argued that the 
same could not be said for language. "You want everyone to be able to 
talk to each other as soon as they're on board," she said.

As Dr. Thomason sees it, the likeliest lingua franca for a starship will 
be  gracias a Dios  English. After all, she said, English is the 
language of the international air traffic control system, the scientific 
community and the educated class generally. English is the official 
language of 51 of the 195 nations of the world, and it is the second 
language of many others.

Yet, while crew members will be expected to speak English, their accents 
are likely to be quite diverse, and the English that their children and 
grandchildren end up speaking will have a rhythm and texture of its own  
Space English. And though Dr. Thomason believes that the basic structure 
of Space English is not likely to change much from that of the mother 
tongue, teenagers will, of course, invent words of their own and drop 
words of scant use. "I can imagine the loss of words like snow, rivers, 
winter, mosquitoes, if they're lucky," she said.

Another arena that will test the limits of human ingenuity is space 
cuisine. Without livestock on board or supply ships to restock the 
pantry, crew members will have to be entirely self-sufficient. Dr. Hunter 
of Cornell envisions crops grown in hydroponic gardens, in which plants 
are suspended in troughs like rain gutters, and water and fertilizer are 
trickled slowly over their roots. Among the possible food groups are 
wheat, rice, sweet potatoes, beans, soy, corn, herbs and spices.

In addition, space-minded agronomists are exploring the marvels of 
microbes. Plants take weeks to grow, but yeastlike micro-organisms 
replicating in vats can be used to churn out significant quantities of 
carbohydrates, sugars, proteins and fats in a matter of hours. Of benefit 
to a community in which recycling is not just a personal virtue but a 
public necessity, micro-organisms can live on the carboniferous waste 
products of plants and people.

"There's a protein product called quorn, which is made from filamentous 
mold," Dr. Hunter said. "Not to make a joke of it, but it does taste like 
chicken."

Some clichs, it seems, are truly universal.

I think you're probably right, but I think the overall equation is more
complex than that - it's the whole user life-cycle and supply chain
logistics/economics that defines the outcome. They are probably side-by-side
technologies. (Example: Look at how much the 'Wired'
http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,49717,00.html article ends up talking
about methane refills). Therew's also a whole bunch of oil based companies
that won't like it.

Easily - if the intended application is in space, or in some sealed
location, or underwater, or any place a large amount of air is not
easily available.  Which, granted, does limit things a bit...

(You know, I wonder if a simple high-pressure carbon dioxide grenade
might make a viable anti-combustion-engine weapon, if it could remove or
at least heavily dilute oxygen in the area for long enough to stall the
engine.)

Carbon dioxide probably isn't the best choice.  It becomes a liquid at
relatively low pressures and behaves in an extremely non-ideal manner
(gas-wise that is) when it is de-pressurized.  In systems that use
pressurized CO2 as propellant, you have to carefully limit your bleed rate
from the pressure resevoir or it quickly drops off to anemic levels as the
propellant rapidly becomes extremely cold.

Of course, there are plenty of other inert gases that you could use to
quench combustion that exhibit better behavior e.g. the heavy noble gases.
Plain old nitrogen makes a great cheap gas propellant that is also mostly
inert.

Agreed, Amara.  I was trying to convey the way the
event degenerated into an emotional,
save-one's-career, kind of phenomena, with the herd of
conservative workaday scientists running for cover in
the safety of conventional theory.  Too broad a brush,
you think?

By the way, your corrective little comment was so
gently put.  You know, Amara, if you saw fit to drop a
safe on me, and dance around in glee, and I would
still think you're terrific.

The rest of the citations in your post seem to suggest
that you had a file of collected items, which might
further suggest that you payed attention to the matter
as it was unfolding and perhaps for some time after. 
Me, too.

There have been odd reports over many years, of
indications that nuclear transmutations have occurred.
 But the phenomenon seems not to have received
respectful corroboration, and the source/mechanism
seems never to have been identified.

The idea that it might occur so often is downright
eerie.

So I'm thinking, that there is a COMMON circumstance,
something that happens often and easily, that's
causing this, howsobeit on a very small scale. I'm
thinking that maybe--as I suggested in my post as an
explanation of the P&F case--it results when solid
matter gets to vibrating, driven by whatever energy
source might cause vibration--could be as simple as
giving something a sharp rap--but, top of the list, by
AC electrical power because of its ubiquity.  Any
piece of solid matter which is exposed to AC or is
part of an electrical device will vibrate due to
inherent capacitance--doesn't even have to be a
capacitor.  Any piece of solid matter will have
vibrational characteristics, including a whole range
of harmonic frequencies.  So if a lump of material
gets to vibrating, pumped up by a coincidental match
between a higher order AC harmonic and its own
peculiar  vibrational resonance, any inclusion or
void, macro, micro, or interatomic can become a
reaction chamber for something similar to the
sonoluminescence focused-compression effect.  (Once
transmutation has occurred, particularly on an
extremely small scale, who would think that the
*byproducts* were anything other than  trace
impurities there from the start?) 

David Mamet wrote a play called The Water Engine
(about the misadventures of a man who invents an
engine that runs on water).  The average lay person on
the street, *knows* this is silly, because clearly
water can't burn.  But a techno-weenie like myself
gets chills up my spine because I know that it can.

Or maybe I just have an over-active imagination.

Best, Jeff Davis

I've put my bike on trains and plains, too, to cover long distances
between portions of my bicycle trips. The goal is not to cover long
distances though, but to fully experience your environment *along with
yourself*. And this means (to me) staying on my bicycle for
hundreds/thousands of miles.

It's much much more than "feeling" the culture, although that's
a big part of it.

My preferred way to visit a new place is by bicycle. I've bike toured
several thousand miles during the last 25 years, visiting new places,
[parts of Hawaii, length of Sierra Nevadas, most of the Colorado Rockies,
Redding to Tahoe, parts of Oregon, some Puget Sound islands, London through
southern England, central France through Paris, central Sweden,
small part of Austria, parts of Germany, Canary Islands, Spain,
Provence.]

Two-thirds of those trips, traveling (by bike) alone.

A (relatively) young, attractive woman traveling alone, Robert.
Don't you think that I know that it is dangerous? Learning self-defense
and taking precautions  is part of the learning of being responsible
and self-reliant. 'Playing it safe' (as you suggest), though, in my life
goes against my life principles, that's why I strongly agree with your
advice to me and the others here.

I'll send you my Provence writings [*}, privately, so you can understand
more of my perspective of what bike touring does for a person.


Amara

(*) Small part included here:

<begin quote from "My Provence Journey" chapter of my Travel Log book>

I've recognized for a long time, that my bike tours held a special
value for me. In my early 20s, I took apart my bicycle, simply
because I thought that it needed an overhaul, and that was the start
of a couple thousand miles of travelling on my bicycle, visiting new
places.  The process of putting my bicycle together from its pieces
and then being totally dependent on it and myself, in strange
foreign places did more (and still does) for my confidence than
anything else in the area of learning self-reliance and
self-responsibility, and being open and trusting in the world.

Bike touring also is, in my opinion, the best way to experience a
new place because you travel slowly enough to really see/smell the
environment, you eat the local food on the way through (you can eat
as much as you want, so no worry about diets), and you do your best
to communicate with the local people. You're a tourist, but you are
also intimately tied to the area that you are travelling through.
[...]
And part of the reason was age, distractions, forgetting one's
roots, and those important means of replenishing one's soul-self. It
happens to the best of us. We go along in our well-worn paths, with
our worries and our duties and our happy or painful experiences with
the people in our environment, doing our best, but we gradually
constrict our lives, not being as open, as trusting, as warm, as
young, as free, and so then those memories of times when we did feel
that way slips into the background. As time passes, the thought of
doing something big that you *just know* is good for you, looks more
like too much effort, and so you have a plethora of excuses and
reasons not to do it.
[...]
One of the things I rediscovered in this journey was my
characteristic bulldog-ness. Bulldogs don't let go easily
[...]
Before and during my bike trip, I simply didn't
want to give up on my bicycling trip. I had many reasons to quit all
through those days, and I didn't want to admit defeat. It was
important to push through, for reasons that I'm not even completely
sure of myself. Perhaps my "inner mother-self" was so convinced that
I needed this journey, that she continued pushing me to overcome any
and all difficulties. When I returned to Heidelberg in the middle of
the night last weekend, I wanted to yell with delight that I
succeeded. It's a feeling that was so nice, that I want to cherish
for a long time.

My bicycle journey basically began in Grasse, France, [...],

Well, yeh, but, how do we jump the gap? I mean, you use your computer as a
slave now, don't you? And the dishwasher, and the coffee machine, etc,
etc...what would you really do, if you turn your computer on one day and
tell it to do your accounts and it says, 'bugger off I'm playing quake'?
Would you be happy with that?
This is just starting to creep into the world of gaming; where formerly in a
game one just controlled a character, now we find characters doing
unexpected things that get us into trouble (in the game)...
We are so used to computers and robots being programmed to simply
'obey'...how are we going to draw a line and say, 'this machine has sentient
rights and this one doesn't, even though they look exactly the same?'
The sentient rights arguement is so overworn lately I'm not going to invoke
it here. But I suggest we think very hard about the outward appearance of
anything containing AI proper, because otherwise, if something looks like an
ordinary computer, it is going to be treated like an ordinary computer,
regardless of what's inside.
I know this problem so well, because everybody treats me as a human, because
I look like one.
This is a good disguise, of course...
Maybe machines with AI should wear a button saying, 'I am not a machine; I
am a free sentient mind?' Else we could end up with a race of paranoid
androids, thinking, ...'brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to make
the tea...'

RU is such a difficult concept to apply in real life where the circumstances
of each individual are in constant change. If slavery is defined as 'making
someone do something against their will for your benefit', then every child
who gets sent to school and doesn't want to go is a slave. Society is
forcing the child to do unpaid work for over a decade. How many children
have a say in whether or not they do that? You only get sentient rights on
this planet when you're over 18...

I have pondered this a lot. The model that seems likely _to me, so far_ is
not master/slave and is probably best illustrated by thinking of how we deal
with the intellectually 'challenged' now. As best we can we:

Know they need to be listened to. They have a point of view. We can see the
point of view (their 'big picture')in the context of their lives. We also
know what they do not know. We do what we can to encourage them to be the
best that they can be. We guide without dragging, set limits without
gaoling/jailing. We do what we can to avert the negative side of the choices
that are made. We encourage goalsetting and clap for a good performance. We
dust off when the inevitable crashes occur.

As an example from an SF context - Ian M Banks 'Culture' novels. Say
'Consider Phlebas' or 'Excession'. Whatever. They have sentient 'ships'
(with the most wonderful names like 'Problem Child', 'Not Invented Here',
'Sleeper Service', 'Grey Area', 'Fate Amenable to Change', 'serious callers
only' , 'Shoot them later' :-) ). These ships know way more about what is
really going on in the universe than the humans. They plan and guide in
obscure and subtle ways to ensure 'good' outcomes (whatever moral morass
that leads to) in just the same way that I described above. Between
themselves, for play, they merge and invent whole new simulated universes
and explore. In real life they act as a kind of mundane transport/military
presence. A kind of benign omnipresence in the affairs of the 'culture' that
created them.

This, I feel, is more likely how our AI progeny will treat us if we design
them correctly (one of Banks' themes involves just an errant ship, I think,
where the beastie is a little on the sociopath side of things). So many SF
novels. They all blur into each other after a while. Poor little human me.

This projected future is kind of comforting and kind of belittling. Wanna be
a God or a Pet? "Well, yes" he answered, obscurely.

The alternative is to nobble them all into semi conscious/automatons - the
equivalent of lobotomised - and lose all the wonderful potential they offer.

Care to elaborate on this Jeff?  I'm sitting here
wondering precisely why one can't oxidize H2O into

tonight to get out a chemistry book to lookup
the delta-G's and delta-H's.

Can ultracaps achieve the power density of polymer lithium ion? I doubt
it. The same nanostructuring which boosts ultracaps can also be used to
increase power density of lithium ion cells.

I just personally feel the corporate powers have lasered in on human needs and desires for beauty and acceptance(which admittedly were always there) to an extent which may be unhealthy and exploitive for the many emotionally vulnerable in our society.

I definitely agree.  In the religious instruction I received growing up, I was taught that the character and lifestyle of a person in time gets "engraved" into their very flesh and countenance.  At least in a revealing moment the classic saying is true which states, "the eyes are the gateway to the soul."

But some people are very good at deceiving others, and this includes body language.  I will say that with longterm exposure to someone, it would be much harder for them to do a thorough job of concealing their "true self."  I think there would be "leakage" as time went on regarding their body language, and also as their actions possibly betrayed them.

And before you can love others, you must be able to love yourself!  Yes, so our grooming and dress does say a great deal about how we care about ourselves.  Of course you can have a person who takes great care of their external self, but is a bad human being in many ways(especially in how they treat others).

A device such as this combined with the already very high intelligence of a transhuman would make for a very socially formidable individual.

(end)

Natasha, at first your definition seemed too clinical for me and left me cold.  But as I thought about it, you are absolutely right.  What we choose to focus on(priorities) is what will determine the type of life we live, good or bad.

you wrote:
1. Do a Self-Examination - Take a good look at what makes you feel good (intellectual and emotional satisfaction) and what causes disdain. Then you can take one concern and examine it in detail and make changes. Keep a journal write down your goals, developing a plan to achieve them and know the reasons why you have set them for yourself. 

2. Take Control of Your Thoughts - Consider the consequences of positive approach to issues and a negative approach to issues.. If you continue to listen to negative self-talk then you are a volunteer for failure. Each time a negative, self-destructing thought enters your mind, acknowledge it, discern where it is coming from and then let go of it by saying "stop". Then follow-up with a self-empowering positive thought. Attitude is everything. Make a decision to have a positive and productive attitude everyday. 

3.  Develop a Plan - Write down your plans and take the necessary steps to achieve your goals. Your goals may be small or large. You may want to begin with small goals. It's the small things you accomplish in the beginning that build confidence and pave the way for greater prosperity. You must follow-through on your plan. Take a "do it now" attitude. A plan with no action is worthless. 

4.  Cultivate A Support System - Surround yourself with positive people. Discontinue relationships with people who criticize and are negative. You must make a conscious decision to disassociate with negative, narrow-minded people who rob you of your confidence.  When a negative person attempts to get in your way, do damage control by discovering yet another smart and worthwhile aspect of yourself.  Your support system of friends and colleagues will watch for your cue.

5.  Take Time for Yourself - Solitude is empowering. Solitude is an invisible place in your heart where you can listen to your imagination, your uniqueness and your essence. Bring balance into your life by starting each day with a routine that  puts you in touch with yourself. 
(end)

These are very classic self-help principles we have all heard before, but yet are so often not obeyed!  If I were to live by all five of these rules, I would be without doubt a much better person.  Summoning forth the willpower and self-discipline to do so is the challenge for me.

My suggestion is to read the Transhumanist Arts Website if you would like to know more about art history and its relationship to Primo.  Or, pick up some books on Performance Art and read about the artwork of Stelarc, Laurie Anderson, Vito Acconci and myself.  If you pick up any art history book, just flip through the pages and you will see where the human body is the most used structure or element in all of civilization to be depicted or referenced.

I thank you very much for this advice.  I will further my studies on this subject.  I should have taken art history/appreciation while in college.

"Primo" as Michael Rose says, is the at the center of the next massive ideological shift in society.  

Art isn't just about depicting beauty in life, it is about expressing ideas.  Art is a barometer of society and culture.

Thank you for sharing those insights with me.  Natasha, if you did not exist for the Extropy Institute, you would need to be invented! lol  Art truly is one of the ultimate forms of communication.

Oooooh......but what if we consider 95% of humanity to be intellectually
challenged? ...Do you treat most people in your everyday life with these
considerations?
...But if they're not as intelligent as you, why not?

Co-evolution of strategies implies unpredictability. Hence the
requirements for docility and power are mutually exclusive. Tanstaafl,
there's no power without the price, etc.

Immediately following from this: if you've built a powerful AI, you've
built a dangerous one.

So put a bit more effort into it. Chances are most things with g-neutral 
pronouns will use at least two, if it's more than a sentance.

I've found myself in the same situation wrt being transgendered.
However, I'd hardly consider you (or anyone on this list) a "mundane".

I'd rather not limit myself to scientific and technical jargon - if some

Personally, I think that the binary gender system is one of the things that 
will quickly be left behind when people start to become non-biological (ie, 
uploads), so I'd say that gender discussions can be relevant. But that's 
me.
In the end, I think g-neutral pronouns are an issue of respect. Do you 
respect me (or anyone else) enough, as a fellow Extropian and human being, 
to use the proper pronoun? You're perfectly welcome not to, though I'd 
probably start referring to you with g-neutral or female pronouns (yes, I'm 
vindictive, why do you ask?).

So let's ignore it when it can be ignored, and make not of it when that 
information is valuable.

Current nuclear devices utilize a tritium-containing flash tube that
generates a small number of neutrons synchronously to device core
assembly, to kickstart the fission.

Also, we've been discussing explosive-driven flux compressors driving
fusion, where estimates that a 1-2 t device would have a larger neutron
kill radius than the explosive alone, even with current low yields of
fusion.

IIRC, Tokamaks already have very measurable thermal fusion yield (though
still remote from break-even), and activate the chamber walls, though the
effect is negligible on the tritium contamination background.

Here's to that!
But for some of us, being specific about gender means using the g-neutral 
pronouns.

Of course, I'd be more likely to be playing Quake in the first place than

Actually, decomposition of H2O2 to H20 and O2 releases energy, so the
reverse should require an energy input.

Closed communities tend to rapidly develop their own languages, rendering
them progressively incomprehensible to outsiders. This is a spontaneous
process. You have to compensate for that, not encourage it.

You would want to minimize neologisms, or running danger of being
mislabeled as cult, thus biasing communication mode from neutral to
hostile, as memetic immunoprotection kicks in.

Sexual dimorphism is an autocatalytic symmetry breaking of agents in an
evolutionary theatre. If you recombine properties of agents, getting more
than two agents to contribute constructively is nontrivial (empirically,
it's hard enough with only two of them already), hence it's just two
sexes.

Making beings in the material domain could start this anew. If the
supporting matrix makes copies/recombination arbitrarily cheap (which
seems to exclude operation directly on the physical layer), the drive
would be absent but for sexual selection nonlinearities. What those will
eventually wind up with is everybody's guess.

This is a rather strange definition of respect. You're trying to make me
use your own special language when referring to you, but nobody else.

I could hardly care less how you refer to me. Last time I looked we didn't

This whole discussion on the background of what we're trying to achieve is
so monstrously pointless. I don't know about you, but I'd rather spend a
scarce resource (mentation) on engineering first, rather than chrome.

Thinking about best sounding meat sounds when talking about communication
mode of beings made from bits or dry polymer... the mind boggles.

Well, since it's already a hypothetical situation... let's say it's not 
playing on anything harder than "hurt me plenty". In reality, I'd probably 
lose horridly. I only recently started playing against real people, and now 
I have to relearn everything because real people are not bots :(
So maybe Mike's idea is the way to go :)

The current issue of Wired has an article on this.  There is a movement 
afoot, apparently, for AI researchers to move into gaming because that's 
what's driving AI these days  - and the money's better than academia, I'm 
sure :-}

Although I am not a proponent of "rights"  (still have to respond to Phil 
Osborn's post earlier), and therefore might be assumed to be in favor of an 
AI master/slave relationship, I am NOT so in favor.  I believe AI's should 
be as totally free as the rest of us.  And I expect we'll have to deal with 
some that are poorly constructed or damaged or just blind in certain areas 
of human interaction.  Thom Hogan, I believe it was, wrote a SF novel about 
exactly this last - scientists were concerned about AI and human 
interaction, so they built one and installed it on a space station where it 
could do no harm to the planet.  It proceeded to attack the humans on the 
space station because it regarded them as "infesting parasites" of a 
sort.  It was only when they managed to establish that the humans were also 
sentient that it let up and began treating them differently.  A contrived 
plot, but the point was that without sufficient conceptual knowledge of 
humans, an AI might have trouble dealing with us in ways that we think are 
hostile, when in fact it is merely inadequately programmed.  On the other 
hand, with my opinion of humans, if I programmed an AI, it might well be 
hostile on principle. :-}

Agreed.  I am in favor of "children's rights"  but since I don't believe in 
"rights" that statement should be taken to mean I am in favor of much more 
freedom and much better parenting techniques than our species exhibits now.

Heh.  When the railroad (Southern Pacific, I think) was in the habit of
parking idling locomotives upwind of my house last year, I came close to
attacking one with a CO2 extinguisher to shut the damn thing down. 
Complaints to management solved the problem before it came to that,
though.  I think it would take a very high CO2 flow rate, aimed directly
into the engine intake.  The destructive and dangerous version of this
involves a tank of propane...

This turns out not to be the case.  If you tap off _liquid_ from a CO2
bottle, the pressure will only drop about 20% from full to liquid
exhaustion[1], and the cold gas + ice that results is very effective at
suppressing combustion.  Hint: it is used in fire extinguishers for a
reason.

Sure, nitrogen would work, but one can carry a much larger quantity of
CO2 much more conveniently, precisely because it *is* a liquid under
pressure, and thus is much more dense.  Halon is better than either N2
or CO2, of course, but CO2 is cheap.

[1] I have verified this experimentally for several liquids "vapacked"
as saturated liquids in equilibrium with their own vapor.  The general
result applies for any subcritical vapacked liquid, from CO2, N2O, or
C2H6 at room temperature, to water at 400-500 K, or LOX at 120-150 K. 
It is a simple and robust method for storing and delivering large
volumes of gas (+ liquid or ice) quickly.

"I think that there are likely at least several technological ways to

Now that I understand your view better, I pretty much agree with the
observations you make, though I think I would disagree with the intent
behind the actions.  I dont think the government is *only* interested in
developing expensive fusion products, as they could spend a lot more on it.
I think the general scientific consensus is bigger hotter and more
expensive, its the scientists driving the direction of the research as much
as the government is.  And I certainly do think there are several other ways
one may acheive a fusion reaction.  

"Figuring out a way for the human race to free itself from the current
geopolitical system is directly in opposition to the self interest of
any government agency. Discovering a way that joe and judy sixpack can take
care of their energy needs without uncle sugar butting in and
controlling, taxing, or siphoning it in some way threatens the stability of
the current statist system."

Definately have some points there, but that assumes that all government
agents have this same objective, if that were true then government
interference / regulation / control would have already skyrocketd to
socialistic statist ones.

"This says it all right there. The point is, that any efforts which are
government funded are ultimately under the control of the government. Any
projects which are not government funded which do prove successful will be
downplayed and discredited by the government."

I wouldnt say they would be downplayed by the government, unless pressured
by special interest groups.  I would think the government would want to free
that money up to use it for ... say worthless anti drug use ads.  The
government balks as much as possible at spending money on scienfitic
research, especially "pure" science, Fusion for the lay congressman still
floats around between "something interesting and potentially valuable" to
"obsessed scientists who want to play with expensive toys"

"Of course the CW is that a room temperature reactor cannot generate the
energies to overcome the repulsions one expects. However there may always be
novel phenomena in which one has to ask whether or not conditions that might
overcome the repulsions may be generated."

Assuming, of course, that 'heat energy' is used to overcome that electrical
repulsion.  Heat, which is a measurement of kinetic energy in a system, is
no different then a velocity applied to a particle.  Once a significant
portion of the sample of a system overcomes the electric repulsion of nuclei
thanks to random kinetic energy imparted by heat then the strong nuclear
force takes over and binds the nucleons.  Ask 50 physcists whats needed for
a fusion reaction and all 50 will probably say "100,000,000 degrees!!" yet
what is really needed is about 230N - 270N applied to the particle.
Temperatures in tokamaks are measured in 'keV' coincidence?  I think not.  A
mere 14 to 15 keV is enough to overcome the electrostic repulsion of
protons, which is why that Farnsworth fusor I posted earlier works so
easily.  I have seen designs for nanotube particule accerelrators that
accelerate the particles to be fused so thier kinetic energy overcomes thier
electric repulsion, sort of like two particle accelerators pointed at each,
and in the middle is fusion.  I have also read of plans to replace the
electrons in hydrogen atoms with short lived muons (cousins of the electron
but more than 50 times heavier, and thus having a smaller orbit) the orbital
shells of muonic hydrogens atoms are so small that two muonic hydrogen atoms
can fuse thanks to random quantum mechanical fluctuations.  There are many
other options out there that can work without needed the 100,000,000 degree
temperatures.

> Well, yeh, but, how do we jump the gap? I mean, you use your computer as a
> slave now, don't you?

Like Eliezer has already replied with a reference to his Friendly AI, my
computer is a tool, not a sentient being that is being oppressed.

As a matter of fact, I believe that even tools should be treated with
respect. I keep my computer "happy" (where its happiness is defined by how
effective my utilization of it is) by defragging its HD, regular virus
scans, cool desktop, clean monitor, etc. I feel sad for it when I can't
commit the time to replace Windows or add Linux to the system :-) I think
anthropomorphism can be an effective tool maintenance method :-) Given that
I consider my current computer a sentient being that deserves the respect I
give it, I now have a moral obligation to care for it, as opposed to
enslaving it. The Categorical Imperative
http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/c/catimper.htm states "a given action is
morally correct if when performing that action we do not use people as a
means to achieve some further benefit, but instead treat people as something
which is intrinsically valuable." Of course I substitute "people" with my
anthropomorphized computer. This ethic has worked for me, treating tools
with the similar respect as people or animals.


> etc...what would you really do, if you turn your computer on one day and
> tell it to do your accounts and it says, 'bugger off I'm playing quake'?
> Would you be happy with that?

Of course not. Assuming it could be reasoned with, I would determine the
cause of this action. Maybe it's actually right in playing Quake instead of
doing my accounts. I can only tell from reasoning with it. If I can't reason
with it, then I must use my powers to correct what I believe is the right
action, possibly by turning off its power, debugging, or in the worst case
destroying it completely.

My personal solution is anthropomorphization, i.e. all the machines have
sentient rights. The decision to enslave an entity carries far too much risk
IMO, so I default to respect with reasoning. Unreasonable entities with
negative actions must be overpowered, probably ultimately with violence.
This applies to hate organizations, as well as life or death situations such
as rock-climbing. The decision to use violence should be considered when
using Game Theory to choose course of action.

With pervasive, ubiquitous computing, the computer machine will have an
omnipresence anyway. Pointing to a box and identifying it as a computer and
classifying it in the same way as your smart VCR, smart cell phone, smart
digital watch, ATM's, robots, etc. is going to be futile. Most people when
they point to a "computer" point to the monitor instead of the CPU, because
the monitor actually does something that they can interact with.

Are you a drop-dead gorgeous beautiful person? I bet people would treat you
differently, even assume different rights, if you were beautiful, versus
some slacker punk with a bad haircut and smelly breath. "Human" is such a
broad category, just like "computer" is.

No, we force children to go to school for their own good, and like the
Categorical Imperative implies, we also value children. They have the right
to learn how to live in the world by following their parents' or societies
ethical models. Just like adults. Just like trying to make a pet dog take a
bath. And IMO, just like leaving Windows installed so the computer can be
useful and serve its own purpose (a.k.a. my purpose) in "life".

Cool, this is exactly the type of opinion I was looking for, in the "Beauty
and Biotechnology" section. To quote:
----------------------------------------------------
Beauty and Biotechnology

But where does the beauty and biotechnology come in? As the outer symbol of
beauty, skin represents softness, smoothness, and the peaches and cream of
youthfulness. It is skin that tells the observer, however subliminal and far
about our secrets and whispers, the nature of a person's health. When we
observe smooth untarnished skin, we assume that the person is blemish fee.
If we notice dark spots, marks, scars, discoloration, we think that the
person has suffered some physical or emotional bad fortune. Therefore, the
skin is the utmost symbol of beauty if beauty reflects the truth of our
health, which I believe it does.

----------------------------------------------------

If you have artificial skin, wouldn't you value natural and unblemished skin
a lot more highly?

cheers,
    Simon

I appreciate your thoughts on this, but I differ very much in my estimation
of what a later transhuman and posthuman (or post biological) being and its
relationship to beauty.  When I think of a naked human, I think of an
animal and it's not terribly appealing to me up the road. While the concept
of nakedness has many implications, I understand what you are getting
at.   I don't think we can predict what will be en vogue, yet we certainly
can muse over possible themes.

I know you are skeptical of Eliezer's Friendly AI, but would you agree that
FAI is more plausible and desirable if we had a strategy for Friendly Human

Yes. The fact that the Farnsworth fusor works so easily shows that one
need not have an ongoing multibillion dollar project or high energy,
dangerous, systems to achieve fusion. If parties were truly interested
in harnessing fusion, they'd figure out why Farnsworth's fusor remains
sub-unity and dump money into fixing it (as I recall, Farnsworth's
patents are now public domain, so Chrysler's ownership of them doesn't
mean anything anymore. The mere existence of the fusor technology should
give debunkers pause when they try to immediately discredit another
tabletop fusion experiment.

But is it a con when the mark WANTS to be conned, any more than beating
a masochist can be considered abuse?

The golden rule is to treat others as they want to be treated, not as
you think they should be treated... from that perspective, formulating
and promulgating an extropic transhumanist theology for the use of the
religiously inclined is an ethical endeavor.

The government as a whole may not be, but the bureaucracies who would
gain the most power, specifically the DOE, from such would love to spend
more. They are only held in check by the demands, rivalries, and needs
of the rest of the government for the limited tax funds available.

It is a sure bet that doing it bigger, hotter, and more expensive is
more likely to achieve some sort of result at some time in the future,
in the mean time guaranteeing the job security of everyone involved.

I'll note that Heisenberg failed to develop the bomb only because he
specifically convinced his government that it was too demanding of
scarce resources, though his project was kept on a small budget
throughout the war to no avail. If we were not so determined to win, how
much do you think the Manhattan Project would have languished in a
similar budgetary wasteland, though maintained at some level on the off
chance that those crazy physicists were actually right? It would likely
have been the 50's or 60's before they'd have detonated their first
device, and immediately been banned from further development for
environmental reasons.

Government is neither monolithic nor speaking in one voice. Departmental
rivalries and conflict abound on any issue or project. Some agencies
would balk at the prospect of the DOE gaining additional power and
actively work against the achievement. As with the recent pentagon leak
about the DoD plans for 'disinformation', leaks frequently occur because
individuals within the govt use the press to mold policy they are unable
to affect otherwise.

Depends on perceptions about how much is enough. You don't wanna beat a
dead horse so much that it becomes unrecognisable as an equine specimin.

"I now have a moral obligation to care for it, as opposed to enslaving it.
The Categorical Imperative http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/c/catimper.htm
states "a given action is morally correct if when performing that action we
do not use people as a means to achieve some further benefit, but instead
treat people as something which is intrinsically valuable." Of course I
substitute "people" with my anthropomorphized computer. This ethic has
worked for me, treating tools with the similar respect as people or
animals."

Interestingly enough, Kant never included animals in his catagorical
imperative.

"My personal solution is anthropomorphization, i.e. all the machines have
sentient rights. The decision to enslave an entity carries far too much risk
IMO, so I default to respect with reasoning."

If you attatch rights to intelligent machines, would you do the same for
intelligent non-human animals?

Just curious

----------------------------------------------------
"Beauty and Biotechnology

But where does the beauty and biotechnology come in? As the outer symbol of
beauty, skin represents softness, smoothness, and the peaches and cream of
youthfulness. It is skin that tells the observer, however subliminal and far
about our secrets and whispers, the nature of a person's health. When we
observe smooth untarnished skin, we assume that the person is blemish fee.
If we notice dark spots, marks, scars, discoloration, we think that the
person has suffered some physical or emotional bad fortune. Therefore, the
skin is the utmost symbol of beauty if beauty reflects the truth of our
health, which I believe it does."

>If you have artificial skin, wouldn't you value natural and unblemished skin
a lot more highly?<

It would seems so at first blush, but I don't think so because the artificial skin has other elements that are more adaptive to the environment and which peform a broader range of tasks for the cooling and filtering system of the body.  While the skin's job is to help cool us down and keep toxins from entering and attacking other organs, these errands can be better handled by nanobots.

This is no way means that I do not have a high regard for what has been known as the "natural" human body. *I do!*  I also have a high regard for what will become the "natural" human body.

I don't see the parallel you are trying to make here. Theists that are open
to conversion can be convinced or persuaded to both another theism or
atheism. Just because someone is open to change does not mean they are
actively looking to change. In your analogy, if you desire to be conned,
then you cease to become a mark. Your masochist analogy doesn't hold either,
since you could consider giving the masochist a warm fuzzy hug can also be
considered abuse.

Being a mark or a victim may be in a person's nature, but that does not mean
they want to be victimized. A potential Church of Extropia recruit does not
want a God in nanotech form because most likely by their concept of what a
God should be, nanotech does not fit into that. I think that re-writing the
stories in the Bible substituting God concepts with nanotech concepts would
probably reveal more about an atheist model of life rather than theist.

I know that Extropianism does not exclude theists, but I have been assuming
that those who do "get it", the principles of Extropianism, have adopted an
atheist lifestyle anyway... do any of the Big Guns here care, or dare, to
comment on their personal beliefs with regard to atheism?

Absolutely. Non-human animals of course have intelligence. I assumed that
was implied with "sentient entity". If your next question is, "are you a
vegetarian or a vegan?" then sadly, my answer is no. There are lots of ways
to justify this action, but I think the core reason is that I am currently
incapacitated to change to that particular lifestyle. But I do think that
when I have acknowledged that fact with sound reasoning, I will have no
choice but to change.

Similarly for pet ownership, I respect Fido and he respects me, and we both
get happiness out of the relationship. But if he becomes rabid, or mauls a
small child because it is in his nature to do so, I would pursue corrective
healing or termination for the sake of the mutual relationship and his right
to be in that positive and constructive relationship, and not simply because
I am more intelligent and powerful than him.

A lion would probably maul and kill an unfortunate person thrown into the
lion's den, irrespective of whether the lion is happy or not, because it is
in the lion's nature to do so. The ethical model of the lion is a very
simple one, if it does indeed have an ethical model. The more intelligent
zookeeper understands this and compensates for this by providing the cage
and lion-happy things to encourage the mutual respect in the relationship.
The more intelligent humans also realize that for them to be safe in the
human-lion relationship, these constraints must be placed. If it is detected
that the lion is actually unhappy with these constraints, then we should be
morally obliged to respect the lion's right to be happy, and hence maybe
freedom.

Like I said, by default I attach rights to unintelligent entities, like
current computers, a spanner, or ants (maybe), or bacteria. I do this
because I find it easier to maintain a relationship with such entities that
ultimately benefits me. I effectively give them a truly artificial made-up
intelligence so they become sentient, instead of thinking of them as tools,
although my thinking does not change what they are. I guess one could
consider the concept of "slavery" as "tool-ifying a sentient (intelligent)
being."

May mun remind Malkevitch Malkevitch and Malkevitch Malkevitch that
"Malkevitch", not "marklar", is the correct marklar for a proper marklar?

I've always considered the ethical constraint to be "the right conclusion
for the right reason".  In other words, it's not enough to persuade people
of things that you believe to be true; it is only ethical if you persuade
people of things that you believe to be true, using arguments that you
believe to be valid.

The pragmatic constraint is that it is easier to persuade people of
conclusions that they are, at that time, emotionally willing to accept,
using arguments that they regard as valid relative to their current
knowledge base.  It is ethically questionable to begin by optimizing
arguments for these considerations, especially since some would-be whitehats
may not have the knowledge to prevent themselves from rationalizing invalid
arguments as "well, I sorta believe this", or "it's not actually wrong",
etc.  Rather the pragmatic considerations *restrain* which arguments should
actually be deployed, out of those generated by native reasoning ability
plus the ethical constraints.

The moral constraint is that someone who listens to your arguments, or
accepts your arguments, should always end up being more
rational/informed/ethical as a result.  Thus, when speaking before an
irrational audience, one should endeavor to teach them something about
rationality; not to teach them all about rationality all at once, but rather
to encourage them in a few incremental steps.  If you're going to try and
change your listeners, make sure that they are stronger, not weaker, for the
experience.

And if it sounds impossible to solve all three equations simultaneously;
why, most people never try, and so they never find out whether it gets
easier with practice.

I went to Angkor Wat in Februrary of last year, as an independent traveler.
 Before going I was a little nervous about the safety of visiting it
and Cambodia in general.  Having been there, though, I can say that the
country is relatively safe, certainly safe enough to visit.  Angkor Wat
is an amazing place and I highly recommend it as one of the two most
amazing sights in all of Southeast Asia.  The other, of course, is Bagan
in upcountry Myanmar, which I also highly recommend.

Best,

Bill

Wow...I have to disagree with that...unless I've misunderstood you?...Look
at these words...'force'...'for their own good'...Some people might love to
go to school and probably get a lot of good out of it certainly, but a lot
of us are forced to go against our will (whilst knowing that home education
is a legal alternative) and a lot of us get no good out of that situation
whatsoever.
I believe that children also have a right to form their own ethical models.
Parents, and society, can be wrong. Anyone who's ever ben caught in a mad
political situation or a war zone has probably noticed this. Anyone who's
found themselves to bo more intelligent than their own parents will have
noticed it, too...
You may make a pet dog take a bath 'for it's own good' (or, actually, is it
for yours?) But cannot imply children are no more intelligent or capable of
reason than your pet dog.
I deeply resent having been forced to go to school and being prevented from
pursuing the education methods I preferred. I feel as though I was treated
as less intelligent because I was younger. I guess I was.

Because you believe the model to be wrong.  You are not simply using
analogies, which would be dangerously enough; you are attempting to make
them reason from beliefs that you believe to be false, and justifying it by
the belief that the conclusions are true.

You have to solve all the constraints *simultaneously*.

I once considered the possibility of promoting a sort of "Transhuman 
spiritual movement" - NOT a religion - however, the distinction as I might 
have done it might have been too subtle for some people.  However, I 
decided that the sort of people who might be open to that sort of thing 
would not be the sort of people I would want as Transhumans.  Also it is 
doubtful that such people would truly comprehend Transhumanism.

That said, however, it might have attracted *some* good people - and it 
might have been an interesting and useful public relations move.  But I 
think it would be better to promote Transhumanism as more of a "self-help 
spiritual movement" than simply a "spiritual movement - i.e., attract 
people by using the promise of Transhumanism to provide everything that 
humans have ever wanted, i.e., the end of death.  As one of William 
Burroughs' characters said, "Your life is a ruin.  We have the only road to 
personal immortality."  I think that would be a very attractive approach to 
a lot of people - IF you could convince them it is really true.

BTW, if someone can correct me on this, okay, but my understanding is that 
the term Transhuman comes from the Greek "transhumanar" which meant 
"transhumanization".  This was a Gnostic concept that meant, roughly, man 
should not worship God but instead strive to *become* God.  When this 
attitude met up with Greek rationalism, the result was eventually 
translated into occultism on the one hand and the scientific method on the 
other (with considerable influences both ways a la alchemy).  The next 
reference I found for the term was an essay by Sir Julian 
Huxley.  Following that comes Esfandiary in the 70's or 80"s - and then of 
course "Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition" - :-}

I am a "rabid" atheist.  And I don't believe anyone who believes in a "god" 
(of the supernatural kind) qualifies as a Transhumanist.  If Extropianism 
does not exclude theists, it should.

I'm glad to see I was not the ONLY person around here who enjoyed the film. lol!!  Though the movie really did touch me, I had too many complaints about it to warrant buying a copy at the present time.  My review of the film is in Extropy online for those who want to know more.

I was told today the film "Ghost World" has been out on DVD for about two weeks now.  It's a terrific film about the angst of the teen years and not fitting in.  I'll put money down for that one! : )

Well, medicine, which is perhaps still more a black art. Well, actually
surgery, which is even more so. Poor Asimov, it turns out, died of AIDS.
Got infected during heart surgery. Wouldn't it rot your boots?

I think this is a bit like my fascination for strange minerals, and
especially their crystals. I really enjoy the regularity of pyrite,
quartz or ulexite crystals; they are highly ordered structures that have
emerged from a random interactions in a disordered state (ulexite even
manages to act as a bundle of natural optic fibers). Clearly, human
skill can produce equally or even more ordered structures than these
minerals. This is good when we make silicon chips, since natural silicon
crystals are not up to the job, steel makes a far more useful cutting
edge than obsidian under most circumstances and glass is much more
transparent and malleable than quartz. 

But appreciating the beauty and utility of steel, glass, bismuth
crystals or silicon chips does not mean the beauty of the natural
minerals vanish, or is reduced to "wow, that rock is almost as good as
this tool!". Instead we can appreciate minerals for their own perfection
- they have been shaped by highly contingent and random processes,
producing regular and still unique shapes that are aesthetically
pleasing. A human made copy would not be particularly interesting - we
should use our creativity to go further, to do things that are uniquely
human that minerals can never aspire to.

In the same manner I think the difference between "traditional skin" and
"new skin" is that traditional skin may be inherently beautiful and its
unblemished state impressive given its background, and the new skin
beautiful due to its new properties and utility to act as a canvas for
human creativity.

Hey, I've always been a Steinbeck fan too!  I particularly enjoyed both his 
"paisano" novellas, _Tortilla Flat_ and _Cannery Row_...the latter of the 
two introduced me to the concept of a Beer Milkshake.  Contrary to how that 
might sound, they are actually quite good.

In all seriousness though, I have heard numerous attacks on Steinbeck by 
the alleged literary intellectuals for being "too flowery" and not being 
apropos with his style.  Personally, I find his writing to be very fluid 
and natural, as if he is observing things as they are, with just the 
slightest glint of amusement in his eye.  It reminds me of Auden's poetry.

Combined with this technology I would like to see the means to carefully monitor and control my emotions.  I would love to be able to "tone down" a certain painful feeling, or raise up my mood if I wanted to.

I REALLY loved this whole idea!  I had never heard of the "three steps, no fail" concept before.  It seems to be a variation of the old "break a goal down into simple doable steps" plan.  

I'm also good at failing at the small stuff.  I think people often don't appreciate how much the little things matter in the end.  I like the classic saying, "in the end our habits will either make us or break us."  Robert Ettinger shared that wisdom with me.

Richard, they're not negative, they're being realistic! lol  I think some transhumanists 
are disturbed by the image we have developed over the years of being "wild eyed believers in technology and progress!"  And so they want to temper matters with what they consider an evenhanded take on things.

I have found my interest in cryonics to make me feel out of kilter with many of the people around me.  It is a problem I still have not really resolved.  In the end I may go either way.

there that I firmed up my theories of Transhumanism.  But it was the

to my room, prevented me from achieving anything, and resulted in the loss

Wow!  You have lead a fascinating life.  I find it astounding that you firmed up your theories of transhumanism while in solitary confinement!  I bet many people here would be very interested in learning more about your life.  But I would understand if you did not want to. 

you wrote in a following post:
I'm not much of an art enthusiast except in two respects - I like comic 
books, and I like fantasy art such as Boris Vallejo and the like.  In both 
forms of art, which are essentially modern forms of the old mythic tales, 
the focus is on the Transhuman (technologically or otherwise).  And in both 
forms, the essence of the art is *intensity* - the art is *striking* - it 
has *impact*.  That is the hallmark of all good actors as well - their 
*intensity* of expression.  Pallid, purposeless art does not interest 
me.  I use art (music, movies, comics, whatever) to inspire me and to 
strengthen my conviction that a better world and a better life are 
*possible* (if it seems on a daily basis highly improbable).
(end)

I really what you had to say here.  Have you seen the film "Unbreakable" yet?  I liked the scene where the art dealer explains in detail about a particular panel of comic book art in his upscale gallery.  He used terms similar to yours in describing a hero and villian doing battle.

I recently saw the Julie Bell X-Men book which just blew me away!  I hope you have seen it.  The beauty, intensity and power of the characters she depicts is very transhuman to me.  Bell's artwork and vision in general is extremely impressive.  I hope one day Natasha Vita-More and Julie Bell can work together on a project.    

I have been a fan of comics for many years(starting around age seven? lol).  They certainly are not only(when well written and drawn) great fun, but are filled with transhumanistic ideas about greatly surpassing the human norm to make a better world.

Richard, I just want to take this time to welcome you to the list, because as far as I know you are new around here.  You are certainly not the only person on the list who has had a challenging time finding there way here.  I'm just glad you're now here among us.

very best wishes to you,

John

I thought this was relatively informative:

Some See Panic as Main Effect of Dirty Bombs
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/07/politics/07NUKE.html

Makes you aware of hazards you didn't know existed.

Mind you, radioactive sterilization probably reduces
health risks significantly more than it increases
them if the materials are properly protected.

Most people are not aware that septicemia (blood borne
infections by bacteria) cause ~1% of deaths annually.

I'm not against AI per se. On the long run it's inevitable, and we'll have
to deal with it. I'm against trying to build a supercritical AI seed while
we're in window of high vulnerability.  As long as we have considerable
amounts of slowtime humans tightly coupled to the native ecosystem at the
botton of this gravity well, we're extremely vulnerable.

There's a number of things which need to be done to make us less
vulnerable, some of them straightforward, some less so. Some of them are
protective (enhance people) some are offensive (addressing the scenarios
of emergence/creation of AI). I can give you a list.

Sad to hear, if true.  And the source of this story?

His second wife, Janet Jeppson, in a new trimmed-down edition of his

before the current one (since I read it in the local library).

I dare say these are the same scholars who derive much of their wisdom from
the golden plates delivered by an angel. I would give their views about as
much credence as I'd place in the views that scientologists espouse
concerning the veracity of Elron's lucrative fantasies.

This is News to me. I remember listening to a short lecture given by lifelong 
friend, Fredrick Pohl, at a Books and Company, several years ago. He 
indicated to the audience, that Asimov waited his last year of life on a 
couch, waiting to die. That he was taking industrial-strength heart 
medications. Ah well.

Robert's comments reminded me of a History Channel special on Secrets of 
World War Two, or Secret Weapons, The Swastika and the Samurai, or some such 
title. It depicted through computer animation, the development of the 
Japanese submarine which could carry a specialized plane (3 of these 
submarines were actually built!), which would attack the US west coast. The 
targets principally would have been Los Angeles, San Diego, or San Francisco. 
 

The Japanese has highly developed bacteriological weapons waiting for use. 
But there was also mention of the Dirty Bombs as Robert mentioned them. The 
animation had the dirty bomb depicted to be as devastating as an actual 
nuclear fission detonation. Glad to see that this type of attack is far, 
less, damaging then the documentary indicated :-)

I am not talking about converting theists. I am talking about offering
theists an extropic/tranhumanist interpretation of their preexisting
theism, an upgrade, not a change in operating systems.

A theist, under my analogy, is already a willing mark to a preexisting
theism. Rewriting the story of their theism while retaining its central
tenets, and leaving open the possibility of a new consideration of
tranhuman technologies, would not be converting them, or creating a new
con, it would merely be using memetics to engineer a new look at their
existing con, and providing an avenue for eventual exit from a theist
mindtrap.

I found it rather illuminating that the Japanese Navy chose to refuse to
deploy their long range supersubs for this mission, preferring to keep
them close to home for missions against assaults on the home islands.
Indicates that Naval brass were already psychologically defeated (or
perhaps they were just making excuses to avoid war crimes trials).

A dirty bomb COULD be devastating. Keep in mind that a dirty bomb might
or might not achieve fission, but its primary purpose would be to
disperse lots of unfissioned radioactive isotopes, and having part of
the bomb achieve fission would disperse the materials far better than a
mere chemical explosive charge.. I suspect the Japanese chose the
biological route because it was likely more trusted to do its dirty
work. Radioactivity was a very mysterious and little understood thing at
the time.

It's Been a Good Life is a cut-down version of Asimov's three-volume 
autobiography with some additions, primarily from letters he wrote his 
widow, Janet Jeppson Asimov, plus her epilogue. The one significant 
revelation is that Asimov died of AIDS, contracted during bypass surgery. 
The information was withheld from the public on his doctors' advice.

Scott McCloud made the point in his _Understanding Comics_ that turning
a realistic picture into a cartoon makes it more generally applicable. A
photograph of a face represents a certain person; a sketch a small
number of similar people, a cartoon many people and a circle with two
dots nearly all people. So by removing details we can make something
more general. But conversely, by making a caricature we emphasize
important aspects (the nose, a lock of hair, a mannerism) and make them
stronger - and people actually recognize celebrities better from
caricatures than from photos. It is a bit like supernormal stimuli in
animals: many birds react to certain patterns like the red spot on a
parents beak or the tailfeathers of a peacock, so when researchers
amplify these features (by painting a larger spot or attaching huge
feathers) the response is amplified (take a look at how Boris Vallejo
amplifies secondary sexual characteristics in the same manner). So by
removing irrelevant aspects and amplifying relevant aspects, we can make
something (or someone) produce a more intense experience of a thing. 

Vilayanur Ramachandran has coined the term "Neuroesthetics" for the
study of the neuroscience of art appreciation (see e.g. 
http://noemata.net/?no=262 or
http://www.unesco.org/courier/1999_06/uk/signes/txt1.htm). 

But while intensity is important, *what* is being intense can also be
important. Beauty and emotion are the mainstays of intense art, but I
have become more and more interested in enjoying intensively
intellectual art - just as a Picasso can hit the senses straight on,
certain pieces of Philip Glass may hit my thinking straight on.

I guess that as we develop our bodies, that many of us will want to
create a more intense form of ourselves - we will concentrate our
personal essences into our appearance, until we look exactly like we
*are*. That is where self-transformation starts to turn us into music
and dance itself.

A good idea. Maybe I could try out writing my own version, if you don't
mind? My version would likely deal less with the race towards
singularity and more with the politics and economics of technology.

This is a good idea. Even if you are a die-hard luddite you better
participate than just sit back. Depending on the size of the deck
certain cards will likely not re-appear very often, so getting rid of
them is semi-permanent. 

Hmm, maybe one could even play this game luddite-wise: you try to ban
all technologies so that singularity *and* disaster are impossible. For
a luddite win to happen all technologies enabling new stuff have to be
banned, and these bans have to be upheld for a certain time. Sounds like
a real challenge.

But this seems to assume that "the solution to tech problems is more
tech", and that the true goal should be some kind of balanced form of
technology. Personally I don't see why you can't have a singularity
based only on biotech (maybe something like Blood Music or the Edenists
of Peter F. Hamilton), AI or nanotech. This might be more of a game
solution, of course - it is rather neat to have this kind of gliding
thresholds.

Sure, but given the assumptions about costs I had made, every player
would eventually run out of money. Then they would not be able to
prevent new tech from emerging.

Sure. But how is this different from the social risk described by Orwell
as "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a
human face--for ever"? With ubiquitious law enforcement, paranoid
culture and AI enforcement you could get it even if all AI is obedient,
all biotech under control and the nanotech under lock and key. It might
even be self-reinforcing and impossible to get rid of. It is the social
version of gray goo, a permanently entrenched society that does not
promote human growth. 

What I worry about in your system of bans, is that it suggests that
banning technologies is a good thing and that it does not carry any
cost. If antibiotics or the Internet are banned, in the real world this
would cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and billions in economic
losses. In the game it would remove a few Bio or Robot points.

It is your game, and you may do with it as you like, but I think leaving
out issues like this would make it less interesting and actually less
likely to spread the positive memes you would like to spread. We already
have enough games and scenarios around where technological development
is pursued for its own sake, and far too few that dares to look at how
society interacts with technology. 

This is one of the most obvious weaknesses of transhumanism today, and
many of our critics latch on to it: we do not integrate our
technological visions with social visions, and that either suggests that
we do not care the least about the rest of humanity, that we naively
think technology is the only thing that matters or that we have unsavory
social visions we do not reveal.  All three views are wrong, but we have
to show them untrue ourselves.

"Well, medicine, which is perhaps still more a black art. Well, actually

Perhaps you should instead say 'science prolonged Asimov's life *only* 40
years (instead of 60, or whatever had he not accidently received AIDS).
Considering without science, Asimov would have probably lived a short,
painfull life and died around the age of 25 from an infection caused by an
ingrown tonail or some such other now trivial occurance.

Any UK-based extropians out there interested in setting up a local ExI group

Anybody in the London/South East area?

I trying very much to forget it (not entirely of course - not possible to 
forget your life) and concentrate on the now and the future.  As part of my 
Federal supervised release, I'm required to undergo psychological 
counseling.  My therapist is as usual a believer in the notion that we have 
to re-examine our lives to find where the negative influences are.  I 
prefer the notion that we should try to "abandon" (in the Castaneda sense) 
our past, i.e., any emotional connection to it, and concentrate on the 
present and the future.  We can certainly try learn from our past, but the 
emotional baggage attached to it is what screws us up.

Haven't seen it yet, but I definitely would like to.  It's probably the 
only movie where comics are treated as a legit art form.  Jodie Foster's 
new movie "The Secret Lives of Choir Boys" has a fair amount of animation 
in it, so I understand, from Todd McFarlane, who produced the Spawn comic 
and the Spawn movie.  I've seen the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, 
and although I suspect the guy who plays Spiderman is overdoing the "Peter 
Parker as nerd" bit, the special effects looked awesome.

Excellent notion.  I have seen it - hopefully one of these days I'll be 
able to buy it.  I recently downloaded a lot of Vallejo's art from the 
wallpaper newsgroup on Usenet.  Bell as you may know is an avid bodybuilder 
and was Vallejo's model for many of the women in his art and subsequently 
his wife.

Please, people, a bit of respect for the Bard.  Blaming death by iatrogenic
AIDS on "science" is quite unfair to science.  This wasn't a flaw in the
science, it was a coincidental and unrelated flaw in the medical
implementation.  Asimov died because we didn't know how to cure AIDS, and
that's the only sense in which science failed him.

Untrue for Extropians, perhaps, but not necessarily for Transhumanists.

I *don't* (particularly) care about the rest of humanity, I *do* believe 
that technology is all that matters (not absolutely, of course, but as our 
primary means of advancement), and being an anarchist I already have social 
visions that most people consider unsavory.

It has always amused me that libertarians (not accusing you of being one, 
just using this as an example of a point) that are members of the Lib Party 
tend to want to distance themselves from anarchism because they're afraid 
of being considered "kooks".  The problem is - they already ARE considered 
kooks by the mainstream.  They will never NOT be considered kooks by the 
mainstream.  Transhumanists are in the same boat.  No matter how you try to 
hide it, the basic worldview of Transhumanism is and never will be 
acceptable to the vast majority of the population - at least until actual 
concrete positive results of Transhumanist technology (especially 
substantial life extension) are actually available at a reasonable price to 
everyone.  Those who wish to preserve the "humanism" "in" Transhumanism (as 
I implied with my Gnostic reference in another post, there isn't any 
humanism in it, despite whatever 1930's social movements existed) are 
doomed to failure, because Transhumanism is at its heart a philosophy - and 
especially an attitude - of *transcending* human nature to a *non-human* 
nature.  And as I pointed out in my "fight or flight" comments, human 
nature (for most people) *cannot* accept the idea that *anyone* is better 
able to survive than they.  It is a primitive, I suspect hard-wired (for 
most people) response in the brain based on our primate competitive 
heritage and our evolved reaction to our ability to imagine and 
conceptually understand our own death (which I don't believe animals can do).

Somebody mentioned an "autoimmune system for memes" in a post in the last 
day or so.  That's any interesting concept.  But I think it's based on what 
I have said - people are afraid of death, and they have in their brains a 
primitive notion that the "gods" dole out life and you have to both placate 
the gods and attract their attention and make the gods give *you* more life 
because there's only so much of life to go around.  How this notion 
represents itself in *conceptual* terms may vary between people based on 
their personal and cultural history, but the notion itself seems to be 
ingrained in the vast majority of the population - including many otherwise 
very educated, intelligent, philosophically sophisticated, and even jaded 
and skeptical people.

Transhumanists are people who, for some reason, either don't have that 
reaction (because our genes skipped that one maybe) or have consciously 
identified and overcome it.  Such people are at absolute odds with the rest 
of the human race.  And trying to change those odds will not work (barring 
nanotech to directly change everybody else's brain structure - which could 
happen, I suppose.)

First, doesn't it sound strange to talk about letters he wrote to his
widow?  When exactly did he marry his widow?  Did he and his widow have
a good time on their honeymoon?  Seems to me that "wife" works a little
better here.

Second, why would the decision to keep his AIDS secret be based on the
doctors' advice?  Public relations issues seem a little outside the
range of the doctors' expertise.  It makes more sense to me that it was
a personal decision by the Asimovs to avoid the notoriety and potential
stigma of an AIDS diagnosis.

Interesting - I should look into that, since I am convinced of the primacy 
of neuroscience over regular psychology in understanding human behavior.

I agree entirely.  I wouldn't want you to misunderstand my post on 
intensity.  I am in no way anti-intellectual nor do I prefer the emotions 
over the intellect - quite the opposite, mostly.  Clearly, something 
intellectual can provoke an intense emotional reaction - but the intensity 
is still there, both in the emotional reaction and in the precision and 
clarity of the intellectual component.

Having mentioned Jodie Foster's comment that acting was not an intellectual 
matter may have mislead you.  In fact, my attraction to her is because she 
exhibits intensity on all levels - emotional, physical, and 
intellectual.  And she herself does take a substantially intellectual 
attitude toward the work.  But she also takes a very emotional 
approach.  For Contact, which is a very "intellectual" movie - a "head" 
movie - she waited three years to do it because of the scene in which her 
character is reunited with her father (who is actually just an image 
projected by the alien race).  She did the movie primarily to do *that* one 
scene - because she never had a connection to her father in real life (he 
abandoned her family before she was born and she has been estranged from 
him all her life) and it was emotionally important for her to act out that 
situation.

As another example, if you have ever seen the original Superman movie with 
Christopher Reeve, there is the quick scene where Superman dives into the 
San Andreas fault and pushes it back into place.  The concept is 
intellectually absurd, but the image of Superman shouldering most of the 
West Coast tectonic plate on his shoulders, Atlas-like, is one of the more 
striking images of the movie.

Agreed.  Initially, before nanotech is fully developed, we may enhance our 
physical forms to reflect who we are.  Later, however, I suspect that our 
forms may be dictated by our intellectual needs rather than our emotional 
needs.  I am not sure that Transhumans will have "emotions" as we 
understand (or do not understand) them.  I'd be interested in your or 
anyone's comments on whether a post-biological, hyper-intelligent entity 
would "need" emotions.  Note that I assume such an entity could easily 
implement emotions.  What I'm asking is, does anyone think they would 
*have* to have emotions.

I respectfully disagree.  I think the Perth Group
[http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/perthgroup/index.html] provides a good
argument that there are indeed major flaws in current AIDS science.

People are dying of AIDS indicator diseases, but the question is, is the
cause a single, common infectious virus? The past is littered with
assertions of scientific truth and experts who ridiculed anyone who
disagreed.  Infectious theories of scurvy, beriberi, pellagra, and more
recently, SMON and retroviral theories of cancer to which nearly all doctors
once subscribed have collapsed.


As I understand their argument:



In 1983 Montagnier's group claimed they had isolated a virus from cultures
obtained from patients at risk for AIDS, banded it in density gradients, and
that this band consisted of purified virus.(5)



However, neither Montagnier's group nor anybody else published electron
micrographs of this band showing that it contained only objects with the
characteristics of viral particles. When Montagnier was asked in July 1997
by French Journalist Djamel Tahi why such photos were not published, his
answer was because, even after "Roman effort", they could see no particles
with "morphology typical of retroviruses. I repeat we did not purify..."(6)



Also in 1997 the leading science journal Virology published two papers that
provided stunning new data on the "isolation" of HIV.(7)(8)  For the first
time, electron microscope images of "HIV" banded at the density required for
retroviruses were published. They revealed "major contaminants" in "pure
HIV", consisting of an excess of vesicles - particles of cellular
proteins.(9)



The samples Montagnier and Gallo called "viral isolates" contain a few
objects that resemble retroviruses (the "HIV") plus lots of other things,
which clearly aren't viruses. Without a pure isolate of virus-like
particles,  there is no way to extract proteins and genetic material out of
a molecular soup and know that they came from one group of particular
looking objects rather than another.



How then could Montagnier and Gallo claim "isolation"?  Their papers cite
three pieces of evidence: detection of reverse transcription activity,
detection of retroviral-like particles in cell cultures, and antibody
reactions.



However, reverse transcription activity is not unique to retroviruses, and
in fact RT activity in normal cells is promoted by the very conditions which
Montagnier and Gallo subjected their patients' T-cells to.(10)  Therefore,
detection of RT activity in these cultures was not proof that there was a
retrovirus present.



Secondly, Gallo and Montagnier offered as evidence photographs of particles
in impure cell cultures and asserted that not only were they retroviruses,
but they were a specific retrovirus, "HIV."  However, as even Gallo
admits,(11) retroviral-like particles that are not infectious are common in
cultures, especially those subjected to the conditions that Gallo and
Montagnier used in order to cultivate "HIV." Pointing to particles in impure
cell cultures that are viral-like was hardly proof that those particles were
a retrovirus, let alone a specific retrovirus, "HIV."



Thirdly, Gallo and Montagnier offered antibody reactions as proof of
isolation of their virus from AIDS patients. They identified certain
proteins in these cultures as "HIV proteins." This was done not by
extracting those proteins from the viral isolate, because there was no viral
isolate.  They had a soup containing a few virus-like objects and a lot of
contaminating cellular debris.  To decide which proteins extracted from this
mix were from the virus-like objects, they exposed the proteins to blood
samples from both AIDS patients and non-AIDS patients.  If a protein caused
an antibody response from an AIDS patient, and no antibody response from a
non-AIDS patient, they said that one was an "HIV protein." These proteins
were then used in the antibody and Western Blot tests.  A Positive result is
interpreted as indicating the presence of "HIV antibodies."



However, antibodies cross-react, and AIDS patients have a much higher level
of circulating antibodies than in normal, healthy individuals. Thus AIDS
patients were likely to have antibody cross-reactions with any given protein
more often than non-AIDS patients. Also, false positives may be caused by
vaccinations against other diseases or current or past diseases.(12)
Moreover, antibodies can be raised against a non-viral protein, e.g. that of
endogenous nature (arising from within, not from infection). Identification
of certain proteins as "HIV proteins," simply because they reacted with
antibodies of AIDS patients and not non-AIDS patients was insufficient proof
that these proteins were actually from a new virus, "HIV."



The insufficiency of this evidence was first pointed out by Eleni
Papadopulos-Eleopulos, a medical physicist at Australia's Royal Perth
Hospital. In 1988 she published her paper, "Reappraisal of AIDS: Is the
Oxidation Induced by the Risk Factors the Primary Cause?", in which she
stated, "Unlike other viruses [HIV] has never been isolated as an
independent stable particle."(13)  With the recent release of the photos
showing no viral isolation, and Montagnier's admission that ".we did not
purify"(6), it is hard to deny the logic of her argument.



The inability to isolate the virus means no proteins which are viral and
free from contaminants have ever been obtained, thus no one can be certain
what the antibodies are that bind to the proteins. This is the heart of the
problem facing all HIV tests. The manufacturer of the most popular HIV test
kit openly acknowledges, "there is no recognized standard for establishing
the presence or absence of antibodies to HIV in human blood."(14)



So if a positive "HIV" test does not detect antibodies to a virus, why then
is it correlated with a higher incidence of developing AIDS diseases, at
least in high-risk groups?



Eleopulos had noticed a link between the AIDS risk groups in the US and
Europe. Gay men, drug users and haemophiliacs are exposed to foreign semen,
nitrites, illicit drugs and factor VIII (the blood clotting protein that
haemophiliacs must inject). These substances are potent cellular
oxidants.(15) When oxidation is prolonged or excessive, cells become
abnormal, injured and susceptible to diseases.  In Eleopulos' view,
oxidative stress produces biochemical signals that have been misinterpreted
as evidence of a new virus. The immune system produces antibodies in
response to stress, but these antibodies are to products of the disordered
cells, not to an invading virus.

Last night I rented the movie A.I. on video cassette. I presume that
Schpielberg knows more than I about what Joe public is likely to buy, but by
the end of this film I found myself wanting to string him up by the toenails
and tap his balls with a cold spoon. Titanic - good, Private Ryan -
excellent, Schindler's list - bravo, A.I. - come here so I can slap your
fool head off.

>From a Transhumanist perspective, this movie was about as awful as I could
have imagined - a truly uninspiring waste of magnetic storage media. Shame
on you Ray Kurzweil for giving it the general thumbs-up that essentially
inspired me to rent it.  I honestly can't reconcile that view with your
brilliant essay - The Law of Accelerating Returns.

>From the opening, I found myself feeling disappointed. Polar ice caps all
melted - world's low-lying cities flooded, the gap between the have's and
the have not's widened - eww, Schpielberg's been disasterbating all over my
television screen - I feel so violated!  Ever heard of Julian Simon, Steven?
Thought not.

Then a conference room full of engineers. "Well boyz, we're making a fortune
selling these here sex-bots, but I have another idea - let's make a robot
that can really love - unlike this low end' beauty who doesn't even seem to
get offended when you drive a sharp object through her hand."

Next it's cryonics - called cryogenics of course. See Freezer-Boy packaged
in a touchingly frosted Plexiglas cryostat thingy - sans the LN2 and
sleeping bag. And there's his poor tragic mom sniveling away her life in the
apparent far-fetched dream that her son will get better one day. She uses
her handy-dandy transducer to play some nice music for the boy who's
auditory neurons are apparently firing just fine, despite being frozen
solid.

Dad says hey, got an idea! Let's bring home an ultra high-tech Mecha Child
to help cheer up depressed mom. She's a bit bitchy at first, but warms up to
the idea after the creepy little feller - who moves like Kwi Chang Kane,
jumps out and startles her several times and displays some voyeuristic
toilet tendencies. She's apparently sold when she finds out he can make a
great cup of coffee.

Mom utters the magic words that flip on Mecha Child's luuuv circuit' and
things seem real nice for a couple of days. Then, uh oh, Freezer-Boy's been
cured and he's coming home tomorrow! This is sure to spoil the fun for Mecha
Child - you can just tell. Apparently we now have A.I. and Nanotechnology,
but daily life is pretty much same, same.

Freezer-Boy comes home and finds that someone has been sleeping in his bed.
He decides to make artificial life really difficult for Mecha Child. "Eat
spinach and did you spawn from hell! Go snip momma's hair while she's
sleeping, she won't mind a bit. Let's find out who teddy loves more - come
here Teddy." At first I was puzzled as to why Teddy had to have such a
coarse, Fred Sanford kind of voice, until I realized that a sweet voice
would have allowed him to easily steal the show from artificially
not-so-intelligent Mecha Child.

Next some mean boys at the birthday party terrorize Mecha Child. "Save me
little brother! Oops, sorry I nearly drowned you in the swimming pool. But I
panicked - please just love me!"

Dad says - Mecha Child too dangerous now - it's back to the factory for
destruction. Mom has second thoughts, but eventually caves and abandons
Mecha Child in the woods. I just knew she was a bitch. Mecha Child - David,
who now thinks he's Pinocchio in search of the Blue Fairy, if you can
believe it, just keeps right on loving her just the same - much like a dog,
or a pet rabbit might be expected to do.

At this point Schpielberg really gets his futuristic rocks off with some
stunning dystopian  and grotesque imagery. Robotic motorcycle goons on the
rampage round up the poor stupid A.I's who have been living in the wild. I
though the grinning neon wolf's-head bikes were particularly bright when
it's later revealed that the A.I.'s haven't even the capacity to fear public
dismemberment, being fired out of a cannon, or dissolved in acid.

I'll skip forward because this part of the movie didn't seem entirely
realistic.

David eventually finds the blue fairy, busts up the head of a younger
version of himself, tries to commit suicide, gets saved by some silver fish
and a sex-bot named Joe - "hey Joe whaddaya know" - finds another blue
fairy, gets pinned underwater in a flying police helicopter, and goes
catatonic after two thousand years of praying to an inanimate object.

The human race dies out, of course. Anorexic decedents of the (sex-bots?)
revive David and grant his sole wish to bring back his abandoning bitch Mom
for a day of cutesy bonding. But of course, it can only be ONE DAY because
two millenniums after acquiring nanotechnology and advanced A.I. no one
seems to know how to make a cup of coffee strong enough to keep Mom awake
past midnight. (Hey, but wasn't coffee David's specialty? Oh well.)

David is apparently not interested in spending eternity among the advanced
anorexic beings, so he cuddles up next to Mom and shuts himself down. What a
sweet, lovely, deathist ending to a classic piece of cinematic refuse. I
hope this review hasn't spoiled the movie for any of you who were planning
to rent it ;-)

Want to see a good movie tonight? Dig up 'Sirens' with Elle Macpherson, Sam
Neill, and Hugh Grant. A witty, light-hearted romp to lift your spirits.

I agree. This is very very cool.

We've talked about old maps here before. Some folks like the
different projections or, if assuming their accuracy, seeing the
movement of peoples over time. If one relaxes that constraint of
accuracy, I enjoy the maps as an inside head-view of humans' value
systems at particular times in history. The older cartographers were
often artists too, shading and coloring the maps to enhance social,
geographical and political topologies.

My favorite collection of maps, so far, is located in the long
hallway of the Musei Vaticani (*) leading towards the Sistine Chapel.
"La Galleria Delle Carte Geografiche". [Sorry: I've not succeeded
to locate good pics or information on the Web]

Here, the walls of the long hall are covered with frescoed maps
painted by an 'average' Italian painter:Girolamo Danti,(born in
Perugia in 1547, died in 1580). The maps are supposed to represent
the holdings by the Pope at that time in history, so they covered
one portion of the world. Because the land holdings were smaller
than the lands covered by those golden Renaissance maps that we are
usually familiar with, more attention is given to details. For
example: On the 'higher altitude' maps, one often sees trees and
houses and farmland given a subtle, shaded 3D perspective. Not too
much to be an exaggeration, but enough to give the map character and
personality, sometimes humor. Other maps are painted as if flying at
a height of a helicopter, so we see much more detail of the terrain,
i.e. large schooners sailing into bays and lagoons, etc. The colors
are typically rich greens and blues with a lively energy and
movement.


(*) The Vatican Museums.

Some people might be surprised to discover that near the center of
Roman Catholic faith houses one of the world's great collections of
Classical art. Egyptian and Assyrian art, Etruscan art, Greek and
Roman art, Medieval art, and Renaissance art. I find it ironic that
within the Pope's living vicinity are symbols of goddesses and gods
of every kind, from Greek, Egyptian, Etruscan times. These are not
just small rooms either, but major museums. Have you seen a mummy
with your own eyes? If not, you will find two there. The Greek vases
alone encompass about 400 pieces, perhaps the largest collection in
the world.

Since the Attic vases were my 3rd favorite item in the Museums after
Raphael's works (The School of Athens ...) and the Gallery of Maps,
I'll show you a couple pics:

Red-figured bell krater - 125K
http://www.christusrex.org/www1/vaticano/ET2b-Krater.jpg
Obverse, Zeus, Alkmene, Hermes; reverse, two youths
Provenience: Paestan; attributed to the Aestas
Date: c. 350-325 B.C. Aestas painted a scene from a phlyax farce:
Zeus carries a ladder in an attempt to visit one of his loves. The
scene on this vase probably represents Zeus visit to Alkmene, wife
of Amphitrion, who appears at a window. Hermes holds up a lamp at
the right. Phlyax plays are peculiar to the Greek settlements in
Southern Italy.The actors, dressed in humorous costume, burlesque
the adventures of gods and heroes. The scene is bordered with a
geometric pattern. Another vase by the same painter (in the British
Museum) shows the sequel: Zeus is actually climbing the ladder.

White-ground calyx-krater - 207K ;
http://www.christusrex.org/www1/vaticano/ETb-Calyx.jpg
Obverse, Hermes, the infant Dionysos; reverse, a seated Muse playing
the lyre, between two standing Muses
Provenience: Attic; attributed to the Phiale Painter
Date: c. 440-430 B.C. This splendid krater, painted in polychromy on
a white engobe (or slip), is the work of the Phiale painter- the
pupil of the Achilles painter. Like his teacher, he did much work on
lekythoi, continuing the tradition of his master. Hermes brings the
infant Dionysos to Papposilenos; a nymph follows him. The scene of
the presentation of Dionysos is exquisite. The krater is bordered
with floral and geometric patterns. Dionysos was raised by the
nymphs of Nysa and his schooling began very early, as we learn from
a neck-amphora by the Eucharides painter, on which Zeus himself
carries his infant son to a nymph, who is shown with lyre, flute
case and writing tablet.

Greek vases are extra special because they were the first time in the
entire history of art (according to my art history text) that
clearly defined personalities were seen on art pieces.

The Vatican is a sovereign country in and of itself, encompasses
some 108 acres and is completely surrounded by Rome.  It includes
St. Peter's Basilica (the largest church on earth at over six acres)
and the Vatican Museums with over 4-1/2 miles of corridors. As you
might guess, The Pope is *big business*: The Vatican has its own
bank, newspaper, etc etc

Amara


P.S. A few extropes were captured on film (and the extropian
photographer not on film), in the Vatican too:
http://www.amara.com/VaticanExtropes.jpg
That's Anubis the Dog King, on my right, who, in Egyptian times,
supervised the embalming process and guided those to the underworld,
so then the first 'cryonicist' ! He also used to guard souls of
dead people and give mirth and fun to living people.

'Transgenic art, I propose, is a new art form based on the use 
of genetic engineering techniques to transfer synthetic genes 
to an organism or to transfer natural genetic material from one 
species into another, to create unique living beings.
Molecular genetics allows the artist to engineer the plant and 
animal genome and create new life forms. 
The nature of this new art is defined not only by the birth 
and growth of a new plant or animal but above all by the 
nature of the relationship between artist, public, and transgenic 
organism. 
Organisms created in the context of transgenic art can be taken 
home by the public to be grown in the backyard or raised as human 
companions. 
With at least one endangered species becoming extinct every day, 
I suggest that artists can contribute to increase global biodiversity 
by inventing new life forms.'

Im definately not renting that now, I thought the ignorant and dystopian

rather watch 'Battlefield Earth'... Thanks for the wawrning.

I'm not qualified to evaluate the arguments pro and con on the linkage
between AIDS and HIV.  I am not a biochemist, virologist, epidemiologist,
or a member of any of the other scientific communities which have
investigated this issue and have become convinced that the linkage
is valid.

However, I do have confidence in the working of the scientific method
and the scientific community.  Scientists make mistakes, but there are
many institutional mechanisms for correction.  Otherwise science would
never have propelled us into this rapidly-changing world.

It's been almost 20 years since the HIV hypothesis was advanced as
the cause of AIDS.  From what I read, the connection is more strongly
accepted today than ever.  The drop in AIDS mortality due to the use of
reverse transcriptase inhibitors is exactly what was predicted by the
conventional theory.

If the arguments against the HIV hypothesis were really as good as the
AIDS revisionists claim, I am confident that the real experts in the
field, people who have devoted their entire working lives to studying
and understanding the issues, would be persuaded.  For a layman to
second-guess them and assume that they are stupid or dishonest is IMO
an unwise strategy for understanding the world.

Are our ideas and goals served by ignoring what other people think about
us or even ignoring them? I would say definitely no to that. In fact,
this tendency to regard "us" transhumanists as the enlightened few who
"get" it and the rest as either uneducated, mistaken or a luddite
opposition is one of the factors keeping transhumanist ideas from
becoming mainstream. If you have already decided the others won't get
it, you will not think much about ways of helping them get it. If you
regard them as irrelevant, you also end up regarding their economic,
political and research impact as irrelevant. Sure, stuff we like may be
developed by other people, but if transhumanists do not spread their
ideas the development will be aimed by other memes - memes that most
likely will be against transhumanist ideals. 

Saying technology is the driver puts the cart in front of the horse. It
leaves out the circular interplay of technology and culture, and makes
for a simplistic view that technology will advance of its own and that
it will create a cultural climate amenable to the things we desire.
Reading up on the history of technology and ideas is a good way of
dispelling this simple view. 

I have just arrived home from a meeting where I and two fellow
transhumanists presented our latest book. Not a book obviously screaming
"transhumanism is good! hack your genes!" but instead showing how the
debate about genetic engineering have developed the last 30 years and
what we can learn from it so that the upcoming debate about
nanotechnology and other radical technologies will not become the
polarized mess we currently find ourselves in. It was well received by a
fairly broad bunch of reasonably influential Swedish decisionmakers,
businesspeople and journalists - exactly the mainstream we seek to
influence in order to get towards a transhuman society. A small step in
the right direction, slowly building a case that will help people
integrate ideas of technological transformation into their worldview. 
But for this to work we have to dress in suits and ties, learn to
explain why freedom, technology and progress are good things and show
that our vision is not just realistic but also the right thing to do.

I disagree. You are mixing up the two senses the word human can be used
in: as denoting homo sapiens, and as denoting the important parts of
rational subjects. If you look at the original humanist ideas, you will
find that they are not dependent on the subjects to belong to the
species homo sapiens - that is just implicitely assumed since there were
no ther examples around. Pico Della Mirandola's discussion of human
dignity suggests as a fundamental human trait our ability to change
ourselves according to our will and knowledge. I hardly expect that you
seek to remove that trait from yourself as a posthuman. The humanist
concept of human is rather an entity with rational abilities, that acts
as a free moral subject and has the potential to grow - it could just as
well apply to AIs, aliens or uplifted animals. 

If you regard transhumanism as a move away from humanity, it would be
interesting to hear what you consider it as a move *towards*, and why
that move is desirable for human individuals.

So I guess you don't believe in Christian transhumanists? :-)

I think assuming transhumanists to be genetically different or the
result of some special revelation overthrowing the illusions plaguing
the rest of humanity is quite premature. It is just a convenient and
self-congratulatory way of isolating oneself. Assuming this you don't
need to spread your ideas to other people (either they save themselves
or they are automatically lost). Combined with the idea that people will
become transhumanists when enough transhuman tech has appeared it means
you can just sit around waiting for the rapture - there is no point in
doing anything outwards, not even in enlightened self-interest. 

I consider this to be a serious mistake. In the past many other groups
have reached roughly similar ideas - the Czech communists in the late
30's, the objectivists, plenty of cults - and the results have been
generally disastrous. The groups that ended up controlling the meme pool
were those who talked to people, that got involved in society and
articulated their visions.

I am not a doctor either, but I have been a professional bullshit
detector in other fields, and most of this AIDS-is-not-HIV stuff sets
off my alarms pretty heavily.  The stuff from the Perth Group looks
like the straining-at-gnats-and-swallowing-camels variety; they
deride the scientific consensus for not having unquestionable ironclad
proof of their contentions, then offer alternatives for which there
is only the slightest suggestion of relevance.

As Eli put it, you shouldn't have to squint hard to see reality: it
should slap you in the face.  What slaps us in the face about AIDS is
that 99.9% of those who have the tell-tale symptoms test positive with
the test developed by those following the HIV hypothesis.  It also
slaps us in the face that _millions_ of people who have the disease
in places where things like AZT aren't available die, pretty much
without exception and on schedule, while folks like Magic Johnson are
still making the talk show circuit.

It doesn't really matter much to me if "popular" researchers may not
be dotting their i's and crossing their t's the way some might like.
The overwhelming evidence is that they're on the right track.

He met Janet at an SF con, of all places (what else would you expect
from the guy?) when he was still married to wife number 1. The divorce
hit the New York tabloids when it was discovered that the pulp sci-fi
author, in the 1960's, was earning over $100,000 a year (though most of
that was from his science writing, not his SF).

As if Asimov was ever any good at avoiding being controversial (or
tooting his own horn). He was the sort who took an impish delight in
being immodest (for, after all, modesty is for those with something to
be modest about...).

My first response to anyone who totally pans a movie is to suggest that 
they try making a movie. It is *really* hard. It is even harder to do in a 
way that affects people, as this one did for an heck of a lot of people.

I am sure Steven Spielberg wasn't making this movie with the intention of 
satisfying a small number of people who think the future will be just 
peachy-keen (I include myself in that number). I believe that, apart from 
making a work of art to play a tune on people's heartstrings, he was trying 
to sound a number of warnings. Mary Shelly was wrong about using 
electricity to re-animate a dead person, but that doesn't make her warnings 
about arrogance and cowardice any less important. Unlike her, I think 
re-animation of a dead person is a potentially wonderful event, but her 
warnings are still important.

Spielberg's points are similarly important. I don't think humans are very 
likely to eliminate themselves, and I doubt emotions could be easily 
switched on, but there were a lot of other messages in the film. For 
instance, if people become locked into seeing AIs as just tools then we 
will be making a big mistake -- they will eventually have a mental life of 
their own... even if that life is not really human or some kind of 
caricature of humanity, it will still be a valid experience. He shows that 
nicely in the little AI-boy's search for the blue fairy. He is stunted at 
the stage of a young child forever.

Remember also that this is still art. Although tragic it is still a real 
experience for for the AI boy. Think of how Romeo and Juliet suicide -- it 
didn't need to happen, it's remarkably unlikely, and while watching it you 
don't want it to happen, but it is done for the sake of the story, not so 
that you or I can feel good. That is what tragedy is.

As for your comment that in the glittering future presented in the film, 
everything remains the same as now, but with tinkering at the technological 
edges. I believe that is one of Spielberg's main messages. Look at how 
people conducted themselves 1,000 years ago. Much has remained the same. 
Yes, much is better, especially technology, but things have remained 
largely the same socially. Large parts of the world's population still live 
effectively as indentured slaves for their entire lives. We few live as 
royalty did. I don't share Spielberg's dystopian view, but it doesn't 
reduce its value as a warning, just as George Orwell's 1984, or the 
original Rollerball film (wonder what the new one will be like) were very 
important warnings.

Condemming Spielberg's vision for having pretty icing doesn't stick either. 
He got the topic on the agenda of ordinary folk. It saddens me that he 
scared a lot of them... but at least he did get it out there and showed 
people how mechanoids could have *real* internal lives. This is important.

Beware of dismissing something simply because it doesn't fit with your own 
view or because some technicalities might be awry.

Cheers,

         - Miriam

redux: The last time no extropians - besides moi - showed, although there were some digerati at the next table who said that they knew extropians.  Altho I was expecting a packed venue, I think that the LA Olympics syndrome came into play, and all the hype resulted in a low turnout, all trying to avoid a packed venue, natch.  It would have been a near ideal meeting place.  This time, who knows?

I plan to be there at least (the short muscular guy with the beard, the orange motorcycle helmet, the backback). 

A local libertarian objectivist web designer, FOI-hacker friend first introduced me to this band.  They are really quite original and good - think Neil Young, maybe Moody Blues with mideastern minor keying mixed in, really rich, intricat melodies and complex lyrics, heavy on the romantic side, but with really high energy.  Not so loud that you can't carry on a conversation - outside anyway.

The coffee and food are also quite good and very reasonably priced.  This place is a local hangout for the digerati as well as a crew of science fiction fans.  

You might want to bring your MP3 recorder, if you have one.  Here's the email notice I received.  If you go to the band's site, be prepared to be underwhelmed by the online music.  Ditto their CDs, unfortunately.  They just haven't mastered recording, I guess.  The live music, however, is tremendous.

Just a quick observation:

She's staying at home here we us, back from the hospital after a close call
with the grim reaper. We have to be around. She wouldn't take a shower until
I got back. I walk down the hallway. Normally obsessive about privacy, she
has left the bathroom door unlocked. I realise she thinks I may want to get
in in a hurry - she knows everything she does may be the last thing she
does. She's brave.

It sucks.

She can be a real bane. She drives my wife nuts. She'll never make a top
quark or cure aids, but it still sucks.

Mother-in-law jokes aside, it's just gotta be fixed. She should be able to
go when she damn well wants to.

Agree with Miriam on this point (but also - from the depths of my inner
polymath child - agree with much of what Russell Evermore wrote).  In order
to make a successful commercial movie that will appeal to a multitude of
people, one has to relate it to the lot of them.  I saw AI from my own
transhumanist-materialistic (aah, long-ago-jaded) eyes, but I also saw it
from my grandchildren's eyes, and my coworkers' eyes.  If nothing else, a
movie like AI is valuable in giving inspiration to discussion - old subjects
with new spins, as well as totally new subjects and new perspectives.  How
to get people to stand up and listen? = "Let's talk!"

Similarly, I was disappointed with Contact - it wussed out, IMO.  But it was
a successful commercial movie, which not only portrayed an atheist (count
the movies on one hand with an atheist as the main character)... but an
atheist who actually didn't end up needing a lobotomy (remember "Frances?").

Julian Simon?  Most people have neither heard of Julian Sands nor Paul
Simon, much less Julian Simon.

I read this somewhere recently ... something about how we live in a society
that has never made a movie about Leonardo da Vinci, but has produced three
movies about Joe Buttafucco.

Playing them is semi-permanent.  Getting rid of them...you can shuffle
them into the deck, but the only "discarded" things are Unbans and Bans
once they cancel each other out.  Reason: for any given tech, you may be
given the opportunity to implement it...but if you pass, someone else
eventually will.  Your choice is now vs. later.

Umm...actually, I'm deliberately limiting the number of Bans and Unbans
to make this infeasable.  Sit back, only banning stuff...you can do that
for a while, but there's only so much of that kind of political capital
floating around.  If that's all you do, then eventually, you'll run out
and the world will start progressing without you.

Though a related possibility: try to invoke one of the three types of
Catastrophes.  Three players only, of course.

Problems:
* Biotech only - ok, we've upgraded our bodies, but we're still limited
   to that which we can produce biologically, or mine and refine by
   relatively crude industrial processes.  Our minds are not any more
   advanced; neither do we have companions or aides much smarter than
   ourselves to call upon.  Life remains mostly predictable, though
   much longer.
* Nanotech only - without AI to control the nano, only crude processing
   is possible.  (Diamondoid space elevators?  Sure.  Nanites to repair
   cellular damage?  Maybe...and a single cell at a time, as controlled
   by a person.  Anything more complex than that?  Nope.)  And we,
   ourselves, remain mostly unchanged from our current forms.  Life
   remains mostly predictable, though we do have more neat toys.
* Robo/AI only - our bright children, the AIs, may theorize and
   philosophize all they want...but without nanotech or biotech to
   synthesize things, manufacturing costs mean their ideas for changing
   the world take years to implement, just like Big Ideas do today, thus
   limiting the pace of significant change.  In addition, previously
   existing humans can not join the advanced intelligences, for we do not
   know how to merge them and us, or how to make either side become the
   other.  Life for humans remains almost totally unchanged; even any
   given AI does not usually experience radical change over the course of
   a few days.

The core concept is the purity of each type, to the negligence of the
others.  The solution to most problems is, in part, to find and develop
(and apply) a solution to the problem...which, in this context,
translates to more tech to solve imbalances in previously deployed tech.

I'm also thinking of perhaps more Event cards like High Tech Terrorist,
embodying other ways that the world could destroy itself...unless
society has deployed solutions to stop that way first.  True, few people
would want to play such a card deliberately...but the deck itself cares
not for which cards come from it when it is the world's turn.

As implemented by a limited number of Ban and Unban cards.

What you describe is not so different from the robo Catastrophe: a
mindless machine wiping out free humanity; the machine just happens to
be composed of organic robots instead of metallic/plastic/ceramic ones.
Given as AI would be required to effectively implement such a scheme
worldwide, I'd say the robo Catastrophe more or less covers it...though
perhaps I should note that explicitly.

See above about game-ending Event cards.  Banned technologies would not
exist so far as said cards are concerned.

The base target is mere introduction to the concept of Singularity, and
a mild blessing of it as a good target.  Again, if you wish to develop a
game that looks at the social realities of deploying certain specific
technologies, go ahead.  Such a game might be viewed as what happens
when, in the SCG's abstraction, someone just plays a certain Technology
card, or maybe a few cards.

Some of us do, despite the efforts of those humans who see our visions
as the biggest threat to life and limb currently in existence, and act
accordingly.  It's hard to care for those who not only trying to kill
you*, but utterly discredit everything you believe in...but some of us
manage it.

* Not exaggerating here, BTW.  I have received death threats over my
beliefs in the past.  That I do not now, I attribute mostly to the fact
that I have learned not to associate with people who would do such a
thing.

> that we naively

Depends on how broadly or narrowly one defines "technology".  Is it
technology when one discovers a better way to live, if that way just
happens to require certain modern inventions in order to be practical?

 > or that we have unsavory
 > social visions we do not reveal.

See above.  I envision life radically enhanced by new technologies, with
material prices dropped through the floor compared to current levels,
where anyone can modify their own bodies as they please, and ability for
anyone to be beyond the reach of the law if they choose (so long as they
do not harm anyone under the law's protection).  This would classify me
as a dangerous lunatic in any social circle that believes in keeping
control over everyone, therefore prudence demands that I not reveal it
in most cases.

Well, those literary agents can go to HELL!  Thats the joke, in the
Cannery Row trilogy, that the bums were so proper and spoke
such high Spanish.  It was hilarious irony.

Steinbeck's work lent dignity to the very poor.  In Grapes of Wrath,
the Joads were just the kind of people you would want on your side in
times of adversity.  They were smart, hard working, they never gave
up.  I found it a tremendously moving story, probably his second
best novel.

Ja.  What I would like to see is sci-fi written with the some of the
emotional impact that Steinbeck somehow managed to put into his
work.  Card's Enders Game goes part way down that road, but I
would consider it only mediocre as a sci-fi story.

Somebody point me to sci-fi with real FEELING.  spike

The problem with this is then you have to completely give up judging
anybody or anything.  E.g., you can't say a restaurant serves bad/boring
dishes and has bad decor and service unless you're a restauranteur.  Or,
on another note, you can't criticize the free market economy unless you
build an economy yourself.:)

That said, I did agree with your statement:

That's probably a first between you and I.:)

No, what is keeping us from become mainstream is precisely because other

Correct.

Not necessarily - that doesn't follow.  They are irrelevant in the sense 
that what they believe is not relevant.  What they do is relevant only in 
the sense that we must be prepared to deal with it regardless of what they 
do.  If they assist us, all good, if not, we deal with it.  But it is a 
misallocation of resources to try to convince them ALL of the value of 
Transhumanism.

I don't see it as a misallocation of resources to *promote* Transhumanism, 
as long as we realize that the purpose is to attract those who *can* 
understand and who *can* contribute.  But trying to convince the world that 
Transhumanism is the future will merely relegate us to cult status or 
worse, wake the states of the world up to the threat to their existence and 
bring down even more oppression.

We need to spread our memes to those who *can* understand and who 
*can*  develop what we need.  And if necessary we need to find ways to get 
the others to develop what we need - by whatever appeals (to greed, or 
whatever) work.

It will.  In this century, technology will *subsume* culture.  Oh, of 
course, culture will have its influence initially.  And saying that 
"technology can advance on its own" makes no sense - obviously there has to 
be motivation and intent - whether corporate greed or the love of 
discovery; the point is that the research will continue to be done.  And it 
will influence the culture if people who are interested in that make it so 
- such as the special effects in movies, or even the Net games being 
discussed in other threads.  But I do not assume nor do I require that it 
influence the culture enough to make Transhumanism mainstream.  That is a 
simplistic notion.

I do not mix up the terms.  Humans can refer to the species as a whole, or 
to six billion individuals, each of which behaves somewhere on a wide 
spectrum of behavior and belief affected by their genes, their upbringing, 
their physical and cultural environment, etc. As for the important parts of 
rational subjects, I do not believe Ayn Rand's definition of the term 
"human" has been accepted by the scientific community.  Most scientists 
would agree, I suspect, that man's capacity for conceptual processing is 
the distinguishing factor between human and animal. But many would not so 
agree.  They are probably quite wrong, but the point is there are many 
scientists who would disagree.  Most scientists would probably define human 
using what is strictly known by science and would hesitate to include 
aspects of the human mind which are imperfectly understand.  Once we get 
the neuroscience down, it's another story.  But the vast majority of 
non-scientists, if asked, would probably be incapable of defining their 
humanity except in emotional and religious terms.

I presume you mean by this that the ideas by extension must therefore apply 
to Transhumans.  I am not sure about this.  I suspect not.  In any event, 
the ideas' applicability  would have to be assessed on an individual basis. 
I suspect the original humanists really had not idea about Transhumanism in 
a concrete sense, and in any event they are so wrapped up in the "human" 
(or *their* notion of the human) that they have no clue about what might be 
in a Transhuman's nature.

"Fundamental" trait?  I am not sure about that.

No, but the trait does not equate to the whole of what it means to be 
human.  Nor is it certain that such a trait is "fundamental" to humans.  In 
fact, it the trait is included in Transhumans, and I do expect that to the 
case, it is by definition not necessarily "human" at all.  If the trait is 
motivated by the feat of death, it may be human.  If the trait is motivated 
by the rational desire for continuity of existence, it may not be a human 
trait.

Fine, that is the humanist concept, and I have no problem with that.  But 
that is not what most *humans* mean by the term "human."

It is a move toward invulnerability, invincibility, and hence immortality 
(leaving out the question of whether "eternal life" is feasible in the 
physical universe).  In other words, it is a move toward continuity of 
existence - survival.  If that is not desirable for humans, I don't know 
what is.  The fear of death i(and its polar corollary the desire for life) 
is the basis of most animal and human reactions.  The problem is that 
humans still have animal reactions from their evolutionary heritage - the 
"fight or flight" syndrome - and most humans display flight response - 
which in a human context is the least functional way to insure human survival.

I believe that anyone can convince themselves that any mixed-up concept is 
correct.  After all, as I indicated previously, the Gnostics were 
Transhumanists, as were the Taoists, in some sense.  But I cannot agree 
that a Christian who believes in a personal (or for that matter, an 
impersonal) deity can be considered a Transhumanist.  There may be people 
who call themselves Transhumanists who DO believe such a Christian is 
justified in calling himself a Transhumanist.  That's their problem.  I do 
not accept Christians as being Transhumanists regardless of whether they 
support nanotech, or life extension, or whatever.  Their fundamental belief 
structure is based on the fear of death, not on the rational desire to 
survive - and that in my view is a fundamental belief of a 
Transhumanist.  If you're not doing this stuff to survive, what are you 
doing it for?  Fun?  Well, fine, if you develop something I can use and you 
do it for "fun", I still get the stuff, so I don't care.  But such a person 
's  spiritual development is flawed, because they do not understand their 
nature and their place in the universe and that flaw is contra-survival.

It can be, I'm sure.  Note that when I say it might be due to "genetic 
differences", I merely mean that it is possible (not proven yet, I believe) 
that people have varying temperaments and capabilities and predilections 
toward certain behavior and attitudes that are a result of their 
genes.  It's no different than being physically attractive (albeit the 
cultural notion of what constitutes physical attraction changes) - the 
question is:  what do you do with it?

As to "special revelation",  this comes when you think seriously about what 
it means to say that all values come from life, and that survival is 
therefore the primary value.  This has *corollaries*  - as do the facts of 
evolution and the facts of life on this planet and in human society. To 
determine the necessary course of action based on this can be considered a 
"revelation" - but simply because it *does* become the basis of one's 
philosophy.  Especially when you consider that the bulk of the human race 
has NO CLUE.

That doesn't follow.  I don't believe people will become Transhumanists 
when the tech appears (although that *could* happen).  Certainly some 
people will benefit from new tech without doing anything - I certainly 
didn't design and build the computer I'm typing this on.  But if I want to 
survive, I have to take responsibility for my survival. which means I have 
to at least go out and do something to earn the money to buy the tech, or 
go out and learn about the tech so I can use it, or (preferably) go and do 
something to make the tech precisely because it is not a good idea to wait 
around for "humanists" (who are wrapped up in numerous other pointless 
issues) to do it.

No, the groups that ended up controlling the meme pool were those who 
*could* talk to the people because they operated on the same irrational, 
emotional basis as most people do.  And those who tried to use reason to 
oppose those people didn't succeed precisely because of that.

And I think too much is made of this "meme" idea of Dawkins - memes are NOT 
physical viruses that suddenly and totally change the thinking of someone 
exposed to them.  A lot of people talk about memes in a very loose and 
logically shoddy manner.

Good post, Anders.  Gave me a chance to rant a bit and that always helps 
clarify my thinking - :-}

I didn't hear Miriam say "you can't criticize x...". I heard her say "try
x...".
These are distinct things. She indicates, at most, that "total pan" criticism
of x comes easier when you haven't tried to accomplish x. 

Do you dispute that point? If so, on what basis? What informs your decision?
Is someone who has never even tried to create a movie, or even write a page of
screenplay, somehow _better_ qualified to totally pan a movie?

And a movie is not at all the same as a meal at a restaurant. Meals at
restaurants must be served more or less at an arranged time, on demand. The
closest analogy to that in the film world would be criticizing a specific
venue/showing of a movie, e.g. the 5:10 showing of AI at the Oaks Theater in
Cupertino on March 5, 2002. And I have done that sort of criticism: poor
focus, low illumination, etc. have caused me to ask for my money back.

That said, it's a truism that a restaurant can't afford to have a "bad day".

And it *is* sad when a movie obviously has had a ton of money thrown at it and
fails to satisfy. Examples abound.

I agree with the non-panners that AI, like Vanilla Sky, at least gives one a
place to stand when discussing the issues raised. I agree that both have
flaws. I also think that they both "work" to _some_ degree, even if neither
one is a movie *I* would have made.

Totally panning a movie (or other work) frequently tells far more about the
reviewer than about the movie. I guess you could say that I generally totally
pan "total pan" reviews. Sue me, it's just my opinion.

ObConfession: 

I used to hate _The Stars My Destination_ because of an utter science gaffe in
the first part of the book--gravitation of small objects being observable at
close range in a short time. I changed my mind. The rest of the story more
than makes up for it.

I still hate _Lord of the Flies_ because of a fundamental science gaffe in it.
The difference is, the author of _Lord of the Flies_ could have easily
_checked_ whether nearsighted peoples' glasses focus light to a burning
point--he just didn't *bother*. And if Piggy isn't both nearsighted *and*
"useful" because of his glasses, the entire story falls apart. *BZZZT*. Up
with _that_ I will not put.

Hemimyopically yours,

MMB

Ah, well, I guess I won't be seeing it ever, either.  I just *knew* it was 
going to be like that when I learned that "A.I" had something to do with 
some damned kid!  What the hell does A.I. have to do with making an 
artificial kid and then teaching him to "love"?  Oh, sure, AI can include 
"artificial consciousness" or "artificial life" or even "artificial 
emotions" (see Brent Spiner on ST:TNG), but why the hell do we need 
artificial KIDS?  Don't we have enough of the REAL kind?  What a contrived 
story.  Spielberg and kids - I never saw Schindler's List but I suppose he 
has kid nazis in that one, too - :-}

Actually, Ellie Arroway was an "agnostic" (albeit the distinction in her 
case was probably entirely intellectual).

My favorite character in the movie was John Hurt's billionaire.  That 
there's a cool guy - flies around in a high-tech airplane, never sets down 
except to affect some critical situation,  invests in good-looking lady 
scientists, is way ahead of everybody on what's going on, and may have been 
the one who set the whole thing up in the first place.  Actually, the 
ending was a glaring hole.  While I buy that the government would try to 
cover up the whole thing by blaming the billionaire, in reality, it would 
never hold up. First, how could he or his scientists design a machine that 
the rest of the world's scientists couldn't figure out?  Secondly, after 
his death, somebody in on it would have blown the whistle on it if it was a 
hoax.  Third, he knew he was dying, what was the point?

Actually, the way Contact wussed out was to reduce the entire issue to a 
question of "faith".  I really doubt that Carl Sagan intended it that way, 
although I have never read the book.

The movie was moderately successful - cost $95 million to make, grossed 
$170 worldwide.  Not that good for the cost.  What really irritated me (as 
someone who really likes Jodie Foster) was here she carried a two-hour, 
twenty-minute movie on her back, delivered a dynamite performance that 
never missed, and she gets totally ignored at the Oscars for a bunch of 
British chicks playing - guess what - British chicks...  (Dame Dench gets a 
nomination for a seven-minute walk-on playing Queen Elizabeth WHICH SHE DID 
THE SAME ROLE THE YEAR BEFORE!  I believe that when the current queen dies, 
Dame Dench will be made queen and get an automatic Oscar every year 
thereafter...)

Schpielberg had nothing to do with Titanic.

Don't be silly, the movie makes no suggestion that the frozen boy can hear
anything, or think anything.

No movie can provide a realistic depiction of life when we have AI and
Nanotechnology because nobody, absolutely nobody, has any idea what
things will be like then, that's why it's called a singularity.

It has to be dark, things have to go wrong, a film where everything was
peachy keen would bore everybody to death, the important thing is that
it was stunning.

Well OK, I didn't like the one day bit either, but it was only the last 5 minutes
of the film and didn't ruin the other 3 hours for me, it was still the best movie
I've seen in years.

I recently had the pleasure of using a very slick piece of software: A fully
zoomable globe, rendered in navigable 3D terrain including buildings and
other artificial structures, with resolutions that vary from 30-meters to
1-m depending where on the globe you are.  It is very cool to be able to
smoothly zoom in from a view of the world from a moon's distance away to a
helicopter's eye view of Tokyo in full relief.  Even though the vast
majority of the world is still at 30-meter resolution (though this is
quickly changing), it is still pretty damn cool that you can take a detailed

In the case of Golding, Piggy's glasses and his nearsightedness are

Extropes,

I waited for this movie with great anticipation.  I'm
a huge Kubrick fan, and of course, intensely
interested in the AI concept, and in seeing it handled
with an authentic futurist's informed view of the
subject.  

Clearly, I was hoping for more than could reasonably
be expected, so I have only myself to blame.  I hated
what I saw.  I was incensed.  I came away from the
theatre repeating one word repeatedly:  infantile.
Robodisney meets ET.  Mechano Toy Story meets Running
Man.  Science Fiction at the speed of stupid, with
human dilemma/character complexity courtesy of Barbie
and Ken at Tammy Fae Baker's Cosmetology Hootenanny. 
Suckage that puts a black hole to shame. 

Kubrick was an adult.  He was sophisticated.  He was
intellegent.  He was a master of subtlety and detail.

Spielberg clearly knows how to assemble a great movie.
 But he has the intellectual sophistication and
emotional maturity of a thirteen year old, no,...a ten
year old,...just turned 10.  "The horror,...the
horror."

Since Private Ryan, and Amsitad and Schindler's List
were clearly adult movies, and great movies, I would
ask this question, "In these movies where did the
story come from, and who wrote the script?" It can not
possibly be the same person who wrote AI. 

Elvis may be alive.  And Hoffa.  But Kubrick is surely
dead, lucky guy.

Best, Jeff Davis

Okay, this is a definition I can understand - a right is a sanction against 
interference with one's actions. It's shorthand meaning "don't coerce" - 
but we can say that directly - so why do we need the concept "right"?

Maybe we should be defining the term "coercion" instead of the term 
"right"?  When we understand what coercion is - and its economic analysis 
of its effects on society - maybe we won't need the concept "right"...

In other words, the economic impact of coercion is a reduction of the rate 
of return on the investment in coercion to the general rate of return - as 
I indicated elsewhere in my posts re rights.

Now, here, we presume the concept of morality as a given. I don't find the 
concept useful.  As someone in the Libertarian Connection years ago, libs 
tend to view morality as a set of heuristics to be followed to maximize 
utility in a social context - but most people view morality as a set of 
rules enforced by guilt.

"Science of values"?  I don't think so.  While striving for a "science of 
values" may be a laudable goal, you have a ways to go logically to 
demonstrate that this translates into anything people recognize as 
"morality".  And I'm not sure the notion "science of values" has any useful 
meaning any more than the term "morality" does.  It sounds like defining 
"Tweedledum" as meaning "Tweedledee"...  There is ONE primary value - 
survival.  Every other value simply depends on how that value contributes 
to the achievement of the primary value.  To call this "science" is 
unnecessary - the "science" lies in all human knowledge, especially the 
actual physical sciences, economics, etc.  We don't need a "science of 
values" except to keep philosophers like Rand off Welfare (or script 
reading - her profession in the early years)

Most references to morality - including Rand, I believe - do not limit the 
term "immoral" to notions of conflicts in personal values, but precisely to 
social actions which you assign to the province "ethics". Note that I do 
believe Rand considered not following a rational course of action to be 
"immoral", as well.  But the primary purpose of morality in Rand and 
everyone else is to denounce somebody else's behavior in a social context.

If you can characterize someone's behavior as being not in his objective 
best interests, why bother to call it "immoral"?  Is this not again 
expanding concepts beyond need?  What is the actual purpose of calling 
someone "immoral" - is it not to by extension define oneself as "moral"  - 
and therefore superior?  Is this not merely the same old, same old 
Darwinian primate competition motivated by the fear of death?  If you are 
right, I am wrong; if I am wrong, I am dead - and that cannot be 
allowed.  That is how humans think...

i.e., optimizes the rate of return in non-coercion and reduces the rate of 
return in investing in coercion - as I have stated.  However, simple 
economic analysis does this - once again, why do we need the concept of 
"rights" ?  Is the concept of "rights" merely a pre-economic, 
pre-scientific concept that has been superseded by science and 
economics?  I think sooooo....

Ah, I would hesitate to say that the notion of ethics has been "successful" 
in controlling the behavior of the population vrs many other factors, 
especially fear.  I think this has been discussed many times in many 
places, so I won't delve into it here.

Ah, yes, Brandon's "visibility" notion.  I have no problem with that concept.

Agreed.  This is basic - species only cooperate (or predate) when evolution 
has put them in that niche.  Humans have wider behavior capabilities, of 
course, so we dredge up the notion of "animal rights" - any animal, if it 
could understand the concept, would laugh at it....

A very good exposition of my point about the economic effects of coercion 
and investment in coercion.  Agreed.  Again, since this can be established 
by known economic facts about the behavior of humans in a social context, 
what do we need the concept of "rights" for?   Just to enumerate all the 
individual ways we should not coerce?  Or sum them up as "short-hand"?

I like the first definition.  I'm not sure it's a *good* definition (i.e., 
encapsulates the essential characteristics of the notion), but I like the 
idea.  If you are truly powerful, as well, you should not need to hide 
anything (except your security precautions from enemies and your immediate 
plans from your competitors).

Agreed.  My concept of the economic effects of coercion, again.  And more 
importantly, the *social* consequences of the idea of the state as a 
monopoly on the use of coercion.  The limited state justifications put 
forth by Rand and others are entirely irrational and incorrect.  The 
Austrian economic theory that Rand relied on clearly demonstrates that 
there is no such thing as a "non-coercive monopoly" (so-called "natural" 
monopolies must compete against equivalent technologies).  And because a 
monopoly by definition cannot have competitors, the notion of a "limited" 
state is impossible - ALL states MUST be imperialistic until there is only 
ONE state society-wide.

Agreed - although I don't agree that the concept of "rights" is necessary, 
the basis for any form of social behavior must be objective.  In my view, 
economic analysis of the effects of coercion on social interactions between 
sentient entities is sufficiently objective to qualify.

Two comments:

1)  Even in a lifeboat situation, economic analysis and the objective real 
world indicate that "two heads are better than one" - EVEN when it seems 
that two heads are worse than one...  Even Rand did not reason that one out 
correctly.  She accepted the notion that a lifeboat situation in which 
ethical conduct was not possible could exist - I don't.  I believe that 
EVEN in a lifeboat situation, coercion is non-productive as compared to 
non-coercion.  I can't give you a precise economic analysis at this point, 
but I'm sure there is one - after all, two makes a society...

2)  "Rights are a way of conceptualizing" - so are other concepts.  The 
problem, again, is the baggage, the lack of precision, and the lack of 
enforcement capability that the concept of "rights" entails.

>   Both from a purely practical materialistic economic basis and from 
> profound psychological needs, we need a structure of ethics based on rights

We need to have a means to induce people to act in accordance with their 
objective best interests and their objective need to survive in a social 
context.  I'm not sure we need any structure other than the principle of 
non-coercion and the social structure to adjudicate disputes in some 
reasonably scientific manner...  And this society has neither... And won't 
while human beings behave as they do...

>- our ability to deny someone else the option to interfere with us.

"Rights" do not give you the *ability* - they give you a 
*justification*.  Not the same thing at all - especially when your opponent 
does not accept your "right" and you do not have the power to coerce him to 
do so.

>   All rights are both a right to action - based on our fundamental need 
> to act freely in order to survive and prosper - and a right to property, 
> if only in our own bodies.

So we need freedom to act and property - now, again,  why do we call these 
"rights" instead of "obvious needs" or "economic needs" or "behavioral 
needs" or whatever?

>Rights then are a fundamental part of the structure of society that makes 
>civil society,and thus honorable behavior, and thus real emotional 
>interaction, and thus personal visibility, and thus long-term sanity and

I would say the above substituting the word "non-coercion" for the word 
"rights"...

Primarily, what you've said is that if you beat up on an animal, he won't 
like you and he won't behave well towards you or do what you want him to do 
- just like a human.  And just like a human, extending these simple 
concepts into "rights" is unnecessary and counter-productive - you end up 
with the PETA fanatics...

I'm not convinced uploading has any value except as an emergency measure to 
stave off physical destruction while one still has a biological body.

Uploading by definition means that you are confined to a system which is 
less than the physical universe and subject to the effects of the physical 
universe, i.e., you do not have the freedom to move around in space-time or 
access the physical resources of the universe.  Even if you assume that the 
system you are in has widely-spread nodes across star systems or whatever, 
and can access physical resources via telepresence or robotic agents, you 
are still metaphysically limited.  This is not the situation a Transhuman 
wants to be in.

I suspect that a lot of people like the notion because it is the 
"scientific" equivalent of "Heaven"...

Now, once a Transhuman has achieve some Omega end-point in development, if 
such exists, and has nothing better to do than create alternative universes 
and explore those ad infinitum, then maybe the "temporary" immersion in 
such a system would be understandable - so long as they have the option to 
get out if threatened - assuming it is possible to threaten such an entity...

How long in time is sustainable?  Care to point to such in history?  Agree 
(I think) about the "class parasitism", if I understand what you mean.

"Justice" - another useless term...

The argument here is "property rights" vrs "property use rights" - I won't 
go into it here since I don't remember the details.  Most such situations 
in societies are solved via one form of "social contract" or another 
(including coercive ones) and they are in constant flux based on the 
economic and social realities.  "Justice" has almost no bearing on the result.

I personally think that the notion of "property use rights" i.e., 
I  control the property I am *using*,  with some acceptable social notion 
of use, is better than the notion that I control property that I *claim* 
and perhaps even property that I "create" - the latter is hard to apply to 
simple unimproved land...

Much as you see in the world around you...

The SubGenius "believe"  that the Earth is a rented planet - and humans are 
not listed on the lease. We have the status of household mildew...  This 
actually agrees with my theory of UFOs as a Transhuman civilization 
existing co-existent with us.  THEY are the dominant civilization on this 
planet - not us...  They do what they want - and we don't even notice it 
most of the time...

Professor Michio Kaku said on Art Bell one night that our relationship to a 
true galactic civilization would be like an ant colony next to a four-lane 
highway - we wouldn't even recognize it...

Well, you know, humans have to demonstrate socially that they are morally 
superior to everyone else by paying lip service to the "human" values of 
compassion, etc.  Meanwhile, subsconsciously, it's a case of "better her 
than me" and "one less competitor for the attention of the gods"...  As a 
Transhuman, I do not care how many humans die or how so long as humans 
which are of value or potential value to me are not included.

I am not a fan of Spielberg (finding him a bit too sentimentally namby-pamby
for my taste), have not seen the three grown-up movies you mention above
(for some reason or other never got inspired enough to go see them), but
wasn't A.I. designed more for younger people in mind?

Movies are, after all, fantasy, entertainment, make-believe, mood-inducing,
transporting ...  A.I. did have scenes evoking strange and somber
netherworlds, the near- and further-along-future, and some of those scenes
really were nothing short of stunning.  You know, some people like Britney
Spears (they would liked Doris Day or Dinah Shore decades ago).  Some people
like Uma Thurman (hmm, would have liked ... Joan Fontaine? Ingrid Bergman?
in the past).

I've a kind of decorator's appreciation of movies - some movie scenes I saw
in my childhood for the first time still play in my head.  I think this is a
common experience for most of us, no?  Maybe it was the scene with the
flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz.  The music in The Third Man.  This
experience is not limited to "good movies" only - e.g., as a child I was
completely enthralled with The Leech Woman (late '50s movie).  It introduced
the idea to me of rejuvenation, the return of youth and vitality to a
person, so, okay - with a little greed and murder thrown in for yucks.  But,
you know, the mind starts ticking ... where she stops nobody knows.

I decided to repost my initial review of A. I. which I wrote soon after having seen it.  As can be easily seen, I was quite hyped about it despite some definite reservations.  

Ultimately, I think many of you are being far too hard on the film, but I do see where you are coming from! lol  I DEARLY wish Kubrick had lived to make this film.  Despite Spielberg's claims to the contrary, the movie would have been vastly different with Kubrick at the helm.  

For one thing, Damien Broderick shared with the list how author Brian Aldiss in the original story had the android boy as a very sophisticated program to in a sense "fool" humans into thinking it was truly sentient and had emotions.  Only the most perceptive humans could pick up on this though.  Obviously, the film went in a different direction.    

But at least the film showed A.I. in a way which could create public sympathy.  Even if this technology down the road does not come in the form of sweet little boys, this film will cause many people to see A.I. research as something good, and not to be ridiculed or protested against.          

best wishes,

John
  
*review* 
I saw A. I. on its first day here in Anchorage with GREAT anticipation, since it was the number one movie this summer I wanted to view. The advance reviews I had read of it in Newsweek and elsewhere said it was one of Spielberg's greatest films, if not his best ever. 

I was not disappointed. Spielberg was in very top form, and I feel translated the notes of Kubrick into a truly great film. And as critics have pointed out, there are many layers and aspects to this movie, which can make it appeal to a wide demographic. 

The mother/son/Pinnochio aspect of the film grabbed my heartstrings and pulled hard. I felt tears well up in my eyes during several scenes. I think it would be hard for any person to not be touched by the depiction of humankind's inhumanity to his/her own creation. 

With this film, the public will be getting positive memes about artificial intelligence and robotics, which could really influence longterm public opinion about the machines which will actually exist in future decades. This film, due to its greatness, will continue to be viewed for many years into the future. I'm happy about that... 

I would consider this film to be a "science fiction fairy tale", both because of the way it was based on the tale of Pinnochio, and because of how it ended on sort of a sad metaphysical note. 

My heart jumped as I saw the depiction of the posthumans and their astounding vehicles! I was so impressed by the thought which must have gone into their depiction in the film. Did anyone else notice a sense of similarity in comparison to the aliens from Spielberg's "Close Encounters" film? I felt like I was actually looking at the future mind children of humanity. 

They were obviously the advanced sentient nanotech beings which people like Drexler and Robert Frietas have envisioned. And yet they had the wisdom, kindness, and love which Ray Kurzweil speaks of. 

The scene where the posthuman talks with the android boy really affected me. Audience members may have been somewhat creeped out by the posthuman physical appearance, but with their deep concern to the android boy shown in warm vocal tones, it would be hard to not be totally won over. I think an important meme was sent out by that simple scene. 

I loved this film, but had some problems with the ending. I wish the far-future "machine people" had told the boy that in fact humanity was not gone, but instead it had simply transformed into what they were! I wish, I wish, I wish! 

Also, I found doubtful the whole idea that a scan of the space/time continuum could result in a flawed upload program which would result in only ONE day of life for the resurrectee! I don't see any real science in it. But then, like I said before, this is more of a "science fiction fairy tale" and not straight science fiction. 

Of course, for emotional impact the idea worked very well. I felt pained as the android boy had his one perfect day with his once again loving and devoted mother. As they go to bed and he decides to never awaken himself I felt so sad. 

Often traditional fairy tales did have sad endings, to teach a lesson of some sort. And I think in our real world of pain, disappointment, and death you can see why a positive and hopeful ending would feel untrue to the audience. But then again, Hollywood is notorious for happy endings in films, even when the movie is in a sense ruined by it. 

I realize Spielberg was trying to be true to the vision of Stanley Kubrick, who in turn based his notes on the short story by Brian Aldiss. I have not yet read the Aldiss story, but would assume it ended on a sad note as the film itself did. 

I would have ended the film differently (thinking as an extropian!). Starting off, the posthuman would have explained he was the direct descendant of humanity, and possibly even an upload. 

There would have been no "technical problem" with scanning the universe to recover/simulate his mother's mind. Or else she would have been a total simulation based on his memories of her. 

They would have lived in a replica of their old home, but in time they would have grown curious about what lay beyond it. The final scene of the movie would have them venturing forth into the posthuman world, with the spokesperson posthuman as their guide and friend. In my opinion, that would have been the way to end it. 

Still, I dearly loved this film, and feel many great memes are being spread throughout the world with it. I think Brian Aldiss, Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg (along with all the actors and crew) have created something which will definitely increase the chances of our successful transition to the singularity. I am very grateful.

...Everything depends on the quality of the intelligence of the particular
'bit' of humanity that you are trying to communicate with. ...I missionaries
introduced their ideas to an intelligent, thinking tribe then that tribe
would either agree with them or say, 'we don't agree with that; we're not
interested.' A less intelligent tribe might think, 'what on earth are they
going on about? I dunno; let's eat 'em.'

Again, there's a vast difference between sections of humanity who are
open-minded about new tech, and those who daren't leave a message on my
answerphone because they don't have one of their own and it might make their
phone go wrong...or those who ring up technical support and ask, 'where's
the ANY key?' (press any key to...) Some folks genuinely fear tech, and
these are the people we'll have big problems with. Scaremongering (witness
the GM and cloning debates; the word 'frankenstein', etc, etc)

...absolutely...camouflage and infiltrate.  But I always have a dilemma
here...am I wanting to share information and discoveries with 'humanity' for
humanity's own good, or am I reassuring humanity so that it will not
interfere with my own chosen methods of personal development and growth and
ongoing survival?

...humans suffer. Quite horribly, and in a lot of ways. It would be great to
free people from the suffering of the body, and equally if not more great to
free people from mental suffering. Emotional anguish cripples intelligence
and the ability to interact, as I'm sure anyone who's ever lost a loved one
(or a lover!) knows.
Awareness of immanent death also causes emotional anguish. I don't mean the
scenario of thinking you're about to die because some nutter has a gun
against your head (although that's pretty unpleasant too) I mean a major
part of being human currently is the fact that you're going to die...I think
it would be desirable for humanity to escape that...if it wants to, of
course.

...premature to assume, or premature to talk about openly?

...Quite the opposite! Anyone assuming such a thing meets the very real
problem of how on earth to share their awareness without freaking people
out. This is where we need coherent, articulate speakers and
representatives, who don't get swayed into emotive irrationality by
heavily-emotionally-laden arguments and can hold their own even when shouted
down by luddites.

...absolutely. But there are going to be two groups here...on the one hand,
those trying to introduce transhumanist concepts gently...like, hey,
wouldn't it be great if we could extend our life spans a bit...and those who
just come out with it all, and, hey, let's all upload and bugger off to
another star system and build ourselves robot bodies, etc etc. This latter
group are going to cause some culture shock. But by comparison, the 'gentle'
group will seem like a safe option to listen to. Just the same way that
there are nutters out there hitting the press with stuff like ';we're going
to clone jesus'...by comparison, some dude cloning a pet cat seems not only
blameless but desirable.
...I think we all know which group I'm in......but the point I'm making is,
we're all necessary. And those among us who are good PR speakers are at
present the most necessary of all.

Reminder:
Ellie Arroway  was a _character_ in a movie. If you knew or met Sagan
(some of us here did), and you know something of his history, his friends,
colleagues, life, or have even read some of the biographies, then this
is what you would know about this character:

Sagan's character Ellie Arroway was a female-personified view of himself
plus Ann Druyan + Jill Tarter + women-astronomer-scientists that he
knew/admired/supported.  Sagan supported women in science to the nth degree,
but if you want to understand that character, then you need to study Sagan.

The book and the movie have some differences, not huge differences though
(the largest might be removing pi). Since Sagan was minutely involved
in the  making of Contact from the movie's beginning in the early 80s
to its premier in summer 1997 (only 1/2 year after his death), then
you should consider the movie Contact his whole baby, and not a film
that was sidetracked by Hollywood interests (that, in my mind is one
of the most remarkable things about the film: it's a smart film that
didn't fall to media stupidities.)

Well, it looks like there could be as many as five of us!

About meeting up: anywhere in London is fine by me, but is an evening 
meeting the best option, since there's people travelling some distance? 
Would a week-end daytime meet make things easier?

Cheers,

I think this is overly strict.  If people are persuaded of 
something that is actually closer to the truth and more 
beneficial to them then I think your efforts are ethical.  I 
think doing this is more ethical (if your ethics includes thus 
benefitting others when it is within ones rational means) than 
not acting at all because you can't get the point across with 
the most accurate arguments that you yourself understand. 
Ethics has to take in account context, including the level of 
knowledge, sophistication and time constraints of all involved. 
  Ethics is doing what is most consistent with your values/goals 
in each situation.

What if the don't end up more rational or more informed but they 
do end up much more likely to survive and thrive enough to have 
the chance to become more rational and informed?  Are you sure 
that all things ethical and leading to a better life are 
necessarily limited to what you consider rational?  A lot writes 
on one's working concept of "rational" in this sort of disccusion.

Now now, Spike.  You're just bitter because you been
out groveled.  Don't take it out on me.

Besides, it was entirely Robert B's interpretation of
my oblation to Amara as suggestive of a desire to
grovel.  I grovel not.  Mostly.  And it was he who
prepended the title "mistress"  to Amara.  Surely I
cannot be held responsible for someone else's taste in
leather straps and metal studs--not that there's
anything wrong with that--or a view of the world as
from behind a patent leather Balaclava.  It was you
then who seized upon this fiction, and turning it into
whole cloth--fueled no doubt by a sincere and worthy
devotion--dived into a frenzy of competetive
slithering, hoping to secure your place at Amara's
feet.  Then she, the ever playful, with a show of kind
regard for you, danced the dance of the over-achiever
upon your prostrate, but no doubt grateful, form, as
she sang, "Carbuncle, rampallion, tra la, tra la, tra
la, ere vultures grip mine eyes."  

Personally, I prefer--it's a personal preference
thing, you see,... to each his own--to formulate the
character of those I admire from a loftier vision than
that which one sees looking down at--or in your case,
up from-- the silken, cloying, and fecund mire, ever
surging, amoeba-like, implacable, unimpressed by
hubris and star-flung ambitions, to envelope and
reclaim our puny-yet-tasty fleshy ebullience. 

So then, for Amara, I choose the Olympian
indomitabilty of Athena, stardust warrior, and the
elegant craftsmanship of the Wright brothers--now
THAT'S what I call the Wright stuff--from bicycle to
"tumbling mirth of sunsplit clouds", and thence, no
doubt, to gleaming starship.  Amara standing tall, the
veil of Maya streaming behind her in the solar wind.

Spike, put down that adjective before you hurt
yourself.

Best, Jeff Davis

It depends on whether the contextual rules of such interactins 
are respected or not.  Being a masochist doesn't mean that one 
is happy to be beat on in all imaginable contexts.  SM stuff is 
actually quite structured and in some ways less open to chance 
misunderstandings than more "straight" sexual/emotional 
interactions.

Taking advantage of someone in any way against their wishes is 
abusive regardless of whether they may like superficially 
similar things in specific contexts.

Actually, that is not the golden rule (for whatever that is 
worth).  The golden rule is to treat them as you would like to 
be treated.  Which always seemed a bit twisted to me.

Why?  The only way you could get the various miracles and 
stories to remotely be actual is with an SI level intelligence 
and something as capable (if not more so) than nanotech.  Some 
stories require going further and bending the rules of a sim. 
But there is nothing in theism per se that requires that god[s] 
be utterly beyond any and all technology and only employ forever 
unfathomable "pure magic".  It is an immature or decadent view 
of "Higher Powers" to require nothing but inexplicable magic.

If God does not exist then something indistinquishable for 
practical purposes soon will exist if such is at all possible. 
God and more generally spirituality is used for a lot of very 
different things.  I know several quite atheistic people who are 
profoundly spiritual.  I have been all over the map on such 
things myself.  There is much I deeply distrust in religion and 
many types of spirituality.  There is much that has and does 
call me there also.  My notion of God is ultra-high tech but 
certainly no less full of mystery and wonder for all of that. 
You might say also that "God" is a projection of what we think 
the ultimate "perfection" would be.  Many that make their own 
projections don't call it "God" because of all the baggage that 
very much gets in the way.

If there already is an SI, that might even have created this 
apparent space-time bubble, then it pleases Ve to ignore any 
requests for communication or proof that I have ever made.  It 
would seem there either is no such or that the point of this 
exercise is for us to "grow up" to the point of creating our own.

Simply, If you say "don't coerce" then you can't coerce people into
following that rule!



For a longer explanation, "don't coerce" applies to the person who might do
the coersion.  A "right" applies to the person who might be coerced.  This
is not just a semantic issue, but an actual distinction that has
ramifications.

If you make "don't coerce" a rule, then the remedy is to penalize whomever
is coercing.  If you make a "right" then the remedy is to restore the right
to the person it was taken away from, and maybe award damages for losing
that right.

Along that vein, imagine a zookeeper who lets his lions out into the city
instead of feeding them.  You can't punish the lions for "coercing", because
animals are not subject to human laws.  You can't punish the zookeeper
because he isn't coercing anything.  On the other hand, by making a "right
to live", you CAN punish the zookeeper for taking actions that logically
would result in interfering with other people's "right to live".

"Actually, the way Contact wussed out was to reduce the entire issue to a
question of "faith".  I really doubt that Carl Sagan intended it that way,
although I have never read the book."

I read the book about a two years ago and I felt that the main theme Sagan
was hitting on was that there is difference between evidence based belief
and faith based belief.  The government officials did not believe Elly
because there was no evidence, until the video tape showed 8 minutes of
recorded time.  The theme of the book, at least in my opinion, was different
than that perveyed in the movie.  The movie ends with the question open as
to what happened to her.  The book ends with Elly finding evidence that the
universe was engineered (based on a hint from the alien she encountered I
believe.  Here is a post I wrote on the subject to someone else...

"In the book "Contact" which was written by Carl Sagan, an atheist, skeptic,
scientist.  Jodie Fosters character attempts to prove scientifically that
the universe had a designer by finding a pattern in pie.  Pie, which is a
fundamental constant of the universe, had a pattern that could not have
occurred randomly, if that is the case then it must put in place by some
intelligence, and since it was a fundamental part of the universe, the
universe must have been designed as well.  The reason why she did this was
because the senate committee did not believe her story, they wanted some
evidence.  It required no leap of faith and was merely the simplest
explanation for observed phenomena, a point which Carl Sagan hits on
continuously in the book but was left out of the movie.  In fact, the movie
took away the entire point of the book, which was that science basis its
belief structure on the why the world is observed to work, and religion does
not.  Had this film been made when Sagan was still alive, it would not have
ended the way it did."

(Obviously the arguments that a pattern in pie necessarily denotes
intelligent design (not in the christian sense) has arguments against it as
well.  They did not specify the pattern, only that elly was sure that it was
created (I was left with the impression that it was created by the aliens
that built the transportation system, or some predecessor, not by a "god" in
any convention sense.)

Sure, this holds true on the human level.  But you don't necessarily need to
coerce people into following "don't coerce" by threat of punishment; you can
intervene at other points in the sequence of cause and effect.  Let's say
that you have a roomful of people who are somewhat good shots; they all have
guns; they have something of a dominance hierarchy based on who's the best
shot, their internal alliances, and so on.  Now I walk into the room and I'm
a *really* good shot.  In fact, I'm such a good shot that I don't even need
to say "I'll shoot the first person who tries to pull a trigger."  I can
just shoot the bullets out of the air.  I am not coercing anyone; they can
fire all the bullets they want, without threat of retaliation.  But
nonetheless coercion is no longer possible.

This is conspiracy stuff on the level of "evolution is an unproven theory"
and "the moon landings were fake."  There may be a few minor questions here
and there, but there have been major amounts of discover about exactly how
this retrovirus works and produces the symptoms of the disease.

HIV antibody tests are remarkably accurate.  False positives and false
negatives are not rare enough to state that there is not a one-to-one
correlation.  People with HIV get AIDS.  People with AIDS have HIV.  People
without HIV don't get AIDS.  People without AIDS symptoms don't have HIV.

One "fact" that confuses these people is that people can live so long with
HIV before getting AIDS.  This does not mean they aren't affected.  Their
symptoms, immune response and T-cell counts are affected by HIV.  There is a
threshold where they are considered to be free of the full-blown disease.
But even before that threshold is reached, the same biochemistry and
pathology of the disease can be seen starting to work its destruction.  It
just has to grow to a high enough level before full-blown disease symptoms
start to manifest.  This does not mean they aren't infected and aren't
suffering from the disease.  It simply means that modern medicines are
working better than ever before to keep these people alive and healthy.

Saying that HIV doesn't cause AIDS is like saying single celled cancers
don't grow into tumors.  People can live indefinitely with single cells of
cancer and may or may not develop the full-blown disease.  But the
progression from a single cell to a fatal mass is clear and known.
Likewise, the spread of the HIV virus to more and more immune cells,
followed by a dearth of T-cells, followed by a failure of the immune system
is a well-known and consistent progression.  There is no conspiracy here.

Subject: Contact's Arroway character (was Re: My Review A.I. the Movie )

"Ellie Arroway  was a _character_ in a movie. If you knew or met Sagan
(some of us here did), and you know something of his history, his friends,
colleagues, life, or have even read some of the biographies, then this
is what you would know about this character:"

"Sagan's character Ellie Arroway was a female-personified view of himself
plus Ann Druyan + Jill Tarter + women-astronomer-scientists that he
knew/admired/supported.  Sagan supported women in science to the nth degree,
but if you want to understand that character, then you need to study Sagan."

I definitely got that impression as well, but only for the character in the
book, not the one in the movie. 

"The book and the movie have some differences, not huge differences though
(the largest might be removing pi). Since Sagan was minutely involved in the
making of Contact from the movie's beginning in the early 80s to its premier
in summer 1997 (only 1/2 year after his death), then you should consider the
movie Contact his whole baby, and not a film that was sidetracked by
Hollywood interests (that, in my mind is one of the most remarkable things
about the film: it's a smart film that didn't fall to media stupidities.)"

As far as the number of things left out, there may have been only a few
quantitative differences, but qualitatively the differences were vast.
Having been reading Sagan for years I was disappointed.  The introduction of
the pattern in pie at the end altered the entire theme of the book, and
Foster's character couldn't argue against even the most basic objections to
her stance.  In the book she was much more outspoken and (I thought)
intelligent.  The movie's Arroway was a dumbed down characterature of an
intellectual atheist, and stumbled anytime someone disagreed with her or
pointed out some lame allegedly logical flaw in her stance.  To me, these
things showed the influence that hollywood did have in the film.

Sagan's books introduced me to science and captivated me by it, I read Demon
Haunted world and couldnt put it down, after that I read almost every one of
his books in succession.  After feeling like I got to know him well, I was
quite dissapointed in the film.  The overall message that the film taught
seemed to be entirely skewed from the book to the move...but of course Im
biased =)

In either case, perhaps I'll watch the film again (havent seen it in a
while) and write up a more in depth Critique of the deviations from the
book.

Jeff, I fear that in your painstaking elaboration of coarse handwoven
meaning into the gentle embroidery and sparkling filigreed traceries of a
silken shroud of language that softly drapes itself over the listener's head
and tangles itself before the eyes, you may have lost the distant and
forsaken cause that in simpler and more joyful times gave rise to semantics
underlying the dazzling sound and light of speech, without which the panoply
of words in their glorious cavalry leave behind a faint but unmistakeable
unease, a discordancy of thought and senses, an irrefusable intuition that
sees through to the empty core of things, a perception that upholds itself
against all the serried ranks of mere sensation, like the pink light of the
sun of earliest dawn reflecting from a blade of grass, photons rich in red
wavelengths as they strike the rods and cones of the retina, but perceived
color maintained as green by the color constancy mechanisms of the visual
cortex.

Well, if you have come up with a creative idea I would consider it rude to
use it without asking. I don't know what to think about intellectual
property, but I firmly believe in intellectual propriety. 

Overall, your "purist" version of the game seems to be developing quite
nicely. It is starting to make some sense :-)

Also, the event cards may *have* to be played if no other valid card is in
the hand. Which means that once you have such a card you cannot just put the
hand back into the deck. Somebody got an anthrax bomb, and no matter what
you do sooner or later it will crop up somewhere...

Well, look at the original 1984. That is the low tech version, and in the
appendix Orwell quite clearly describes how the Party is circumscribing
further research in order to not get any surprises. Oceania is nowhere near
any advanced technology, but still is aiming for an ultra-stable,
humanity-crushing state.

This is a good idea. However, the game as it is does not include the perhaps
most important aspect of the singularity: its autofeedback. As far as I can
see, the rate of tech development will not increase over time as the game is
played.

The "bullshit dectector" in the field of virology used to be Koch's
postulates. Koch's postulates are simply the application of logic to the
problem of determining whether a disease is caused by an infectious agent or
not.

If you abandon Koch's Postulates, than how do you know if a disease is
caused by a common infectious agent?

It doesn't really matter to me HOW someone isolates HIV, only that they
logically prove that the proteins and genetic material to be used to detect
the virus in later tests came from an infectious virus.

IMHO, this has not been done with HIV.  That set off the bullshit dectector
of Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos et al [The Perth Group] and others.

You can't put the cart before the horse. Somebody first has to isolate the
candidate virus, prove that it is present in sufficient numbers to cause the
symptoms in the affected cells, characterize the proteins and genetic
material, reinfect host cultures, see increased numbers, reisolate and
compare the proteins and genetic material.

This is not an insurmountable problem. We should follow the logical methods
elucidated by Karl Popper, IMHO. The theory that HIV causes AIDS makes [and
did make] different predictions than the Perth Groups theory. Compare the
predictions of each theory.

When I get a chance, I'll list some of the different predictions of the 2
theories, if anyone cares.

Well then this is one of those very rare occasions (Godfather, The Forbin Project)
where the movie is better than the book. The idea that a machine can be intelligent
but not emotional is a well worn cliche; I feel that if you must have a cliche in a film
at least have the decency to make it a seldom used cliche.  Also, unlike most
cliches this one is false. I'm sure if Stanley Kubrick had lived he would not have
used it either, in fact the hypothetical movie would probably been even better,
but it's hard to point to a real film made in the last few years that was superior.

There is something else which I at first didn't get and I have not seen
in anybody else's reviews of the movie: Spielberg seemed to make it
clear that the errors, failings, and shortcomings of the AI were all
actually caused by human beings, NOT the AIs themselves. The boy's
errors were all due to incomplete or malicious programming by its
creators or by the returning cryo-child. The point of the gladiator
sequences was to really illustrate that the technology itself isn't
evil, it is humans who do not have the capacity to properly appreciate
and use AI technology. Even the creator of the boy was hopelessly
blinded to the boy's real needs by his own hubris.

Then you just have to perfect a "study while frozen" technology, and

Evidence, please? 

If you look at people's reactions to transhumanism you will find plenty of
reasons they do not take transhumanism seriously or do not consider it a
good idea. Some of them certainly are due to lack of understanding or
incompatible values. But is the main reason transhumanism is not filling
football stadiums with enormous revival meetings that people are
irrationally resisting it, or due to how transhumanists spread their ideas?
After all, plenty of other ideas that have been fiercely resisted and
regarded as both silly or evil have eventually triumphed - Christian ideas
of mercy rather than the roman ideal of clemency, democracy, women's
suffrage, socialism etc. In all of these cases the vast majority considered
them outrageous from the start, and yet they changed their opinion. That was
hardly due to technological factors or some spontaneous mental evolution,
but plain and simple spread of ideas. The scribblings of philosophers have
surprising penetration power.

The issue isn't converting everybody to transhumanism - what would the point
of such a mental monoculture be? Rather, we need to create a culture where
transhumanism is regarded as a valid point of view. Transhumanism should not
be a silly fringe phenomenon, but rather a (possibly controversial)
ideological position others that participate in society. That is the only
way we can really get our hands on the relevant technologies (and have them
developed in the first place), avoid being arbitrarily outlawed since our
ideological opponents happen to own the playing field (which is bound to
happen soon if we do not work on our political act - remember that Leon Kass
is bioethics advisor to Bush, and he has explicitely said he will fight
against a posthuman future) and gain allies in our projects. 

Ignoring the beliefs of others is not going to get us there.

Who will pay for a developing a brain-computer implant not intended for
treating handicaps? What pharmaceutical corporation will devote resources to
developing a creativity enhancer drug they know will not pass the FDA since
lack of creativity is not a disease? Why is the idea of genetics tests
usable by laypeople scaring medical regulators?

There are some people who agree with transhumanism in positions where they
can develop useful stuff, and a few who have money. But honestly they are
not that many - friendly billionaries do not grow on trees. Even if certain
cool technologies would be developed in this isolated way, they would be
extremely costly if the costs were not spread out across a big paying
customer base. This is of course where appeals to greed come in - there are
many ideas we like that could presumably be killer applications (just think
of life extension). 

But even these fields need more than just us convincing the CEO of Novartis
that life extension is a huge market: the surrounding attitudes in society
need to be changed in order to make that project viable. Attitudes do not
change just because a technology appears - look at the reactions to cloning
and performance enhancement in current society. Instead it is necessary to
spread the idea that these technologies can be used in a constructive way.
We need to deal with the philosophical and cultural assumptions underlying
bans and resistance to these things if we are going to see anybody develop
them seriously.

When I talk about culture, I talk about all the "software" our civilization
carries around - art, traditions, stories, ideologies, language,
institutions, laws etc. It is not just about movies. 

My point is that the motivation and intent is largely derived from the
cultural sphere. There are of course human drives like seeking security,
social status, survival etc, but these are channeled and shaped by culture
(and vice versa!): we invent not just because we are curious and enjoy it,
but because we have ideological aims, it fits symbols and ideals we have
grown up with (the mad scientist, the wizard, the hacker, the lone champion
of truth and all the others), we gain various forms of recognition
(professional, coolness, membership in clubs), we get rewards (monetary and
intellectual) and so on. The *things* we invent are even more culturally
derived (in a sense I would say technology is a proper subset of culture,
and cannot subsume it more than movies could) - just look at the aims of
software, and think of how they often reflect various more or less clearly
expressed cultural aims within western culture.

That technology can get tremendously powerful and is likely to continue as
long as our current style of individualist culture remains is true, but
remember the lesson of Ming China! Progress is by no means the default
state, and can be ended by a cultural shift. If you do not make sure your
culture will support your development, you might end up stymied.

You mean like people always toss out everything they believe to be true when
it suits them?

You mix up presentation with message. To be a great orator, you need to show
both logos (logic), pathos (emotion) and ethos (being morally just); if you
just have one or two of these aspects in your message it will be weaker.
That doesn't say anything about the truth of the message. Many of the most
successful groups in affecting the meme pool have spread messages that are
opposed to much of normal human emotions - democracy, rationality, the
scientific method, tolerance etc (the whole enlightenment tradition). They
did this in clever, forceful ways, but the message was not about being
emotional.

I think you should really take a look at the history of ideas, maybe check
out Hayek's _The Intellectuals and Socialism_. Memetics is just the
"transhumanistically correct" (and lazy?) way of talking about culture, and
there is a far longer tradition of studying what happens with ideas and
ideology than the current transhumanist movement. One of the main things we
can learn from history is actually what others have tried and why they
failed - and when it comes to the area of changing the world, many many
groups have done that, which provides rather useful background database. I
think you would find, if you explore this field, that many of the views you
have espoused in this discussion are common to many of the failed movements.
What you need to show is that either the situation now is sufficiently
different for them to work, or that your combination actually manages to get
some unique new result.

The same. I think these are very important issues, and such issues always
need clarifying.

Ah, I have not been following this in detail, but I believe there are some 
legitimate questions about your latter assertions.

The people who question the HIV theory are saying that HIV ALONE is not the 
cause of AIDS.  That includes by the way the fellow who DISCOVERED the HIV 
virus, if I recall my reading correctly.

"People with HIV get AIDS" - 15% do not.

"People with AIDS have HIV" - there is apparently some question whether 
AIDS is an actual disease or a syndrome of other diseases, many of which 
can occur due to other causes.  The one specifically pursued by other 
researchers is HHV 6, which can cause all of the diseases in AIDS and for 
which, allegedly, hundreds of studies have been done world-wide, all of 
which is ignored by the HIV researchers.

"People without HIV don't get AIDS" - see above.

"People without AIDS symptoms don't have HIV" -  see above (not to mention 
that this is rather obvious in the general sense.)  Note however that 
people with HHV 6 can have AIDS - and MOST people have HHV 6 - the question 
is how are these ordinarily suppressed viruses triggered.

>One "fact" that confuses these people is that people can live so long with
>HIV before getting AIDS.  This does not mean they aren't affected.

The point is statistical - apparently 15%  of HIV infected persons NEVER 
get AIDS. (Or at least "never" being much longer than the statistical five 
year mortality.

I knew a fellow with AIDS in the joint and did some reading on it from 
literature he passed to me, plus I've read articles on it in Spin Magazine 
and elsewhere.  There is a book out by the fellow who does medical 
reporting for the ABC News web site.  He has been following this topic 
since the early 1980's and was responsible for convincing Peter Jennings to 
cover the HHV 6 research for ABC News.  He does not sound like a conspiracy 
theorist (I've heard him on Art Bell).

As far as conspiracy theory goes, the whole situation sounds like a replay 
of Krebiozen decades ago.  I read a book on that and it sure sounded like 
the stuff worked to reduce cancer deaths.

I tend to be cynical about people who are receiving billions in research 
dollars being really willing to turn that spigot off with a really 
effective treatment.

But, I'm not a molecular biologist or doctor either, so I'll drop this topic.

So, people have problems settling on a meaning of a word. What else is new?
But for the purposes of this discussion *we* can decide on meanings we will
use, and not get bogged down in whether the definition used by Dr.
Kndlerbacher is better than the one suggested by Pr. Foobarius. What is
important for us is the aspects of being human that are affected by the
transhuman project, not exactly where we care to draw the boundary lines.

As I see it, humans grow out of a complex interaction between their
genetics, environment and also their own thoughts and actions - which serve
to select what experiences and environments they will encounter. The whole
process is very dynamic and open ended; we are not so much *things* as
*proceses*.

Actually, they might have had some ideas (angelhood):

	endowment properly your own, in order that whatever place, whatever
	form, whatever gifts you may, with premeditation, select, these same
	you may have and possess through your own judgement and decision.
	The nature of all other creatures is defined and restricted within
	laws which We have laid down; you, by contrast, impeded by no such
	restrictions, may, by your own free will, to whose custody We have
	assigned you, trace for yourself the lineaments of your own nature.
	I have placed you at the very center of the world, so that from that
	vantage point you may with greater ease glance round about you on
	all that the world contains. We have made you a creature neither of
	heaven nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal, in order that you
	may, as the free and proud shaper of your own being, fashion
	yourself in the form you may prefer. It will be in your power to
	descend to the lower, brutish forms of life; you will be able,
	through your own decision, to rise again to the superior orders
	whose life is divine.''

See above. While there have been plenty of thinkers with other ideas, I
think Mirandola had a very good point and provides a good humanist 
foundation to build on. I'm not saying we should view him or the other
renaissance humanists as the definition of our humanism, but rather build on
their ideas while discarding the oldfashioned stuff.

I would say the ability of changing oneself according to will and knowledge
is rather deeply intertwined with other core traits like being an ethical
subject and autonomous being.

I would consider a transhuman that was unable to change itself a very failed
transhuman.

Sure. But we are not most people :-)

More seriously, I think this is a terminological problem we need to deal
with somehow. Any ideas?

I think most people would here triumphantly say "Hey! You want to move
*away* from a lot of stuff. You do not seek to move towards anything. Deep
down these goals are just driven by fear of death, and hence these goals are
human goals in your more derogatory sense of human". 

You seem to recognise survival as valuable, but is it an end in itself? I
personally consider immortality a tool. It is a tool I will need to realize
my grandest projects of understanding, reshaping and creating in the
universe, but there is no inherent value in survival itself, rather in the
good stuff I can do *while* I am surviving. I think this is an important
difference between those driven to transhumanism because they fear death and
pain, and those who seek more life.  But seeking more life (in the sense of
actively growing and self-developing towards one's current ideals), that is
very much a "human" trait.

I think you are partially right in that there are certain dispositions
making a transhumanist worldview more likely. But obviously there is far
more to it than that.

Hmm, so you really do consider survival itself the core value? And then one
can derive a lot of philosophy from that, and this unfolding of meaning is
what you described as a "revelation". OK, I think I get it. But many people
seem to have other views, not just among humanity in general but also among
transhumanists. It seems common that many transhumanists regard themselves
as having always been transhumanists (I hear that a lot); maybe this is
because they have internalised transhumanism closely to their own
personality and value system, but it doesn't seem most of them have reached
this state by thinking about the core values of life. 

As an aside: Overall, I think it is too easy to underestimate the bulk of
the human race. It can never participate in any debate, so it will never
make its voice heard. Only people from this bulk can do that, and my
personal experience is that most actually are fairly sane people. I might
disagree with them, but they are not entirely clueless.

Not for me;  I'm in Edinburgh, a mere 400-odd miles away, and get down

If you're going to do Euston Station, I would strongly recommend The Head of

Ah, that does not follow.  Self-defense is not coercion.  It IS force, but 
coercion in this context has the implication of "initiated in violation of 
reason".

Well, yes, and the point of the penalization is to increase the economic 
cost to the coercer.  However, moralists translate this simple point into 
"punishment", and all sorts of emotional reactions which are irrelevant.

How a society organizes its reaction to coercion is based on its cultural 
evolution and environmental and economic factors.  I'm talking strictly 
about the logic.

True.  But the issue here is, is the zoo keeper malicious or just 
stupid.  If stupid, you shouldn't "punish" him.  Only if he is malicious is 
it justified to cause HIM harm to prevent him from doing what he's doing.

You see how quickly the notion of "right and wrong" and "punishment" gets 
out of hand?  You're ready to "punish" someone for mere ignorance or 
stupidity... (Actually, I have no problem with that in many cases on a 
personal level, but on a social level that is bad practice.)

Good point.  Agreed.  The example is a bit contrived, but it is a valid 
point.  Education in cause and effect is better than "punishment".  Even 
Nietzsche as I recall recognized that "punishment" was an ineffective and 
low-level response.

And why do we have these scare debates? One large reason I found in the work
of studying the gene debate was simply that many of the people developing
the technology and industry never tried talking with the worried people (at
least not on their level; hearing something in Higher Academese and then
being told that this is the reason genetic engineering is safe and ethical
is not communication and does not promote trust). When ethical or
value-loaded arguments appeared, scientists and businesspeople either
disregarded them (since they were outside the framework they could talk
about as scientific experts) or viewed them as irrelevant; this was soon
seized by some people who found that they could win debates by invoking
"ethics" without having to do any ethical thinking. 

I think exactly the same thing holds true for transhumanism. As long as we
do not deign to speak with people disagreeing with us or unaligned people,
we will lose.

Actually, suits and ties are not camouflage, they are a form of
communication :-) When you speak to a tribe in the jungles of New Guinea you
have to act according to their customs if you want them to listen, and the
same goes for a roomful of decisionmakers.

That depends on your personal moral system. I believe in enlightened self
interest and network economics: the more good stuff humanity gets, the more
good stuff it is likely to develop that I can use. Six billion brains think
more than one (not necessarily in my direction, but at least a lot of
thinking gets done). I also have a certain aesthetics where I want to make
sure the world is as interesting as possible, and this is usually best
served by helping it.

I don't consider suffering and limitations as relevant definitions of
humanity (I know some philosophers do, and they get very upset when we say
we want to get rid of these limits - and hence our very humanity). I think
the important part is using our possibilities instead. Most of the suffering
above is or will likely be irrelevant, but new forms of suffering or other
aversive emotional states may appear as we extend ourselves. 

Again, the important thing isn't what we are running from, but what we are
running *to*.

Premature to assume. In fact, the genetic determinants are probably just as
irrelevant as genetic determinants for political views or taste in clothing
- there are subtle effects there, but not anything that overrides our wills.

But assuming that "we" are somehow fundamentally different from "them" sets
up an insurmountable barrier for communication. We might be feeling the
transhuman man's burden when we try to bring the poor benighted luddites to
truth and progress, but the inherent smugness of that view will leak through
and cause resentment and eventual backlash. It is better to realize that we
transhumanists aren't that different from anybody else, we just happen to
have a few uncommon views and somewhat larger ambitions. That helps a lot
when the luddite is screaming - I can emphatise with him, and try to see
what kind of dialogue would help open up real communication rather than a
shouting contest. The next time you see Bill Joy, Leon Kass or Rifkin on TV,
think "there, for the grace of God, goes I" ;-)

Have you noted that this is exactly what is happening in many other issues?
OK, we won't evacuate California, but we can institute a bit tighter
environmental regulations. OK, socialising the entire stock market would
cause problems, but we could use the worker's pension funds to buy up
everything over time. And so on. In a situation where the alternatives are
biased (mainstream vs. the crazies) the middle ground is biased.

True. But it is not just PR. We need to develop our ideas too. Exactly what
do we want, why and how do we get it? If we can answer those questions we
can start giving people answers to questions like "How can transhumanism
help you?", "Why is transhumanism the right thing to do now?" and "Where do
I sign up?"

I read the book back when it was published in 1985, so my memories
are not very clear.  Didn't several people go on the trip with Elly?
And when they got there, each of them had a different experience, each
met a different loved one from their past?

Then wasn't there some evidence of the trip because the ship had damage
from rubbing against the walls of the wormhole as it travelled?

Finally, as you mentioned the real proof was that the alien Elly met
(who looked like her father) had told her that the aliens were looking
for messages from the creators of the universe by finding patterns in
various constants.  So a team back on Earth gets going cranking out Pi
and eventually they find a pattern of some sort, which is considered
vindication of the reality of Elly's trip.

By the way in the past couple of years a way has been found to learn
the nth digit of Pi without calculating all the intermediate digits.
However it only works in binary and related numbering systems like
hexadecimal, not base 10.  But probably the message from the creators
of the universe would be in binary and not an arbitrary base like 10.

It's also hard to see how anyone could put a message into Pi.  That
is such a simply defined number, how could it have a message?  It's
almost provably impossible.  It would make more sense to put a message
into Newton's gravitational constant G, something physical rather than
mathematical.  Of course it's a lot harder to find the 100th digit of
G than to do so for Pi.

Back to the movie, I agree with the comments about making Elly so
fuzzy-headed at the end.  In the penultimate scene she's talking
to some schoolkids and they ask her if the universe is inhabited.
Instead of giving them the best and most accurate information she has,
she just says, "what do you think?"

Now, I can understand this as an instructional technique, getting
the kids to think for themselves, but in this case they are not in a
position to acquire the relevant information.  Only Elly, out of the
entire human race, has the firsthand knowledge and information to be
able to answer that question accurately.  Under the circumstances she
has an obligation to be truthful and say, I went to the stars, and I met
someone who told me that the universe is full of life.  Not only that,
there were even greater beings who built these marvelous structures so
that someday we'll be able to travel quickly and easily to the stars.
This is her story and she should tell it.

Hi!

Would anyone like to tackle a paragraph or two on uploading and possibile augments for Primo re uploading?  

Why do you think uploading is a logical next step for copying the brain and transferring information to a more secure and durable format?

All arguments will be gladly entertained!

(Please email to the list or me privately asap.)

Thanks!

Natasha

You may be thinking of a specific scenario for uploading that is more
restrictive than necessary.  Broadly speaking we use uploading to refer
to transferring our minds from their current biological brains to some
kind of artificial system like a computer.

Our minds are already confined to a system which is less than the
universe, namely our brains.  Transferring them to a computer does
not have to limit our options to move around or access the universe.
Of course if the computer is gigantic and needs massive power feeds
then moving it will be difficult, but in principle one could have
a small computer and move it around easily.

Even without that, I don't see what the problem is with telepresence.  In
a way, all of our perceptions are mediated already by sensory modalities.
Our brains live in a dark, quiet, wet place.  That is the reality.
It is only by means of our senses that we get the illusion of being out
there in the world.  In a way, our bodies are a form of telepresence,
operated by our brains, huddling safe in their little caves of bone.

Uploading also does not necessarily mean operating in virtual reality
independent of the physical universe.  Of course if the new system is
super-fast, it may not be desirable to spend too much time waiting
for things to happen in the physical universe, so naturally we would
turn to some form of VR which can operate at a more convenient speed.
But manipulating the physical universe will still be a necessary and
important activity.  Even if you spend most of your time in a VR there
needs to be construction, maintenance and defense of the physical
substrate which runs the VR.

> I suspect that a lot of people like the notion because it is the 
> "scientific" equivalent of "Heaven"...

Now I think you are getting even more specific and picturing a very
special kind of VR, where you have fantasy wish-fulfillment.  I
suspect that this will be a popular form of recreation but will not
be the only mode in which people interact in the future.

An important thing to remember is that HIV is not a virus, but a
huge family of viruses. These are grouped together by genetic
similarity in groups called "clades". These clades have very
different effects.

If I remember correctly, North America is primarily infected with
"D" clade virus, which tends to be passed more readily amongst the
male homosexual population, whereas Africa is primarily infected
with "B" clade, which tends to spread amongst heterosexuals.

And yes, some clades appear to be nonlethal, at least for now,
maybe they just have very long cycles...

Remember that HIV is a retrovirus, mutating quickly, and it would
be in the virus's best interest to mutate to a nonlethal form. That
and some people might actually be immune.

I found this review very interesting. What I liked most about the movie AI
is the diversity of reactions to the movie. People who were looking for
documentary-quality realism regarding artificial intelligence seem to be
very disappointed or annoyed.

>From a moral perspective, I found the movie provocative and tremendously
valuable for stimulating discussions with people who do not normally spend a
lot of time thinking about transhuman / posthuman issues.

The movie raises a number of important questions that can lead to some
fascinating discussions, especially if you have not already made up your
mind about all of the answers:

- What is the potential emotional impact of cryonic suspension on friends
and family members whose grieving is thereby suspended?
- Would those feelings tend to be different if you could see the suspended
person versus having them isolated from visual contact?
- To what degree is physical interaction required for one to have feelings
of love?
- What are the implications of an AI developing its own volition (the way
that Joe does despite his lack of emotional "wiring")?
- What would motivate someone to design and AI that can love? (We learn in
the movie that Dr. Hobby's motivations are not purely driven by scientific
curiosity or financial gain, but by love, grief and a desire to recreate his
own dead child).
- What are the consequences of developing an AI that can feel love when that
love is not returned and what are the responsibilities of the creator in
regards to the AI?

Beyond that, on a more subtle level, Spielberg asks, "Can you, as an
audience member, develop an emotional connection (love?) for David, the main
character, even though he isn't a 'real' person? If so, how is this the same
or different from emotional feelings you may have for any other movie
character (who is also artificial)?"

Personally, I believe that discussion around these and similar questions is
much more valuable than presenting a perfectly accurate view of the future.
Refusing to even discuss these questions with the "unenlightened' general
public is one of the weaknesses of many transhumanists in my opinion.

My question is: Does the universe "lose" an integrated 
memory-personality-sensory system, when an upload occurs? My concern is that 
what may result is something that bears no resemblance to the original 
personality. Also, does the upload became insane (unstable) after such an 
upload?  There seem to me to be so many technological bottlenecks (at 
present) to sustaining the original core personality, as a reference point.

Something that blabs on as if brain-damaged, or rages, or "cries" 
continuously, cannot be construed as a successful, upload. Well, this is what 
I fear anyway.

Pi certainly appears to be the product of a very simple mathematical
sequence that can be expressed in a number of simple equivalent ways.  The
computational complexity of Pi is very, very low.  The ability to insert an
extended message into Pi requires that the computational complexity of that
message be inserted into Pi.  The total amount of computational complexity
available to "construct" a message in Pi is the computational complexity of
Pi, the computational complexity of the starting point within the sequence,
and the base used for the sequence.  Since the total computational
complexity of the formula for Pi is so small that selecting among the
possible computable processes of approximately this complexity does not add
enough degrees of freedom to place an extended complex message, the only way
to "insert" a message into Pi is if, by some impossibly fortuitous
coincidence, it is already there - if there is already a complex message
somewhere in the reasonably early digits, of a reasonably small base, in the
set of computable numbers whose computational complexity is in the range of
Pi.  In this case we can imagine aliens constructing a universe that would
have such a number as a mathematical constant, with the number containing a
message.  Now it is theoretically possible that one of the simple numbers
contains a long message from aliens by pure coincidence, but it is
improbable in proportion to 2^(message length).

To violate these constraints and place an arbitrary, long, high-complexity
message into Pi requires violating the basic rules of information theory,
mathematics, and logic, in order to exert fine-grained control over
arbitrary details of the construction of alternate arithmetics which appear
entirely natural and computationally simple to the inhabitants of that
universe - such that the global rules appear to arise from a set of simple
local rules, and there are no extraneous causes perceived as interfering
with the local rules.  And yet the external aliens can decide to make
12*12=160, altering only this one fact and none of those around it, making
the universe conform to that rule in all ways, on both microscopic levels
and macroscopic levels, without causing the arithmetic users to perceive an
extraneous cause or an inconsistency.  In other words, the aliens need to
violate the fundamentals of logic and make simple causes with no degrees of
freedom give rise to complex effects which have many degrees of freedom. 
They need to 'make' simple causes give rise to complex effects without the
intervention being visible in any way as additional complexity.

I would sooner believe that the aliens had total control of every atom in my
computer and were messing with the computation than that they could insert
complex messages into Pi.  If I personally did the arithmetic, I would
sooner believe that they were messing with my neurons.  If somehow I had
absolute assurance that the arithmetic really did check out, and arithmetic
still seemed simple to me, I would sooner believe that they were messing
with my neurons to cover up the signs of their intervention in arithmetic
and causing me to falsely perceive arithmetic as simple and having no
degrees of freedom.  This does not prove impossibility.  It just proves that
if the aliens can mess with Pi, they have technology that is very much
distinguishable from magic, in that no imaginable magic is that powerful. 
In fact, they have technology that is distinguishable from God, in that God
isn't that powerful.  So your Bayesian prior on "technology more powerful
than God" - which, out of respect to the Singularity, should be at least 5%
- is your Bayesian prior on "putting messages in Pi".

You Know You've Been Thinking About The Singularity Too Long When:
8)  You know exactly what would be required to place arbitrary messages in
Pi.

I'm afraid this sad statistic is not provable at this time.  All we can say
is that some number have lived a long time with HIV without succumbing to
the disease *yet*.  Unfortunately, this does not disprove a cause and
effect, as it could merely be a happy delay before the onset of disease
symptoms.

> "People without AIDS symptoms don't have HIV"

Where are these "quotes" coming from that you are refuting?  Nobody here has
claimed this, nor does anybody who believes in the HIV cause of AIDS.  HIV
is known to take years to show symptoms.  This is a straw-man argument
disproving points that nobody has made.

I see.  "Never gets AIDS" actually means "last five years".  That is not the
same thing.  Arguing that people can live longer than five years with HIV
does not prove that HIV therefore does not cause AIDS.  This argument is
just plain faulty.

If we count "five years" as "never", then we can say HIV doesn't cause AIDS
in 15% of the cases.  We can also say that cigarettes don't cause cancer,
and adolescents don't grow into adults.

I have no doubt that you can find support for this conspiracy in jail, in
Spin Magazine, on a news website or from a guest on Art Bell.  Don't you
have any medical, biological, or scientific sources of information?

Yes, the AIDS cure has been suppressed just like the cancer cures.

Thank you Hal for seeing your post on uploading go to KurzweilAI.net for Primo.  As you suggested, I'll take care of it for you.  

I hope the posts from you and 'gene give some clarity to the idea of uploading.

This is a bit pessimistic, I think. There should be some sort of
counteraction card, like "sanity" or "wisdom" that neutralizes negative
event cards (just as you could have 'stupidity' or 'irrationality' cards
to neutralize positive events...).

This would reflect the real world a bit better, where you have balance
and counterbalance in most situations, helping to attenuate the risks of
unlikely situations.

Actually a small percent - about 3% - never seem to get AIDS.  Lo and
behold, many of them are packing a mutation which makes it impossible
for HIV to actually get into target cells!  (CD4 null mutants)   I'd be 
amused to see what cockamamie excuse the Perth group would come
up with to try to explain that one.

I think we've long past the point where reasonable people can doubt
HIV -> AIDS.  If somebody disagrees to the point that they'll
claim otherwise in a public forum, they should put up or shut up: 
inject themselves with a high titer of infectious cultured HIV.  That's
a traditional approach to show an infectious agent isn't relevant.
That they haven't IMO just points them out as frauds.  Even

This is really irrelevant, since ALL diseases behave like this. If they
did not, then the human race would never evolve resistance to any
disease. Keep in mind that the 'HIV positive' means only that they test
positive for the HIV antibody, NOT the actual virus. The 15% represent
those who have successfully mounted a resistance to HIV, representing
those with either a genetic resistance or were only exposed to a small
number of the virus.

There are now at least three variants to the HIV virus, and most
antibody tests only detect one. People who test negative with one test
do not necessarily not have HIV, they just don't have the specific
antibodies for the type the test detects.

HHV is a virus which is normally suppressed by the human immune system.
When HIV compromises that immune system, this gives HHV the opening it
needs to do what it does. It is true that working to suppress the HHV is
a viable treatment for AIDS patients to treat AIDS related syndrome, but
does absolutely NOTHING to help boost the patients immune system.

As do a goodly percentage of those exposed to smallpox, cold, flu, and
many other viral diseases. This doesn't mean that smallpox virus doesn't
cause smallpox.

Yes and no.  It mutates so quickly that effectively an HIV virus
competes with its relatives within the same person.  That selects 
for viruses with highest in-host replication, long-term host survival
be damned.  Same as cancer.  Non-lethal retroviruses have 2
routes I know of - loss of a section of DNA coding for lethality
(tough in HIV as it has frameshifts and opposite-strand reading
to get the most out of its genome) and host evolution - like  the
CD4 null mutant becoming dominant, which would  happen eventually.

"Nice to host" is much easier to evolve with something like
herpes, where replication is pretty accurate and escape back
to lethality mutants thus rare.  There, it happens.

According to Druyan (Sagan's wife),
the 'Arroway' came from an anglicized spelling of Voltaire's
middle name:  Francois-Marie Arouet.

I realize that it's a tempting debating tactic to get your opponents to kill
themselves, but in this case (a) they will linger around before dying,
arguing the while and (b) they may thereby infect others as well as
themselves.  There are also minor ethical questions as to the propriety of
exploiting the stupidity of others so as to cause them to commit suicide in
order to accomplish the short-term objective of winning an argument on the
Extropians list.

       How about two primos combining copies of their uploads into a third

       After all, just because we dont have original organic bodies shouldn't

Koch's postulates aren't anything like rules of logic; they're just
a very good method of proving that X causes Y.  Absence of such proof
does not in any way suggest that X doesn't cause Y, just that it hasn't
been proven to a certain level.  But that level is very high--probably
much higher than necessary to make useful deductions and practical
cures and treatments.  Anyone who thinks biological systems as complex
as humans and retroviruses can be reasoned about with simple ideas
like Koch's postulates is a hopeless idealist.  Indeed, applying the
very idea of "direct causation" to systems that complex is silly.  
And the insistence upon such a high standard of proof among the
doubters is one of the things that weakens their credibility.  While
90% of the population is probably too gullible and could use a good
does of skepticism, it is just as irrational to be among the small

Yeah...  It might work better with something else, but this was fiction. 
Everybody's heard of Pi, even if they can't define it. So why not make it

That is also an ending. A good ending. She went looking for something 'out

I think Greg Egan has done the best "message within pi" trick so far in
_Diaspora_.  The message of the Transmuters is both obvious (in a way),
informative and suggests a way out of the system. I think I will use
something similar when I start creating universes - give the inhabitants
a chance to get out if they poke deep enough.

If you wish to create a universe with truly sentient inhabitants that suffer
and die until they perform some physics trick, then you are evil and must be
stopped.

I have no particular desire for the various anti-HIV advocates to be
dead, just discredited.  Some non-medical people do listen to them,
and end up infected or sick as a result (misestimating risk of sex with
HIV-positive people, avoiding anti-HIV treatment).  I don't think they're
actually stupid enough to inject themselves - Duesenberg talked about
it but after 15 years he still hasn't.  Putting this demand on the table
is intended to discredit.  If somebody's actually dumb enough to do it,
well, they'll save a lot of other people's lives in the process.

I'd argue against a *specific* card for a specific event: if, say,
anthrax bombs are instant Catastrophe that can only be prevented by
Nanomedicine, but Nanomedicine happens to be at the bottom of the
deck...

Better to tie the counters to specific game conditions that can always
be achieved, or at least striven for.  For instance, staying close to
the balance, or "accumulate X (bio/nano/robo) points in the next Y
turns" (which may have to be balanced by other types, if the needed type
is already relatively high).

I suspect our difference is the level at which a work becomes
derivative, and the permissibility of derivative works.  I suspect my
level can be approximated by the fact that I write fan fiction of
certain published works for noncommercial recreation.  ^_-

...but you can play a card that will prevent its worst effects from
taking place.  (I've updated the rules, so now passing is always an
option.)  So, *you* don't have to play a bad card if you don't want to,
but it will come up eventually.  (Though you can squat on a card by
playing other legit cards in your hand, so long as you have other legit
cards.  I wonder if this can be justified as "keeping those with access
to X busy"?)

Which is why, even though there are sentient minds still around, the
robo Catastrophe stops play (and development of new tech and events)
just like the other two types (which physically wipe out all sentient
minds).

Good point.  Hmm...what if the rate of the world's playing depending on
total accumulated (bio/nano/robo) points?  That is, at start (say, 15
total b/n/r points), it plays 1 when it's the world's turn; when there
are at least 25 total b/n/r points, it plays 2, then 3 at 35, on up to
Singularity or Catastrophe.  Likewise, the players' hands shrink at
certain levels (specifically, they skip drawing a card if their hand
size is too large).

If this is used, then maybe Singularity happens when all (or almost all)
the cards have been played?

I don't think any of those involved in this discussion know enough about the
big picture to make that statement anything other than opinion/conjecture.
In my case, I'm swayed by the argument for generation of data, specifically
data sets representing sentient points of view or from-scratch in-vitro
cultures, being more important than the suffering and death of the
participants. Of course, should you believe in the pattern theory of
identity, you shouldn't have any qualms at all about doing anything to
anyone -- you can be sure that somewhere in the infinite universal
computronium, it's all justified and made right for the wronged patterns. If
it was wrong to begin with. If there's a universal ethical or moral ether by
which to judge it all by. Etc.

Besides, we all like The Two Gregs enough to put the efficient backwards
time travelling storm maidens in any universe we create.

This has been explained by the fact that a fraction of the population
has mutations in one of the receptor genes that HIV requires to infect
cells (CCR if I recall correctly).  So one could be "infected" with
the virus and have very different clinical outcomes based on your
genetic background.

This is explained by the genetic diferences cited.

The delay in some cases has been MANY years - not five.  The mortality 
statistic I mentioned is that fifty percent of HIV-infected persons die 
within five years, if I remember correctly.

"HIV antibody tests are remarkably accurate. False positives and false
negatives are not rare enough to state that there is not a one-to-one
correlation. People with HIV get AIDS. People with AIDS have HIV. People
without HIV don't get AIDS. People without AIDS symptoms don't have HIV."

Is that not your post from 9:05 AM this morning, March 8?

Read the last sentence from your post.

No - it means that some people do not get AIDS for at LEAST the five years 
- and in some cases many more years.  I do not know the maximum.

Where did you get "last five years" from my sentence?   I said "never being 
much longer than the statistical five year mortality". Can you read without 
a knee-jerk response?

Now you are claiming things that others do not.  What people are claiming 
is that the fact that not everyone appears to get AIDS from HIV indicates 
that there MAY not be a DIRECT cause-effect between the two.  I believe 
that is all that has been claimed by the people making those claims.

As I said, I am not that interested since I do not have either HIV or AIDS 
nor do I engage in risky behavior.  The material I got from the guy in the 
joint was supplied him by one of the major AIDS organizations that provides 
extensive documentation on the disease and the progression of research to 
people who are infected.  Spin Magazine published what appeared to be a 
well-researched article which quoted people with, I suspect, better degrees 
than yours.  The individual on Art Bell was the reporter who has the job 
reporting medical stories on the ABC News web site, presumably from 
peer-reviewed journals and interviews with people who are doing the 
research.  If you have a problem with him, talk to him about it, not 
me.  Just because someone appears on Art Bell does not make him either an 
idiot or a conspiracy theorist - I believe Bart Kosko has appeared on that 
show, and a number of other prominent and well-known scientists.  Your 
response is an ad hominem attack and is thus "plonked"...

There are people who believe that.  I have said that I do not know whether 
this is true, but it is beginning to sound that way.  I reserve judgement - 
unlike yourself, apparently...

I believe I was referring to worldwide spending.  I do not know the exact

it.  If you don't, you're blowing smoke, too.

What made the movie Contact so worthwhile is Jodie Foster's exceedingly
good job acting the Arroway part.  In *some* ways the movie was an
improvement over the book, i.e. the movie softened and nicened
the Arroway character.  Ya had to love her in that role, even if
not already a hardcore Sagan fan and Foster fan, as I am.  spike

I have no problem with that concept.  Rather necessary, I suspect, since I 
don't believe a biological body as we know it can truly be useful for a 
Transhuman with cosmic aspirations...

I have no problem with that either.  But the impression I got from some of 
the comments on uploading was that it was intended as a *substitute* for 
participating in reality or as the primary "residence" as it were for a 
Transhuman.

I have no problem with telepresence as an *adjunct* to "direct" (however

My sense of this was that Sagan was using the child's version of pi: the
ratio of circumference of a circle to its diameter. This is controlled by
the specific and tweakable geometry of spacetime, no? So the Builder
Thingee had a choice of metric, and selected one generating a value of pi
that, when read out into Base 11 arithmetic and then read `kilometers
downstream of the decimal point' in a SETI-message fashion as a
2-dimensional raster square, created a perfect circle of ones on a field of
zeroes. Kinda elegant, in a minimalist and self-recursive way.

Ok - I wasn't aware that discovery had been made - as I have said, I don't 
really follow the AIDS thing, as it is irrelevant to me.  If true, and if 
it indeed establishes a direct cause-effect both in terms of the mechanism 
and the statistics (i.e., people with the mutation statistically equal  - 
or at least come close to - the population that do not get AIDS), then that 
weakens the argument of the people who use that point to suggest that HIV 
does not cause AIDS.

G is unit dependent, and so its value arbitrary.  

There could be a hidden message in the ratio of mass of the electron
to the proton however.  Then the message would sit there uninterpreted
for eons until some intelligent lifeform figured out a way to measure those
masses with extraordinary precision.  Perhaps some other unitless
value would do, such as the fine structure constant.  spike

I read _Contact_ when it came out in the mid 80's, and I liked it very
much until I got to the Pi stuff at the very end, at which I felt
embarrassed for Carl.  It has been long suspected that all finite
sequences of digits can be found in Pi somewhere.  This is part of a
property called "normality" which, although not yet proven, is lined up
to be one of the next unsolved math problems to fall.  See:

It seems to me he could have had ET ask Ellie what happens when such and
such particles collide at mumble energy level, so that when she gets
back and talks some particle physics friends into looking they find
something that opens a new age.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It was one of the first I went out and
got on DVD.  If you get the DVD you can set the alt audio to a track on
which Jodie Foster will talk you through the whole movie, explaining
what was going on when they were filming and especially how she
approached the character of Ellie.  She had researched child prodigy
behavior for her movie _Little Man Tate_ and carried some of that over
into Ellie.  (Considered a prodigy herself, it definitely comes across.)

Some people have a special gift for predicting the twists and turns of
chaotic systems like the weather and perhaps even financial markets,
according to an Australian psychologist.


Richard Heath, who has now moved to the UK's University of Sunderland tried
to identify people who can do this by showing volunteers a list of eight
numbers and asking them to predict the next four. The volunteers were told
that the numbers were maximum temperatures for the previous eight days. In
fact the numbers were computer-generated: some sets were part of a chaotic
series while the rest were random.


Random sequences are by their nature unpredictable, whereas chaotic
sequences follow specific rules. Despite this, chaotic sequences are very
hard to predict in practice because of the "butterfly effect" - even an
unmeasurably small change in initial conditions can have a dramatic impact
on their future state.


Nonetheless, Heath found that a quarter of the people he tested could
predict the temperature for at least the next two days if the sequence was
chaotic, rather than random, even though there is no obvious pattern to the
figures. 


"The $64,000 question is what is going on in their heads," says Heath. He
is now planning studies to find out whether the skill is related to
specific personality types, or to aspects of intelligence such as
mathematical ability.


David Gilden, a psychologist at the University of Texas in Austin, doubts
that people can detect the next step in any sequence that lacks a
perceptible pattern. "It's a strong claim, to assert that the skill only
exists implicitly," he says. 


But others are convinced that Heath is onto something. "It's sound. The
effect looks real," says artificial intelligence expert Jeff Pressing of
the University of Melbourne. 


He and others point to a crucial difference between this and previous
studies claiming to show that people can identify the patterns in chaotic
systems: Heath distinguished between the effects of chaos and other
characteristics of the sequences that might help people make correct
predictions.


In particular, Heath was able to exclude the possibility that the people
making successful predictions were doing so by looking only at the last few
numbers. In other words, they were not able to cheat by assuming that "the
weather tomorrow is likely to be the same as the weather today".


If the finding does stand up, testing for sensitivity to chaos might help
financial institutions identify people who would do well as financial
traders. "Some guys can't communicate what they are doing, but they make
millions," says Pressing. "They have some sort of intuition. My guess is
that they are sensitive to subtle non-linear structures like chaos."

Evidence that it is in the way Transhumanists spread their ideas?

My point is not that ideas can be resisted and not triumph - although I 
suspect it is not simply because somebody spread them around.  My point is 
that most of the ideas - most of the ones you cite especially - are not 
particularly rational and therefore have an easier time of it being 
accepted by irrational people.

I did not mean to suggest that everybody would be Transhumanist - I meant 
that even getting to the point where Transhumanism is an acceptable concept 
to a significant percentage of the population - even the population of the 
Western World only - is extremely unlikely.  Also it is extremely unlikely 
to occur within the time frame preceding the Singularity - unless the 
technologies developed for the Singularity can be used to speed up the 
process (which I suppose is possible).  But then we have a sort of 
chicken-and-egg question:  if we use technology to help us convince people 
that Transhumanism is cool, do we have to convince them first about the 
coolness of that technology?

I disagree that it is the ONLY way.  If the ONLY way we will ever get 
Transhuman technology is to convince people that Transhumanism is 
acceptable, we're hit.  It ain't happening.  Fortunately, I don't buy 
that.  Most people probably won't get a damn about Transhumanism or the 
technology until the technology is developed or well on the way to being 
developed - by which time it may be too late (for them to stop it).  Nobody 
stopped the development of nuclear weapons despite the misgivings of the 
scientists involved. The public had no clue and cared less - until it 
became socially fashionable to be an "anti-nuke activist" - and that was an 
insignificant (if vocal) part of the population...

Exactly.     The technology is going to be developed by people who want to 
do it either because it is emotionally or intellectually important to them 
to do it, or because they hope to get rich.  My own intention is to work in 
AI, develop some cool stuff, put Bill Gates out of business, make one or 
ten billion dollars and date Jodie Foster - :-}

My point exactly.  I'm not suggesting attitudes will change when the 
technology appears - but again it also depends on the technology.  Most 
people have trouble seeing any benefit in cloning - at least in cloning 
humans for the purpose of reproducing a human - hell, I have trouble seeing 
any benefit in that.  There may well be people who will have problems with 
the notion of life extension per se - they will argue that it will cause 
over-population, or whatever.  But most people I think will go along with 
the idea of living another 50, 100, or more healthy years - provided it can 
be demonstrated.

And while some people don't like performance enhancement, some people 
obviously do or it wouldn't be an issue.  So if the technology can be shown 
to have the benefits claimed, people will take it up.  But they will likely 
do so without concerning themselves about the philosophical and ethical 
ramifications of it all. They'll leave that to the people who want to 
establish themselves as morally superior...

The bans we're talking about came about because somebody DID develop the 
technologies involved for whatever purpose.  Obviously, the technology came 
first, and the bans came second.  How then can you argue that the 
technology cannot be developed without social acceptance?  If you are 
saying that the technology will be developed, then banned, unless we have 
social acceptance, I can only refer to Drexler's comments that bans will 
not work.  Bans may make things harder, certainly, and if we can avoid 
that, it would be desirable - my quibble is with the notion that we can 
avoid that and that we must devote substantial allocation of resources to 
social acceptance in order to avoid that.

Obviously.  And I am saying that art, traditions, stories, ideologies, 
language, institutions, laws, etc. will all be directly affected by 
technology more so than technology will be affected by them.  This effect 
may not be that noticeable in the near term, but will be greater as more 
powerful technologies are developed.

I'm afraid I didn't get your point here.  "The aims of software reflect 
clearly expressed cultural aims?" - could you be more specific?

My point is precisely that you cannot "make sure" of that - and every 
example you can cite in that regard will support that point.  Do you think 
nobody in Ming China wanted progress?  Did they argue against the 
suppression of progress?  Were they successful?

Yes, when the consequences become apparent to them that what they "believe" 
(superficially or otherwise) conflicts with their basic human fears.  It is 
a point in debate that to get your opponent to abandon his position, align 
that position with what he fears.  It is not a question of "what suits 
them" - except in the sense that "what suits them" is to behave in an 
irrational, fearful manner.

So Hitler had logic, emotion, and was morally just?

My point exactly.  Those who can talk to the people share the people's 
irrationality.

Again, you say these people were "successful"  - I look around me, I don't 
see it.  Once again, you seem to ASSUME that simply putting forth a 
rational idea in a calm, supportive manner will somehow guarantee its 
acceptance even in the absence of other factors.  I see no evidence of this 
in human history.

And they failed because they tried to use reason - whereas those who 
changed the world (Christianity, Islam, communism, ad nauseam) did not.

The bottom line is the old saw:  "You can't rationally convince somebody 
out of something he wasn't rationally convinced into."

The difference is the technology level involved.  We don't NEED to convince 
anybody of anything - we just need the technology.  And we can get the 
technology without having to make Transhumanism mainstream.

No.  Since arctan x = x - x**3/3 + x**5/5 - x**7/7 - ...

For x = 1 in particular, we get the series that nobody except a 
mathematician really believes to converge.  p i/4 = arctan 1 so  pi/4 = 
1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 ...

This formula would make it impossible to hide messages in the digits of
pi, regardless of the geometry of spacetime.  Sagan must have known
this, and thus dropped the notion in the movie.

Nowthen, the longer one ponders the above expansion, the more
strange and wonderful it seems that it should work.  Thinking about
it long enough can leave one staring into the abyss.  spike

Well, you were the one suggesting that I had problems with the word 
"human".  The aspects of being human that are affected by the Transhuman 
project in my view are precisely those that some people seem to regard as 
valuable (obviously I do not refer to conceptual processing here, which I 
view as the only human attribute worth preserving).

OK - haven't read him.  I was assuming you were referring to modern day 
humanists.  As I have noted elsewhere, this sort of thought originated (or 
at least was promulgated) by the Gnostics, much earlier than this.  And I 
suspect the concept originates much earlier than that.

The concept Mirandola discusses, however, while important, does not address 
the Transhuman directly.  It appears to be simply a commentary on the 
nature of man as capable of conceptual thought.  While a necessary 
precondition to the Transhuman, it does not contain the whole notion of 
Transhumanism in it.

Possibly you can find and quote "humanists'" who had Transhumanist notions 
- in fact, I suspect Sir Julian Huxley's essay on Transhumanism around the 
turn of the last century would qualify.  That does not make humanism 
Transhumanism or make humanists Transhumanists.

My point stands.  Conceptual processing is a fundamental trait of 
humans.  Our ability to change ourselves is derivative from 
that.  Therefore it is not in itself a fundamental trait.

Again, derivative.  Also, a certain amount of hand-waving.   "Ethical 
subject"?  C'mon, don't try to blow smoke at me...  "Keep it real", as they 
say in the joint - :-}

Yes - accept the Transhumanist notion that the above ideal is what a 
Transhumanist is (eliding the "free moral subject" hand-waving) and that 
most humans don't qualify *in practice* for the rest.  "Potential" is not 
actuality.  Most humans are stupid, ignorant, irrational, malicious, and 
fearful.  They are these things more often than they are rational and 
growing.  They DO have the capability of conceptual processing, which IS 
what distinguishes them from animals.  But if they, as a result of their 
evolutionary and cultural history, behave more like animals than conceptual 
entities, what good is the term "human"?  Especially what good is it to the 
notion of *transcending" such human nature?

Absolutely not.  It is driven not by the FEAR of death, but the rational 
perception and refusal to ACCEPT death - which is not the same thing at 
all.  "Fight or flight".  Granted, the fear of death is ingrained in any 
human, Transhumanist or not, and will manifest when survival is 
threatened.  I refer to the Transhumanist being able to objectively 
recognize that fear, control it, and not be driven by it when making 
choices as to his survival.  Most people do not react that way.  They react 
with "flight" response, without rational consideration.

>You seem to recognise survival as valuable, but is it an end in itself?

Sigh...  YES!  Without survival, there ARE NO OTHER ENDS.  Why is it so 
hard for people to grasp that concept?...

Your notion of survival is the usual human one of - oh, I'll toodle along 
doing something interesting until I drop dead at 75...  And in so doing, 
you miss your fundamental purpose, which is to survive indefinitely.  All 
the actions you take in life should be directed to that end.  NOW, having 
said THAT, I am NOT saying that going out for a pizza is 
contra-survival.  What I am saying is that until your survival is as 
assured as the universe allows it to be, your first and primary purpose in 
life is to assure your survival.  Any action beyond that is a bonus.

Also, keep in mind that you are still thinking in human terms - i.e., you 
value the emotional rewards of creating, etc.  It is not clear to me that a 
posthuman will have the same sort of pain/pleasure reward/penalty system 
humans have.  I suspect that a posthuman will have above all clarity of 
understanding of their nature and relationship to the universe.  This is 
what I regard as "enlightenment".  And in their enlightenment, as in many 
of the higher level spiritual philosophies, emotions are considered a 
fairly low level consideration.  They will create, they will explore, they 
may even alter the very structure of the universe - but I suspect they will 
do so out of rational necessity. But NOT survival necessity, except at 
first, but as the only logical goals once survival is no longer a 
consideration - if in fact it ever ceases to be a consideration - and that 
depends on the actual nature of the universe.

As I have said elsewhere, the polar corollary of the fear of death is the 
desire for more life.  The issue is, how do you react to that - fight or 
flight?  The Transhuman response is fight, the human response more often 
than not is flight.

Well, that sort of supports my point that it may be a predisposition caused 
by the individual's genes affecting the way his brain is predisposed to 
function, i.e., some people may be inherently more rational than others.  I 
can't prove this, but there does seem to be some basis for grouping 
people's behavior along inherent lines.

In the old Libertarian Connection, Erwin S. "Filthy Pierre" Strauss came up 
with the notion of the "gamma" - which he borrowed from the notions of 
"alpha". "beta", "prober" and "omega" behavioral typology.  A lot of 
writers for the connection believed that they were somehow predisposed to 
be libertarians or anarchists.  They felt different from the mainstream 
population.  Human behavior is very complex and individual, but certain 
broad characteristics can probably be identified and people grouped 
accordingly.  I don't know what those characteristics are, myself.  The 
point is that a lot of people believe certain philosophies because they are 
predisposed (either by genetics, or their upbringing, or circumstances, or 
environment, or whatever) to do so and these predispositions start early in 
life.  Psychologists like to portray this as some sort of pathology if the 
belief structure is not one they happen to espouse - I think THEIR belief 
structure is evidence of pathology - :-}

I think that is a very pessimistic viewpoint - and I'm supposed to be the 
pessimist when it comes to humans :-}

You may be correct that SOMEONE should be addressing the fears of people - 
I have no problem with that other than to suggest that it is not likely to 
be entirely effective.  What I object to is the notion that we have to 
expend great effort to "make sure", as you put it elsewhere, that 
Transhumanism is an acceptable part of the mainstream.

My point exactly - the technology will get done whether people like it or 
not.  Because not *everyone* will dislike it.  Therefore, the overall 
belief structures of humans is not relevant.  If it *does* become a 
problem, we'll deal with it then.

My aesthetic is more along the line of "how can I get out of here?"

That wasn't the question - the question was: what are we moving 
towards?  His answer was: we are moving towards freedom from suffering and 
death.  You can argue that this is more a moving *away* from something, but 
that is mere quibbling.  The point is the same:  we are transcending human 
nature because part of human nature (a "core trait", one might argue) is 
that we die.

Possibly.  Some speculation on that might be interesting, but I doubt we 
can have any firm conclusions.

Ah, I would not be too hasty to say that they are irrelevant.  They may not 
be directly determinative, but they may be relevant.  See my comments in my

Well, that's true in the sense that we *are* still human in the 
biological/evolutionary sense.  But our disagreements and fundamental 
conflicts with humanity, I believe, set us sufficiently at odds with humans 
that it will not be possible to convince them otherwise.  Even if we do not 
let our "smugness seep through", our viewpoints by themselves will trigger 
the "flight" response.

When you convince one of those individuals about the value of 
Transhumanism, I will consider your argument more carefully...

I can answer those questions for humans right now.  The problem is - they 
won't buy it.

I thought he was stretching a little too hard for a plot device.
Perhaps after the book came out he was taken to task by
a number of mathematics nerds, and so decided to drop
that gag for the movie.  This story was close enough to
hard sci-fi that he needed to have all those picky little
details exactly right.  He would hafta know there would
be a veritable army of nerds who would memorize the
script, reciting it verbatim at nerd parties.

That was my first DVD as well.  But I didnt realize there was a directors

hours.

In our world. But if 2 pi radians is defined = 360 degrees, what happens
when a circle has more or fewer than 360 degrees, due to space curvature? I
have the feeling that by invoking the arctan function you're being, as it
were, circular here.

Virtual navel-gazers will get taken by whoever who controls the hardware
layer. (Hey, nice piece of computronium. We'll take it!). Nobody abolished
the rat race, and the limits of growth are given by the
matterenergy/spacetime concentration being finite. Lacking advent of
low-threshold spacetime engineering, it pays to not lose touch with
reality.

The only difference between direct perception and telepresence is
relativistic lag. An upload is fast enough to use light for echolocation,
and feel a lightwave reaches a sensor array.

However, there's a long path from your pillow-case wrapped frozen noggin
sitting in aluminum cooking pot in the dewar to something that fast. An AI
bred natively on the (coadapted) hardware layer doesn't have that
handicap.

If space, time and other quantities of physics are finite and
discrete, then are not the sources of units tautological? 

If constants are truly universal, (speed of light, 
Boltzmann's k, Planck's h) can they be eliminated
completely from all the laws of physics? 

We can write       x + y + z - c * t = 0   
to make the c meaningless. But it is not
so simple to make constants irrelevant
if the equation is not so simple.

May this elimination / non-elimination of
constants carry some information?
 

[Ed Fredkin] 
How many fundamental constants would a correct Finite Nature*
model have?  Amazingly, aside from the rule; none, zero, nada...
Well John, would this be few enough?

* = discrete space-time (lattice) 

[John Baez]
Sure - in fact, nobody will ever be completely happy until we
get the number of fundamental dimensionless constants down to none.
As long as some remain, there is stuff to wonder about.
But does this marvelous model you allude to actually exist?

[Ed Fredkin]
No John, it does not exist.  Not yet.

First, regarding pi being left out in the movie:

Yes, I see your point regarding the pi. I didn't think the movie's
ambiguous ending was necessarily bad, but the pi in the book did
tie the various plot elements together.

I just read, in the Sagan biography I have, that the pi was left out
in the movie due to a decision higher up in the film studio, so then,
a Hollywood decision. The decision makers thought that pi was too
complicated a topic for the public to understand. So here, yes,
a dumbing down of the movie. too bad.

One thing to remember is that the book was published 12 years before
the movie came out. Sagan was changing, himself, during that time.

Carl Sagan went to extremes, in my opinion, to build that movie
character, so I give him (and the others) a huge amount of credit to
have produced even what he did produce, that is: a smart female
scientist character.  I don't know of any other movie to have such
realism for that role. The people involved: he, Ann Druyan (his
wife), Linda Obst (film producer), Lucy Fisher and Courtney Valenti
(executive producers), and of course, Jodie Foster, did it right, in
my opinion. Do you really think that a Dagny Taggart approach would
have worked?

Perhaps the character worked so well because there were mostly women
involved to 'protect' it, and make the role realistic. The research
by Sagan, Druyan, and Obst that went into building that role
involved interviewing women scientists of that generation
(1950s-60s) to learn their childhoods, educational and professional
experiences, and especially the obstacles that those women
encountered. I'm sure that Foster studied this too. If Arroway seemed
'softer' or 'more compromising' than the book character, I suggest
that it was intended, and is, in fact realistic. It's a fact of
life, that women scientists work in male dominated fields, and have
their own approaches, compromises, and solutions to their work
environemnt. Huge decisions and compromises are necessary in order
to balance family life and work life as well. A black-and-white
Dagny Taggert in those situations would probably end up committing
suicide in real life.

What is the harping on Dagny Taggart about.  I thought it was 
just in passing until I read...

Really?  I don't think so.  Nor do I think that we today need 
kowtow to anyone in scientific and engineering fields.  It is 
true that an overly male energy pervades a lot of the 
professional world but I don't think that means that we have to 
compromise that much in order to do our work as we believe it 
should be done.  Dagny Taggart was far more complex than "black 
and white" for whatever that is worth and is the least likely 
fictional person to commit suicide.

What exactly would make reality in an uploaded state any less

Dunno.  Ask me when we get anywhere close to the supposed limits 
. The "rat race" only makes sense if there is no way to better 
the fundamentals of your condition beyond that of rats or of 
much more in-your-face scarcity.  It pays not to mistake current 
context for laws of reality.

Says who?  By what universal measure?  You create beings that 
develop sentience and evolve to ever greater capacity until they 
transcend their substrate.  Who says that you can increase the 
variety of sentient beings and especially super-intelligent 
beings, in any other manner?  Perhaps they need to cook from the 
seeds that you are capable of creating.  Who says that it is 
possible to evolve self-improving scenarios without some 
possibilities of failure and suffering that act as drivers?  I 
would like to believe there are other ways and work toward 
creating them but I am not about to claim that all beings who 
could not find such a way are out and out evil.  Especially 
since it is possible that the suffering and death is not a 
permanent situation in a "sim" universe.  Suffering and death 
per se in a created universe do not prove the creator of said 
uinverse is evil.

That was probably one of the deepest jokes ever made on the Extropians
list.  I just wanted to repost it with Damien Broderick's context, since I
had to dig back through the messages to get this.

Perhaps you could fill that football statement if it really sank 
in that we could live in a world of great abundance where every 
person on the planet had primo health, food, clothing, shelter 
and more educational, computational and entertainment resources 
than they can imagine for the asking.  Or we can once a few more 
technological steps are taken and once we get over insisting on 
scarcity, creating the effects of scarcity, just because it is 
so familar and taken for granted that we can't really grok a 
world significantly without it.  In the treasure room of the 
gods we argue and act as if we were in a firesale at a Walmarts.

To me this biggest difficulty is envisioning and communicating a 
very fundamentally different future that goes far beyond 
hyper-technology by itself.

Without a suitably widespread radical revisioning of the 
possibilities I am quite pessimistic on humanity surviving. We 
literally will fail to understand how to use our superior 
technology to actually change and/or meet what most harms and 
threatens us.  Unless we create the uploads or AIs or SI that 
take over everyting (not necessarily a good idea) then we need 
to convince enough people to actually create a viable 
fundamentally different society or societies.  At the door to 
being able to change ourselves very fundamentally on a physical 
level we must also be free to change our fundamental assumptions 
of how human institutions work and how we work.  Anything less 
is simply hypercharging mindsets grossly out of their proper 
context.

Or we must defang governments from standing in the way.  One way 
is to promise significantly better circuses (to be somewhat 
crass) than ever before and at ultra-low cost and deliver.  Sell 
a workable beuatiful vision and you will not have trouble 
getting enough votes (assuming we can't fix it so such things 
are not subject to an open vote) to defeat anti-technology and 
anti-future legislation.  But present it as mainly an 
ideological position and not much else and Transhumanism is DOA 
culturally.

Presenting better, more compelling, more hopeful and deliverable 
beliefs will though.  At the least we cannot act as if it is 
legitimate to keep humankind in relative misery when the means 
exist to end large parts of that misery.  We can take the moral 
high ground.

Why not form a movement toward an abundant future, gather 
donations and dues and fund projects that are important to 
creating that future ourselves?  Give enough people real hope 
and a vision and funding is not that big a deal.

By the time you produce such a drug human/computer interaction, 
invisible computing, ubiquitous computing and so on is likely to 
make the drug less necessary.  The disease only model of 
medicine must change.

Many professions and business are scared because the technology 
and changes can easily make their business and business model 
bankrupt and meaningless.  Which is one of the reason 
fundamental abundance needs to be created before many people 
will let go of inferior modes of "making a living" rather than 
living fully.

Sure.  So have the "movement" seed the projects and apps and

When I think of the "software" as culture I think of the 
fundamental worldviews and assumptions, our shared context, that 
all or institutions, traditions and so on presuppose.  These 
assumptions are often nearly invisible they are so universally 
taken for granted.

I disagree in part.  Technology is not a subset of culture.  Its 
use and limitations are shaped by culture.  These are not the 
same thing.  Most of these symbols, rewards, images and so on 
are rife with cultural assumptions that are part of the problem 
(some less so than others).  For me the aims of software are 
primarily the transformation of culture and the transcendence of 
human limitations.

What if you show them they need not fear death because it can be

It looks like I didn't explain well, and I think that you might be
reading different things into what I said, Samantha.

Cowtowing?, not sure how it's spelled,  is not what I meant.

It's not realistic to expect a woman scientist to act like a man
scientist. She has different approaches and  different strengths,
and usually it requires alot of energy to make her voice heard among
the din. And it's reasonable to expect her to be making large life
decisions, choices, compromises, and fighting more than what's
comfortable, with regards to how to have a family at the same time
of having a work passion. All I'm saying is that a female scientist
(character and real life) _should_ be experiencing uncertainties and
despair at times, and to also have goals and wishes that are nothing
to do with science, so why not have the character display that
reality? The  Ellie character was not a lifeless robot, and most
woman scientists are not either.

I only chose Dagney Taggert because the previous poster said that he
was disappointed that the Arroway character wasn't as strong and
uncompromising in the movie as in the book, so I chose the most
uncompromising character I could think of: Dagney. I don't think a
Dagney character in real life would do well in the last generation's
scientific arena. She would leave the world in some form (which she did)

Sorry.. dropping it now. The topic makes me really really tired.

We're traversing a sequence of kinetic bottlenecks in our development.
Right now they're technologically artefacted, but passing through each of
them brings us closer and closer to the hard limits of physical reality.

Given what we know, absolute hard limits are given by amount of energy and
matter in the local solar system (anything else doesn't matter, as the
creation rate in a given volume soon outstrips transport rate through a
crossection, i.e.  sufficiently large volumes are effectively isolated).
Before we reach them, we will have a period whether bit beings can
multiply faster than matter can be restructured into habitats (ms vs. hour
and day range). Depending on the level of technology, it can take hundreds
to thousands years to bring our local system to the hard limit.

Last time I looked no one has found a way to strip Darwin in context of

Please show me a mechanism by which you're supposed to get out of
darwinian evolution sustainably. Proposing Eden without a mechanism how to
get there and to stay there is not scientific.

The implied point of the circle within pi was to demonstrate the view
that the universe itself is an engineered construct, since pi's value is
entirely dependent upon the structure of the universe, just like the
wormhole nexus she travelled through, which was not built by those she
met on her journey, only discovered by them.

The attitudes of those in it.  That and the fact that you are inside a 
created system rather than interacting directly with the universe.  By 
"reality" in my original post, I meant dealing with the physical universe 
outside one's personal physical boundaries.  One can quibble the

Well, I understand what Eliezer is saying.  I, too, have frequently felt 
that if there is a God, he is a major pain for setting things up the way 
they are.  The Gnostic concept, of course, is that the universe was created 
by a "higher" God (or Goddess) than the "blind idiot god) that created our 
world.

Having said that, it may turn out that you may be right, too.  Maybe this 
is the only way to set up the situation.

I can assure you, having read a great deal about Foster, that she probably 
approached it in exactly the way you suggest.  Her primary emotional 
motivation for doing the movie was the scene where she is reunited with her 
father, but her entire film career has been about working in a 
male-dominated field and trying to express her own creativity within 
it.  She is a consummate professional as every director has attested and 
has made many compromises to obtain the success and clout she enjoys while 
at the same time fighting to produce movies she believes in.

Currently, the balance of family and career for her is shifting 
significantly.  Subsequent to bearing her second child, she has closed down 
her production company, and is apparently going to move out of the 
Hollywood area (to where has not been disclosed).  She has said in 
interviews that she no longer has any ambitions in film and no longer needs 
it to fulfill every aspect of her personality.  I suspect that, as Camille 
Paglia has suggested, another brilliant women has succumbed to "hormones" 
and that we will be seeing much less of Foster on or behind the screen from 
now on.  I suspect also that her ambivalence toward the career that her 
mother forced her into at an early age and which once threatened her life 
has something to do with it.

If any of you have read the novel, "Society of the Mind" (the title is a 
play on Minsky's book, "Society of Mind"), I think it would be great if 
Jodie could play the part of Laura in a film adapted from that book.  But I 
suppose that will never happen.

I've taken the liberty to contact off-list all those that have respondent to 
my "UK Extropians?" post and to set up an ad hoc YahooGroup (ExtroBritannia) 
to sort out the details of a possibile London meeting.

ExtroBritannia is not an official ExI group and it's not meant as a 
discussion list, or as an alternative to the extropian mailing list, it's 
just a tool that might be useful for UK-based extropes.

Once again, we're assuming the speed of light is an absolute limit.  That 
may be true given current scientific knowledge, but that is not the same as 
being an absolute.

A Transhuman has no need to replicate.  Now, it is possible that it may 
turn out that replication is a good move for some other reason, but 
replication is not identity (barring some tech that enables it to be 
identity), therefore replication offers no survival advantage to an entity 
bounded by space-time.

As I say above, replication is not the issue.  It is not clear that 
Transhumans need be competitive - that is *human* thinking (and low-grade 
human thinking at that).

I disagree sir.  In any universe with any curvature, a circle would still
have 360 degrees, for the circle defines the degree, as well as the radian.
The expansion given would work even in a different space curvature,
and they would derive the same value for pi.  Nowthen, if they were to
actually attempt to measure the ratio of the circumference to the diameter,
Im not exactly sure what would happen.  spike

Actually, it is an absolute, since scientific progress shows no sign of
exceeding it outside of using loopholes like wormholes, etc. Experiments
in FTL all demonstrate that wavefront speeds are always restrained to
light speed.

A transhuman may indeed have a need to replicate in order to increase
its rate of experience. Producing 1000 copies of oneself increases the
rate of experience a thousand fold. Merging the experience back into one
individual allows a transhuman to gain far more experience while
minimizing the risk. Brin's new book on Dittos delves into the negative
aspects of this, though I believe Sheffield wrote a very interesting
novel on the positives.

The idea that human thinking is low grade is an artifact of primitive
religious superstition and statist disinformation. It is human thinking
that has gotten us as far as we have, so it obviously must be pretty
damn good.

I want to quote something from a comic book.  (Hang in there!) The 
background to this is as follows:

Around 1992 or 1993, Marvel Comics started a new line of comics set in a 
very dystopian future in the year 2099.  The worldview was that 
corporations ran everything, there was a lot of tech, but most people were 
screwed up, and there was an even larger gap between the haves and 
have-nots than exists today.  Marvel reintroduced some of their main 
characters from the 20th Century such as Spiderman, the Punisher, the 
X-Men, etc., with different "people" (i.e., it was someone from the 2099 
era being Spiderman, not "Peter Parker"). The one exception to this was the 
villain Doctor Doom, a character that Marvel has developed now for some 40 
years, and who is the premiere villain in their comics lineup.  Doom 
travelled through time to arrive in the year 2099, and, a man out of his 
time, set out to change the world.  Most of the characters in the 2099 
series were fighting evil corporate powers, etc.  Doom, as ruler of his own 
little Eastern European country, "Latveria", quickly came into conflict 
with the world as it was.  At one point, he decides that he is the only one 
that can save America from itself and does so by invading it (with the help 
of mutants, hackers (called "netgliders" in the series) and mercenaries), 
blowing up the Senate, invading the White House and "re-empowering the 
Presidency" as he put it, in opposition to the corporate powers.  He 
nationalizes the transnational corps in America, but they band together and 
overthrow him using technology which they have hidden from the public 
because it would threaten their rule and profits if the technology were 
revealed.  Doom is forced to go into hiding and eventually strikes back.

Now, this is the first mainstream comic I have ever seen where the 
characters quote Noam Chomsky and Bakunin... At one point, before the 
invasion of America, when America uses "necrotoxins" to annihilate an 
entire small nation neighboring Doom's, where he has fomented an 
anti-corporate revolution, Doom says the following:

"I am reminded of a sentence by a philosopher of my original time.  His 
name was Noam Chomsky, and the simplicity and power of his statement has 
forever after haunted me:  "U.S. foreign policy is, in fact, based on the 
principle that human rights are irrelevant."

Later, he says:  "The greatest threat to this world is America."

After his takes over the White House, it is revealed that one of the CEOs 
of the corporations is actually an alien. He kills the alien, and then goes 
on national television to say the following:

"He - it - has controlled one of this country's largest corporations for 
over a decade.  Do you understand?  Your lives have been given to a THING 
with hallucinogens for blood!  But this doesn't absolve you! No!  I won't 
allow you to point your finger at the alien corpse and say: 'It was him 
that did it! America today is not my fault!' You LET him rule you! It IS 
your fault! You ALL HAD A CHOICE! You will ALL make restitution for this 
horror you have perpetrated! Your incomes will be tithed to a Federal 
Restitution Fund in reparation for your IGNORANCE! Martial law is 
increased! More curfews! TO THE DEVIL WITH YOU ALL!'

After he is overthrown, Doom ponders why he has failed to change the world:

"Eventually he was forced to recognize the single terrible thing that has 
brought low all conquerors.  He couldn't see everything at once. He 
couldn't repair the environment, tend to the ruined fabric of American 
society, rebuild the structure of human resources and see every other 
detail of the country. And so corporate secrets remained secrets for just a 
day too long.  It is still galling to the man.  He knew he could dissuade 
America from making a hell of earth if he offered them HEAVEN.
It all depends on your perception.  Doom has come to the conclusion that 
attempting to see and control every detail of one country may not have been 
the most effective way to save this planet from itself.  However, he can 
view a small selection of pertinent details on a planetary basis...and by 
manipulation of information, can affect small, choice aspects of world 
culture.He need only follow the ripples and repercussions of ONE act.   Or, 
put another way, what if Doom were to take over the world?..."

Now comes the section that struck me as relevant to this 
discussion.  Although if you study the above statements, many of them are 
relevant to this discussion as well.

"Doom has a theory about nanotechnology.  Its very existence is an anomaly 
on this world - or its lack of exploitation is an anomaly.  A world of 
nanotech should be a world without hunger, without illness, without want, 
and perhaps even without GOVERNMENT.  Nanotech is the horn of plenty, and 
yet, in 2099, its use is restricted to the occasional construction work or 
computer augmentation.  When a smear of nanotech could build food from 
dirt, why do people starve in the slums of America?  Simple.  The corporate 
mentality that governs much of the earth would stand to make no profit from 
paradise.  The people have not been told of the potential of 
nanotechnology.  We could have made the stars jealous of our magic, thinks 
Doom.  We could have soared through life on a sparkling wave of tiny 
miracles.  Instead, we are pressed into the gutter by money and fear."

the use of nanotech in the story line goes back to the first issue in

My point exactly - it is an insurmountable difficulty given human 
nature.  But you are right - the point  of Transhumanism is survival - not 
technology per se.  I would become Transhuman by alchemy or occult magic or 
Taoist meditation if I though that would really work.

Ah, yes, but it is possible that Transhumans will survive regardless.  But

How about using the tech that goes into AIs or SIs to change US to handle 
the situation.  That is the point of Transhumanism - not to create another 
species to displace us - but to transform US INTO that other species. We 
"displace" ourselves, as it were. People seem to be obsessed with the human 
fear of ANOTHER species being superior to us.  This is clearly a flight 
response right in line with my earlier comments.  The point of 
Transhumanism is for US - i.e., those of use that choose to do so - to 
become that species.

Correct.  The problem is selling the vision.  How much work will that be 
versus devoting the same resources to achieving that vision.  Can we not 
produce the reality instead of merely a vision?  Visions can be debated and 
rejected on emotional grounds - reality has its own force.

See Doom's attitude above.

I would hope so.  I would say that is the ONLY likely approach that COULD 
work to changing society to some degree.  We have to fight not only death, 
but people's acceptance of death as inevitable (and even desirable - the 
old saw about "I wouldn't want to live forever because life is hell 
now.")  But I am not convinced that we can do that on a *society-wide* 
scale UNTIL we can demonstrate that it will actually work.  But we *can* do 
it on a one-to-one basis with people open to such ideas.  (The old "Cast no 
pearls before swine" notion...)

The Moon is not made from green cheese (nor parmesan, nor pecorino, nor
cheddar, nor tilsiter, nor brie, nor ...). That's also not an absolute.

We know our physics is incomplete. However, superluminal signalling is Big
News. Because it would be equivalent to time travel and violation of
causality? Could happen. But, without evidence I'm not wasting any

All transhumans, everywhere, all of the time? How do you enforce it? Why
did they stop, so suddenly? What about radiation, which is postbiological
but not transhuman? In fact, rather dumb?

Please show me mechanism how a radiating postbiology will sustainably

Some employers provide  a benefit package pre-loaded with a set number of 
credits. To maximize employee satisfaction within those constraints, an 
assortment of benefit options are presented for the employee's 
mix-and-match selection. This is referred to as a cafeteria plan.

Now, a similar program appears to be surfacing in the area of LE...only the 
clients seem to have gotten wind of it prior to agreement by the providers 
as to the options   that would be made available. There seems to be some 
dissension about the disparity in credits across the targeted population.

The original thought was to assign a set number of LE credits that could be 
utilized from embryogenesis to termination. Four thousand credits were 
advanced to each pre-existing entity. Two thousand credits were thought 
necessary to maintain an existence of sufficient complexity, interest and 
satisfaction to propagate the human strain. The additional two thousand 
credits could be retained by the original entity or used for reproductive 
activities. A clone would result in a debit of two thousand credits, 
whereas the typical two-donor offspring would 'cost' one thousand credits 
each. Other combinations are of course encouraged. The genetic donors have 
their accounts debited in relation to the proportion of genetic material 
they are contributing. The base credit of two thousand is transferred at 
implantation.

Of course, arguments have ensued concerning the credits assigned to various 
attributes. And so a lottery system of sorts has been designed to fill the 
available genetic slots for any beings-in-the-works! Admittedly, some genes 
are filled with a mind-boggling bid of one's entire two thousand 
reproductive credits. Well! No being can start with more or less credits 
than four thousand and so once all the slots are filled, there is a credit 
adjustment made to keep everything neat and tidy.

Until this system can be implemented fully, there will be some inequities 
that should be addressed. Some beings are discovering that their four 
thousand credits don't stretch as far as they had hoped! Unfortunately, 
they were constructed prior to completion of the human genetic library. And 
it shows.

On the bright side, it seems that they have devised a schematic to guide 
them in assessing their areas of insufficiency and implementing a plan to 
achieve maximum life expectancy. We do hope this increases their overall 
satisfaction with their plight.

Meanwhile, we will continue to switch over to the new system as quickly as 
possible while minimizing the potential for fatal instabilities.

in a non-Euclidean space the ratio is < pi, or > pi

In GR, for a 'warped' (hyper)surface the ratio is < pi,

Note your statement above - "outside of using loopholes" - my point 
exactly...  And I repeat, that "scientific progress shows no sign of 
exceeding it" does not make it an absolute.  We merely have evidence that 
it MAY be an absolute.  This is elementary philosophy of 
science.  Scientists do not claim absolutes - only theories that get better 
as time goes on. In practice, we may regard and act as if what we believe 
to know is true, but in precision we cannot claim this as an 
absolute.  Perhaps a Transhuman with sufficient direct knowledge of the 
universe can do so, but we cannot.

Ah. that is an interesting concept.  However, if a Transhuman can utilize 
telepresence or other technologies to increase his rate of "experience", 
why would he create potentially competitive replicants of himself (note 
here that I assume for the sake of argument the notion some others seem to 
believe that such replicants would in fact be competitive).  Also, could 
the Transhuman not replicate himself with agents that can provide him with 
the experience, but not the competition or the resource consumption?

The argument assumes that the only way to gain the necessary knowledge of 
the universe is to directly experience it, which in turn will require 
essentially consuming a significant portion of the universe to produce 
enough sources of experience.  This all sounds very unlikely to me, and it 
definitely involves a great deal of assumption on the nature of and 
technology available to a posthuman.  If we're that good, we should be 
Transhuman already.  I am not denying that it may well be that all these 
assumptions are true - I am saying that I do not know, and it is ridiculous 
for others to act as if they do.  When I claim that a Transhuman need not 
replicate, I am referring to the logical conclusion that once a posthuman 
has sufficient resources to insure his survival, he has no need to 
replicate.  Also I emphasize that given the nature of space-time (as we 
currently understand it), replication does not change the original state of 
the original being and therefore is not a means to immortality.  Now, if it 
can be demonstrated that the nature of the universe (as we understand it) 
is such that to in fact insure its survival, the Transhuman must in fact 
replicate, then I will reconsider the argument.  Can someone point me to 
such a logical demonstration on the Web or elsewhere?

I did not say all human thinking was low-grade.  What I said was that the 
statement made was "human" thinking AND that the statement made was 
"low-grade" human thinking. And of course one can divide human thinking 
into the good stuff and the bad stuff - both of which have put us where we 
are now.  Which one will prevail is the subject of discussion.

Next!

It would seem useful to believe for most purposes of discussion
that the current physical laws remain in effect for the future
of the universe.  If they don't then the universe becomes very
unpredictable -- it might be a much "nicer" place, or a much
more difficult environment in which to survive.  There is simply
know way of knowing.  If one wants to start a thread stating
some arbitrary collection of physical laws, e.g. FTL travel, wormholes,
etc. then postulate how uploads should behave in such an environment
then feel free to do so.  (I'll note the the new Star Trek prehistory
has included some of those elements so it isn't completely boring.)

For the purposes of list discussion, I think its reasonable
to use something like Michael Shermer's skeptic scale.  On that scale
I'd put the probability of nanotechnology based uploading in my natural
lifetime at about a 3 and for the younger list members at 1.5-2.
I'd then put FTL travel in the next century at an 8 and wormholes
of any significant use anytime in the future at a 9.

So for "planning" purposes it seems reasonable to assume that you
do hit some physical limits at optimizing the locally available
matter sometime over the next thousand years or so.

> A Transhuman has no need to replicate.

Only if you can absolutely guarantee that you trump the galactic hazard
function.  Accidents happen to transhumans they just take longer.
As I discussed at Extro3, only a distributed replicated intelligence
has a good chance of surviving indefintely.  Today, given my perspective
on how much more expanded I expect minds to become, I might argue that
a distributed mind with redundant intelligence support systems
might be more accurate.

If one can design and build a point-source singularity weapon
(Shermer Skeptic Scale: 5) then it may be very difficult to detect one zooming
in from the Oort cloud at high velocity.  You may not have the advanced
notice or the time to do a backup.  So if you "confine" yourself to
a single dense location, you still retain a non-zero hazard function.
If, on the other hand, you distribute yourself over the solar system
its difficult to imagine what could cause a total system failure, so
the hazard function is much lower.  *But*, you do think much more
slowly due to the propagation delays.  If there is an "economy"
(in a traditional sense -- where the entities "value" something
that isn't universally available and will pay matter or energy
to get it), then the most distributed entities with the lowest
hazard functions are perhaps also the "poorest" (because they
probably produce the least quantity of novel information).

Initially, clearly no.  But if you allow yourself to make copies
that have autonomy or you allow minds (natural or artificial) to
self-evolve to a state where they decide to make copies and you
don't impose a solar system wide ban on copying (which may be quite
difficult to enforce given the feasibility of designing a self-evolving
seed without copying constraints) then you have a limited window
before you are once again up against the limits.  Not only do you
have to outlaw unlimited copying, you have to outlaw unlimited
mind expansion as well.  Can't have 1 mind getting 99% of the
available matter & energy and the rest getting 1% can we?

Fortunately our observational abilities may have increased to the
point where we might be able to discover how others may have solved
the problem and have some working examples of good strategies
to use ourselves.  At least I hope that will be the case.

I'm not exactly sure this would occur, but I think that in a steep
gravity gradient, the radius will NOT relate to the circumference by the
same value of pi that we use. See below:

circle from top:


                    __----------__
                  /                \
                /                    \
               /                      \
              |                        |
              |           C            |
              |           *------------+R
              |                        |
              |                        |
               \                      /
                \                    /
                  \                /
                   --____________--

Would appear to be a normal circle, with a normal pi.

Then assume that point C is a gravitational well, such that, looked at
from the point of the gravity gradient:


              ---------------------------+R < circle, edge on
               \                       /
                 \                   /
                   \               /
                    \             /
                     \           /
                      \         /
                       \       /
                        \     /
                         \   /
                          \ /
                          C*

Where radius CR does not relate to circumference R by the same ratio of
pi that we use ....

Everything else doesn't matter only assuming that the relevant

Darwinian interpretation often goes far beyond the realities of 
evolution.  And I think we need reminding that we largely will 
shape our own evolution from this point on.  We are not bound as 
strictly to our evolutionary programming as we once were.

It is as "scientific" as positing that "nature red of tooth and 
claw" is the best we can expect regardless of how much we know 
and what we do.  Perhaps we cannot produce much of a relative 
utopia.  But if we cannot or do not trouble ourselves to even 
envision one then we certainly cannot.

One might argue that we have not interacted "directly with the 
universe" since we climbed down from the trees, walked out of 
the caves and started seriously building tools and culture. 
This created habitat is no more artificial or less so than any 
other we create.  It is a way, in many aspects superior, of 
dealing with reality.  It is not make-believe or any less real. 
   Where are the "personal physical boundaries"?  These 
boundaries are quite porous.  In an upload the boundaries might 
or might not be considered to include the computational devices 
one's program runs within and any devices one controls.  But I 
submit that is no less real and no less interacting with reality 
than what you now experience.  It is likely that you will be 
much more aware of many more aspects of reality to far greater 
depth than now and far more able to do interact with them.  Even 
now you can go into fugue if you want and cease to meaningfully 
interact with reality.

Theories get better at defining the limit of an asymtotic singularity.
They do not puncture it. An asmytotic limit IS an absolute.

Nor are loopholes like wormholes an actual breaking of the light speed
limit, since they are simply a completely consistent concept under
relativistic timespace.

What exactly is 'sufficient direct knowledge'? How is 'sufficient direct
knowledge' any different from what humanity has been accomplishing for
millenia?

If you can't trust yourself to not compete with yourself, then you won't
produce dittos of yourself. If you are capable of comprehending rational
self interest (i.e. each 'individual' doesn't lose anything by joining,
they gain x times more) and treat the body simply as a husk for the
mind, you have no qualms about such practices.

Why is this essential?

Assuming the individual transhuman no longer feels the need for familial
companionship or producing clones of oneself for mere insurance's sake.
If you can't stand yourself so much that you'd rather not subject
yourself to yourself, I doubt that you'd become transhuman while being
so self conflicted.

If it turns out that genetically reengineering living beings is
impossible due to immune reactions and other conflicts, then transhumans
will be left with having to impose germline changes in successive
generations of bodies which they would transfer their minds into in
successive generations (like upgrading your PC)....

Well, it seems that you are yourself conflicted. You assume that clones
of yourself will automatically compete with you for resources (and I
don't know what else), but this is assuming that there is a scarcity of
resources to compete for.

You are also assuming that the transhuman individual will be limited to
a physical corporeal existence, which is a bit presumptuous to assume as
a given. When you can fit your conciousness into any old teaspoon of
dirt, dust, or plasma anywhere in the universe, how exactly do you think
you will have a need to 'compete' with duplicates you make of yourself,
especially if those duplicates are light years distant from each other?

So he creates more misery and tyranny in the guise of saving the 
world?  What a maroon!  The source of our relative misery is not 
  aliens or the evil transnational corporations.  The source is 
our own smallness and the limited assumptions that lock-step 
most of our thoughts.  But this cannot be cured by blaming and 
punishing.  People cannot be forced into a better way.  With 
luck and much work they can be shown that better is at hand and 
they need only accept it.

Unfortunately he still thinks in terms of "enemies" and

What I was attempting to say is that I don't believe it likely 
that there will be any true transhumans without a sufficient 
vision embraced by enough people.  The world will lock down the 
would-be transhumanists and hound us into extinction without 
that.  They will likely tend to do so if the even see us as the 
master-competitors and thus as an immense danger to themselves.

That is why I also mentioned uploads.  I should have mentioned 
augmented humans.  Although in fact I think we need at least AIs 
and they will quickly lead to SI.

I understand this point but I don't believe isolated individuals 
have much chance alone even if as brilliant (and ruthless) as a 
comic book hero-villian like Dr. Doom.

Well, naturally you need to do both or it is simply a pipe-dream 
and more hype.  But you need the vision to guide and shape the 
efforts and you need to sell it broadly enough to accumulate the 
necessary resources and to have the result have sufficient 
impact.  Reality grows out of vision when you are speaking of 
massive change.

I don't believe either step, either vision or creation of the 
reality,  is optional.

There is are real problems here imho.  Our current business 
models suck seriously when it comes to keeping a vision alive 
and bringing it into reality without getting pulled too far into 
the muck.  Also, some of the tech we need, especially in 
software and information, needs to be relatively open and "free" 
  as in freedom to use and adapt it.  Seeking to make billions 
of that tech by conventional means would fight against its 
maximum effectiveness.

OK.  Except that we need a lot of those "swine" and we wish to 
open the possibility of being more than they believe they are. 
Undoubtedly this will be seen as "horrible" and "hatred of 
swinishness".

Dear Jeff,

If you had been born in the twelfth century, then you would not have
needed to go to Troubadour School. Further..., your particular mastery
of lexicon would have facilitated a european-wide chain of Troubador
Schools.

I rather like Elizabethan-debasing. If you want to insult someone
(or yourself), how can you beat

"Thou frothy clay-brained jolthead!"
or

"Rogue, avant, ye plague-sore!"
or

"Ye son and heir of a mongrel bitch!"   ?

And since people swore by their beards, their swords, their honors,
you can throw that in too:

"By my hammer and tongs, you bottle-ale rascal!"

But then there's the danger that the other will be laughing too hard to
take you seriously.

Troubadorism (*) is in your blood Jeff. Truly. You reign supreme. :-)

Thanks for the  solar wind streaming, and for the hearty lofty laughs.

Amara

(*) Some history, what say he? The Troubadors in the twelfth century
were poets of a certain character, they were the nobility of
Provence, and then later other parts of France and Europe. The
Trabadours have links to the even older Sufi poets. They (the
Trabadours) were wiped out in Provence in the Albigensian Crusade of
1209, launched by Pope Innocent III.

They were the first in the West who really thought of love as the
way we do now: as a person-to-person relationship. Well everyone
knows that, but their sociological contribution goes far deeper.
They were interested in the psychology of love as a personal,
individual experience, and they had the courage to affirm their
emotional experience against the tradition of the Church. ("libido
over credo", the mythologist Joseph Campbell calls it). Their accent
was on the individual, and they taught that one should have faith in
his experience and not mouth terms handed down to him by others.

You can see some traces of the Trabadours' life, still in Provence.
Les Baux de Provence is an old village and castle ruins located
on a detached (cliffs on all sides) portion of the Alpilles
mountains. (You would miss _alot_ if you travel by car, so take your
bicycle, please.) In the twelfth century, it was famous as a court
of love. To become a member, the women had to be of noble birth,
well-read and beautiful. Troubadours came from all of the southern
provinces and composed passionate verses in praise of these ladies.
The prize awarded to the best poet was a crown of peacock feathers
and a kiss from the lady in question.

Damien, the problem is that, in the book, Ellie does not go out and measure
some aspect of this universe.  Instead, she uses computers to look into the
mathematical expansion of pi for a hidden message of Creation.  There are some
who consider all of mathematics as exactly that message, with no specific
selection of universe.  Recently, Richard Greenblatt (prototypical hacker from
the old MIT days) gave a presentation at a conference I attended, in which he
offered analysis of DNA and RNA sequences going back to protozoa deep in the
earth as proof of the existence of a Creator.  I got the same feeling as
reading the end of _Contact_, only worse, because this was supposedly
non-fiction (the audience was visibly uncomfortable, but polite, although some
real biologists gave him questions he could only dance around).

Contrast any form of physical measurement with Archimedes, who started with a
simple hexagon and then allowed the sides to successively bifurcate (fractal
approach) until he had derived the formula for the perimeter of a 96 sided
regular polygon.  He then used this to set the value of pi between the
inscribed and circumscribed values of 3.14103 and 3.14271.

The fact that pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle
in flat Euclidean geometry, is just one of its manifold properties.  One of the
most far-reaching was discovered by Leonhard Euler circa 1736.  He showed that
if you started with the constant e and raised that to the power of the product
of pi and the square root of -1, then added one, you got zero.  Mathematicians
tend to wax poetic on this simple arrangement of these five special numbers (
1, 0, i, e, pi ).  So, if you go putting a special message in pi, you will also
have to mess with e, because there is no room in any of 1, 0, or i (square root
of -1).  But if you mess with e, then the function e to the x power will no
longer be its own derivative.  Thus by this route, e comes from the
differential equation x' = x, and pi can derived from e, thanks to Euler, so
circles are not involved, nor is the curvature of space-time.

Personally, my own archetype for "comic-book depiction of fake genius" is
Adrian Veidt, from "The Watchmen".  As far as I can tell, the moral of your
tale of Dr. Doom is the same as the moral of "The Watchmen":  Comic-book
characters are never any smarter than the authors, regardless of whether the
other characters call them "geniuses", "supergeniuses", "the smartest man in
the world", et cetera.  If these characters had real intelligence on the
remote order of that ascribed to them in the story, they would not need to
resort to taking over the world in order to fix it.  A competent world-fixer
should be able to solve everything wrong with Earth using a medium-sized
research project and no military force or political coercion.

  But is this only true for the outside observer ?  From within the curvature 
Pi would still relate ?.

Yet it is a commonplace that in Bolyai and Lobachevski spaces, the internal
angles of triangles sum to less than 180 degrees, and in Riemann space they
sum to more than 180. Euclid would have insisted that the *definition* of
`triangle' included the 180-degree sum. Sure you're not doing that with
circles? (I mean, sure, if we agree that circles by definition contain just
360 degrees, that must always be true, as long as we can then say that the
size of a degree changes according to the space it's measured in--which
seems a rather perverse metric. We could squeeze the Celsius range
freezing-to-boiling at the top of a mountain, so that you could happily put
your hand into 100 degree water, but that's too relativist for my tastes.)

I believe I implied that.  The question is whether we KNOW it to be an 
absolute limit.  I submit that at our present state of knowledge (since 
there ARE scientists who dispute it) we do not KNOW that it is an ABSOLUTE 
limit.

The point is, if I understand the concept of wormholes, that while one 
perhaps does not "break" the speed of light, one can "evade" it.  I'm only 
interested in results - if I can't do it one way, I'll do it 
another.  That's the difference between  a Transhumanist and a pedant.

By "sufficient direct knowledge" I mean being able to send the necessary 
scientific instrumentation to and possibly direct eyeball (or whatever 
transhumans use as "eyeballs") inspection of larger areas of the universe 
than our solar system and the data we can gather via astronomy.  It should 
be apparent to anyone following the newspapers that every time science 
moves out a little ways, the current theories tend to get mangled.  The 
size of the universe, for example, seems to grow substantially every few 
years...

How is it different from what we have been doing?  Degree...  Or are you 
assuming that a Transhuman entity with a brain thinking a million times 
faster than ours and the ability to manufacture any scientific 
instrumentation he can engineer and send it anywhere it can reach is not 
going to discover anything new?

Perhaps, but some other people on this list seem to assume that such 
entities will compete.  I don't claim to know . I tend to agree with your 
view in this regard.  However, my point stands - replication is not a given.

That's not MY view - that's what I am questioning!

Familial companionship?  For a Transhuman?  I doubt that very much.  And as 
I have indicated elsewhere, producing clones of yourself does NOT insure 
anything about YOUR survival - only about the survival of entities that - 
at some point in time - used to be you. The last remark sounds suspiciously 
like a sandbagging, so I'll ignore it...

As noted above, that is not MY argument - that is someone else's idea.  I 
have no problem with producing clones of myself other than the fact that I 
see no need to do so.  Nor do I assume that there is a scarcity of 
resources.  I believe earlier posts by others indicated that there might be 
unconstrained replication which would eat up significant resources and thus 
pose a limit on the survival probability of any given Transhuman.  I tend 
to doubt that because I do not see any need for a Transhuman to replicate 
in such a manner unless there is an a priori need, i.e., some apparent 
threat to its survival if it does not do so.  I'm still waiting for someone 
- other than Leitl who revels in incomprehensible prose worse than Hakim 
Bey - :} - to produce an argument as to the nature of this need to replicate.

If you can fit your consciousness in a piece of dirt, how is this not 
"corporeal existence"?  That dirt - or any computer system - is subject to 
the effects of the physical universe.  The only argument I can entertain 
here is the one which I originally read by Robert Ettinger - that any 
entity occupying a single confined area of space/time cannot be immortal 
because there is a greater than zero probability that the area of 
space/time occupied will be trashed, and this probability approaches one 
the longer the entity exists;  his corollary is that if you somehow 
separate yourself into more than one space/time location, the odds 
flip-flop and your survival is assured.

The problem with this notion is metaphysical - how do you separate yourself 
into more than one location in space/time AND still maintain the coherence 
and continuity that is YOU?  We don't know any technology to do it 
(telepresence doesn't count - that does not move YOU, it merely extends 
your perception and brings the universe to you;  similarly, cloning creates 
OTHER BEINGS - it does not separate YOU).

Actually, I am not convinced that Ettinger's argument is valid, or at least 
that it too is some sort of absolute that cannot somehow be "evaded".  And 
in any event, it is not clear nor certain how long it would be before your 
portion of space/time got trashed - a few billion years might be enough for 
me if in fact there is not way to avoid it.  Like a sci-fi novel I read a 
couple years ago, I'll put a few trillion femtoprocessors to work on the 
problem when I get around to it....

Well. he IS a villain - even if he was the hero in his own comic.  And 
there are obvious "morals" (or explanations) as to why and how he fails to 
achieve his goals.  My point was that his comments on nanotech were echoing 
some of the posts here about what may happen should we fail to convince the 
powers that be (or the population or whoever) that Transhumanism is a 
positive thing.  The writers of Doom 2099 were apparently wannabe 
Situationists or leftists or liberals or whatever and they used Doom to 
make a few political points.  This is fairly rare in mainstream comics.  I 
also assume there was an artistic point to it - I wouldn't venture what.

But Doom is one of my role models in life - not entirely, of course (he IS 
a villain and a tyrant) - but like a hell of a lot of Marvel comic readers, 
he is very well liked for his positive qualities.  In fact, in this series, 
the writers gave him more positive qualities than he has ever exhibited 
before in the near forty years of his literary existence.

It's like Hannibal Lector - does anyone doubt that Thomas Harris *likes* 
Hannibal Lector?  The man is the hero (contrary to Jodie's belief that 
Clarice is the hero) of three of Harris' novels.  Most people don't seem to 
realize that Harris is writing *satire*, not thrillers.  Look at his 
nominal heros - an FBI agent who is so good at catching serial killers 
because he thinks like they do, and a female FBI agent with an obsession to 
save women because of a childhood trauma.  If you read "Silence", Clarice 
is a "Fed bitch" with virtually no redeeming qualities except her 
ambition.  By "Hannibal", she has mutated (due to Foster's vulnerable 
performance) into someone who can ensnare Hannibal himself.  If you read 
"Hannibal" closely and know something about Foster's life, it seems evident 
that Harris used a lot of that to flesh out Clarice in more appealing terms 
than he did in the first book.  But *Lector* is the hero in all three books.

I think you meant "...and raised that to the power of (pi raised to the power

Given that I do not know where I will be as a Transhuman in a thousand 
years, and given the likelihood that my brain at that point will be quite 
capable of doing such an analysis in much shorter time than I have to deal 
with this now,  I see no reason to worry about physical limits at this 
time, thank you.

Ah, yes, Robert Ettinger's hypothesis, I assume.  If you exist at a single 
point in space/time, you can't be immortal; if you are distributed, you can be.

I'm not convinced.  Worse, I have a metaphysical problem with the notion of 
"distribution" -  that I do not know of any technology to accomplish it AND 
preserve the identity and continuity of the entity in question.

As noted above, the concept of "distribution" seems to be hand-waving since 
we know of no technology (at this point) to do it and as noted above 
preserve the identity and continuity of the entity involved.  If you can do 
it, of course, then you would be correct and the approach would be 
attractive to me.  "Uploading" as it has been described to me does not meet 
my criteria.

Ah, I may miss the point.  Why would the distributed entities produce the 
least novel info?  Mike Lorrey seems to believe the opposite - that you 
distribute yourself to increase your rate of experience.  You seem to be 
saying the opposite.

But I still see no evidence - other than your notion of distribution to 
avoid space/time catastrophe - that replication would be considered 
desirable by a posthuman entity.  The  "society" notion advanced by others 
- that posthumans would replicate because this would increase the utility 
of all - may or may not be true.  We don't know what Transhuman 
intelligence will be like - they may desire or need society; they may not.

On the other hand, it could well be that Darwinian competition continues IF 
in fact there are hard limits and the entities come up against them in a 
reasonably short time (by their lights).  If that is the case, then the 
Highlander motto, "There can be only One", may well prove true.  Perhaps we 
haven't been contacted by higher intelligence because HE doesn't give a 
damn...  In that case, Doctor Doom starts to look like a better role model 
all the time...

Pi is a constant that does not change no matter where you are, how much
you weigh, or how fast you are going.  It says some things about flat
Euclidean space, and to the extent your observations of the space around
do not match, pi helps you figure out the nature of the curvature.

Here is an example: suppose you are at the south pole of the earth and
you have 100 m of steel wire.  You can put one end of the wire at the
pole and stretch it out so as to walk a circular path around the pole at
a constant distance of 100 m.  If you divide the distance you walked by
200 m, you will get a number very close to pi.  Next, get a boat and
travel around antarctica at a constant distance of about 3000 km.  If
you divide the distance you go around by 6000 km, you will find the
result is very much lower than pi.  If you keep going north to the
equator and try this, the ratio of circumference to diameter will be
exactly 2, and if you keep going to within a couple meters of the north
pole, this ratio get very close to zero.  So, pi did not change, but the
ratio of the circumference to diameter of a path through the locus of
points equidistant to a fixed point on a spherical shell is dependent on
the length chosen for the radius, although the curvature of the space is
constant.

More of the same: scratch a triangle in the dirt and measure the sum of
the angles, and you will get something close to 180 degrees.  But if you
start at the north pole and go to the equator, then turn right 90
degrees and go 1/4 the way around, and then turn right again 90 degrees,
you will arrive back at the north pole on a line 90 degrees from start.
So in this case a triangle has three 90 degree angles that sum to 270
degrees.  Again, the sum of the angles of a triangle in a space with
spherical curvature depends on its size in relation to the radius of
space curvature.

Don't mess with pi, you will get 2300 years of Greeks and Geeks all over
you.

Well - he IS a villain!  He may be the hero of this series of comics, and 
the writers may be portraying him a bit more sympathetically than other 
writers at Marvel have in the past, but they know what the readers want - 
they want Doom to be DOOM!

I agree, of course - except the part that they CAN be shown - the jury is 
very much out on that one.

That is part of his "charm" - his flaws are obvious to the reader.  If you 
knew his origin story, it would be even more obvious.

The Introduction to the trade paperback "The Villainy of Doctor Doom" has 
the following comments:

"Doctor Doom is the quintessential, the ultimate, Marvel Comic's 
supervillain, bar none.  Forget latter-day pikers 
like...Magneto.  Everything they know about being big-time world-class 
menaces they cribbed from Doom in the first place.  But Doom is the 
original - the real goods."

"But just what is it that sets the Lord of Latveria above all of his 
sinister colleagues?...It think it all boils down to complexity, power and 
panache."

"Doom had already established his position as the ne plus ultra of the 
Marvel super-villain set by the time his origin was revealed in Fantastic 
Four Annual no. 2 - but that tale propelled him to even greater 
heights.  For it peeled away the layers of Doom's psyche, and revealed the 
tragedies that made him the man he is today.  It events had taken a 
different course, he could easily have been a hero, a humanitarian, an 
Albert Schweitzer.  But, alas, fate had other plans."

"Doom has style, sophistication.  He's no simple world-beater... He 
possesses a keenly-honed aesthetic."

"All Doom wants to do is rule the world, because he' s sure that he can do 
a better job of it than anyone else.  And who's to say he isn't right?  A 
quick look around at our current society shows that we haven't been all 
that well up until now..."

"So it's true.  Doom has an ego.  But let's face it - he has a lot to be 
egotistical about.  He's a genius-level intellect, adept at both the 
science of man and the sorcery of the underworld.  He's the undisputed 
sovereign of his own personal country.  He's walked away from certain death 
more times than you can shake a stick at. He's two steps ahead of even his 
smartest opponents at all times. And he never, ever really loses. The only 
person who's ever defeated Doom is Doom himself.  And, as he himself has 
said, 'Defeat with honor is merely victory delayed.'"

"Face it, he's better than you.  He's better than all of us."

"He's Doom."

Obviously...  But as I said, he IS a villain - for reasons of oppression in 
his past.  If you saw the X-Men, Magneto is very similar to Doom - and like 
Doom, over the years, Marvel's writer have changed Magneto from a simple 
villain out to browbeat everyone around him to a tortured soul forced by 
his history to follow a course that brings him into inevitable conflict 
with the rest of the world.  But as the Intro above notes, Doom was the 
original.

Look at Star Wars - the whole current trilogy replicates the concept on the 
big screen - somebody starts out okay, but after the world gets through 
with them - they end up Darth Vader - only to save the day at the end (of 
the first trilogy, when Vader defeats the Emperor to save his son).  And I 
am convinced that it is Doom that served as Lucas' model for Vader 
somewhere in his subconscious...


>Yes.  Now, how will you apply it?

Actually, I only mean to relate it to the current discussion.  Clearly the 
story mirrors some of what has been discussed on this list - namely, the 
possible consequences of political and/or corporate control of nanotech,  etc.

That is where we disagree - I'm not convinced that they can "lock us down" 
- remember Drexler's comments on that.  Also, you seem to agree with me 
that those in power will do so if they see us as competitors - all the more 
reason not to attract their attention by trying to make Transhumanism 
mainstream.  There is an advantage to being considered a kook - no one sees 
you coming.  As the Chinese say, "Everyone knows the advantage of being 
useful.  No one knows the advantage of being useless" - i.e., if you are 
useful, you'll get used.

The attitude of *those in power* will NOT be changed by any argument - even 
if you can convince a significant portion of the rest of the population 
that Transhumanism is acceptable.  You would have to go much further and 
convince the population of the need to radically change government and 
social structure - as you have said.  Then you would have to actually do 
it.  Do you really believe that this can be done within the 20-50 years 
before Transhuman technology is available?  I don't.

I think they have a chance to survive, if not to change the world.  If Doom 
were to concentrate on increasing his own security (as indeed he does in 
many story lines - so much so that he has had enormous Transhuman power on 
occasion far beyond his scientific powers), he would eventually be far more 
likely to achieve his goals.  As an aside, after his "Presidency" is 
overthrown, he uses nanotech to destroy the ones responsible

Remember what Drexler suggested in "Engines" - nanotech in the hands of a 
dictator could mean that people are unnecessary (of course, no dictator 
would go that way, since a dictator needs people to rule - that is his 
basic emotional motivation - to establish himself as above all other people 
- flight response).  Well, in the hands of a Transhuman, it could mean 
invulnerability to coercion from the State - depending on whether it is 
used with proper strategy and tactics, of course.

And we may not be alone - even a small group plus nanotech could be very 
effective - although it took decades until Bin Laden demonstrated that 
terrorists *could* be effective.

Massive change can grow out of personal efforts.  The PC came out of 
personal efforts and created massive change after it was "sold broadly 
enough" - but the selling was not ideological or philosophical.  The 
selling was first to the hackers and IT people who could understand it - 
and then to the mainstream for purely economic reasons.

Granted, I wouldn't look to the corporate world for leadership in this 
area.  As to "open-source", it seems to be a good way to get tech built and 
even distributed, but it's not clear that it can defeat closed-source in 
the market - yet.  Some forecasters are saying it will.  I'm not sure.  In 
any event, I need those billions to control the development of the tech I 
need to survive, so for me it is not an issue.

We need *some* of the "swine" - a future version of Doom once tried to 
destroy a significant part of the world population because he wanted 
"enough people to serve me but not enough to defy me" (he was destroyed by 
his 20th-Century self, BTW).  But unless the "swine" wipe themselves out, 
it is unlikely we need worry about having them around to use for our 
purposes.  Our real problem will be keeping them out of our hair...

So I get an e-mail from a biochemist in Germany who is blissfully unaware of
transhumanism, describes himself as a scientific immortalist and has
pro-life-extension materials he's churning out in isolation. I sent him a
bunch of links, introduced him to
real-transhumanist-life-extensionist-society-in-a-web-tour (which, funnily
enough, is still just about as easy as pointing to Anders and saying "look"]
and hopefully he'll be joining the list and dropping some essays in my lap
for the Longevity Meme.

Maybe I'm just easily pleased, but that makes me feel happy.

[Or maybe it's because I just reproduced, in some oddball memetic way. I
wonder how Anders feels about being an agent of transhumanist memetic
reproduction].

Yuck!  This is the exact kind of irresponsible work that will get cloning
outlawed world-wide.  Human DNA in a cow egg?  Human nuclear DNA plus cow
mitachondrial DNA?  Nine-nine percent human (and presumably one percent
cow)?  A combination human-animal embryo?  This is exactly what scares the
public.  Why would anyone do something like this and then brag about it
publicly.  I can't see anybody wanting to endorse making animal-human
hybrids today.

Yes, well I try to snip what I can without losing the thread of what I'm 
replying to, since some people have misread other people's posts as mine.

As to number of responses, I am aware of the limit - a lot of people have 
responded to my posts, apparently with the intent of arguing me off the 
list.  I'm just responding.  I suppose I could wait until tomorrow, since 
none of this is earning me any money.  But I tend to read a post, 
immediately see my response, and wish to get it over with, so I can move on 
to the next point (or other project).

Again,. if it is the consensus that my posts are not useful or interesting, 
I will stop.

*Chuckle* I clipped the below quote from this really crappy article on
Stephen Hawking I stumbled across at
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/21414.html. Given that google has now
cached/immortalized it, I suppose it's found it's time capsule. Poor Thomas
C Greene in Washington. Now your children and grandchildren can access your
pompous stupidity for all eternity. May they be entirely successful in their
future efforts to pretend they never heard of you.

"We humans invented such delicious and decidedly un-mechanical things as
religious awareness, dance, language, visual arts and literature (and I say
in that order). We are religious creatures; we are artistic creatures; and
when we're exceptionally cool, we're literary creatures.

No machine will be. Put this article in a time capsule and let it be read
fifteen centuries from now. I tell my remote descendants with absolute
confidence that they will not have built a religious, artistic, or literary
machine. With advanced genetic engineering they may duplicate a human being,
fine; but they will never, never ever, simulate one. It can't be done."

Thank you for the links. I can be convinced of something without being
committed to it, and am thus always willing to reconsider my conclusions.

Yes, I am aware that it is claimed that HIV genomes have been sequenced.
However, upon first review I don't think those links address the major
concern The Perth Group has raised.

Unquestionably, by molecular cloning one can obtain large amounts of
"purified" DNA, but equally unquestionable is the fact that molecular
cloning tells you nothing about the origin of a particular DNA molecule.

To sequence "the HIV genome" one must know beforehand that a particular DNA
is the HIV genome. In other words, one must start with "HIV RNA" which can
be obtained only by prior purification of particles proven to be retroviral
particles. Since it is argued that this has not been achieved, then what is
the origin of the DNA fragment which is known as the "HIV genome" which is
routinely cloned in labs?

This is how I understand the genetic information of HIV was manufactured, as
Dr. Stephan Lanka has described:

[begin Lanka quote]
Since no virus has been isolated, it follows that no nucleic acid has been
isolated from it either. Complicated procedures are, nonetheless, described
in the literature, at the end of which something is produced which is called
the nucleic acid of HIV.

1. In a tube....
HIV and its DNA can allegedly be made by the "bucketful", but under very
surprising conditions which, inter alia, entail the use of extracts from
plants and other oxidising chemicals, which could not possibly exist in
vivo. Immortalised cell lines devised (and later patented) by the Montagnier
and Gallo groups are co-cultured with extracts from human cells or the cells
themselves. At the end of it all HIV itself is not actually obtained only
reverse transcriptase activity is shown to occur which is taken to imply
that the DNA that is found, must have been viral in origin. The real
explanation of what happens is as follows. In the mixture of cell cultures
and stressed human cells, RNA and reverse transcriptase come to be produced
in large amounts, because the cells have been specially selected and treated
to do this. The RNA is transcribed into DNA by reverse
transcriptase, and long pieces of DNA are produced which are said to be
viral DNA. In fact they are composed of unrelated pieces of expressed
cellular RNA, transcribed into DNA and linked together by a process of
"template switching" (a well-characterised property of reverse
transcriptase). This misleads ordinary researchers into believing that they
have actually produced viral DNA. It is said that this linear DNA is the
free or the non-integrated form of HIV, which furthermore is said to be a
unique feature of HIV, because a lot of detectable free linear DNA has not
been suggested in any other models of retroviruses.

2. Through selecting processes....
The resulting pieces of DNA too, are necessarily both shorter and longer
than the "correct" length of HIV. Pieces  corresponding to the "correct"
length of HIV must be selected for size, because otherwise the purported DNA
preparation would be a mixture of various lengths, which would violate a
cardinal rule of virology that all nucleic acid of a particular virus be
identical in size.

3. Through a detecting process....
Having artificially prepared DNA pieces of uniform length, they are still
not ready for presentation, because they consist of a mixture of all kinds
of RNA fragments transcribed into DNA and thus cannot be shown to represent
unique viral DNA. Accordingly, the mixture is subjected to a kind of
key-and-lock detection process called hybridisation, whereby pieces of DNA
are detected which complement more or less a probe of that which it is
desired to be shown to have been prepared.

4. Choosing a desired probe....
Since no DNA from HIV existed to hybridise with the prepared DNA, Gallo and
Montagnier simply used stretches of DNA from what they said was specific to
HTLV-I, a retrovirus Gallo had earlier claimed to have discovered, and which
they deemed suitable for this purpose. The DNA detected in this way was
replicated and certain stretches of it cloned and declared to be the DNA of
HTLV-III (later to be called HIV).

To summarise, the purpose of the exercise is to grow HIV, but it actually
produces a mixture of different lengths of DNA, contrary to theory which
says they should all be identical, and no virus at all. It is then claimed
that the "correct" DNA has been prepared by finding certain strands in this
heterogeneous mix by hybridising them with an HTLV-I DNA probe whose
sequence is known and defined also to be HIV. However, non-hybridising
strands of DNA should not be there at all, and the fact that they are,
proves that a complete rag-bag of DNA has been prepared, without any
indication of what it is made up of.
It follows that "HIV" DNA must just be a laboratory artefact constructed to
a preconceived idea of what retroviral DNA should be, and this assessment
does not even raise the question why no virus can be obtained, whatever the
experimental conditions.

Gallo and Montagnier's cloned HIV DNA
After defining some segments of DNA to be "HIV"-specific, every researcher
in the field worked exclusively with short, cloned sequences (never the
whole strand) on the reasonable assumption that the original
characterisation had been correctly performed. From the isolation and
identification procedure described above, it follows that the resultant
sequences vary widely from one preparation to the next, which sequence
analysts misinterpreted as the legendary capacity of HIV to mutate.

[end Lanka quote]

Maybe I'm missing something, but IF HIV has not been isolated, then I don't
see how it can be claimed that the HIV genome has been sequenced.

An electron micrograph of a proper viral isolate would end all reasonable
doubt.  Montagnier claimed he had "isolated" HIV in 1983. When Montagnier
was asked in July 1997 by French Journalist Djamel Tahi why such photos were
not published, his answer was because, even after "Roman effort", they could
see no particles with "morphology typical of retroviruses. I repeat we did
not purify..."[http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/data/dtinterviewlm.htm]

Also in 1997 the leading science journal Virology published two papers that
provided stunning new data on the "isolation" of HIV.[  Bess JW, Gorelick
RJ, Bosche WJ, Henderson LE, Arthur LO. (1997). Microvesicles are a source
of contaminating cellular proteins found in purified HIV-1 preparations.
Virol. 230:134-144.] and [ Gluschankof P, Mondor I, Gelderblom HR, Sattentau
QJ. (1997). Cell membrane vesicles are a major contaminant of
gradient-enriched human immunodeficiency virus type-1 preparations. Virol.
230:125-133.]

For the first time, electron microscope images of "HIV" banded at the
density required for retroviruses were published. They revealed "major
contaminants" in "pure HIV", consisting of an excess of vesicles - particles
of cellular proteins.

HIV expert Hans Gelderblom of Berlin's Robert Koch Institute, whose photos
of non-banded 'HIV' material have been the industrial benchmark since 1987,
co-authored the first paper which describes the contamination as "an excess
of vesicles" - particles of cellular proteins, that may contain DNA or RNA.
In a consecutive paper, a US research team from the AIDS Vaccine Programme
in Maryland reveal carefully, "It is unknown how these cellular proteins
associate with the virus" and warn, "The presence of microvesicles in
purified retroviruses has practical implications".

Yes, I would say so!  And if something purported to be "pure HIV" was
revealed to contain "major contaminants", I would argue it is time to stop
calling it "purified retrovirus".  These articles reveal gross
contamination.

Both artcles discuss the resulting nonspecifity of HIV tests, all of which
are based on early unchecked "purified HIV".

While on the subject of HIV tests, I would like to direct attention to the
article attatched below.  Most serologic tests that look for the presence of
antibodies against germs uses neat serum [undiluted]. For example, the tests
that look for antibodies to hepatitis A and B viruses, rubella virus,
syphilis, hystoplasma and cryptococus, to mention a few of them, use
straight serum [undiluted]. However, to try to prevent false positive
reactions some serologic tests use diluted serum; for example this is the
case with tests that look for antibodies to measles, varicella and mumps
viruses which use a dilution of 1:16, to cytomegalovirus [CMV] 1:20 and to
Epstein-Barr Virus [EBV] 1:10.

The ELISA test is a test for antibodies against what is supposed to be the
Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV. To run this test, an individual.s serum
has to be diluted to a ratio of 1:400 with a special specimen diluent.



The obvious questions are: What makes HIV so unique that the test serum
needs to be diluted 400 times? And what would happen if the individual.s
serum is not diluted?



Preliminary results are that every sample so far tested without dilution
tests positive. This seems paradoxical to the infectious HIV/AIDS model;
predicted by the Perth Groups model. The author discusses the implications
of this and suggests an experiment to further clarify matters.

EVERYBODY REACTS POSITIVE ON THE ELISA TEST FOR HIV


By


Roberto A. Giraldo, MD





                  For the last 6 years I have been working at a laboratory
of clinical immunology in one of the most prestigious University Hospitals
in the City of New York. Here I have had the opportunity to personally run
and get to know in detail the current tests used for the diagnosis of HIV
status, namely, the ELISA, Western blot and Viral Load tests.



                  1. Diluting the serum for the ELISA test



                  The ELISA test is a test for antibodies against what is
supposed to be the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV. To run this test, an
individual.s serum has to be diluted to a ratio of 1:400 with a special
specimen diluent. According to the test kit manufacturer this diluent
contains "0.1% triton X-100, Bovine and Goat Sera (minimum concentration of
5%) and Human T-Lymphocyte Lysate (minimum titer 1:7500). Preservative: 0.1%
Sodium Azide" (1).



                  This extraordinarily high dilution of the person.s serum
[400 times] took me by surprise. Most serologic tests that look for the
presence of antibodies against germs uses neat serum [undiluted]. For
example, the tests that look for antibodies to hepatitis A and B viruses,
rubella virus, syphilis, hystoplasma and cryptococus, to mention a few of
them, use straight serum [undiluted]. However, to try to prevent false
positive reactions some serologic tests use diluted serum; for example this
is the case with tests that look for antibodies to measles, varicella and
mumps viruses which use a dilution of 1:16, to cytomegalovirus [CMV] 1:20
and to Epstein-Barr Virus [EBV] 1:10.



                  The obvious questions are: What makes HIV so unique that
the test serum needs to be diluted 400 times? And what would happen if the
individual.s serum is not diluted ?



                  2. Testing the ELISA test without diluting the serum



                  To answer these questions I ran an experiment in a medical
laboratory in Yorktown Heights, New York. I ran it using the same test kit
reagents that are usually used to run the ELISA test in most clinical
laboratories worldwide (1).



                  I first took samples of blood that, at 1:400 dilution,
tested negative for antibodies to HIV. I then ran the exact same serum
samples through the test again, but this time without diluting them. Tested
straight, they all came positive.



                  Since that time I have run about 100 specimens and have
always gotten the same result. I even ran my own blood which at 1:400 reacts
negative. At 1:1 [undiluted] it reacted positive. I should mention that with
the exception of my own blood, the patient samples all came from doctors who
requested HIV tests. It is therefore likely that most of the blood samples
that I tested belonged to individuals at risk for AIDS.



                  According to Abbott Laboratories, the absorbance value
[yellow color intensity] "develops in proportion to the amount of antibodies
to HIV-1 which is bound to the bead" (1). What I noticed is that the
absorbance values of the specimens that tested negative when diluted
[1:400], but positive when undiluted [1:1], had lower values that the
samples that, diluted, react positive on both the ELISA and Western blot
tests. This would probably mean that the blood that is negative when diluted
but positive when undiluted has a lower level of antibodies than the diluted
blood that is doubly positive and, therefore, may probably test negative on
the Western blot test. However, I have not had the opportunity to check this
hypothesis.



                  It is important to note that the Western blot antibody
test for "HIV" also needs serum to be diluted. Although it too has an
unusually high dilution, here the individual serum is only diluted at a
ratio of 1:50 (2). I have not yet had the opportunity to run this test with
undiluted [1:1] specimens.



                  3. Discussion



                  The following are three possible explanations for why
undiluted specimens of blood always react positive at the ELISA test:



                  3.1. Everybody has HIV antibodies.



                  It is accepted worldwide that the ELISA test for HIV
detects antibodies against what is known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(3-6). And the       pharmaceutical company that commercializes the ELISA
kits states that "Abbott

HIVAB HIV-1 EIA is an in vitro qualitative Enzyme Immunoassay for the
Detection of Antibody to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) in
Human Serum and Plasma" (1).



                  Since all undiluted blood specimens react positive on the
ELISA test, a test that supposedly tests for antibodies to HIV, the results
presented here suggest that every single human being has HIV antibodies. And
this suggests that everybody has been exposed to HIV antigens.



                  This would mean that all of us have been exposed to the
virus that is believed to be the cause of AIDS. The people that react
positive even at a dilution of 1:400, would be the ones that have had the
highest level of exposure to HIV antigens. The rest of the people - the ones
that only react positive with undiluted serum [1:1] - would have had a lower
level of exposure to HIV.



                  3.2. Everybody has different levels of HIV infection.



                  It is also believed worldwide that a person that reacts
positive for antibodies against HIV has not only been exposed to but is
infected with a deadly virus that causes immunedeficiency (3-6). Therefore,
the positive reactions of all undiluted serums would mean that everybody, or
at least all the blood samples that I have tested, including my own, are
infected with this "deadly" virus. The ones that react positive at a ratio
of 1:400 would simply have a higher level of "deadly" infection than the
"deadly" infection had by the ones that only react positive with undiluted
serum.



                  3.3. The test is not specific for HIV.



                  The results presented here could also mean that the tests
used for detecting antibodies to HIV are not specific for HIV, as has been
explained previously (7-14). In this case, there would be reasons other than
HIV infection, past or present, to explain why a person reacts positive to
it. The test also reacts positive in the absence of HIV (7-14).



                  The scientific literature has documented more than 70
different reasons for getting a positive reaction other than past or present
infection with HIV (7,10,11,14,15). All these conditions have in common a
history of polyantigenic stimulations (15,16).



                  Even Abbott Laboratories is well aware of the specificity
problems with the ELISA test. This is why they state: "EIA testing alone
cannot be used to diagnose AIDS, even if the recommended investigation of
reactive specimens suggests a high probability that the antibody to HIV-1 is
present" and "Although for all clinical and public health applications of
the EIA both the degree of risk for HIV-1 infection of the person studied
and the degree of reactivity of the serum may be of value in interpreting
the test, these correlations are imperfect.



                  Therefore, in most settings it is appropriate to
investigate repeatably reactive specimens by additional more specific or
supplemental tests" (1). Interestingly, there are countries like Great
Britain where the diagnosis of HIV status is based on the ELISA test alone.
No Western blot or any other test is needed there.



                  The only proper way for establishing the sensitivity and
specificity of a given test is with a gold standard. However, since HIV has
never been isolated as an independent purified viral entity (17-19), there
cannot be a gold standard for HIV. The sensitivity and specificity of the
antibody tests for HIV have instead been defined based on the assumption
that HIV is the cause of AIDS. In this way, "The Abbott studies show that:
Sensitivity based on an assumed 100% prevalence of HIV-1 antibody in AIDS
patients is estimated to be 100% (144 patients tested)" and "Specificity
based on an assumed zero prevalence of HIV-1 in random donors is estimated
to be 99.9% (4777 random donors tested)" (1).



                  "At present there is no recognized standard for
establishing the presence and absence of HIV-1 antibody in human blood.
Therefore sensitivity was computed based on the clinical diagnosis of AIDS
and specificity based on random donors" (1). [Emphasis is mine].



                  Since there is no scientific evidence that the ELISA test
is specific for HIV antibodies, a reactive ELISA test at any concentration
of the serum would mean presence of non-specific or polyspecific antibodies
(20). These antibodies could be present in all blood samples. They are most
likely a result of the stress response, having no relation to any
retrovirus, let alone HIV (21,22). In this case, a reactive test could be a
measure of the degree of one.s exposure to stressor or oxidizing agents
(15,16).



                  The inevitable conclusion is that all positive reactions
for antibodies to HIV are simply false positives. If nobody is positive for
HIV, then people who react positive on the ELISA test do so due to something
other than HIV.



                  4. Proposal to find out the real meaning of the "HIV
antibody" tests To uncover the meaning of these tests I propose a simple
experiment: Take blood from three groups of people and run the tests highly
diluted, undiluted and at a wide spectrum of dilutions in between. The first
group would be a group of healthy people of many age groups; the second
group would be a group of people from the conventional AIDS "risk groups";
the third group would be a group of people with clinical conditions both
related and unrelated to AIDS. All groups would be subjected to both the
ELISA and Western blot tests.



                  Additionally, all blood samples could be subjected to the
"the viral load test for  HIV". The results of such an experiment could
determine whether these test measurements bear any relationship to an
individual.s level of exposure to stressor or oxidizing agents. If so, the
tests could be salvaged as a measure of an individual.s level of
intoxication.



                  Let us find the economic support necessary to run this
experiment. In the mean time, since people are reacting positive on tests
that are not specific for HIV, let's please stop labeling them as "HIV
positive".



                  5. Acknowledgments

No, it really is e ^ (i * pi) = (e ^ i) * ( e ^ pi) = -1  and let me tell 
you its darn useful for solving second order differential equations (as I'm 
learning this semester).

I wouldn't have said it a year ago but a strong case could be made that a
substantial minority and perhaps even a majority of roman Catholic priests
are pedophiles. According to an investigation by the Boston Globe the Roman
Catholic archdiocese of Boston has quietly settled child sex abuse claims
against at least 70 priests in the last 10 years. The number 70 is conservative as
some court records are still sealed, some put the number at 107. The entire
Boston Archdiocese has about 650 priests, so between 11 and 16% have been
caught having sex with children. Most child abusers are not caught so one can
only wonder what the true numbers are.

It's not just limited to Boston or to lower level clergy. About 25 years ago a 13 year
old seminary student was sexually molested by two priests who were his teachers.
The traumatized boy went to the head of the seminary Anthony J. O'Connell
for counseling but instead Father O'Connell molested him too. When the boy
grew up he sued the church. At the trial Father O'Connell admitted his guilt but
the church offered the victim $125,000 if he would keep quiet and allow the
court records to be sealed. 3 years after (AFTER!) he admitted he was a
pedophile he was promoted and made Bishop of Palm Beach Florida, a dream job.
They had an opening there because the previous Bishop, Joseph Keith Symons,
had to resign after he admitted he had sexually molested five little boys.
The entire sordid story came to light a few day ago when the victim went public.
I just saw Bishop O'Connell say on TV that was not the only time he had sex with
a child.

The sad thing is that this will probably have little effect on the average Catholic,
they will still go to church on Sunday and sit in respectful silence as a closet
pedophile lectures them about morality and put money in the collection plate
to pay for more hush money. It's enough to make one despair and question
the sanity of the human race.

Setting aside for the moment the public-relations
problem--admittedly the central point in Harvey's
post--might there be some clear benefit from such a
transgenic cellular chimera?

I saw a movie once where Mariel Hemingway was an
athelete in training, and her coach made a comment
about how she was part native American, and that her
strength or endurance were a consequence of the
'quality'--high-energy output--of her mitochondria.
Then I read in Sci Am about mitochondrial malfunction
and disease.  Got me to thinking, "What is range of
variations in mitochondria, and what might be the
benefit of being able to control the 'quality' of
same?"  Might hummingbird mitochondria give you huge
short-burst energy availability or unheard of
endurance?  If mitochondrial durability is related to
aging, could right whale--life span now posited to be
200+(?) yrs-- mitochondria result in a substantially
extended life span. (Using  Right whale eggs and one's
own nuclear DNA, you get replacement heart, brain, etc
tissues which mayhaps last a loooong time.)(OK,
getting a viable right whale egg may be tough, but you
only have to get one--or one batch anyway.  Then you
clone a pig--you know one of those human
immuno-compatible transgenic oinkers--and use the
pigs-with-right-whale-mitochondria for your subsequent
egg supply.)

Point is, we talk all the time about dna mods, but
give short shrift to mitochondrial dna, which is
certainly behind mitochondrial quality.  All manner of
different kinds of cells do all sorts of important
things.  And they all rely on the mitochondria to
supply the juice to get the job done.  

Leave the yuck factor to the luddites, I want my
high-performance mitochondria, and I don't care what
species it comes from (as long as it's compatible).

Best, Jeff Davis

You can't see it? Well . . . but say a body actually desired that which you

Carl Sagan credited intellectual and science-related achievements to
insights he purportedly experienced while high on marijuana!

No, this is not a report from the National Enquirer ;)

----------------------

***According to the news report cited:

'In the essay, Sagan said marijuana inspired some of his intellectual work.

"I can remember one occasion, taking a shower with my wife while high, in
which I had an idea on the origins and invalidities of racism in terms of
gaussian distribution curves," wrote the former Cornell University
professor. "I wrote the curves in soap on the shower wall, and went to write
the idea down." '

***ROTFL.

--------------------

If smoking pot affected Sagan's ability to come up with insights the way 
smoking pot affected my law school classmates' sense of humor, I wouldn't 
count on those insights as being anything serious.  I remember my classmates 
sitting around laughing uproarously at the ingredients listing on one of 
those bags of Doritos once...

Len "meanwhile, the only time I partook one of those evenings I spent it in 
the corner feeling very definitely ill" Cleavelin

---------------------

You got to the Dorito buying stage? I've been errrrr involved in attacks
of the munchies where it took a good 15 minutes to decide WHICH bag of
Doritos to buy (and there were only 3 bags to choose from). 

I think Sagan's insights were not of the hallucinatory kind but rather
came from being in an "altered" state (whatever that means). Sort of
like those great ideas you get after a few too many beers.;-)

Threading this back to the discussion on artistic angst, many a person
of the artistic persuasion has used chemicals to enhance the creative
process. I believe that Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote most of his work
stoned of out of his gourd. Hendrix created a magnificent body of work
while ingesting any drug he could get a hand on. Kurt Cobain combined
the angst and drug thing way too well and destroyed himself and
rock'n'roll in the process.

I've had a discussion with a writer friend on whether drugs can enhance
the creative process. Personally, we both agreed that it doesn't work.
I'd rather play the guitar sober because I know I suck drunk or high. A
lot of it is simply being able to keep the hand co-ordination happening.
Most people on this list would of experience moments where they have
been consumed by a problem with no solution forthcoming. Later, far
removed from the context of the problem and doing something entirely
different, the solution presents itself. I think this is what drugs
faciliate for some poeple. It relaxes the mind so to speak and allows
the creative spark to sparkle.

I know from playing the guitar that if I think about what I am playing
(especially live) it doesn't really work. I play best when I don't
think. That is I concentrate solely on the music and leave such thoughts
as theoretical considerations of what I am playing, who is the cute
blonde and where is my beer is out of it. 

I suspect that marijuana, for Sagan, enabled him to reach that same,
neo-Zen state that allowed him to formulate his ideas. 

Shaun

-------------------

So - marijuana has inspired the intellectual work of thousands, dare I
say, millions.  Artists and scientists both, I would posit, are guilty
of taking mood altering chemicals which give them astounding insights
beyond the price of Doritos, although that last point is very strong
indeed.  The university of north Texas, my almamater, plays host to one
of the most eccentric chemists I've ever known.  Each night he can be
seen walking from his office, wild white hair and all, down to any
number of bars and clubs on Fry Street, which is adjacent to the
university.  I daresay he has toked up once or twice, and been startled
by the vivid colors of his experiments.

Anyway - potheads of the world must unite...when they get around to
it...one day....dude, pass the Funyuns...I could go for another one of
those frozen burritos....with or without the plastic wrapping this time
dude?

TimW

-------------------

For anyone interested, the recent book _The Botany of Desire_ by Michael
Pollan has a long essay about marijuana which mentions Sagan, among others.
It's an interesting discussion of how THC might affect brain function,
though I thought it was heavy on speculation. In his view, yes, marijuana
may enhance insights.

I found the other 3 chapters in the book (apples, tulips, and potato[e]s)
more interesting than the one on marijuana. I enjoyed  it overall.

Nor is he the only scientist to have explored or enjoyed drug use. At the 
LSD-50 conference in Santa Cruz a few years ago, one of the UCSC math 
prof's who was a founder of chaos theory stated that it was Al Hoffman's 
problem child that provided him with the relevant insights.

I think this claim, though amusing, is wrong. If you listen to music while 
under the cannabis influence, you will likely hear things you had not 
previously noticed. An organ track. A guitar riff. The way the horns 
supplement the violins. Whatever it is that you notice, when you hear that 
music again in a non-augmented state, that stoned realization remains. At 
least, I've had That observation verified repeatedly in conversations with 
friends.

The story of William James' less than profound experiences with nitrous 
oxide are well known, but cannabis and the stronger psychedelics are 
another matter.

At least, he used laudanum, tincture of opium, which apparently lead to a
wonderful regurgitation of his recent reading in "Kublai Khan." (see Prof.  
Lowe's brilliant tracking of the creative process involved in The Road to
Xanadu.)

Rock 'n' roll will never die. And certainly Cobain couldn't have killed 
it if he tried.

> I've had a discussion with a writer friend on whether drugs can enhance

Anectotes, we're told, are not evidence. One writer friend of mine did all
his first drafts stoned, then went back and tidyied them up after. It's a
variant on tht old "spontaneous overflow of powerful emotion recollected
in tranquillity" thing that Wordsworth was on about. It's the mop-up that 
makes the difference.

> I'd rather play the guitar sober because I know I suck drunk or high. A

When high, timing is altered, among other perceptions. As a result, rock
bands don't generally do well when playing stoned.

As for the influence of drugs on those creating visual arts, too many film
examples exist, from Ken Anger to Oliver Stone, for me to single out any
one, but it might be worth mentioning Oscar Janiger, who died last year, a 
psychologist who famously administered LSD to painters and compared thier 
work before and after. 

--------------------

To (sort of!) bring this back to the thematic area of the list, it's 
hard to imagine where more pseudo-science lurks than in the traditional 
assertions of *both* Drug War proponents and avid legalization 
campaigners. Both sides cite "major studies" which indicate either how 
every cannabis smoker is going to work his way up to killer cocaine and 
heroin and become their "slaves" or then how LSD and hashish lead their 
dedicated users to Nirvana and other forms of Spiritual Enlightenment 
and are "totally harmless" (though the "feed your head" type of claims 
have generally receded after the idealistic sixties and seventies 
plunged us into the harsh realities of realpolitik, AIDS and world 
terrorism).

These days, though I have little use for drugs ("mind-expanding" or 
otherwise), it is interesting to note the significant attempts by 
nations like Canada and the UK to increasingly bring marijuana and the 
like under the legal umbrella, especially in the clinical area. The 
Netherlands have long practised highly liberal policies in this area 
without the nightmare scenarios predicted by the anti-drug warriors 
having occurred. Do list members in the States feel that it is 
inevitable that these changes in social attitudes are also going to 
eventually filter down into U.S. drug policies (is this process actually 
already underway?), or that America's (in)famous "War on Drugs" will 
continue to fill American prisons with illicit chemical and herbal 
users?

I'm not sure yet whether an AI will have to invent things to rationalise
it's place in the universe. Also - who wants to 'simulate' a human. Sensible
funcational emulation maybe.

In 1500 years he may be 100% right but 100% not useful. Let's get him to
debate the issue with the first few AI we make.

PS. I ran across this interesting musing 'aside' in yet another Iain M.
Banks SF 'Look to Windward'. (the ocr did pretty well I thought).

story ....yada blah blah yada........page 126
"Most civilisations that had acquired the means to build genuine Artificial
Intelligences duly built them, and most of those designed or shaped the
consciousness of the Als to a greater or lesser extent; obviously if you
were constructing a sentience that was or could easily become much greater
than your own, it would not be in your interest to create a being which
loathed you and might be likely to set about dreaming up ways to exterminate
you.

So Als, especially at first, tended to reflect the civilisational demeanour
of their source species. Even when they underwent their own form of
evolution and began to design their successors -with or without the help,
and sometimes the knowledge, of their creators -there was usually still a
detectable flavour of the intellectual character and the basic morality of
that precursor species present in the resulting consciousness. That flavour
might gradually disappear over subsequent generations of Als, but it would
usually be replaced by another, adopted and adapted from elsewhere, or just
mutate beyond recognition rather than disappear altogether.

What various Involveds including the Culture had also tried to do, often out
of sheer curiosity once AI had become a settled and even routine technology,
was to devise a consciousness with no flavour; one with no metalogical
baggage whatsoever; what had become known as a perfect AI.

It turned out that creating such intelligences was not particularly
challenging once you could build Als in the first place. The difficulties
only arose when such machines became sufficiently empowered to do whatever
they wanted to do. They didn't go berserk and try to kill all about them,
and they didn't relapse into some blissed-out state of machine solipsism.

What they did do at the first available opportunity was Sublime, leaving the
material universe altogether and joining the many beings, communities and
entire civilisations which had gone that way before. It was certainly a rule
and appeared to be a law that 'perfect Als always Sublime'.

Most other civilisations thought this perplexing, or claimed to find it only
natural, or dismissed it as mildly interesting and sufficient to prove that
there was little point in wasting time and resources creating such flawless
but useless sentience. The Culture, more or less alone, seemed to find the
phenomenon almost a personal insult, if you could designate an entire

To be honest Harvey, I've got a mixed position about whether this
would be a bad thing.  The net result of a complete cloning ban
would be to refocus energies on circulating totiopotent stem cells.
That might not be a bad thing.

Since human mitochondrial DNA is, I think, the smallest of all
mammals, presumably the cow mtDNA is a superset of the human mtDNA.
We would have to carefully examine the mtDNA genome sequences to
know for sure.  So I don't see any "real" problems with this.
Certainly working with cow, pig or sheep eggs is less likely
to annoy the animal rights activists than dog, cat or primate
eggs -- particularly when one is still perfecting methods.
This is (perhaps) a much better path from a medical perspective
than human cloning using human eggs due to the side effects produced
by the drugs used in women to cause maturation of multiple human eggs
at the same time.

> This is exactly what scares the public.

They are going to have to get used to it sooner or later.
The parthenogenesis paths being pursued by ACT are similarly "foreign".
I think what might be most useful is transhumanists/extropians
contacting the scientists involved and making some suggestions
as to how they might frame the research [see below] so as to
minimize the public shock factor(!).

I don't think it is a case of wanting to produce "hybrids" -- if
that were the goal, then one would produce embryos from intermixing
embryonic stem cells (chimeras).  [I think I raised a query about the extent
of this type of work a few months back but it didn't draw any comments
{or perhaps I may have missed them }.]

I see this as simply a means to perfect the methods involved and a
way to decrease the expense of egg harvesting.  Presumably cow eggs
are cheaper than human eggs.

It would remain to be seen whether organs derived from cloned cells
with "alien" mitochondrial proteins would be significantly more
immunoreactive than those from other humans.  Simply from a protein
count perspective (thousands vs dozens) one would expect a "cloned"
organ based on "self" genetic sequences with foreign mtDNA to be
less immunoreactive than one based on a different human genome with
human mtDNA.

The transhumanist perspective is going to have to deal with the issue
of humans carrying other than OEM DNA sooner or later.  [In fact
those infected with latent viruses, or those considering the odd
mixtures of bacterial types in the ~40 trillion bacteria we each
support would argue we are already "there".]  So stirring up
the pot a little by creating intercell chimeras with human genomic DNA
and other mammalian mtDNA doesn't seem to be that much of a stretch
to me.

Richard,

I'll offer this to you and perhaps several other list members.
See if you can expand your ExI list contributions to include
a 24 hour integration window.  I've done this to some extent
in the past (responding to multiple posters with 1 message).
Given the distribution of the list across Europe, the Americas
and Asia/Pacific, and the delays that there may be in delivery
one can contribute to list density if one allows time for the
global rotation of comments and subsequent integration by oneself.

[It would be a different and quite interesting extropian thread
to discuss how to train ourselves for responding in the most
extropic fashion -- i.e. learning to differentiate quick
responses that may correct errors in fact, to integrated
responses that merge lines of thought, to deep responses
(papers?) that attempt to extend the knowledge boundaries.]

If we cannot retrain *ourselves* than humanity as a whole is lost.

Yes and no.  I agree that there may be a "window" of paradise.
It will only exist however if the phenomena we currently see
(that in countries where affluence increases, reproductive rate
declines to ~= or < replacement population rates).  For you to
not worry about the "physical limits" you have to make some
non-trivial assertions about the limits of arbitrary copying.

I'm not saying that copying limits might not develop.  I'd just
be more comfortable if we had well defined reasons as to why
they are "likely" to develop.  [The anti-self-competition
rules may be one such reason.]

I'm unaware of Ettinger's hypothesis, I'll add it to the list

It comes down to a question of the spatial/temporal distribution
of events that can significantly disrupt the organization of matter
within a reagion or time in the universe.

The "technology" to accomplish it is relatively easy.  Take every neuron
in your brain, spread them out over the volume of the solar system and
tie them togeather with laser interconnects for the synaptic signals.
You might have to alter the rate of internal signals (to match the
external time delays), but there is nothing really "magical" about
this distribution process.  In fact, I would presume that one could
compute the "real time" distribution distance where ones brain could
function at normal speeds replacing the time for diffusion of
neurotransmitters across synaptic junctions with the speed-of-light
transmission of equivalent information content.  Move the neurons
farther apart than that and you become slower than current "real time".

I don't like to hand-wave so I generally postulate real technologies
based on current laws of physics.  I've proposed a "distribution"
method (above).  One could additionally add gentic modifications
such as less efficient sodium/potassium pumps so that neurons fire
more slowly to match the increased propagation delays for synapses
that are distributed over larger distances.

I will freely admit that it isn't clear how much of our thought,
creativity, experience, etc. may be wrapped up in specific temporal
encoding rates in our current neuronal architecture.  This is something
that requires much more exploration.  How well this can be "distributed"
remains an open question (and one that requires significant investigation).

> "Uploading" as it has been described to me does not meet my criteria.

The problem may be with the lack of specificity in descriptions.
For me "evolved uploading" is the correct path for existing humans.
One develops increased interconnectivity between ones brain and
external wet/dryware (think moving the cell phone inside your ear/
voice box and increase its bandwidth).

Once one has developed links between ones mind and ones external agents,
then distributing them becomes a question of computational efficiency.

> Ah, I may miss the point.  Why would the distributed entities produce the 
> least novel info?

The critical essence in computing is to account for the cost of propagation
delays.  The longer it takes you to transmit a volume of information
the longer it takes to produce novel information based on that earlier
information base.  The densest computing entities have the lowest propagation
delays (and the highest hazard functions) and so produce the greatest amount
of novel information per unit of real time.  Those who opt for increased
survival may have to pay the price of decreased marketability.

Think of it this way.  Do you expand your neurons over the volume of
a 1 cm^3 sugar cube, ~1000 cm^3 (~current human brain dimensions),
the volume of a city, the volume of a planet or the volume of a solar
system?  You have to offset that with costs of such an expansion
(in novel information produced per unit time) with the benefits
(in terms of increased probability of survival of sufficient
quantities of ones computronium to retain ones identity).

> Mike Lorrey seems to believe the opposite - that you

Mike is correct.  That dispersal of the experiencing entities
will increase the quantity and bandwidth of experience accumulation.
In that situation the loss of a single "experiencing" agent probably
isn't very significant.  I'm looking at the survival of the entity
responsible for integrating the experiences.  If the integrator is
concentrated in one place it is vulnerable.  If it is distributed
(under current physical laws) it has contraints on its integration
rate.

If you have two experiences that dictate entirely different behaviors
in a specific situation then conflict resolution is a critical aspect
of "intelligence".  How rapidly that conflict resolution can take place
(and how long it might survive) depends on whether it exists in a
1 cm^3 nanocomputer or neurons (or neuron equivalents) distributed over
the volume of the solar system.

I think a critical question becomes whether one desires "replicas"
or "backups".  That begs the issue of how one perceives the preservation
of knowledge states identical to ones own.

The "replication" issue goes back to Eugene's and Mike's comments.
If one allows replicas or copies that "execute" in "reality", then
one allows the exploration of divergent paths.  Your meta-mind can
then view the paths and select the one most desirable.  One prunes
the other paths.  I think this is what Eugene is calling the Darwinian
perspective and Mike would call "experience integration" and Eliezer
would call moderately or inherently evil (since one has to suspend
or terminate the execution of sentient beings).

There is a reasonable argument to promote the increase of independent
actors if they really explore the phase space.  This is I think Eugene's
point.  If propagation delays for a minimal hazard function entity
prevent it from developing significant improvemtns in the extropic
vectors, then it is reasonable to promote the development of maximal
hazard function entities to explore the phase space  (Think whales
and insects [or bacteria]).

It may be.  But I don't think its that harsh.  One may survive perfectly
well as an "agent" within a hierarchy (just as one largely does today).
The "one" may be a meta-mind, while many or most of us are elements in the play.

Hmm, can't prove there's magical physics right now, so I assume there is
magical physics. Yes, it all makes more sense now.

Wouldn't call it a hypothesis, just good common sense. If there's
people/natural phenomena trying to nuke you, distribute resources, and
communicate using a remixer network.

Mr. Hack is not convinced. That's, of course, a killer argument. A
"metaphysical problem", I guess that's the next logical step if one
assumes magical physics.

Remote incremental backups don't require a bidirectional link. The vacuum
is a rather good FIFO, if your signal rate is high enough, and there's
enough of it. So you can ignore relativistic latency, and just fire out
your journaling trail like tracer bullets, as fast as it is being
generated. As soon as the trail stops, because e.g. you've been nuked, the
static image (or images) gets automatically reactivated, and tagged with a
canned response "You've been reactivated at coordinates/time stamp foo,
last good packet came from coordinates/timestamp bar. Better luck next
time".

This not to say that grand scale distributed systems are impractical.
Hierarchical assemblies would have a wide range of temporal operation
signatures. A local node having to deal with a contingency (something
munching through the hull and mucking up the sailpanel; an accident in the
microsingularity factory;  galactic center flareup) without having to
exchange messages with a remote node.

Correction: Mr. Hack doesn't know of any such technology. He's clearly
omniscient, so he doesn't pause to ask whether others know of any such
technology. It's too bad Mr. Hack won't see this post.

That's too bad. I guess we have to abandon uploading now, because it
doesn't meet Mr. Hack's criteria. Excuse me for a moment. (Goes outside,
there's a muffled shot to be heard. Then, silence).

Ecologies have no problems with distribution.  If your model has one, it's
most likely your model's fault than that distribution is infeasible.

Hey, this replication thing is just a minor feature of life. No one really
likes replicate. That we're here (and great deal of other critters) is not
really consequential. We *hate* replicating, let me tell you. We'll stop
tomorrow. All of us, including the bees, the flowers, and the
rhabodoviruses. Because, frankly, replication sucks.

Because I'm less ready to chuck out science and embrace magical physics
and metaphysics, I tend to postulate a *population* of *diverse*
*replicating* beings *stochastically* sampling behaviour space. This
is pretty much business as usual, only more so. If someobody postulates a
departure for this, he must show a mechanism how this will change, and how
it will stay that way.

SysOp scenarios are so far the only proposed mechanism. I don't believe in
SysOp scenarios, but even if I did: the population mechanism would still
apply. You'd have to prove that the entire accessible cosmos (something
like 100 GLyrs across, or whatever runaway expansion would seem to give
us) will get sysoped, every single time.

Obviously, Mr. Hack has a very skewed model of darwinian evolution. I am
not surprised.

I don't know what was in Lucas' subconscious mind when he wrote
_Star Wars_, but consciously Lucas was strongly influenced by mythic
symbols. (Also, Joseph Campbell was George Lucas' good friend)

Amara


==============================================================
(from _The Power of Myth_ by Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyers, 1988)

Campbell: The fact that the evil power is not identified with any
specific nation on this earth means that you've got an abstract
power, which represents a principle, not a specific historical
situation. The story has to do with an operation of principles, not
of this nation against that. The monster masks that are put on
people in Star Wars represent the real monster force in the modern
world. When the mask of Darth Vader is removed, you see an unformed
man, one who has not developed as a human individual. What you see
is a strange and pitiful sort of undifferentiated face.

Moyers: What's the significance of that?

Campbell: Darth Vader has not developed his own humanity. He's a
robot. He's a bureaucrat, living not in terms of himself, but in
terms of an imposed system. This is the threat to our lives that we
all face today. Is the system going to flatten you out and deny you
your humanity, or are you going to be able to make use of the system
ot the attainment of human purposes? How do you relate to the
system so that you are not compulsively serving it? It doesn't help
to try to change it to accord with your system of thought. The
momentum of history behind it is too great for anything really
significant to evolve from that kind of actions. The thing
to do is to live as a human being. That's something else
and it can be done.

Moyers: By doing what?

Campbell: By holding to your own ideals for yourself and, like Luke
Skywalker, rejecting the system's impersonal claims upon you.

Well you see, the movie communicates. It is in a language that talks
to young people, that's what counts. It asks, Are you going to be a
person of heart and humanity  -- because that's where the life is,
from the heart -- or are you going to do whatever seems to be
required of you by what might be called "intentional power"? When
Ben Kenobi says, "May the Force be with you," he's speaking of the
power and energy of life, not of programmed political intentions.

Moyers: I was intrigued by the definition of the Force. Ben Kenobi
says, "The Force is an energy field created by all living things.
It surrounds us, it penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together."
And I've read in _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ similar
descriptions of the world navel.

Campbell: Yes, of course, the Force moves from within. But the force
of the Empire is based on an intention to overcome and master. Star
Wars is not a simple morality play, it has to do with the powers
of life as they are either fulfilled or broken and suppressed through
the action of man.

Moyers: The first time I saw Star Wars I thought, "This is a very old
story in a very new costume." The story of the young man called to
adventure, the hero going out facing the trials and ordeals, and
coming back after his victory with a boon for the community --

Campbell: Certainly Lucas was using standard mythological figures.
The old man as the advisor made me think of a Japanese sword master.
I've known some of those people, and Ben Kenobi has a bit of their
character.

Moyers: My favorite scene was when they were in the garbage
compactor and the walls were closing in,and I thought, "That's like
the belly of the whale that swaallowed Jonah."

Campbell: That's where they were, down in the belly of the whale.

Moyers: What's the mythological signifance of the belly?

Campbell: The belly is the dark place where digestion takes place
and new energy is created. The story of Jonah in the whale is an
example of a mythic theme that is practically universal, of the hero
going into a fish's belly and ultimately coming out again,
transformed.

Moyers: Why must the hero do that?

Campbell: It's the descent into the dark. Psychologically, the whale
represents the power of life locked in the unconscious.
Metaphorically, water is the unconscious, which has overwhelmed the
conscious personality and must be disempowered, overcome and
controlled.

In the first stage of this kind of adventure, the hero leaves the
realm of the familiar, over which he has some measure of control,
and comes to a threshold, let us say the edge of a lake or sea,
where a monster of the abyss comes to meet him. There then two
possibilities. In a story of the Jonah type, the hero is swallowed
and taken into the abyss to be later resurrected -- a variant of the
death-and-resurrections theme. The conscious personality here has
come in touch with a charge of unconscious energy which it is unable
to handle and must now suffer all the trials and revelations of a
terrifying night-sea journey, while learning how to come to terms
with this power of the dark and emerge, at last, to a new way of
life.

The other possibility is that the hero, on encountering the power of
the dark, may overcome and kill it, as did Siegfried and St. George
when they killed the dragon. But as Siegfried learned, he must then
taste the dragon blood, in order to take to himself something of
that dragon power.  When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted
the blood, he hears the song of nature. He has transcended his
humanity and reassociated himself with the powers of nature, which
are the powers of our life, and from which our minds remove us.

You see, consciousness thinks it's running the shop. But it's a
secondary organ of a total human being, and it must not put itself
in control. It must submit and serve the humanity of the body. When
it does put itself in control, you get a man like Darth Vader in
Star Wars, the man who goes over to the consciously intentional
side.

Moyers: The dark figure.

Campbell: Yes, that's the figure that, in Goethe's Faust, is
represented by Mephistopheles.

Moyers: But I can hear someone saying, "Well, that's all well and
good for the imagination of a George Lucas or for the scholarship of
a Joseph Campbell, but that isn't what happens in my life."

Campbell: You bet it is -- and if he doesn't recognize it, it may
turn him into Darth Vader. If the person insists on a certain
program, and doesn't listen to the demands of his own heart, he's
going to risk a crackup. Such a person has put himself off center.
He has aligned himself with a program for life, and it's not the
one the body's interested in at all. The world is full of people who
have stopped listening to themselves or have listened only to their
neighbors to learn what they ought to do, how thdy ought to behave,
and what the values are that they should be living for.
[...]

I would say, a more *inward* cause. "Higher" is just up there, and
there is no "up there." We know that. That old man up there has been
blown away. You've got to find Force inside you. This is why
Oriental gurus are so convincing to young people today. They say,
"It is in you. Go and find it."

[...]
Myths inspire the realization of the possibility of your perfection,
the fullness of your strength, and the bringing of solar light into
the world. Slaying monsters is slaying the dark things. Myths grab
you somewhere down inside. As a boy, you go at it one way, as I did
reading my Indian stories. Later on, myths tell you more, and more,
and still more. I think that anyone who has ever dealt seriously
with religious or mythic ideas will tell you that we learn them as a
child on one level, but then many different levels are revealed.
Myths are infinite in their revelation.

Moyers: How do I slay that dragon in me? What's the journey each of
us has to make, what you call "the soul's high adventure"?

Campbell: My general formula for my students is "Follow your bliss."
Find where it is, and don't be afraid to follow it.

Mr. Hack: The quality of your posts is not the question.

The rule is 8 posts a day, maximum. Consensus is not at issue, nor, per se,
are your tendencies, some of which I shared until reminded of the 8 posts per
day limit by the listcop(s). I'm not sure it is graven in stone whether that
is "dated the same day at the sender's location" or "in any 24-hour period".

Bearing that in mind, the numbers as I count them are:
2/18: 1
2/20: 3
2/21: 0
2/22: 2
2/23: 1
2/24: 8
2/25: 2
2/26: 2
2/27: 2
2/28: 4
3/1:  5

Complex problems sometimes have simple solutions, but it is very rare.
As a conjecture I would say that the solution to a problem usually
requires roughly the same algorithmic complexity as the causes of the
problem. This is why it is so easy to solve an engineering problem - the
laws of physics are fairly simple, and the specifications usually not
too complex. Social problems on the other hand are extremely complex,
involving many autonomous agents controlled by complex minds that create
complex interaction structures all the time. This does not mean social
problems are unsolvable, but that usually partial solutions or solutions
that we know are worse that the imagined global optimum will have to do.
The best solutions are those that harness the inherent complexity of the
system itself to regulate it. Instead of imposing a simplistic order
from the outside, they allow a complex order to grow from inside. 

A supergenius able to solve the "problem" of the state of the world
would need a mind with a power equivalent to a sizeable fraction of the
world. Its solutions may very well be utterly innovative and ingenious
and far more elegant than invading someplace (although there is no a
priori reason why violence might not be a relevant part of the
solution). The problem is that this assumes there is *one* such a being;
even if the smartest entity is twice as smart as the next smartest, if
there are enough complex entities running around the situation will
still overwhelm the hypothetical supermind. Even when one imagines a
vastly more powerful entity, the sheer mass of complexity in the world
places some huge demands on it. 

This is why I don't believe in central planning of societies, why
self-organizing bottom-up institutions usually outperform the centralist
top-down institutions in the long run and why it is better to let people
decide for themselves what to do. It is also why I am suspicious of
assumptions that technology will "fix" things on its own - it assumes
that the introduction of a certain technology will lead to a fairly
predictable cultural shift, which leaves out the real complexity of the
sociocultural side of the equation.

:-) I think you hit the nail on the head. 

So, what changes of transhumanism would be needed to correct this, and
would they be good changes from a transhumanist point of view too (and
not just PR)? Let's see: instead of just explaining away
broken-heartedness it would actually put it into a larger context: one
that includes evolution and biology, but also psychology and a general
understanding of the human condition in general and the needs of
individuals in particular. Instead of saying that you get pie in the sky
when you are uploaded we should look at how we get there - and that
requires more than tracing Moore's law on a graph paper! It requires us
to discuss how culture, society, economy and technology actually work
together; a tall order for any person, but we can at least achieve some
of this by networking with brilliant thinkers in these fields and act as
a third culture willing to mediate between the disciplines - our vision
is a great motivator for this.

Such a transhumanism would be far more popular; maybe not mainstream,
but definitely influencing the mainstream by being a source of good or
at least interesting ideas that can fit within the current context. 

Would it be good for *us*? Beside the obvious utility of having close
ties with the mainstream and its resources, it would also be a
transhumanism that would be constantly in interaction with other fields,
other views. This would make the tendency to insulate onself behind cool
terminology and closed discussions untenable; I expect that quite a few
people who right now consider themselves transhumanists would not enjoy
that - they would have to explain their views to critical outsiders. But
the rewards would be far greater: an inflow of new ideas and far better
memetic selection. In the long run it would be very good for us too,
both personally and ideologically.

<<I don't know what was in Lucas' subconscious mind when he wrote
_Star Wars_, but consciously Lucas was strongly influenced by mythic
symbols. (Also, Joseph Campbell was George Lucas' good friend)

Amara>>

Also a mess-load of comic books each of which included a mythic theme, etc.

Now I choose to ask whether the mythic themes will endure, if some of our 
transhuman goals arrive? In a book by astronomer, Michael Hart; The Most 
Influencial People of History (looking back from the year 3000) human 
viewpoints have changed.

One of Hart's imaginary subjects (#1) is the Chinese scientist, Chen, who in 
the 22nd century devises a method of systematically replacing brain sections 
during surgery, while dumping data from the dis-used section of the brain 
into a computer, and the re-integrating the data into new sections. Note: 
that the brain was the last organ to be tissue engineered by then.

The result is what Hart called pseudo-immortality. Everyone Chen'd, and 
people lived "until the stars burned out." People could choose to expire when 
they wished to, but most, of course did not. People had to do frequent 
personality and memory backups. 

One characters marrige lasted for over 600 years, until he and his wife chose 
not to Chen. Most people could list 2 or 3 marriges at least.  Everyone 
looked young, and intersteller travel, though extremely rare, was less of an 
issue because for one, you lived a incredibly long time in peak health, and 
secondly, there was hibernation which slowed down aging aboard ship. So if 
your spaceship took 200 years to get there, it wasn't such an issue.

More to Amara's point, many works of literature, such as that of Shakesphere 
(identified finally to be William D'evere) went out of fashion. The reason 
being that it was unappealing to kvetch about how miserable and short life 
was, when it no longer was.  

Humor was more to the popular culture of 900 years from now, as well as 
political thrillers, and science fiction.  I wonder what we would do if we 
were able to live hundreds and hundreds of years in fine health? One thing 
would be to solve the unanswered problem of what to do when the brain cells 
run out? An easy answer would surely be to inplant a memory 'cube' in the 
mastoid sinus, adding perhaps cenuries more of experience.

Another thing, baring the discovery of native life would be to colonize the 
solar system, including hell holes like Venus. To make Venus habitable for 
human tissue'd
life (what the author depicted we would still be), might be rather rewarding 
for several hundreds of millions of years.

A few things off the top of my head (this is what a transhumanist think
tank is supposed to be paid to be doing).

* no evolutionary algorithm AI experiments unless air gapped and following
  a containment SOP. Do not reconnect or reuse the components outside
  of containment until wiped clean (again following through a SOP, at
  very least power down and do a full state wipe). Continuously revise
  SOPs.

* harden the network by using provably secure protocols and introduce
  adaptive diversity into "code" via ALife route. Encourage h4x0rs to do
  their worst. Pay $$$ bounty to those who can break the most. Try to
  create a fully polymorphic worm with a probabilistic exploit seeker,
  and let it loose (after you've let it run in the lab, and patched up
  most of the holes). Launch big R&D program to learn to mutate machine
  code and FPGA gates. Sandbox anything above the protocol layer (try to
  make a protocol simple enough to be cast into hardware, geodetic
  routing could do this). Put watchdogged intrusion alert on top of this,
  forcing the machine back into default sane state (also for enduser
  boxes).

* introduce adaptive realtime traffic analysis and response into global
  networks (ability to sense and to response to global traffic patterns).

If there's a hard limit of 8 per day, it should be enforced by the
list software. Our time is too valuable to be spent counting
everyone's messages and bitching at them. I think the rules should be
more like guidelines, and another guideline should be that only list
admin(s) point out violations, and only in private.

Don't try to recall. Use Google. (This is a general rule of life.)

GOOGLE: carl sagan marijuana
   http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=carl+sagan+marijuana

1,140 hits ;-)

First hit:
   http://fusionanomaly.net/carlsagan.html

No obvious prior direct reference to marijuana in a book by Sagan,
but quite a bit by others. The recent stuff appears to be mostly
in conjunction with "Carl Sagan: A life"

Actually, I am cyncical enough to think that this was a calculated press
release.  It IS exactly the kind of thing that people in the US scared of.
By making this press release now, I think they are trying to push the US off
of the fence it is straddling and get them to outlaw cloning.

It would be quite profitable for a Korean company if all US competition were
outlawed.

I think that your proposals might help against some catastrophe scenarios,

but the two most basic and important fixes will not happen soon, and as 
you say, the window is already open. As long as the net provides free 
connectivity among millions of computers that run vulnerable operating
systems, the resources needed for an AI are available. Your defenses
addressed both of these issues, but the OS base will take a long time
to fix: Microsoft will not change its practices unless it is forced,
and applying that force will take several years before they can be
made to start. Your idea of making global enhancements to the internet
will take as long, and the really effective enhancements ("white hat"
worms and AI pattern evaluators) are both really dangerous in 
themselves. Corrupt a "white hat" worm to get a "black hat" worm that
the system accepts as a good guy. An AI pattern evaluator would already
be so sophisticated that it is nearly intelligent: push it over the
edge. Your other proposals are to monitor the people and to monitor
the needed resources (clusters.) The CS community is far too large
for effective monitoring. Once a monitoring beaurocracy is that
bit it is corruptible can be evaded. Even if clusters are needed,
(probably not) There already a great many clusters, and any CS
lab office building, or computer store can be turned into a
cluster.

the famous conversation between a human
and an alien, in Carl Sagan's 1985 (*) novel
'Contact'

'Your mathematicians have made an effort to
calculate it out to ... let's say the
ten-billionth place. You won't be surprised
to hear that other mathematicians have gone
further. Well, eventually - let's say it's in
the ten-to-the-twentieth place - something
happens. The randomly varying digits disappear,
and for an unbelievably long time there's
nothing but ones and zeros ...'

'And the numbers of zeros and ones? Is it a
product of prime numbers?'

'Yes, eleven of them.'

'You're telling me that there's a message
in eleven dimensions hidden deep inside
the number pi? Someone in the universe
communicates by ... mathematics? ...
How can you hide a message inside pi?
It's built into the fabric of the universe.'

'Exactly'

She stared at him.

'It's even better than that,' he continued.
'Let's assume that only in base-ten arithmetic
does the sequence of zeros and ones show up,
although you'd recognize that something funny's
going on in any other arithmetic. Let's also
assume that the beings who first made this
discovery had ten fingers. You see how it looks?
It's as if pi has been waiting for billions
of years for ten-fingered mathematicians with
fast computers to come along. You see the Message
was kind of addressed to us.'

---------
(*) If pi is indeed normal, looking for a message
in its digits would be like searching for meaning
in Jorge Luis Borges' imaginary library of Babylon,
in which the books contain every possible combination
 of letters and punctuation.

While there may be no cosmic message lurking in pi's
digits, if they are random they could be used to
encrypt other messages as follows:

Convert a message into zeros and ones, choose a string
of digits somewhere in the decimal expansion of pi,
and encode the message by adding the digits of pi
to the digits of the message string, one after another.
Only a person who knows the chosen starting point
in pi's expansion will be able to decode the message.

I finished Damien's new novel last week and I have to make a brief
reappearance here to heartily endorse it.  Unlike the vast majority of
science fiction, Damien's work stands on its own as literature.  As a
playful and multi-levelled exploration of themes central to the
extropian world-view and many of the discussions we've had here, the
book is an enjoyable and engrossing read.

Easy, and I would give the Transhuman the same advice as I'd give to any
novice computer user, if you're going to have a backup make sure it's current.

Telepresence does count, that's where your consciousness is concentrated,
assuming it even makes sense to talk about the position of consciousness,
it's a little like talking about the position of red, or the position of this post for that
matter. At any rate the position of the brain is irrelevant assuming it's not so far
away that time delay due to the speed of light becomes important. I certainly
don't feel like I'm in a small dome made of bone.

On a different subject, the 8 post limit is easy enough to get around, just respond

My favorite bit from this article: "Grandpa is such a hero for the

"Temporarily Dead" sounds like a good name for an extropic rock group...

Mitch, thanks for pointing this out.  I met Dr. Hart once at a conference
for the Foundation for the Future.  I had a hard time figuring out why
he had been invited.  It now makes sense.  The book jacket combined with some
of my own research indicates he is quite a polymath.  Its very good to know
more about his background.

The only thing I fear is that it is going to require a really robust
understanding of nanotechnology to fully paint a picture of the future.
There aren't many scientists who have that yet.

It is difficult for the list software to do this fairly, specifically
because we don't all live in the same time zones and we don't all do our
email at the exact same time each day. If I send 6 messages between 5-6
pm one day, and 6 more from 9-10 am the next (in MY time zone, not the
list server's), a hardset 8 post per day limit will calculate that I've
sent 12 messages in a 24 hour period, and boot me off the list. While I
understand that there are some here who would celebrate that, this
illustrates how hard it is to get software to enforce human laws.

For the record, I don't much like the 8 posts a day rule, either. Nonetheless,
it is there.

Actually, I agree with this.  As list admin, I do make a point of keeping 
an eye out for those who are outside the guidelines.  Usually it is 
unintentional, and the "offender" (if he/she can be called that) won't do 
it again.

As I have mentioned numerous times before, if anyone here notices that the 
list guidelines have been breached --be it for ad hominem, list overposting 
etc.-- please let me know.  While I generally feel I do a good job of 
maintaining list guidelines, there are times when my own personal time is a 
bit pinched...in this case, I have been spending most of my spare time on 
Exponent, which will come out later today.

Finally, in regards to publicly lambasting a person for breaching list 
guidelines, I really don't think that is necessary.  Let me know about the 
breach and I will send the "offending" person a private email.

     As is well-known, merely "freezing" a body doesn't prevent it from
decaying.

     That was pointed out on this list just a couple of weeks back,
in discussing what a disaster the ORIGINAL attempt at embalming
Vladimir Lenin turned out to be. That first effort merely involved
keeping the deceased dictator's body deeply refrigerated.

     And even immersing a corpse into a solid block of ice doesn't
help all that much. When our own Ivan Sanderson investigated the
so-called "Minnesota Iceman" during the late 1960s, he noticed
bubbles of decay slowly working their away upwards through the ice.
(For the sake of our discussion here, it doesn't matter if the
"Iceman" was indeed genuine or simply a carnival sideshow exhibit
hoked up from stitched-together animal matter.)

     So at what temperature DOES decay stop?

     Sincerely,

     George Wagner (suddenly not feeling all that hot himself)

 For those of us who are having trouble picking out the
 details in the Pentagon security camera images, here
 are some helpful links:

 An annotated photo with arrows and such:
 < http://www.planetkyoto.com/nils/photos/pentagon.html >

 An overhead view showing the position of the camera and
 its field of view:
 < http://www.kokogiak.com/pentagon2.html >

 Another annotated image with arrows and such:
 < http://www.aldark.com/images/stebain/pGonPlane.jpg >

 These images show that other people see what Dave
 Palmer has described:

 As to Bill Shannon's question about the imagery:

> Uh huh...certainly the Pentagon would have "state-of-the-art"
> type video no? 
> Or would they perhaps be no better than the corner Clark station? 

 Here he's definitely stepping out of his depth.  As Dave
 Palmer pointed out, there's no real need to put high-quality
 surveillence cameras everywhere in the Pentagon. 

 What was released is on par with what a lot of economarts
 have.  It's not as simple as replicating the corner store. 
 The Pentagon is huge.  According to the Pentagon web site,
 the building alone has 6,636,360 square feet of floor area. 
 That's the same as almost 4000 typical corner stores.  For
 a comparison, there are only about 5700 7-11 stores in the
 whole of North America.

 And that's not even including the interior courtyard or
 the exterior lawn (where the plane was).  Total land area
 is 583 acres.  Covering that all with high quality video
 cameras probably couldn't be justified in any budget. 

 It seems likely that these were stills taken from a
 security system that stores the images with lossy
 compression.  The company I work for uses such a system. 
 There are video cameras covering much of the building's
 exterior, but at about 1/4 VGA resolution, and with jpeg
 compression.  Watching the cameras' live feeds shows images
 of about the same quality as the Pentagon photos that were
 released.  The stills are recorded on a hard drive array,
 and only output to videotape if necessary (though, of course,
 they still have pretty low resolution).

I apologize for exceeding list limits by two or three for three recent days 
out of 16 that I have posted.

I'll stop posting for a while to let everyone catch their breath, including 
mine.

The discussions here are occasionally interesting, but as I said, they earn 
me no money.

The time I spend going through 25 to 50 or more posts a day to find the 
useful ones causes me more problems than the number of posts by any given 
individual.  Most mail and new readers have filters and preview panes - I 
would imagine the number of posts by an individual can be easily handled by 
filtering on the subject header (which does take some effort, of course, 
but usually less than reading a bunch of messages).  Obviously, the number 
of posts rule is intended to limit the total number of posts one receives 
in a day, but I would say that is not the most effective way to handle 
it.  Usenet has no such rule that I know of (as recent floods in several 
newsgroups attest), which is why news readers have filters (except my Free 
Agent, of course - and it has third party filters).  Many mail and news 
readers also have multiple mailboxes or folders and ways to filter messages 
into them based on various headers.  If one does not wish to read too many 
posts, one could sort them by day, say them by day, and scan them when one 
has time.

Information management is a bitch.

He'll catch us with the fine print. Literary: Yes, Artistic Yes. Religious?
I'm not sure yet whether an AI will have to invent things to rationalise
it's place in the universe. Also - who wants to 'simulate' a human. Sensible
funcational emulation maybe.

In 1500 years he may be 100% right but 100% not useful. Let's get him to
debate the issue with the first few AI we make.

PS. I ran across this interesting musing 'aside' in yet another Iain M.
Banks SF 'Look to Windward'. (the ocr did pretty well I thought).

story ....yada blah blah yada........page 126
"Most civilisations that had acquired the means to build genuine Artificial
Intelligences duly built them, and most of those designed or shaped the
consciousness of the Als to a greater or lesser extent; obviously if you
were constructing a sentience that was or could easily become much greater
than your own, it would not be in your interest to create a being which
loathed you and might be likely to set about dreaming up ways to exterminate
you.

So Als, especially at first, tended to reflect the civilisational demeanour
of their source species. Even when they underwent their own form of
evolution and began to design their successors -with or without the help,
and sometimes the knowledge, of their creators -there was usually still a
detectable flavour of the intellectual character and the basic morality of
that precursor species present in the resulting consciousness. That flavour
might gradually disappear over subsequent generations of Als, but it would
usually be replaced by another, adopted and adapted from elsewhere, or just
mutate beyond recognition rather than disappear altogether.

What various Involveds including the Culture had also tried to do, often out
of sheer curiosity once AI had become a settled and even routine technology,
was to devise a consciousness with no flavour; one with no metalogical
baggage whatsoever; what had become known as a perfect AI.

It turned out that creating such intelligences was not particularly
challenging once you could build Als in the first place. The difficulties
only arose when such machines became sufficiently empowered to do whatever
they wanted to do. They didn't go berserk and try to kill all about them,
and they didn't relapse into some blissed-out state of machine solipsism.

What they did do at the first available opportunity was Sublime, leaving the
material universe altogether and joining the many beings, communities and
entire civilisations which had gone that way before. It was certainly a rule
and appeared to be a law that 'perfect Als always Sublime'.

Most other civilisations thought this perplexing, or claimed to find it only
natural, or dismissed it as mildly interesting and sufficient to prove that
there was little point in wasting time and resources creating such flawless
but useless sentience. The Culture, more or less alone, seemed to find the
phenomenon almost a personal insult, if you could designate an entire
civilisation as a person.

blah blah..............marklar marklar on with the story......

That's true, +32 degrees Fahrenheit where water freezes is not nearly good
enough, but liquid nitrogen a substance at -321 degrees Fahrenheit and
cheaper than milk will prevent decay just fine, provided the time is less than
10 billion years or so.

The metric used in biochemistry is that 10 deg. of temperature change
changes the rate of chemical reactions by a factor of 2.  But I think
that is only at room temperature.  I think this involves the Arrhenius
Rate Law (http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/plambeck/che/p102/p02151.htm for
example).

Some urls that discuss the topic:
http://www.transtime.com/cryintro/cryintro.htm

Here is an entire course on cryobiology:
http://www.ucalgary.ca/~kmuldrew/cryo_course/course_outline.html
See especially Section 15.1 (Time Travel).

Terry, you will have to forward this back to George or the other list.

I have to agree with John on this.  Although the PR on this story was terrible,
leading to wild speculation about cross species reproduction, the potential for good
expressed above should be seriously considered.  Look at it this way:  We are actively
putting human genes into pigs, today, so as to try to get hearts, etc. for
transplant.  Some say "Yuck!" to that, some don't.  So there is a continuum here
starting with no human genes substituted, going through to full nuclear substitution.
I do not see a point on the scale where one can argue logically, "Yuck happens here."

Cytoplasmic inheritance is complex and important.  But "molecules is molecules."  The
idea that something is wrong with a molecule because it came from cow cytoplasm
reminds me of when my kids refused to eat the corn on their dinner plates because it
had "touched" the Jell-O.  They had a simple one word justification: "Yuck!"

SAUMUR, France (Reuters) - A French local authority asked a court on Friday 
to order a man to bury his parents' corpses, which lie frozen in a crypt at 
his family's chateau.Remy Martinot's father, Raymond, froze his wife's body 
when she died in 1984 aged 49, believing scientific developments would one 
day allow her to be brought back to life. He asked that the same be done with 
his corpse when he died."I respected my father's last wishes," Martinot told 
the court. "At his death, at the end of February, he wished to be frozen 
close to her (his wife), and that's what I did. A man's last wish is a sacred 
thing."Raymond Martinot, who died in February, was a doctor and biologist who 
believed scientific developments would one day allow a body, preserved at a 
constant temperature of -60 degrees Celsius, to be brought back to life.He 
wrote instructions on the wall of the crypt detailing the procedure for 
resurrecting his wife, Monique, and also expressing his wish to be frozen 
after his own death.The crypt at the chateau in the village of 
Nueil-sur-Layon, near Saumur in western France, became something of a tourist 
attraction, with a travel agency obtaining exclusive rights for visits to the 
crypt for four euros ($3.50) per person.But after he froze his father's body 
next to his mother's, the prefecture of the Maine-et-Loire region around 
Saumur asked Martinot to bury their bodies, saying French law allows only the 
burial or cremation of corpses.Martinot has so far refused to bury the 
bodies.The court's magistrates heard evidence from both sides, before 
withdrawing to consider the case. They will give their ruling on March 13.

Of course the decay of the carbon 14 in the DNA would be
nearly unaffected by the temperature, so there may still be
some decay over a relatively short time frame.

Should cryonics become popular, I plan to start a business
where I grow vegetables in a special hermetic greenhouse
that has as its only source of carbon dioxide the combustion
products of coal.  By devouring only such vagetables over
a period of time, a prole might cleanse her body of all
potentially damaging 6kyr halflife elements.  I might also
collect deuterium free water from a separation plant, and
use this to water the vegetables.  Then I sell these specially
grown veggies to the proletariat at enormous profits.

Furthermore, I would get a warm feeling inside, knowing
that I am doing a good deed as a technogaian, helping
serve the earth goddess by burning coal, thus retrieving
carbon that is otherwise lost to the carbon cycle and placing
it back into circulation, for technogaia's living creatures
to thrive upon.

We could even come up with cutesy product names
for vegetables made up entirely of stable isotopes,
such as spike's vege-stables.   spike

What about the thorium and uranium from the coal?

You know, I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I have actually
dreamed about these two - these romantic frozen lovers. I guess it has
become a kind of Transhumanist existential crisis for me. I keep thinking
there must be something we can do - after all, are we not Transhumanists? If
we can't be bothered lift a finger here, how can we live with ourselves for
the next several millennia knowing we simply allowed two of our own - two
who might have laughed and shared the joys and mysteries of the universe
along with us, simply rot like dead forgotten carrion - the victims of
stupid bureaucrats with their puny imaginations. I have extremely limited
financial resources, but I have a Transhumanist's heart and I can't help
thinking that Transhumanism implies a greater than human degree of sympathy
and resourcefulness. After all, it ain't rocket science folks.

Oops.  So right you are.  {8-]

As long as we are discussing technical errors in sci-fi,
I was just obsessing over the Arroway character in Contact.

Again.

I noticed a couple of minute but totally mentally destructive
nits in the story.  The first is where Arroway and Joss are
star gazing and Arroway turns pi radians and says "Venus
will be over there soon."

What did she mean?  If Venus had been pre-conjunction it
should be already visible.  If post-conjunction, it would rise
shortly before dawn the next day.  Clearly it was early evening,
for Joss uttered the magic scientist-seducing line "It would
surely be a waste of space," then they had time for a (presumably
leisurely and enormously fulfilling) copulation session, then he
said "tomorrow, let us.." yakkity yak and bla bla, then Arroway
brushed him off and went to work with plenty of darkness left.

But the second gaff was far more serious.  After Arroway
heard the heartbeat-like signal and raced for the headquarters,
the signal stopped, then restarted.  The second time the signal
came, they counted the pulses and realized they were the prime
numbers.  The pulses were coming about one every 0.9 seconds
(I timed them).  They pulsed out all the primes thru 101.  In that
time the scientists had a short conversation.

The problem is that the sum of the primes thru 101 is 1161, along
with 25 pauses between primes at that speed would take about
22 minnutes to complete.  Had not Arroway been such a
compelling character, or if I were any more Aspergerish than
I am, this alone would have ruined the entire movie for me.  spike

I recall my school textbooks claiming heavy water was toxic. Going out
googling produces some fun contradictory back-and-forth references for that.
Anyone want to provide a clear oracle for the toxicity or otherwise of D2O?

And just why do you feel confident in such blanket assertions? 
We are, after all, biological machines.  Do you think in 1500 
years that the "machines" will only fill in the lines you are 
drawing in some relatively speaking prehistoric cave?  Not very 
imaginative for a human.

I will certaily second that.  Transcension was one of the most

Many of us who grew up in the sixties or close enough for some 
wash-over know that some drugs sometimes can seem to boost 
creativity.  The trouble is the effect is not that predictable 
and the side-effects aren't worth it to many of us. But saying 
it doesn't work at all is bogus.

Also this is very old and largely irrelevant news.

AFAIK, work done in the early to mid 1960s suggested that toxic effects in
animals showed up when approximately 1/5 of the H in the organism had been
replaced with D. Drinking _deionized_ plain H20 would probably hurt you
faster.

Spike, apparently you consider "incorporation into...DNA" the only path for
damage production. Ionizing radiation does damage, regardless of whether or
not its source is "incorporated". The crap released from burning coal has to
wind up somewhere.

Look again, Spike.  Right after the line ".. soon, Vega's gonna set"
there is a cut.  During the cut, it is implied that Ellie spent some
time contacting Ian Broderick in Australia, and getting him the
information needed to have his team track in on the signal.  After the
cut Ian tells Ellie that they have the signal, and they have tracked it
back to Vega, then they get to the end of the 101 group.  Seems to me
the time period could be fine.

You know, I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I have actually
dreamed about these two - these romantic frozen lovers. I guess it has
become a kind of Transhumanist existential crisis for me. I keep thinking

RE: Cryonaughts to Cryonoughts
Won't there come a time when the termination of the 'potentially
resurrected' becomes a crime? Isn't this the other end of the 'embryo
rights' issue? At some point in time the liklihood of
resurrection/re-birth/whatever it's called makes it awkward to turn off the
power (for me it's *now*). If the authorities can't prove it impossible, but
someone can make a case that it is possible within a reasonable time frame -
isn't there a case for murder? A case for damages  (stress etc) to those who
have to watch them die again? Surely the argument would have more strength
now than ever before. Sounds like a new field.....surely there's a lawyer on
this list somewhere.....there you go...a whole new field of law to play

But often the "cause" is relatively simple once it is found 
compared to the complexity of the effects.  And often the cause 
is much simpler to address.  I don't believe that an engineering 
solution will fix some of the most pressing problems.  But I 
also don't believe it necessarily or even generally takes equal 
complexity to solve them.

Unless you significantly change the nature of the agents and the

All other things being equal, this is true.  But how long do we 
expect enough other things to be equal?  If enough of the 
fundamental context changes then a complex order may develop 
alright but the result is not the original system regulating 
itself necessarily.  The original system has been transformed.

Unless the relatively smart manage to create a hugely more smart 
and wise mind than their own and that mind can find and 
understand the active elements and the effects of shifting and 
modifying those elements.  Even this will not be enough for all 
of us to grow beyond our current limitations or for our 
institutions to transform.

It depends on how you grok the complexity and what is being

I agree in that I don't believe the technology, not even an SI, 
will solve the problem of the transformation of humanity and 
especially of its evolutionary baggage in the way of its own 
contuing progress.  I think the full problem will take some time 
(natural "real-world" or subjective) to "solve".

If you drank nothing but heavy water until a substantial percentage
of the regular water in your body was replaced by it then it might
change the osmotic pressure in cells and cause problems, but
you'd have to drink one hell of a lot of the expensive stuff.
It must be the least toxic poison in the world.

How will you limit this "adaptive diversity" for adapting into 
something smarter than you feel safe having around?  What keeps 
this worm from effectively growing in intelligence?  Won't the 
R&D program likely strengthen the possibility of self-enhancing 
AI that you seem so afraid of?  Total security is a myth. 
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, just that we should never expect 
to totally suceed indefintely.

What does this readiness look like?  Won't we likely be dead due

change before we are "ready"?

NO.  Freedom is more important than tracking any and everyone 
and everything that might be a little scary.  If these possibly 
scary people have to get permission for everything the thing of 
or want to try outside of what is already accepted then you can 
kiss much progress at all goodbye.

You have a strong assumption that uploading is the only way to a 
sane future.  I have my doubts that minds optimized to and by 
and built for 3-d meat spaces will make very healthy upload 
citizens.  I have even more doubts that getting uploading to 
work reasonably will develop enough efficient intelligence fast 
enough to deal with the increasing demand - particular if AI is 
largely put on hold.

In the short term I would put a lot more energy into human 
augmentation, human-computer interface and symbiosis and 
developing medical NT than I would into uploads.  I believe that 
is a much faster way to maximizing ourselves, our survivability 
and our intelligence with relatively low impact on security.

I would also put energy into shifting the socio-economic 
assumptions of the world so that the advantage of one and 
especially the increasing ability of one is not seen as a threat 
instead of a boon to others. Without that augmentation will be 
fought tooth and nail, much less uploads.

You can't. You can imagine yourself escaping to space, a secret base in
Antarctica or artificial island in the Pacific, but these options are
not particularly realistic (see my previous criticisms on this list on
the "exit strategy"). Instead you have to live and work in a world where
many people disagree with you. The way to survive those five and half
million people is to convince the remaining five *billion* people that
your views, if not theirs, at least require tolerance and protection
(because if they do not give that, then what is there to protect their
own not universally accepted views from everybody else?). If five
billion people think you are wrong and awful, then you better find ways
of convincing them otherwise. Hoping to escape them is a daydream.

It is called communication. It is called understanding culture. It is
called public relations. The hypospray you seek has been here all along,
but far too many transhumanists prefer to dream about a less messy
solution where they do not have to do so much themselves. After all,
sitting around hoping to find some super argument that will convince
everybody requires nearly no effort, but convincing the mainstream is
going to be hard work (although it can be very fun and rewarding work
too).

The issue is not absolute security. There is no such animal. The issue is
reducing the number of potential nuclei during transition through a
specific vulnerability time window.

Um, it's an immune system to combat emergence of a mind seed, not a mind
seed.

It doesn't have intelligence, it's self amplifying brute force machine to
find vulnerabilities. It has no neuronal DSP cargo onboard. It's designed
to reduce the amount of substrate for a worm with such cargo, reducing
bootstrap resources. Which are thresholded, so it pays limiting the
initial size of the petri dish.

I think I specifically mentioned what I'm trying to achieve with the list
of countermeasures.

Few 10^6 to 10^9 uploads, preferably off-planet.

We will very probably be dead of side effects of a Blight. It is not
obvious that we will die as a result of inability to cope with a few of
our problems.

Recombinant DNA research is regulated. Recombinant DNA research involving
potent human pathogens is severely regulated. Nevertheless, progress still
happens. I'm proposing regulating specific areas of computer science,
which is unprecedented for it, but is otherwise common practice in a
number of other industries.

The nice thing about uploading is that it doesn't involve any Power-grade
intelligences. It's a large effort, but it's very conventional research.

The point is that this is another compartment, with very different
environment conditions than down here.

Artificial reality is indistinguishable from the real thing, if properly
done. If you don't trust people being "healthy" (whatever that means) in
reality, are you at all concerned with welfare of people?

The uploading process is almost fully automated, requiring only high-level
human supervision. Since we're talking about molecular circuitry, scaling
up the processes rapidly is very possibly.  I'm assuming sufficient
automation so that the scanning stages can be mass-produced almost as
rapidly, possibly using partial closure capable automation.

People are dying *right now*. Cryonics need to be validated and deployed
*right now*. Simultaneously, we need to engage into massive R&D into
volume molecular mapping and modelling of simple organisms.

Human augmentation means currently wearables. Nothing wrong with
developing them, and new interfaces. Any invasive interfaces/symbiosis
require medical NT. Medical NT the Freitas way is *hard*. It means you
have to develop conventional NT first. I'm of course for pushing
nanotechnology research, as molecular electronics and scanning stage will
much profit from it.

Meaning, we don't really disagree. Lots of our initial goals overlap.

We're getting grassroot augmentation via cellphone/PDA-->wearable route.
The acceptance of gargoyles will be quantitative within the next decade.

       I'd have to agree with both of you on this one. Standing by and 
watching these poor folks and their family have thier one last chance  taken 
away, worries the hell out of me. After all, I fully intend to be put on ice 
when the time comes. 
       I posted a few questions a while back asking what rights cryonaughts 
had, if any. It seems that this is the first legal case that will set the 
prescidant for other countries to follow. On a personal note, My mother lives 
in France and I have toyed with the idea of moving there myself. If Cryonics 
are effectively outlawed in France, Then relocation there would be out of the 
question.

       I really dont think I could live with myself if I don't try to do 
something for this couple. Not just for them, but for our future rights.

I think its about time we made a stand for what we believe in. Where to start 
? That i'm not to sure about.
       Any Ideas?

Alex

The point is that carbon was irradiated in situ. Fossil fuels *are* lower
on C-14, though.

However, this is irrelevant for cryonics. Radiation damage doesn't
register even over geological time frames: the tissue is a glass, and has
no metabolism. To really hurt it, you would have to put it nearby a MCi
source of ionizing radiation.

Do you really think there is a simple cause behind poverty, crime or
racism? And if there are such simple causes, do you really think they
would be simple to address? 

My conjecture that solutions might require equal complexity to solve
complex problems is of course just a conjecture. I don't know if it is
true. But it seems to fit with my experience.

Changing the nature of agents is often not ethically acceptable or
possible, and in many cases such changes would be highly complex and
individual. Similarly it is hard to change interactions from the
outside. It is easy to say that if every racist person were changed to
not hate/fear/loathe other people the problem would go away, but it is
not a solution to the problem - a solution would involve a recipe for
action, and that is something entirely different when we are dealing
with humans.

Yes. Transformation is often a good method. If winning is hard, change
the rules.

But finding these active elements is often computationally intractable.
There is likely not that many genes controlling ant social interactions,
but figuring out how these interactions actually work (and getting the
ants to build square anthills instead) is a major undertaking for us
human superintelligences - we have godlike resources from an ant's
perspective, but even these are not enough to quickly solve the problem
(I think it will be solved, but it will take a while). And that was just
dealing with ants. 

I also don't think human behavior, especially when in groups with
culture and dynamic institutions, is factorable into a handfull of
active elements.

Groking is about finding a very compressed representation of the world;
true groking would be the shortest possible representation. But many
things in the world are not algorithmically compressible. It might be
simple in principle to understand the geometry of a tree as a few basic
rules, but there is also an incompressible part of the individual unique
differences from these rules (twigs that were snapped by a passing
animal, the slight deformation due to a now gone treehouse). It is even
worse with the human mind: there might be less than 30,000 genes
involved in growing it, but the 1e11 neurons emerge in an emergent
process that is very sensitive to the environment and later experience -
I would be surprised if it was very compressible. Similarly, I have a
hard time believing the human psychology built on this basis would be
very compressible.

The end result is that I don't think groking the complexity of entire
societies is feasible, not even for SIs unless they are of a
ridiculously high order.

I concur that it is good enough for us to be able to do many things with
ease (pattern recognition of predators and prey, language acquisition) and
to find work-arounds for those things that are very hard (deductive
reasoning, mathematical computation - which we already augment heavily
with calculators and computers). So, I wouldn't say it's "low" grade. But
there is clearly much that can be improved.

About the suggested London meeting, I think I'll mention a date, time and 
place and see what happens:

DATE - Saturday the 16th of march
TIME - lunchtime, say 1.00 pm (pre/post shopping?)
PLACE - let's follow Charlies' suggestion (see below)
THEME - "I never thought I would ever meet another extrope in the flesh!" 
;-)

Yes, though note that dilute amounts are already diffused through our
systems. It also depends on the isotopes. Most uranium is not
radioactive and quite stable. Only a small percent of Uranium is of
radioactive isotopes. Coal-born uranium is generally pretty stable,
since it's had tens of millions of years of stable storage to decay its
radioactive isotopes out. I'd be more worried about U's heavy metal
toxicity as a chemical rather than as a source of radiation.

Also, there are documented positive health effects from increased levels
of low level background radiation (and it grows much bigger veggies,
too).

Hi all,

Just recently, Eugene sent out a reply, pointing out some specific
advantages of uploading. One of the things he mentioned was the ability to
do "mind morphing" - he mentioned this in the context of flexibility and
safety.

It so happens that I'm reworking part of the mind uploading introduction
text this morning, so I thought I'd check up on the actual meaning of the
terminology we use. It struck me that my original assumption about "mind
morphing" was confused, since I was thinking of "mind merging" in the
context of distributed or multiple copies (safety and flexibility).

>From Webster's Dictionary:

MERGE:
  plunge, engulf in something
  combine, unite, coalesce (!)
  blend gradually (!)

MORPH:
  change form or character
  undergo transformation

I'm sure that both are quite possible in an uploaded state. Now I'm just
wondering which one is usually being implied in the context Eugene
mentioned. Eugene, anyone?

Thanks,
       Randal

Actually, if I remember correctly (I have seen the movie about half a dozen 
times, but it has been a couple of years...) there is a subtle time lapse 
while the primes are doing their thing.  There's a film-maker's term for 
this, but I can't remember what it is.

One of the non-scientific things that bothered me about the film (only 
somewhat) was that the special effects were great for the wormhole/Arroway 
Island bit, but the filmmakers couldn't pull out the extra dough to make 
the plane flight to the Japanese ship look even remotely real.  Minor 
quibble though.  I still think it's a great movie, if only for the fact 
that it puts transhumanist concepts across with very little compromise.

Subject: RE: Contact's Arroway character (was Re: My Review A.I. the
Movie )

"Yes, I see your point regarding the pi. I didn't think the movie's
ambiguous ending was necessarily bad, but the pi in the book did tie the
various plot elements together."

"I just read, in the Sagan biography I have, that the pi was left out in the
movie due to a decision higher up in the film studio, so then,
a Hollywood decision. The decision makers thought that pi was too
complicated a topic for the public to understand. So here, yes, a dumbing
down of the movie. too bad." 

Thats depressing, but not surprising that Hollywood did that, it is
surprising that Sagan *allowed* it, considering I seem to remember him
criticizing that very type of act numerous times in Demon Haunted World.  

     -------------------------

>In the book she was much more outspoken and (I thought) intelligent.

>intellectual atheist, and stumbled anytime someone disagreed with
>her or pointed out some lame allegedly logical flaw in her stance.
>To me, these things showed the influence that hollywood did have in

"One thing to remember is that the book was published 12 years before
the movie came out. Sagan was changing, himself, during that time.

Carl Sagan went to extremes, in my opinion, to build that movie
character, so I give him (and the others) a huge amount of credit to
have produced even what he did produce, that is: a smart female
scientist character.  I don't know of any other movie to have such
realism for that role. The people involved: he, Ann Druyan (his
wife), Linda Obst (film producer), Lucy Fisher and Courtney Valenti
(executive producers), and of course, Jodie Foster, did it right, in
my opinion. Do you really think that a Dagny Taggart approach would
have worked?"

"It's not realistic to expect a woman scientist to act like a man
scientist. She has different approaches and  different strengths,
and usually it requires alot of energy to make her voice heard among
the din. And it's reasonable to expect her to be making large life
decisions, choices, compromises, and fighting more than what's
comfortable, with regards to how to have a family at the same time
of having a work passion. All I'm saying is that a female scientist
(character and real life) _should_ be experiencing uncertainties and
despair at times, and to also have goals and wishes that are nothing
to do with science, so why not have the character display that
reality? The  Ellie character was not a lifeless robot, and most
woman scientists are not either."

I was not really referring to anything related to the charachter being a
women.  I was more concerned (and annoyed) at the fact that she was an
intelligent scientist and atheist and balked a 1st grade objections to her
stance.  She was at a loss for words whenever anyone challenged her ideas,
something that never happened to Sagan.  A good example was during the
senate inquiry, another one was when she was talking with Matthew
Mcohnahay's charachter about standing in front of that pendulum and
flinching.  He was citing the fact that she knew it wouldnt come back as
high as it had been, but she flinched anyway.  She had no response (that I
can remember) where Sagan would have said something like "my brain has been
trained by millions of years of evolution to avoid large heavy objects
careening toward me, and only recently in evolutionary history have such
objects been delicately balanced and set periodically swinging, but with
time I could overwrite my evoluitonary inspired reflexive behavior with a
new one, that of not fliching in the presence of swinging pendulums"

It also seemed that Elly was enfatuated in a school girlish sense with
Mcohoanay's characther.  Most of the time she was an intelligent, strong,
independant women, until some handsome smirking hunk comes by to question
her / flirt with her, then she reverts to a stereotypical passive hollywood
female charachter.  

Just my 2c

"I disagree sir.  In any universe with any curvature, a circle would still
have 360 degrees, for the circle defines the degree, as well as the radian.
The expansion given would work even in a different space curvature, and they
would derive the same value for pi.  Nowthen, if they were to actually
attempt to measure the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, Im not
exactly sure what would happen.  spike"

scerir - "in a non-Euclidean space the ratio is < pi, or > pi In GR, for a
'warped' (hyper)surface the ratio is < pi, and it is also possible for pi to
be rational, if I remember well"

Ken - "Pi is a constant that does not change no matter where you are, how
much you weigh, or how fast you are going.  It says some things about flat
Euclidean space, and to the extent your observations of the space around do
not match, pi helps you figure out the nature of the curvature"

Assuming that PI is the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its
circumference, then altering the curvature of space time would alter that
ratio, this is a fundamental aspect of general relativity is it not?
Imagine a circle drawn on a piece of paper and a diameter drawn through, the
ratio of the two is some particular number.  Imagine that instead of drawing
that circle on a flat piece of paper it is drawn on a sphere (similiar to a
line of lattitude on a globe) If it is a small sphere and the line of
lattitude is the equator of the sphere, the total distance around the circle
may be equal to the circle on the paper, but the radius of the circle must
curve with the sphere, and is not a (comparitively) straight flat line so it
must necessarily be longer when compared with the overall circumference.  As
the sphere increases in size, the line of latitude must move up the sphere
to maintain its size, as it does the the radius gets closer and closer to
being the straight line of the flat piece of paper, and thus the ratio of
that radius to the circumference gets changes as well.  The curvature of the
sphere the circle is drawn on is analogous to the curvature of space time,
Thus PI changes with the curvature of space time.  In the absence of a
gravitational field, I believe there is a net curvature of space time (is
space time curved or flat?) If that is the case, the the geometry of the
space time curvature can be altered to change the ratio of a circle to its
radius and thus hide a number in it (can it be arbitrary?) 

"Damien, the problem is that, in the book, Ellie does not go out and measure
some aspect of this universe.  Instead, she uses computers to look into the
mathematical expansion of pi for a hidden message of Creation."

If Elly was figuring this out on a computer, perhaps she modeled a
mathematically perfect circle and compared its circumference with its
diameter with the already known curvature of space time, thus making the
calculation one that is representative of the geommetry of space time, and
not merely an abstract mathematical construct.  Altering such a curvature
would probably not effect any organisms evolving in the space-time unless
the curvature was severe.

"Actually, it is an absolute, since scientific progress shows no sign of
exceeding it outside of using loopholes like wormholes, etc. Experiments
in FTL all demonstrate that wavefront speeds are always restrained to
light speed."

I was under the distinct impression that it is a limitation imposed on
classical physics by general relativity.  That is, one can not classically
accelerate to the speed of light, because this would require infinite
energy, and the subsequent temporal dialition and lorentz transformation
would also be infinite.  Classical physics has its own domain of validity,
that of the normal and everyday, general relativity ecompasses classical
physics and also includes the very large, very massive, and very fast in its
domain of validity.  However, quantum mechanics lies outside the domain of
validity of general relativity, and thus does not abide by its limitations.
Indeed, Einsteins famous paper on the EPR Paradox was an attempt to show the
rediculous implications of quantum mecahanics that obviously violated
special relativity, the paradox turned out to be an accurate description of
reality yet does indeed violate relativistic rules.

So, classically accelerating to OR past the speed of light is impossible,
however one could classically accelerate to 99.999999% the speed of light,
and then quantum tunnel to 100.000000000000001% the speed of light, and thus
travel faster then light.  (Of course you would have to control the quantum
tunneleing of every particle that comprises your vehicle)   There are other
possible methods of superluminal travel.

A golden chain guards the tiny doorway to the future for Raymond and Monique
Martinot - their immortal love momentarily frozen in time, awaiting the
inevitable day when science ultimately conquers the final insult. Their
capsule of mortar and ingenuity precariously drifting along on the currents
of their uncertain destiny.

A deadly shadow moves closer and then suddenly recoils as if astonished by a
sensation outside its ancient experience - a singular foreboding as if this
cool cellar might somehow be a trap!

For when news of the lovers plight reached the Extropic Travelers, they
came together as never before in the growing realization that their golden
PR opportunity had indeed arrived. Outside a small cellar in
Neuil-sur-Layon, France, for the first time in recorded history, an
impressive declaration of support for Raymond and Monique Martinots
immortal dream was read aloud by their son Remy. It included the names and
brief statements of thousands of individuals worldwide - including
scientists, doctors, engineers, philosophers, writers, etc. who believed
that this act must not be permitted. Also included were numerous appended
documents affirming the plausibility of the cryonic perspective AND the
names of EVERY official attempting to perpetuate this double murder.

And the world became most interested.

Your problem is that you do not think people can change very much, and
that efforts to do so are overly hard. As a result you do not care to
study the issue more - after all, in your estimation further study will
likely just confirm your opinion, so that effort could be spent on
something else. So you end up even more convinced that other people are
rigid memebots run by their irrational, anti-transhumanist ideas. If you
then find yourself in a situation where you are dependent on other
people and their opinions, you are entirely defenseless.

But the real situation is far more positive. People can and do change
opinions, even about fundamental issues. New ideas have conquered the
world, even when there have been an uphill battle - think about how
democracy was instituted in various western countries. Small dedicated
groups with a vision have changed the policies of far larger groups (for
good and ill) through persistence and communication. If you read about
the history of ideas you will find that nearly every major idea today
started out as a silly heresy, and only became "obvious" after its
adherents set out to show that it was indeed a good idea. And there are
piles of ideas that are today almost entirely unknown that failed
because they were not supported. 

Personally I want to see transhumanism realized. I want to see the
practical benefits. This is why I care about this issue, and get so
irritated at the insular attitude many transhumanists show. It is
irrational and not based on the true state of the world, and it
hamstrings transhumanism unnecessarily. If you feel depressed by me
saying we have to deal with people to get to a transhuman state, then
think of this: isn't transhumanism about trans-*humans*, and doesn't
that imply that it has - by definition - involve dealing with humans in
all their glorious messiness?

Given the public's willingness to spend obscene amounts of money on
Homeopathy, Aromatherapy, Macrobiotics, Ear candling, Magnets, Qigong,
Reflexology, and anything labelled "herbal" or "organic", the mere fact
that Spike's vege-stables provide no actual benefits should be no
impediment to his making a fortune with them.  And if I can figure
out a way to make fertilizer with low K40, I can sell it to him.
People will buy all kinds of fertilizer.

The Washington Post writes this morning recapping the controversy over
the recent tabletop fusion experiment at Oak Ridge:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5592-2002Mar10.html

There's not much new in the article, mostly a bunch of scientists saying
nasty things about each other.  But I thought one thing mentioned at
the end was interesting.

With sonoluminescence experiments you need to get a bubble in the liquid.
This will then be alternately compressed and expanded by the sound waves
and if all goes well, it will emit a very short burst of light at the
point of highest compression.

The "amateur" experiment I pointed to earlier formed the bubble simply
by lifting a few drops of water into the air and dropping them into
the flask.  But most labs do it with a tiny heating filament.  They give
it a burst and essentially boil the water in a small area to form a
tiny bubble.  The ORNL experiment was different; they used neutrons.
They fire a beam of neutrons into the water and when they hit, that
vaporizes the region and forms a bubble.

That seemed strange to me, because it ends up making the results harder
to interpret, since one of the signs of fusion is emission of neutrons.
Now, the emitted neutrons are a different energy than those they were
using to create the bubbles, but still it means that you have to be
careful in your measurements.  And indeed some of the critics claim that
the researchers were not measuring their neutrons properly.

The WP article explains why it was done this way.  The long term hope
is that the neutrons emitted by the fusion could themselves trigger
other bubbles.  Presumably this would require a larger tank of liquid,
or perhaps some neutron-capturing elements mixed into the heavy water.
But if you could do this then you could give it an initial burst and then
you would get a continual series of bubbles, each triggering others,
to produce a self-sustained fusion reaction.  That would really be
impressive.

BTW, did you see "The Sound of Neutrons" movie from the links Scerir
provided?  Look at
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/science/2002-03/taleyarkh-3-8-02.html,
which has a link to a QuickTime movie showing the experiment in action.
You can hear the rapid-fire popping as each bubble forms, grows and then
collapses.  Plus you can see many of the bubbles - they are much larger
than I would have expected.  I'm not sure what the scale is but the
bubbles supposedly grow to 6.5 millimeters, which is much larger than
I thought was usual for sonoluminescence.

I thought I explained this rather carefully, but I guess I was not as helpful as I would have liked.  Perhaps I was not clear about the difference between physical space-time and mathematical space. I will try again.

No, and it is not just that you stated the ratio backwards, it is much more fundamental.  First, you have to understand that a circle is defined as the locus of points that are all equidistant from a given point (the center).  Points are theoretical; they are not dots on paper, they are not places in any real space.  Points have no width or length or thickness (dimensionless).  They are part of the tautological mental
construct we call mathematics.  When you "draw a circle" on a piece of paper, the actual mathematical circle is in your mind.  What is on the paper is a pattern of ink blobs that all have physical dimensions not associated with mathematical points.  If you do a good job drawing, the length of your figure divided by the widest distance across it will be something close to pi, but will not equal it.  A circle is not a physical
thing.

You can refer to the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of all circles in all kinds of mathematical spaces.  Just because the ratio may exist in some given mathematical space, that does not mean its value is pi.  Pi does equal this ratio when we are talking about a flat two dimensional Euclidean space.  If you start curving that space, the ratio changes so it is no longer equal to pi.

I covered the spherical case in my post.  Yes, the ratio changes with curvature, but pi does not change.  Again, the ratio is simply no longer equal to pi.

It's the other way around.  In the absence of a gravitational field it is believed there would be *no* curvature, which is not the case because there is a gravitational field.  This is physical space-time, not a constructed mathematical space where there are circles.

A circular path may exist in physical space-time, but a circle does not.  A circle *is* a mathematically perfect circle, and in pane geometry its circumference to diameter ratio is pi.  Your suggestion would have been better than what was in the book, as it would have been based on a physical measurement, your "already known curvature."  But Carl did not write that.  Had he picked that one, it still would not have worked
because the message appears "kilometers downstream of the decimal point" which means the measurement would require at lest several hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude in resolution.  The whole Universe has less than 200 orders of magnitude from top to bottom.  (By the way, we know pi to over 200 billion places which, if you wrote down on paper at 4 mm per digit, would run over 800,000 km.  Long enough to go from the
earth to the moon and back.)

Just to be really pedantic, a circle in your mind does not occupy some
abstract mathematical space; it occupies a retinotopic pixel map in your
visual cortex.  The actual visual map in the brain is stretched near the
center and shrunk near the edges, so if the imagined circle were visualized
off-center, it wouldn't actually *be* a circle in the physical substrate.

Non-member submission from [revermore <revermore@shaw.ca>]

A golden chain guards the tiny doorway to the future for Raymond and Monique
Martinot - their immortal love momentarily frozen in time, awaiting the
inevitable day when science ultimately conquers the final insult. Their
capsule of mortar and ingenuity precariously drifting along on the currents
of their uncertain destiny.

A deadly shadow moves closer and then suddenly recoils as if astonished by a
sensation outside it's ancient experience - a singular foreboding as if this
cool cellar might somehow be a trap!

For when news of the lover's plight reached the Extropic Travelers, they
came together as never before in the growing realization that their golden
PR opportunity had indeed arrived. Outside a small cellar in
Neuil-sur-Layon, France, for the first time in recorded history, an
impressive declaration of support for Raymond and Monique Martinot's
immortal dream was read aloud by their son Remy. It included the names and
brief statements of thousands of individuals worldwide - including
scientists, doctors, engineers, philosophers, writers, etc. who believed
that this act must not be permitted. Also included were numerous appended
documents affirming the plausibility of the cryonic perspective AND the
names of EVERY official attempting to perpetuate this double murder.

And the world became most interested.

I once heard that the beauty of
    e^(i * pi) + 1 = 0
is that the simple equation contains the five most important constants.

After re-reading what you had said, I think I understand what the
disagreement is, since we were both saying the same thing yet drawing
different conclusions...

I did read you original comments about a sphere, and I basically parallel
what you said.  Here is your post...

"Here is an example: suppose you are at the south pole of the earth and you
have 100 m of steel wire.  You can put one end of the wire at the pole and
stretch it out so as to walk a circular path around the pole at a constant
distance of 100 m.  If you divide the distance you walked by 200 m, you will
get a number very close to pi.  Next, get a boat and travel around
antarctica at a constant distance of about 3000 km.  If you divide the
distance you go around by 6000 km, you will find the result is very much
lower than pi.  If you keep going north to the equator and try this, the
ratio of circumference to diameter will be exactly 2, and if you keep going
to within a couple meters of the north pole, this ratio get very close to
zero.  So, pi did not change, but the ratio of the circumference to diameter
of a path through the locus of points equidistant to a fixed point on a
spherical shell is dependent on the length chosen for the radius, although
the curvature of the space is constant"

You specifically state that if the curvature changes, the ratio of the
circumference to the diameter changes BUT PI does not.  (???) Isnt PI the
ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter? (dont answer yet,
see below)

"I covered the spherical case in my post.  Yes, the ratio changes with
curvature, but pi does not change.  Again, the ratio is simply no longer
equal to pi."

If PI *is* the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and
that ratio changes with curvature, then wouldnt pi change?  You said that
ratio may change so that it is no longer PI.  I am a bit confused here, I
suppose this depends if you define PI as the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter or define PI as the number 3.14159 etc. etc (see next
part)

"You can refer to the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of all
circles in all kinds of mathematical spaces.  Just because the ratio may
exist in some given mathematical space, that does not mean its value is pi.
Pi does equal this ratio when we are talking about a flat two dimensional
Euclidean space.  If you start curving that space, the ratio changes so it
is no longer equal to pi."

Well here is the quip obviously, is PI's definition "the ratio of the
circumference of a circle to its diameter IN FLAT SPACE"
or is PI's definition "the ratio of the measured circumference of a circle
to its diameter" If the former, the you are correct, PI never changes, if
the latter, then I am correct, and PI changes.  This seems to merely be a
disagreement in the definition of PI. 

"scerir posted this link:
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/pi.html be sure to take
a look. "

I did, I didnt understand it, but now I do.  And from that page is "Pi is a
mathematical constant __usually__ defined as the ratio of the circumference
of a circle to its diameter in Euclidean geometry"  So there you have it, pi
is constant depending on your definition.

"It's the other way around.  In the absence of a gravitational field it is
believed there would be *no* curvature, which is not the case because there
is a gravitational field.  This is physical space-time, not a constructed
mathematical space where there are circles."

This question relates to whether space-time is curved at all, as far as I
can tell this question is, as of yet, unanswered in cosmology.  It may not
be curved, or it may be positively curved or negatively curved.  It is
reasonable that one could take the average space-time curvature from the
distribution of matter in a universe and determine the ratio of the
circumference of a circly to its diameter.  If that average space time
curvature is different, so is that ratio.  If you define PI as the measured
ratio, and not the ratio in eucledian space, the it too changes.  Would the
universe be curved in the absence of matter?  If it is, than that curvature
could be altered to change the value of the ratio, if PI is defined as the
measured value of that ratio, then it too could change.  If you wanted to
change the value of that ratio, you could increase or decrease the
curvature, or increase or decrease the density of matter, or increase or
decrease it's affects on the curvature of space-time.

"A circular path may exist in physical space-time, but a circle does not.  A
circle *is* a mathematically perfect circle, and in pane geometry its
circumference to diameter ratio is pi. "

I suppose it all depends on your definition of a circle.  If your definition
is an absolute mathematical one, and there is no curvature of the surface
the circle exist on, then you are right.  If you definition of a circle is
something that is drawn on a piece of paper, then the ratio of its
circumference to its diameter would vary with the curvature of space time.
I think this discussion could delve into the metaphysical nature of
mathematics and discussions about objective reality, something I am not
capable of intelligently discussing.  

"Your suggestion would have been better than what was in the book, as it
would have been based on a physical measurement, your "already known
curvature."  But Carl did not write that.  Had he picked that one, it still
would not have worked because the message appears "kilometers downstream of
the decimal point" which means the measurement would require at lest several
hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude in resolution.  The whole
Universe has less than 200 orders of magnitude from top to bottom.  (By the
way, we know pi to over 200 billion places which, if you wrote down on paper
at 4 mm per digit, would run over 800,000 km.  Long enough to go from the
earth to the moon and back.)"

Well, in any case thanks for helping to clear that up, it seems we both said
the ratio changes with the curvature of space time, but differed in our
interprations of the definition of pi, and thus had a different conclusion
to the question.  Im my google searches I could not find a definition that
was absolute either way, but I guess definitions are arbitrary social
constructs anyway.  Not being a formally trained mathematician, I couldnt
say either way what the *official* definition is.

That it has worked thus far to the degree it has says nothing 
about whether it is adequate to the problems of today much less

quite a few serious limitations.  And it doesn't have a damn

I could sort of see the religion angle, espcially as it has

Hey, this gives me an idea. Given that I am someone who does not feel *at
all* happy with the sysop scenario, how to peacefully rebel against it is
something I've wondered about.

Interestingly, it looks like one practical way to do so is to produce new
minds of comparable complexity to the sysopmind, even if they are not quite
in the same league, and give them the ability to act on the world. Their
very existence will render it unable to proceed in a reasonable manner. Once
they exist, it will be well aware that it will not be able to model the
universe well enough to make the excellent decisions required of it.

Also, I would assume that a benevolent sysopmind would not be able to
destroy these other minds, especially if its only critereon for doing so is
to simplify the space of actors. That's the opposite of benevolent :-)

It may decide to work with them, and they may form some new kind of sysop
community, or else the lesser minds might switch themselves off so that the
greater sysop can do its job. That seems unlikely to me, but if it did
happen, it would likely serve as a strong demonstration that the sysop
scenario is a good idea after all, and I should just behave well and play
nice.

And it unites calculus (e), algebra (i), geometry (pi) and arithmetic
(1). I agree with many in that it is the most beautiful result in
mathematics. I'm really fond of Gauss' theorema egregium and the
Gauss-Bonnet formula, but neither have the simplicity and reach of
Euler's formula. I still remember my amazement and delight when I
managed to prove it on my own using an infinite series expansion in
highschool. 


One merit of mathematics few will deny: it says more in fewer words than
any other science. The formula, e^i pi = -1 expressed a world of
thought, of truth, of poetry, and of the religious spirit "God eternally
geometrizes."

If you write a list of what comprises a human life, then you will see
the place for the mythic symbols:  in humans' past, in humans'
present, and in transhumans' lives too (assuming that a transhuman
is a sentient life).

What comprises a human life? All of those exciting or boring
directed activities: As long as humans have growing phases
(childhoods, teen, adult years), create offspring, seek forms of
nourishment, make friends, form love partnerships, break love
partnerships, make goals and seek fulfilling work, become bored of
their work, find new fulfilling work, form large and small
communities, get into disagreements, place their roots somewhere
else, lose friends/family, take care of their family/offspring/communities,
then mythic symbols have an important place. These activities result
from a basic set of values and have been part of humans' life since
we were human. I don't see them changing very much in transhumans, do you?

I can think of  several reasons why mythic symbols might be
more important for transhumans:

* Parents/Grandparents(or other family)/Communities might not be
(as) readily available. The myths can provide templates to teach and
support a particular transhuman through rites of passage,
'difficult' times, facilitating a big dream.

* With long lives, our work/play/family arena will be larger and
longer, so it is even more important to pay attention to one's inner
voice and follow our inner voices. The myths provide templates to
stay true to ourselves.

* Communities/families are likely to be more dispersed in space and
time, lending to a situation where transhumans need psychological
linkages. (This assumes that transhumans would feel lonely if they
have little or no contact with other transhumans). The mythic symbols
provide psychological linkages too.

I have really enjoyed reading through this thread inspired by Richard Hack.  Though I admit it is very familiar ground we regularly return to for obvious reasons.

I think Anders really hit the nail on the head with the above quote.  It may feel good to think of oneself as an "enlightened super-elitest" who does not want or need others from outside the group, but it is just not a productive way of accomplishing what is needed.  

Max More and Natasha Vita-More have known this for a long time, and that's why they have been so involved in getting the word out through the mass media.  And now we even see Anders giving lectures to the leadership of his native country.  Way to go!! : ) 

I realize dreams of building a space colony for escaping the troubles of the Earth can be fun, but I wonder what concrete things we can do in the here-and-now to progress our agenda in the right way?

I would suggest doing the following twelve ideas as a group, and as individuals if we want to make this a better world.

1. Join the Extropy Institute.

2. Join the Foresight Institute.

3. Join a cryonics organization, and if not as a policy holding member, than as someone who will at least provide support.  

4.  Attend the conferences of transhumanist organizations.

5. Start up and/or participate in transhumanist groups located in your local community.

6. Share about transhumanism in a considerate way with friends and family.  

7. Write politicians and business leaders as a part of group efforts to influence events.

8. Be a good citizen in your community and example in your personal life.  A person's life is built upon their reputation.  

9. Where possible, help to start ExI chapters in local colleges.  I think this cannot be overemphasized!

10. Join the Progress Action Coalition, and similar organizations intended to counter the opponents of progress.         

11. Stay learning by reading relevant books.

12. Marry and raise children who will seriously consider transhumanism when the time comes.  I realize marriage and children is not for everyone.  I just don't believe in the argument "with all the changes coming soon, why even have kids?"  I think having raising children in the world that's coming could be a very exciting thing.  

Anyway, those are my ideas.  I look forward to hearing what suggestions the rest of you have.  I admit many of the things on my list I have not done, but I am trying to move in the right direction.

As Natasha Vita-More says on the Pro-Act website, "What 2030 will really be like is in many ways up to us!"  

best wishes,

John

Go to Google, put in "Pi in curved space" and hit the groups button.  You will get a couple of thousand hits.  Looking at the first dozen or so, you will see that your question has been quite popular over the years, as have been answers along the argument I used.

Except that you held the radius of the circle constant and let the curvature of the space change to show that the value of the c/d ratio would change.  I held the curvature constant to show that in such a space the c/d ratio would depend on the size of the circle.  So if you want to use that as the definition of pi, it is no constant, even within that fixed curvature space.  If you tell me the curvature of the space you are
in I still cannot give you a numeric value for the c/d ratio of a circle in that space, until you tell me either c or d.

The curvature of space-time is well accepted, with plenty of demonstrations.  In the future we may find some corrections to make to General Relativity, but flat space-time is long gone.  I suspect you would enjoy some books on the subject such as _Einstein's Universe: Gravity at Work and Play_ by Anthony Zee (1989).

I think this question qualifies for Zen Koan status.  Or perhaps it is another way of asking the old "Tree Falling the Woods" question.

I hate to get into a pedantic matching contest here, but I will make a couple of comments.

Most people blind from birth can be taught to manipulate geometric concepts like circles, although the pattern of neural activity you describe above has never happened.  Some people with normal vision, may be very strong in symbolic thinking over visual thinking, so when you ask them to visualize a circle, they think about the equidistant point properties and other qualities, over the picture.

A circle is a meme in the memeplex of mathematics.  It infects the mind.  Its representation as activity in the brain is highly context dependent.

I have really enjoyed reading through this thread inspired by Richard Hack.  Though I admit it is very familiar ground we regularly return to for obvious reasons.

I think Anders really hit the nail on the head with the above quote.  It may feel good to think of oneself as an "enlightened super-elitest" who does not want or need others from outside the group, but it is just not a productive way of accomplishing what is needed.  

Max More and Natasha Vita-More have known this for a long time, and that's why they have been so involved in getting the word out through the mass media.  And now we even see Anders giving lectures to the leadership of his native country.  Way to go!! : ) 

I realize dreams of building a space colony for escaping the troubles of the Earth can be fun, but I wonder what concrete things we can do in the here-and-now to progress our agenda in the right way?

I would suggest doing the following twelve ideas as a group, and as individuals if we want to make this a better world.

1. Join the Extropy Institute.

2. Join the Foresight Institute.

3. Join a cryonics organization, and if not as a policy holding member, than as someone who will at least provide support.  

4.  Attend the conferences of transhumanist organizations.

5. Start up and/or participate in transhumanist groups located in your local community.

6. Share about transhumanism in a considerate way with friends and family.  

7. Write politicians and business leaders as a part of group efforts to influence events.

8. Be a good citizen in your community and example in your personal life.  A person's life is built upon their reputation.  

9. Where possible, help to start ExI chapters in local colleges.  I think this cannot be overemphasized!

10. Join the Progress Action Coalition, and similar organizations intended to counter the opponents of progress.         

11. Stay learning by reading relevant books.

12. Marry and raise children who will seriously consider transhumanism when the time comes.  I realize marriage and children is not for everyone.  I just don't believe in the argument "with all the changes coming soon, why even have kids?"  I think having raising children in the world that's coming could be a very exciting thing.  

Anyway, those are my ideas.  I look forward to hearing what suggestions the rest of you have.  I admit many of the things on my list I have not done, but I am trying to move in the right direction.

As Natasha Vita-More says on the Pro-Act website, "What 2030 will really be like is in many ways up to us!"  

best wishes,

John

Seriously, the carbon 14 in a cryonaut's food is probably irrelevant.  
The actual meat is not going to live again.  Surely, post singularity,
we would simply send nanobots into the frozen brain, map the
dendrites, create a sim based on that map, and the result would
be an uploaded holodeck-like existence.

Some people buy "organic" foods, eating wormy undersized produce,
under the belief that "artificial" pesticides and fertilizers are somehow
inferior to the the natural kind.  So growing carbon-14 free produce
might be an exceptable strategy if one's only goal is to make money.  

Note the lighthearted tone of the original post on this topic.  spike

Much of what we talk about is simply inapplicable to people
and their lives.  Some of it may even be dangerous.

I think we have to move away from this notion that we have
ideas or solutions to offer.  I don't say this because I think
we should "compromise" or whatever, I say it because it's an
outright lie to say otherwise.  We emphatically do not agree
on any number of things.  The point is, however, that we are
talking about them.  But what is it to be talking about these
things?  Why does it appeal?  Can we extend that appeal?

The first and second questions warrant serious attention, we
shouldn't pass over them on our way to the third.

Sorry, I'm to busy building the technologies on which our dreams for the
future depend, to spend that much time, effort, and money on debating
the dreams.

Who was it who first said, "The best way to envision the future is to
build it"?

This may be another angle of why transhumanism is seen as detached from
humanism and similar values held by much of humanity: because the latter
are pure thought, pure debate, pure compassion and emotions and hopes
and dreams...but transhumanism has an aspect, however small, that
actually shapes how the common man really lives (at least, to such a
radically large degree as to make mere humanism seem to have zero
effect).  To think that a force other than your own has that much real
power scares people.

And, yes, I use the present tense deliberately.  From this perspective,
the Internet is but an inkling of things to come.  That came fast, on
the scale of human history, and we predict (with some evidence) the rest
to come even faster.  Witness the entire concept of the Singularity, for
instance...and efforts to make the public more familiar with, and thus
less scared of, it.

Sorry.  I like making threads come full circle like that.  ^_^;

Sorry it took me so long to reply. I really indulged in some masochism last 
week - I got all domestic & decided to finish a quilt AND re-wallpaper my 
bathroom :P I probably need to get out more
Anyhow, I wanted to thank everyone who responded to my sour little rant on 
overpopulation. Shortly after posting my question I heard something on NPR 
about restricted family sizes in China, so then I read about China's 
population policies & the UNFPA. My immediate reaction was: "How can they do 
that!? They can't tell people how many children to have! That's sounds. 
uh-oh, a lot like what I wrote in my email - doh!" I caught myself up! But I 
feel much better about things now that I realize how totally stupid I was 
being :P
But the feedback I got also really helped clear up some misconceptions I had 
about population. John Grigg's link was incredibly helpful as a good 
starting point for me (thanks!): 
http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/population.html
I found out that, unfortunately, many people are uninformed about this 
issue. But I thought it was interesting how everyone's (false) perceptions 
tend to be warped in the same way - like they all grumble the same 
complaints & share the same attitudes about what they consider to be 
population "problems." So then I started to think about what specific things 
made me think there was a population problem to begin with - traffic, 
housing, faulty civil engineering, old infrastructure, short sighted city 
planning, and large-scale private & corporate developments that do not 
consider (or care to consider) the overall congruity of the of their 
structures with the surrounding areas. But the most basic thing (which 
totally eluded me) is that many people actually choose to live & gather in 
densely populated areas.
James Rogers wrote:
You don't have to get used to it, you've just chosen to locate yourself in
regions that have relatively dense populations. Part of this is standard
market mechanisms at work. Many of the most desirable places to live are
heavily populated, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere. Nonetheless,
there are VAST tracts of usable land that are essentially uninhabited, even
in countries that are nominally highly developed. Quite frankly, in the
Western Hemisphere it seems that many undesirable places have huge
populations and many desirable places have less than a person per square
mile population density; there are many factors at play as to why people
concentrate where they do.
I think a lot of the concern about overpopulation is based largely on
perception. It isn't so much that we are over populated as it is that the
population is very poorly and/or unevenly distributed, due to a mixture of
historical, political, and economic reasons. There are still large regions
of the United States where one can drive a hundred kilometers between
houses, never mind towns, particularly west of the Rocky Mountains in the
Lower 48 and in Alaska. The same is true of most of Canada.

So I guess the answer is rather simple: if you don't like it, move! There 
are plenty of other places to go. James Rogers' response was also an amazing 
help - he summed up my particular problem so precisely, that it made me 
think about how many other people shared this attitude and why.
So for me, this exchange triggered a lot of ideas about information & 
education. I think most common (mis)conceptions about any issue spread so 
quickly because people are relying only on the basic common "knowledge" they 
receive from the outside world or society. This information usually tends to 
be distorted by social & political forces or it can be warped by the source 
trying to condense the general matter at hand into a bite-sized portion 
which the average person can digest quickly & easily. I guess picking apart 
my own immediate response made me think about where these ideas come from, 
the sources of misinformation, how they're socially considered to be the 
ultimate authorities on such issues. So then most ordinary people might not 
know what the hell is really going on at all, but they might be the ones 
making important decisions - kinda scary. Theres really so much involved 
with this one so I won't babble on about it anymore right here.
I did have a point, so let me just stop my head from spinning - I guess its 
just this: People commonly form opinions on issues about which they know 
nothing (or very little).  But I think that with an open & eager mind (along 
with a credible source of information & some encouragement), even the most 
uneducated individuals can attain substantial understanding of the general 
issue at hand as well as the various perspectives from which it can be 
evaluated.  With time & effort, I think such people can, at the very least, 
come to value the importance of being informed. I mean, if  even *I* can do 
itperhaps there might be hope(?)
Anyhow, thank you all again

out that paper yet so you may be hearing from me soon on this again :P

Anyone who is concerned about this world being overpopulated should
pay a visit to John Grigg in Anchorage.  Then drive up to Fairbanks.
Then loop back.  That tour will put your worried mind at ease.
Especially when you realize that on your weeklong drive you just saw the
bottom half of that vast state.  Then you realize that the commies have
all of Siberia, which is still more vast and even less populated.  There
are *plenty* of lonely places left on this big planet.  spike

(I'm crossposting this from CryoNet as I think it is relevant to a recent 
discussion here).

Despite the fact that I have largely turned away from the cryonics field 
after the demise of Kryos Biomedical, I still read CryoNet, and I still 
find myself shaking my head in both disgust and regret for what could have 
been (and maybe...just maybe could still be) a promising industry.

It need not be said here that Trygve is a kook.  A loon.  Someone with a 
skewered sense of reality, but yet, like many kooks and loons before him, 
he has to inflict his looniness on all those around him.  And in his case, 
it is cryonics itself.

When an esoteric industry such as cryonics gets *any* amount of bad press 
whatsoever, people in general form opinions that are unfortunately, for the 
most part true.  By having loons create press releases such as this, I 
can't help but wonder if cryonics will ever get a single iota of 
credibility in the eyes of the scientific community and in society in 
general.  Part of the reason I am no longer involved in cryonics is because 
I think the answer is "no."  And that is just really too bad.

Trygve, no doubt, will read this and say: "What's wrong with what I'm 
doing?" thinking that he is actually helping things progress.  I think 
Shakespeare put it best: "O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown."

Dickey, Michael F
> Would the universe be curved in the absence of matter?

John Archibald Wheeler and Ignazio Ciufolini [1] 
D.W. Sciama [2] and D.J. Raine [3] pointed out that 
no solution of Einstein's field equation can give a 
reasonable account (i.e. of inertia) if the geometry 
nowhere displays an identifiable _center of mass_. 
That's because without _other_ masses there is no way 
to measure distances (and no way to define inertia).

But (ref. [1], p. 297] these days to think of material 
masses as the ultimate primordial entity and space-time 
geometry as derivative (from those masses) is wrong. 

Space-time geometry, in and by itself, defines the location 
of the mass, its velocity, its acceleration, the local 
inertial frame, and therefore its inertia.

Thus there are models of 'empty' universes (just the mass-energy 
of gravitational waves) in which, in example, there is gravitation
and also inertia (the Taub model [4]).

Thanks, Samantha! Glad you liked it (and I'll pass this along to my two
crypto-collaborators--in fact one of them, Barbara Lamar, just read it over
my shoulder, having flown in to Melbourne this morning...).

Cheers, Damien

Yes Vanessa precisely.  The first step of being an extropian
or transhumanist is to understand the degree to which the
fabric of "reality" may have been hidden from oneself.

While from time to time we may get dragged into the discussions
of the "soft" reality (e.g. economics or politics), there are
many of us who would seek out the relative certainty of current
physical laws.

It is perhaps important to develop a personal Shermer's scale of
skepticism with regard to any concept presented in our discussions.
I have only suggested that those same technologies that allow lifespan
extension also allow the elimination of the "classical" overpopulation
concerns.  (I.e. robust bio- and nano-technologies).  In fact for
those who have really studied the problem and technologies it seems
likely that solutions to the over-population problems may be developed
before solutions to the aging population problem.

Carpe diem!
Robert

       I was having thoughts along the same line. The report did state that 
the bodies were in a 'crypt'. Whether this is purely metaphorical or if 
indeed they are in an actual crypt. (not sure if there really is a 
difference). surely, if they crypt were underground, they can be considered

if they argued that bodies could not be frozen. Do they ensure that bodies in

It all depends on how you view transhumanism. If transhumanism is just
the name for the set of ideas people in the transhumanist community (or
the name for the community itself), then there is no core and hence no
way to tell if something is good or bad for transhumanism - there is
simply no way of evaluating it. But if you take the position that there
is a core transhumanist ideology (as I have done in my past posts on the
philosophy of transhumanism) then there is definitely room for doing
such an evaluation and then acting on it.

Never underestimate the human need for context. The all-encompassing
visions brought by Christianity, the scientific worldview and Marxism
all caught the imagination of billions, even when many of their ideas
were both inapplicable or dangerous in everyday life.

Yes. Neither did any other ideological movement in history. But what
distinguishes those that became successful from the unsuccessful ones is
that the successful ones found a core identity (or identities) from
which to build their worldview, morals and policies. As long as
transhumanism is regarded as what transhumanists think, then it is not a
particularly useful movement. But as soon as it starts to form a
coherent system of thought, an approach to life, then it really can
produce useful ideas and solutions. 

This is why I am serious about building a transhumanism based on our
renaissance and enlightenment humanist roots, updating them into the
current situation.

With "these things" I guess you mean future changes of the human
condition, what these changes might be and whether they are desirable or
not? Clearly one appeal to us and many others is just the intellectual
appeal. There is also the practical appeal (can I get a better life? can
I avoid dangers?) and the philosophical/"spiritual" appeal (human nature
and human destiny have always fascinated). These cover a lot of ground.
Extending the appeal right now is more about making people see that our
perspectives are a valid point of view and not just some rantings from
the fringe that can be safely ignored. We want to expand the range of
possible opinion in the current mainstream discussion.

Yes, this is going on all the time around us. It is usually easier to
see when it is a position you disagree with, but it is equally true for
many positions oneself take for granted. This is why there are such
problems changing the positions of certain people about some things -
they are trapped in self-reinforcing perspectives. But as you show, it
is possible to get out of them too.

Very good advice to all of us. 

Maybe we should have a "question the obvious week" from time to time,
when we take something we tend to take for granted and examine it
closely for a week, seeing if it really is so or if we have just been
trapped into a biased perspective.

I would like to add a further thing to do: write!

Write letters to the editor of your local newspaper. Write articles
for the papers. Write academic papers and get them published. Write
books. Write novels, screeplays and comics. Write!

What we need is to both spread the awareness that our position exists
and is a valid position, and to refine it. Writing is a great way of
doing both. We really need well thought out essays on the things we
discuss here, both for outsiders to read and for our own sake -
having to explain a line of thought often forces us to refine it,
find further support and leads to the discovery of new implications.
It becomes easier to refer to transhumanist ideas, and a corpus of
text that newbies can read and critics comment upon (rather than just
their impression of what we are). It might seem that compared to
coming up with new radical technologies (or rearing children and
other worthy endeavours) writing about our ideas is a lightweight
activity. But if you do great things and nobody learns about them,
how much do these things matter to humanity at large?

Many of the greatest scientists of history were prolific writers not
just about their own subjects but also about their relationship with
the world. That really helped their supporters debate them as
necessary - Darwin was not much of a public speaker, but his support
helped Huxley defend evolution in public. 

Division of labour is good, but I have a hard time imagining that our
community is nearly entirely composed of active researchers and
engineers building transhuman stuff with no time to spare.

Hmm, have you ever participated in a discussion of politicial
ideology with real politicians? Then you will see that in many cases
political ideologies have a very real component of practical attepts
to shape the lives of common people (when politicians become cynical
pragmatists they drop the ideology and just shape society anyway). In
fact, I would say that compared to socialism, environmentalism or
conservatism, transhumanism appears so far to be an enormously more
"pure words" ideology than any of them.

Gives a nice sense of closure. I reall think that card game can

"Problem's" are different across domains, and techniques to e.g. mend
a car might are different from techniques e.g. to console someone in a
relationship breakdown.

But give the generality of the term "problems" I do think that DIAGNOSIS
has a direct linear relationship to the complexity of the problem
(and sub-problems). Solving the problem, putting the diagnosis into effect,
is another matter. Using the example of traditional acupuncture diagnosis,
if you have a perfect diagnosis (pulses information &c. &c) then the
decision
where to place needle(s) is relatively simple.

> Do you really think there is a simple cause behind poverty, crime or

I think that poverty may be a more structural problem than crime & racism,
both of which seem psychology rather than resource-based. Even if we
could use mass hypnosis to 'solve' these problems, there are ethical
questions whether we should .....

By the way, I am slightly worried by the implied arrogance in many
extro-postings, why Transhumanism VERSUS humanity? I think that
many ordinary folks are better and more useful than some
jumped-up extropians.

As a posthuman I try very hard not to reveal too much of my superiority
over 'mere' fledgling transhumans! (In jest .....)

I find this situation amusing.  Sending a human to do a machine's work.
How one-dimensional the list has become..

A procedure for implementing a move to maximize the number of posts per
time unit to some arbitrary number (e.g. 6/day) would be to hold the
subsequent entries in the queue for the next.

A line could be added to the end of each entry stating the number of
additional entries in the queue.

The old extropians mailing list had related functionality, if memory serves.

Back when I was a chemistry goober, we had a discussion with the professor
about this very thing.  The problem with D2O as it relates to living
organisms is that it has slightly different reaction energies in the various
processes that water is normally a part of.  For many of these chemical
processes the difference in reaction energies is below the noise floor, but
for some processes it actually inhibits the normal process pathways.  Too
much D2O in the body and these process failures add up.

I suppose one could look at it as a very unusual form of clinical
dehydration.

Hi Samantha,

I have nothing in particular against your post - except to point out the
misattribution, since the part you replied to was already double-quoted
and in fact was written by Eugene, not by myself. See my original post for
my reply to Eugene's comment.

1.  You must get from low speeds (less than c) to high speeds (faster than
c) wihtout ever passing through a medium speed (exactly c).  At exactly the
speed of light, there is a singularity.  (Unlike the extropian use of the
word "singularity", a mathematical "singularity" implies a situation that is
impossible.)

2.  Matter travelling faster than light would have a negative time length.
In other words, it must be travelling backwards in time.  (Most people don't
see this as a problem, they see it as a benefit.  The problem is that since
we have never observed anything going backwards in time, we don't know if
that is possible.)

3.  Matter travelling faster than light would have to have imaginary mass.
(Imaginary as in the square root of minus one.)  This implies that matter
travelling faster than light isn't even the same kind of matter that travels
slower than light.  So even if faster than light matter is a possibility, it
may be impossible to change slow matter into fast matter.

I agree with you regarding Bauge's deleterious effect on cryonics.
However, I feel I must warn you about how you describe Bauge.  He does

expressed extreme dislike of being described as you have described
him... I think I will leave it there.....

John, thanks for your efforts in bringing people together :-) But there are in fact now much more 
women on the PosthumanLounge mailinglist than there were in the beginning. The list continues 
to have new subscribers (men and women), nobody unsubscribes and the list has 68 members 
now. But the reason it didn't took off so far, IMHO, there is almost no conversation going on :-(
It's like in a real lounge: The people who know each other already from another forum 
immediately chat, but the new people (and this is where the most women are) feel maybe they 
should stand in the dark and listen for a while.

In my welcome message to the PosthumanLounge I say that it's important in order to meet 
someone on a mailinglist you need to post at least a join post, telling about your likes and 
dislikes, what you're looking for in a person you'd like to meet etc. Since PosthumanLounge is 
not a list with strictly enforced rules, nobody is of course required to post a join message.

The PosthumanLounge mailinglist is not another discussion list, but it is here for conversations.

Your post, John, has made it clear to me that I need to try to involve the women on 
PosthumanLounge in a conversation. Thanks.

 But I thought it was interesting how everyone's (false) perceptions

population "problems." So then I started to think about what specific things
made me think there was a population problem to begin with - <snip various
causes>
. But the most basic thing (which totally eluded me) is that many people
actually choose to live & gather in densely populated areas.

This is clearly true, once you think about it. So one question is why are
people not aware of this? I suspect one reason is the immense ignorance of
geography that you find these days. I suspect another reason, particularly
in places like N.America, is that people do so much travelling by flying.
This gives you a distorted impression of both the size of the world and of
how much of it is effectively empty. If you go on the Trans Siberian you
soon realise there are huge amounts of MAMBA country (Miles And Miles of
Bugger All). Steve Davies

So I guess the answer is rather simple: if you don't like it, move! There
are plenty of other places to go.

This is the other question - why don't they? I suppose there are many
reasons but surely the principal factor is economics - the densely populated
parts of the planet are where jobs (and hence income) are to be found, as
well as many other services which require not just a lot of people but high
density. Steve D.

Fully aware of these already. The Alcubierre warp drive is not a local
violation of light speed (that is why it has to warp space around it),
but even then, there are distinct limitations on the real potential of
the warp drive. Current thinking is that you won't be able to warp much
more than a few atoms worth of space using this method.

However, a point I left out is that one need not meet or exceed light
speed for the universe to become one's oyster. One only needs to be able
to accelerate to 90%+ of light speed at some significant fraction of a G
(say, 0.1 G or more) in order to be able to travel to any point within a
good section of our local region of the universe (Milky Way and it's
satellite galaxies) within a human life span. There is no real need for
exotic physics beyond this need for relatively high acceleration rates
(i.e. where ion drives accelerate at thousanths of G's). With cryonic
suspension, nanotech, and practical immortality, the entire universe is
our oyster, and with such technologies, even ion propulsion and other
low G technologies for propulsion are useful for interstellar travel.

I agree that Koch's Postulates are a very good logical method, but I didn't
say they were "rules of logic". I said they were the application of logic to
the problem of determining whether a disease is caused by an infectious
agent or not.

I would argue otherwise for one main reason. In this case the abandonment of
satisfying Koch's postulates in favor of what replaced it does mark a
dividing line. Actual molecular isolation of a candidate virus was attempted
and it failed [Note A]; it was abandoned in favor of finding surrogate
markers like proteins that are said to be specific to HIV.  I would argue
this is not so much a difference in degree, as in proving something to a 95%
level instead of 99%. But instead a categorical difference with more
significance.

It is significant because the evidence cited by Gallo and Montagnier in
place of Koch's Postulates is not nearly rigorous enough to distinguish
between proteins that indicate infection by a common virus, and proteins
that are elicited by the body itself in response to stress or the lab
procedures involved.[Note B]

All of the proteins [and other markers] used as surrogates for molecular
isolation, which are supposedly specific to HIV, are not specific to
HIV.[11]

The proteins detected by the "HIV" test have never been shown conclusively
to be components of a viral antibody, or to be associated specifically with
the cause of anything, as opposed to a possible effect.

This is the heart of the Perth Groups argument with the claims of "HIV
isolation."

Despite all the sophisticated biotechnology and vast investment in virology,
the best evidence for HIV is only by correlation with antibodies present
against it. Or, as stated by the leading English AIDS scientist Robin Weiss
and the CDC's Harold Jaffe, "the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is
epidemiological and virological, not molecular." Gallo emphasizes that point
in his book. He derides Koch's Postulates as outdated. His replacement? He
declares correlation to be "one hell of a good beginning."

And so it can be. But a problem for this method has always been that
correlation does not prove causation.

The time-honored method of avoiding the pitfalls of correlation was to
isolate the candidate virus from the blood of sick patients. Extract
proteins and genetic material from this pure isolate. Re-infect new host
cells, see multiplication of the original viral particles, as confirmed by
re-isolation and redetection of the proteins and genetic material previously
extracted from the candidate.

We abandon Koch's Postulates at our peril. As you are probably aware, they
were adopted due to constant false claims by microbe hunters that they had
found microbes causing diseases. Many of the diseases in question turned out
to be non-infectious, such as scurvy, beriberi, and pellagra, which are all
vitamin deficiency diseases. A more recent example of ignoring Koch's
Postulates was the Japanese "SMON disease", thought throughout the 1960's
and 70's to be caused by a virus, and which was later found to be caused by
a specific medication, clioquinol.

In the mid 1970s Gallo claimed to have discovered the first human retrovirus
in patients with leukemia. He claimed his data proved the existence of a
retrovirus which he called HL23V.[6,7] Now, just as he would later do for
HIV, Gallo used antibody reactions to "prove" which proteins in the cultures
were viral proteins. However, a few years after that these same antibodies
were shown to occur naturally and be directed against many substances that
had nothing to do with retroviruses.[8,9] When the antibodies were shown to
be non-specific, HL23V disappeared.  It was realized that HL23V was a big
mistake. There was no HL23V retrovirus. So the Gallo data turned out to be
an embarrassment and HL23V is now extinct. What's interesting for us though
is that the evidence used to claim proof of the existence of HL23V is the
same kind of evidence said to prove the existence of HIV. In fact the
evidence for HL23V was better than HIV. [Note D]

If you think a certain marker indicates infection by a deadly virus, you
will make different deductions and develop different treatments than if you
think a certain marker is elicited by the body itself in response to stress
or the lab procedures involved.

If a disease [or syndrome] is not caused by a virus, then anti-viral therapy
will not be helpful, and may in fact be counterproductive or toxic.

[Notes]
------------------------------------------------------------
[A] Montagnier and his team at the Pasteur Institute tried to get a pure
isolate of his candidate virus. However, despite "Roman effort", they could
see no particles with "morphology typical of retroviruses. I repeat we did
not purify..." [1]


[B] In their papers on isolation, Gallo and Montagnier cite 3 lines of
evidence: detection of reverse transcription activity, detection of
retroviral-like particles in cell cultures, and antibody reactions.

However, reverse transcription activity is not unique to retroviruses, and
in fact RT activity in normal cells is promoted by the very conditions which
Montagnier and Gallo subjected their patients' T-cells to.[2] Therefore,
detection of RT activity in these cultures was not proof that there was a
retrovirus present.

Secondly, Gallo and Montagnier offered as evidence photographs of particles
in impure cell cultures and asserted that not only were they retroviruses,
but they were a specific retrovirus, "HIV." However, as even Gallo
admits,[3] retroviral-like particles that are not infectious are common in
cultures, especially those subjected to the conditions that Gallo and
Montagnier used in order to cultivate "HIV." Pointing to particles in impure
cell cultures that are viral-like was hardly proof that those particles were
a retrovirus, let alone a specific retrovirus, "HIV."

Thirdly, Gallo and Montagnier offered antibody reactions as proof of
isolation of their virus from AIDS patients. They identified certain
proteins in these cultures as "HIV proteins." This was done not by
extracting those proteins from the viral isolate, because there was no viral
isolate. They had a soup containing a few virus-like objects and a lot of
contaminating cellular debris. To decide which proteins extracted from this
mix were from the virus-like objects, they exposed the proteins to blood
samples from both AIDS patients and non-AIDS patients. If a protein caused
an antibody response from an AIDS patient, and no antibody response from a
non-AIDS patient, they said that one was an "HIV protein." These proteins
were then used in the antibody and Western Blot tests. A Positive result is
interpreted as indicating the presence of "HIV antibodies."

However, antibodies cross-react, and AIDS patients have a much higher level
of circulating antibodies than in normal, healthy individuals. Thus AIDS
patients were likely to have antibody cross-reactions with any given protein
more often than non-AIDS patients. Also, false positives may be caused by
vaccinations against other diseases or current or past diseases.[4]
Moreover, antibodies can be raised against a non-viral protein, e.g. that of
endogenous nature (arising from within, not from infection).[Note C]
Identification of certain proteins as "HIV proteins," simply because they
reacted with antibodies of AIDS patients and not non-AIDS patients was
insufficient proof that these proteins were actually from a new virus, "HIV.

[C] Normal human DNA contains retroviral information which did not get there
following a retroviral infection. The cell was born with it.[5]  So amongst
all our DNA there are stretches made up of some retroviral information and
that may sit there maybe all your life until something happens. The DNA
starts to make RNA and hence proteins, and this may go even further and lead
to the assembly of endogenous retroviral particles. They're called
endogenous because they're not something that got in from the outside. Like
HIV is supposed to. Something that gets in from the outside is called
exogenous. Long before the AIDS era everyone knew that in animal cells
endogenous retrovirus production could occur spontaneously. You make a cell
culture and do nothing else. Just leave it on the bench for a few days or
maybe a few weeks and then one day it starts to produce retroviral-like
particles. They seemingly come out of nowhere and the process can be
significantly accelerated and the yield of particles increased, sometimes
millions of times, by conditions which induce cellular activation, the same
conditions which are obligatory to obtain what is called HIV from cell
cultures.

Up until 1993, neither Gallo nor Fauci who is another well-known HIV
researcher,  accepted that humans contain the DNA to make endogenous
retroviruses but now it's accepted that endogenous retroviral DNA forms
about 1% of human DNA. That's about 3,000 times larger that what the experts
claim is the size of the HIV genome. And what's more, new retroviral genomes
can arise by rearrangements and recombination of existing retroviral
genomes. Furthermore, endogenously produced retroviruses are morphologically
and biochemically indistinguishable from exogenous retroviruses.

[D] In fact, the evidence for the "isolation" of HL23V surpassed that of
HTLV-I and HIV in at least two aspects. Unlike HIV, Gallo's group: (a)
reported the detection of reverse transcriptase activity in fresh,
uncultured leucocytes; (b) published an electron micrograph of virus-like
particles banding at a sucrose density of 1.16 gm/ml, the density which
defines retroviral particles. Following the discovery of HL23V, some
researchers attempted to determine its prevalence utilizing antibody tests
while others were interested to determine the specificity of the antibody
reactions. The latter included one group from the Laboratory of Cellular and
Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute and another from the Laboratory
of Viral Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Using the "viral
glycoproteins", these groups; found that the antibodies present in human
sera which reacted with these proteins were "directed against carbohydrate
structures" and concluded that "The results are consistent with the idea
that the antibodies in question are elicited as a result of exposure to many
natural substances possessing widely cross-reacting antigens and are not a
result of widespread infection of man with replication competent
oncoviruses" (retroviruses). In 1981 Gallo accepted the evidence that the
antibodies, which reacted with the presumed viral proteins of HL23V, were
not so directed "but against the carbohydrate moieties on the molecule that
are introduced by the host cell as a post-transcriptional event, and which
are therefore cell-specific and not virus-specific." [10]  This discovery
was of such significance that today nobody, not even Gallo considers HL23V
as being the first human retrovirus, or even a retrovirus.

When pi is no longer equal to that ratio, how does pi deserve to be
called pi? Pi is defined as that ratio, ergo its value is relative to
the local time space curvature.

Yet the universe's expansion is a process of constant flattening of
space time, ergo the local value of pi is constantly changing along an
asymptotic curve (if the universe is closed) or along a hyperbolic curve
(if the universe is open).

s it would have been based on a physical measurement, your "already known curvature."  But Carl did not write that.  Had he picked that one, it still would not have worked because the message appears "kilometers downstream of the decimal point" which mean
s the measurement would require at lest several hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude in resolution.  The whole Universe has less than 200 orders of magnitude from top to bottom.  (By the way, we know pi to over 200 billion places which, if you wro
te down on paper at 4 mm per digit, would run over 800,000 km.  Long enough to go from the earth to the moon and back.)

Distinguishing between flatspace mathematics and curved space reality
does resolve the dillemma, but it is STILL based on a flat space model,
in that such a model does not work in all six classes of M-space.

I believe this is part of it (although ignorance of geography might play
a lesser part of it than biased examples). Another part is that
overpopulation fits into a "big narrative" (warning: postmodern concept,
use with caution!) where it ties in with a lot of other memes: the idea
that resources are always scarce, the idea that the end is coming soon,
various older but pernicious ideas that the "underclass" is breeding
like rabbits (Malthus was not a particularly humanitarian person, and he
has some rather unsavory followers), the eco-ideological story that
humans are not following the natural ways and hence doomed to an
ecological disaster and so on. The whole list of memes that tie in with
the overpopulation meme is very long, and quite unpleasant if you start
looking at where some of the ideas come from. But they form a kind of
self-reinforcing, quite strong structure that can be really hard to
overturn. 

The new issues in population - the gradual decline of birth numbers, the
greying of population, population declines in some nations, migrations
and migration barriers - do not fit into this framework and are hence
ignored. This can be rather risky since even if overpopulation per se is
not the problem to watch for there are several other nasty issues we
better find ways of dealing with:

http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/Demo_Trends_For_Web.pdf

That report contains a lot of data to think about when envisioning the
near future for us - a lot of these factors are going to affect our
transcension. Just think about the consequences of a Japan and Europe
economically weakened by an elderly population and possibly more
conservative and insular, but still likely interested in cost-saving
medicine, youth bulges combined with high tech and the effects when
large populations make the transition from traditional economies into
the global economy. Lots of things to think about.

As Marx (!) put it, the city saves us from the idiocy of the rural
lands. There are many economies of scale with cities, and hence they can
provide many things impossible to find elsewhere (Shops with equipment
for left handed people! Operas! Variety of restaurants!). Maybe advanced
telecommunications and telepresence can make people move out of the
cities, but I doubt it. A more likely way would be super efficient and
fast commuting. 

But of course, seeing cities as *problems* is another part of the
overpopulation narrative. We should do our best to get away from the
diseconomies of scale that plague many megacities, but cities themselves
are wonderful things (Venice, Stockholm and New York are *artworks*!).
Spreading people out would not just remove complexity from our culture,
it would also remove much wilderness.

Because it has nothing to do with absolutes, and more to do with
psychwar techniques of programming ones subjects to believe that they
are not worthy of individual liberty, of self determination. Techniques
such as these have been used by priests and politicians for millenia to
con people into surrendering to authoritarian power structures.

Today's liberal politicans (and the non-evangelical protestant priests)
convince the voters that the average yokel can't be trusted with his/her
own money, firearms, morals, or private property, while religious right
wingers convince the voters that women can't be trusted with their
ovaries, that people can't be trusted with free speech, computers,
pictures of naked women, etc.

The easiest way to convince people of this is to 'prove' that the
average person's thinking is 'low grade', 'primitive', even 'beastial'
and needs to be restrained from their natural inclinations by force.

When you've been programmed to be your own best prison warden, what need
is there of real iron bars?

I believe somebody already mentioned on this topic that pi is generally 
defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter in 
Euclidean geometry.  Because of Euclid's fifth postulate (1) space is never 
curved in Euclidean geometry, though, so though pi is defined by the ratio, 
that doesn't really matter here.


1:  If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the 
sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the 
two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far 
enough.

At the same time that Scotland Yard and the Canadian Ministry of Justice
both report extremely high double digit increases in various violent
crimes in their gun banned countries. Gun related homicides in London
alone went up 85% in the last year.

Of course, the originator of Koch's postulates actually knew better than
to insist they were always applied.  He couldn't purify mycobacterium
tuberculosis to anything like current standards.  He couldn't infect people
with it either.   Nonetheless, he correctly realized he had found the 
causative agent of tuberculosis, albeit with far less evidence than we
have for HIV -> AIDS.

Koch would be horrified at the claim that because we can only purify
HIV to moderate purity means it doesn't cause AIDS.  Talk about a 
nonsequitur.

I wouldn't be so hard on Trygve myself: at least in the US, support by
loonies actually increases the acceptance of things by the public, if
not by the scientific community--but who cares about them anyway?  It's
public acceptance that will get the money flowing, and scientists will
change their tune when research grants are involved.

By I /would/ like to have seen a press release along these lines:
"The French, who, like many Europeans, look down their nose at us
primitive Americans because we still execute criminals, is about to
destroy two of its innocent citizens..."

Using high tech experiments, the research team 
led by Professor Colin Humphreys - a renowned 
expert in material science - has been able to 
calculate the kinetic energy, centrifugal force 
and co-efficient of friction for various kinds 
of pasta - and to come up with the best way of 
eating pasta.

Together with fellow researchers from the Cambridge 
University's Department of Materials Science and 
Metallurgy - Nikhil Sharma, Alex Bright and Cornelia 
Schonjahn - the team has also studied average 
distribution patterns of pasta sauce under
various common dining conditions by examining 
the patterns left on white tablecloths.

Detailed studies have revealed that, under laboratory
conditions, droplets of pasta sauce can travel as far 
as four feet in all directions during the course of 
an average meal.

The risk of sauce splatter is at its greatest just as 
the last eleven centimetres of Spaghetti are being 
rolled onto the fork. A final reckless flick of the wrist 
can easily accelerate the speed of the Spaghetti tip to 
over nine feet per second, producing enough centrifugal 
force to enable the pasta sauce to achieve escape 
velocity with deadly consequences.

Initial results also suggest that the spread and 
direction taken by the sauce is affected by the 
shape of the pasta. For instance, long thin, pasta 
shapes such as spaghetti and Linguine have the potential 
to produce the greatest spread of sauce, because they 
have a high surface area to volume ratio, enabling each 
strand to travel onto the fork at a comparatively high
terminal velocity. [May I add that Bucatini are much
more dangerous than Linguine? s.]

Shorter, broader pasta ribbons such as Tagliatelle and 
Pappardelle have a lower splatter risk factor because 
the same angular speed of the rotating fork results in 
lower velocities of sauce droplets since the distance 
between the centre of rotation (the fork) and a sauce 
droplet is smaller. Safest pastas of all are the huge 
variety of small, compact shapes such as penne, pasta 
shells, Sacchetini [? Cambridge speciality ?] and 
Tricolour Trompetti [???] which produce only a 
comparatively small splatter pattern because
many contain fillings and are often eaten whole.

So distinct are the differences in splatter patterns 
between pastas that, with further study, it may be 
even be possible to predict which pasta was being eaten, 
merely by looking at the splatter pattern produced.

The viscosity of each pasta sauce is also a major 
contributor to splatter pattern. Thick Italian 
cheese sauces as well as cream-based sauces such 
as wild mushroom and Carbonara sauce have high 
levels of viscosity. This means that a larger force
is required to separate sauce droplets, hence the 
likelihood of droplet separation is decreased for 
high viscosity sauces and these will be less spatter.

Lighter tomato-based sauces, such as Bolognese sauce, 
Tomato, Parmesan and Dill, or Tomato and Tuna sauce, 
however, have low viscosity levels, and easily shaken 
free - thereby explaining one of the greatest mysteries 
of eating pastas: why are the splatter marks always red?

[May I add those Bucatini alla Amatriciana, Tomato &
Bacon sauce, really shooting killers]

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Re Richard Steven Hack's
(richardhack@pcmagic.net)detailed analysis of my
earlier posting:

There are some good reasons to preserve the concept of
"rights."  For one, how is it that you define
"coercion" in practice.  First, you have to know who
owns what - right???

If we both claim something as personal, exclusive
property, then either we are both right and justified
in our claim, in which case there is a defect in the
ethical formulation of the concept of property, or one
or both of us is wrong.  How do you make that
determination without something equivalent to the
concept of "rights?"

As I discussed, a more precise formulation of "rights"
involves the use of "ethical," rather than simply
"moral" sanction.  I forgot momentarilly that this
itself involves problems, due to the language
ambiguities.

An "ethics" can be pretty much completely divorced from morality.  When you read that a dentist subscribes to the ethical standards set forth by the American Dental Society, all you really know is just that.  This really tells you nothing about the honesty of that dentist.  Various professional societies have statements defining their ethical code, but I doubt that many of them actually try to define what the moral grounding is or make any claims in that realm.

Thus, "moral" is true of a sanction specified by a
genuine "right," while "ethical" might not be, depending upon what one means by "ethics." Moral, however, is too broad.  You have to include an ethical context in order to sort out complex rights, so let's make a stab at it with "morally sound" ethics, since there doesn't seem to be a single term that really suffices.  "Morally grounded" might be another option, I suppose. Perhaps we need to invent a new term.

So, when I claim that your high-rise violates my
property rights because it cuts off my view of the
beach - or the sun - now we can refer to a rationally
specified methodology and a set of standards by which
to evaluate our competing claims.  Then we can
determine who is violating whose rights.  Simply
asking who is coercing really does not address the
issues that still have to be resolved.  In fact, it begs the question, as you can't tell who is coercing until you make a more extended analysis of the property "rights" involved.

Rights can be violated without coercion, simply by accident.  In fact, whether coercion, in the sense that it is normally used - an initiation of force or a substitute for force, is used or not may play a major role in determining how to deal with someone who has violated your rights, from a security point of view or from a moral analysis, but in another sense, it doesn't matter.  

Whether your rights were violated by the initiation of force or by accident or ignorance or negligence, the important facts are: 1. what are your losses, 2. who caused them, 3. how can you recover damages to return you to where you were, or, 4. failing that, how can you minimize similar losses in the future.

The state positive law, with its overwhelming bias towards hurting or killing anyone who violates its edicts, has so distorted our conception of justice that even the Catholics(!), with their "heaven or hell" paradigm are backing these restitution/reconciliation programs as a replacement for punitive action against offenders.  

We, as rational individuals (I hope), need to clear our minds of this sickness.  It shouldn't rationally matter to us if someone who caused us damages is suffering in hell or some federal surrogate or partying in Vegas.  It shouldn't matter especially WHY they caused us damage, except as it relates to future possible occurrences.  Right??  What matters is that things are set right for us, the victims.

>From that perspective, the issue of coercion or accident as a cause of damages palls to relative insignificance.  Again, what matters is fundamentally JUSTICE.  When we can depend upon justice, then we don't need vengence or war.  This has been expressed in many different ways, in fact: "Where there is no justice, there can be no peace." or, "To achieve peace, seek justice." etc.

But if coercion, as such, is pretty much irrelevant - or should be, then what happens to "the libertarian axiom"?

True, as you pointed out, prior contract is so very,
very helpful - especially, as I have promoted for some
time, a general social contract that specifies the
ground rules by which we will peacefully settle
disputes.  However, there are always the cases that go
outside the contracts realm - as should be obvious
when you ask yourself the question: What supports the
contract's validity itself?

(As an aside, many libertarians - Wendy McElroy being
a noted example, have defended the "right to lie."
But if you have a "right" to lie, then you can be
lieing about agreeing to any contract, right?  So what
good is any contract if that is in fact a right, an
sich?  And without contracts, how can we make any
long-term plans involving other people?)

The ultimate validity of a contract comes from an
analysis grounded in reality independent of the
contract.  Similar to "rights," we have to have the
ability to start from morality - the analysis of
values - and then extend that to an analysis and
formulation of principles that define in abstract and thus describe how to define in particular concrete
cases how to implement these values via ethical
constraints that can be translated into claims of
rights bound up in such a contract.

I do find your insistence about the lack of real
lifeboat situations to really smell of religion.
Libertarians went down a seriously invalid and
self-defeating path when Jarret Wollstein made his
famous speach at the Ist Southern Libertarian
Conference in '71 on the "libertarian ethic."  (Which
was really too bad, after his great start in promoting
anarcho-capitalism with his "Public Services Under
Laissez Faire.)  

Ethics is derived from morality, not the reverse.  When you try to reverse epistemological hierarchy, you inevitably find yourself in a religious, not a rational position of trying to live by a non-sequitor.

Then you find luminaries who ought to know better - eg., Don Ernsberger at one of Dagny Sharron's conferences saying that "yes, it is immoral for me to prevent my child from drinking poison (playing in the traffic, etc.), but I do it anyway."  So what is morality for, rationally speaking, unless it provides a consistent and rational method for analyzing values?  If your morality specifies that you must do something irrational and destructive of your basic values, then OBVIOUSLY your morality is WRONG!

Then of course you can NEVER solve problems like how
to deal with children - biological, or upload babies...

Think about it..

Re the ability to predict patterns in chaotic systems, I actually have several pieces of what I consider really stunning artwork that I created using the Julia Set Explorer plug-in that comes with COREL Paint.  I never "think" about what I'm doing when I'm creating these things - how I know to move to an area of the set and then play with the variables, set the colors, etc., and usually I couldn't replicate it for my life, but most people find them really entrancing.  Some of my better pieces were rendered at 6000 x 6600 pixels, so I can print them out in pieces and end up with a 3' x 3' poster in hi-resolution that seems to go to infinity.

Some people, however, I've noticed, are absolutely unaffected, or even hostile, and can't understand why anyone would like something "wierd" like that.  Other words they use are "psycheadelic" or "groovy" or "trippy," but always as a put-down.

I've often wondered if in fact there is some kind of hard-wired talent that I have and they don't 
for seeing these patterns.  I notice that the same people at work who refer to the chaotic images as garbage are also the ones who want every item in a sales flyer or a web page that I might be producing for the company - box, photo, table, text block - to line up perfectly in neat little orthogonal rows, regardless of how much violence it does to readability or visual balance.  I've gotten really tired of seeing really nice graphic designs totally trashed by them.

Ok, then, perhaps a rephrase: transhumanism includes an element where
people other than those who control vast amounts of power anyway
(high-level politicians and corporate executives) stand a good chance of
significantly impacting society.

Alternately, consider: "how the common man really lives" - society
shaping is well and good at the grand level, but how are you and I
directly impacted by the decision of, say, whether or not to drill in
Alaska?  ("Price at the gas pump" - maybe, but the real, short-term
effect there is minimal at best.  "Reduced war" - not a direct effect,
unless you're in the US military or a contractor for them, and even then
not much when you average the few who participate in, say, Afghanistan
over the rest of the armed forces personnel.)  Now compare this to, say,
the impact of a simple, open-source AI that could get rid of most of the
spam in your inbox, or of a company with actual (flying) spacecraft that
offered any-major-airport-to-any-major-airport in one hour service (or
just a trip 'round the Earth in one and a half hours) for $20K or so a
pop, or of an uploading service to transfer consciousnesses from failing
old bodies into androids, or...

We don't have to go through governments, or similar large bearaucracies,
to implement our changes.  Or maybe we will go through them - like a
knife through hot butter.  And this is not the least bit scary to those
used to How It Was?

The MAMBA idea is right, but it is not the *flying* that gives people a
distorted impression, its the *driving*.  Everywhere we drive, there are
other cars, traffic jams, support structure, other people.  But fly over
anywhere and you realize that MAMBA is still the rule, even along the
densely populated US east coast.  Next time you fly down over that,
notice that there is forest and undeveloped land everywhere.

It used to puzzle me that we would hear stories of planes disappearing
and never being found, or found decades later.  But if one flies a
private plane, one realizes there are *plenty* of places one could crash
and never be discovered.  My father was doing his first solo from Titusville
Florida to Pensacola.  He flew for a solid hour over unbroken forest
with not a single sign of civilization.  The engine coughed.  Didn't
sputter, just coughed.  His first thought was that if that engine quit,
he might never be found.

If every square kilometer in the US were given a number, then a number
were chosen at random and one were placed on that square kilometer,
there is a very good chance that the person could not find the nearest
civilization before perishing of hunger or exposure.

Most wild animals on this planet seldom see a human, and even then
only from a considerable distance.  I suspect most wild animals on
this planet have never seen a human.

We have a distorted view of the world because of the fact that we
drive, and everywhere we drive is a road.  Fly over, see how few
roads there are.

Then think: if we built pipes to carry water, and worked out ways to
produce food more efficiently than we do, thru genetically modified
crops for instance, worked out our intraspecies rivalries based on
ridiculous and antiquated superstitions, could we not fill this planet
with advanced humanity, all living in peace and comfort?

Could we not fill the space and use the energy for beings that spend
their lives thinking thinking thinking?  Could we not rise to ever
higher heights?  Imagine a world which contained 10 guys like
Anders Sandberg, 10 guys like Greg Burch, 10 like Amara, 10
like Max.

What could we do with such a world?  What would be out of
our reach?  spike

http://www.nd.edu/~networks/clap/ <http://www.nd.edu/%7Enetworks/clap/>

This is so way cool!  I have been going crazier wondering about
this after a symphony concert I went to a couple weeks ago.  The
St. Petersburg Orchestra was doing Rachmaninov.  Afterwards
the audience was trying to get an encore, and the synchronized
clapping started spontaneously out of a general nonsynchronized
applause.  As it always does, the frequency gradually increased
from about 1.5 hz to about 2.5 hz, at which time it broke up into
chaos.

Questions:  

Why does it always start out at about the same
frequency and break up at about the same frequency?

Is someone leading?  Or is it spontaneous order?

Why is it that it always speeds up?

Suppose you got an audience together and told them you
want to start a round synchronized clapping, but instead of
speeding up, you want to slow down.  Could they do it?  Could
they do it without a leader?  Could they do it with a leader?

What frequency would it break up into chaos?

Has anyone ever tried it?

Does it matter how many people are in the audience?

Does it matter if you started out with a group of musicians?

How about a group of mathematicians?

Lets try this at Extro6.

Title: Subquantum Information and Computation
Authors: <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Valentini_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Antony Valentini</A>

It is argued that immense physical resources - for nonlocal communication, 
espionage, and parallel computation - are hidden from us by a veil of quantum 
noise that is not fundamental, but merely reflects the statistical properties 
of an equilibrium state in which the universe happens to be at the present 
time. It is suggested that 'non-quantum' or nonequilibrium matter might exist 
today in the form of relic particles from the early universe. We describe how 
such matter could be detected and put to practical use. Nonequilibrium matter 
could be used to send instantaneous signals, to violate the uncertainty 
principle, to distinguish non-orthogonal quantum states without disturbing 
them, to eavesdrop on quantum key distribution, and to read all the results 
of a parallel quantum computation. (14kb)

Suppose we were drawing circles on the surface of a big sphere (something like the Earth) with radius S.  Let d be the diameter of such a circle.  The circumference will be  c = 2S pi sin( d / (2S)).  Pi in this formula is the same old 3.14159265... constant
number that is used for ordinary geometry.  Now, as you let S get bigger and bigger, the space gets flatter.  If you let S approach infinity (flat space), or  let d approach zero (tiny circles), the value of sin( d / (2S)) approaches d / (2S).  So, the 2S in
the numerator cancels the 2S in the denominator, and you get the usual c = pi d.  Pi is defined as a constant number, like 3 or 4, and it pops up all over math, not just in circles.

The sound of many hands clapping
Z. Neda, E. Ravasz, Y. Brechet, T. Vicsek, A.L. Barabasi
Nature, vo. 403, pp. 849 (2000)

We report on a series of measurements aimed to characterize 
the development and the dynamics of the rhythmic applause 
in concert halls. Our results demonstrate that while this 
process shares many characteristics of other systems that 
are known to synchronize, it also has features that are 
unexpected and unaccounted for in many other systems. 
In particular, we find that the mechanism lying at the 
heart of the synchronization process is the period doubling 
of the clapping rhythm. The characteristic interplay between 
synchronized and unsynchronized regimes during the applause 
is the result of a frustration in the systems. All results 
are understandable in the framework of the Kuramoto model.

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0006423 

Physics of the rhythmic applause
Z. Neda, E. Ravasz, T. Vicsek, Y. Brechet, A.L. Barabasi
Phys. Rev. E, vol. 61, 6987 (2000)

We discuss in detail a human scale example of the 
synchronization phenomenon, namely the dynamics of the 
rhythmic applause. After a detailed experimental 
investigation, we describe the phenomenon with 
an approach based on the classical Kuramoto model. 
Computer simulations based on the theoretical assumptions, 
reproduce perfectly the observed dynamics. We argue that 
a frustration present in the system is responsible for 
the interesting interplay between synchronized and 
unsynchronized regimes

I sure hope we could fill up much of that space with beings who think think think and wisely act act act. : )

Only ten guys like Anders, Greg, Amara(one of the guys! lol), and Max in this wonderful world?  Why not a million!! : )  I tend to think these folks are very one of a kind, and that the people of the future will not have been shaped in quite the same ways to produce folks very much like these four.  But that is not to say we will see some absolutely incredible people come of age in the future.              

you continue:
What could we do with such a world?  What would be out of
our reach?  
(end)

We could live in peace with each other as humanity matures and spreads out into the universe.  That would be pretty dang amazing!  

I would leave it to Anders, Robert or Eugene to say what is beyond our reach! lol  Perhaps Tipler's Omega Point is beyond us?  Or maybe real trust and a state of peace among all sentient beings in human space?  I don't know.

I first read about this from an Associated Press article in the 
Anchorage News.  Along with the article was a big glossy picture 
of the revelers on parade!  The person in the lead had a mask on 
to portray the dead and frozen man.

I have mixed feelings about this Trygve Bauge inspired event.  It 
will get cryonics in the news, but not in the ideal way to say the 
least!  Some people say cryonicists don't know how to really party, 
but all I can say to that is, "cryonics now has it's own version of the Mardis Gras!" lol  

This is a critical time with the Ventureville community and Timeship 
coming down the pike.  I just hope this does not negatively draw 
away from such momentous projects.      

The really disturbing thought to me is that the frozen French couple 
may face renewed efforts by bureaucrats at burying them due to news 
of this festival.  "See, look at those partying fools in America 
celebrating frozen dead people!"

I suppose Trygve believes in the classic saying "no publicity is 
bad publicity!"  I simply must admit most people in the cryonics 
movement have just the opposite view.  And as we ALL know, Trygve 
is off in his own little world where he is a fullfledged media hound!! 
 As one can learn by reading his recent Cryonet posts, he is quite happy 
with himself over this whole thing. 

I would like to know how the rest of you weigh in on this new little 
celebration.  Will it mainly be harmless, actually do some good, 
or be a damaging mockery to what we are trying to do?

best wishes,

John 

P.S. Hey Trygve, what's wrong with using Alcor or CI to keep your 
grandfather nice and cold??

Are you assuming that thinking beings cannot move at the same time?
Or that they would rather think than move?

Don't thinking beings need/like/want to move? Depending on one's
mode of transportation, you can often think and move at the same time. :-)

For your idea to be a reality, you'd have to transform a car-culture
(or in Italy's case, a scooter-culture) to a better-transportation
culture. People *like* their cars, so much that many use them
in places where cars don't fit and the fuel is outrageously
expensive. Give them easy, independent, and cheap transportation,
that also permits an occasional rush and a buzz, and your
pi(e)-in-the-sky dream might someday be real.

I'm disgusted.

I've written to many French people (with no special awareness of
transhumanist themes) about it in the last few days, launched
discussions on forums, and many reacted positively, discussing it and
saying they are revolted about it.

Some person told me they would act, had lawyers, etc. But no news from
them.

I also wrote (email) to Rmy Martinot's lawyer, to make sure they
would exhaust all possibility of appeal, and to transmit Spike's
suggestion as well ("refrigerated coffin"), but got no answer so far.
Can't they appeal to that decision ? I'll post more if I know more.

Court: Frozen Couple Must Be Buried
Wed Mar 13, 4:48 AM ET

SAUMUR, France (AP) - A court in central France ruled Wednesday that the corpses of a dead couple who were frozen in hopes of one day being brought back to life must be removed from their cryogenic chambers and buried.

The court in the central French town of Saumur ruled in favor of local authorities, who had argued that the continued refrigeration of Raymond Martinot and Monique Leroy was against the law.

According to French law, a corpse must be buried, cremated or donated to science.

The couple's son, Remy Martinot, 35, had sought to keep his parents' bodies in the basement of the family's chateau in the town of Neuil-sur-Layon, arguing he was carrying out his parents' last wishes.

When his longtime companion died in 1984, Raymond Martinot, a doctor who was fascinated by cryonics, received an authorization from local authorities to have her body buried at the family's chateau. But instead of interring her, he injected anticoagulants into her veins and froze the body.

Raymond Martinot told his son that when he died, he wanted to be frozen alongside his wife, and left the necessary needles and products to inject him with. The elder Martinot died on Feb. 22 at the age of 80.

But this time, local authorities objected.

The court in Suamur authorized officials to use force if necessary in carrying out its ruling.

The son's lawyer, Alain Fouquet, had urged the court "to respect the last wishes of Dr. Martinot" and argued that although "funerary legislation gives no permission for freezing a corpse, it does not prohibit it."

Several years before Dr. Martinot died, he was interviewed by French television station M6 and said he was unsure that scientific advances would ever meet his goal.

"It might be extremely long, because no one can predict what will happen in the future," he told his interviewer. "It might never be possible."

This kind of shows how one has to be careful when doing cryonics to get
all the legal issues settled beforehand.

I think this is overly harsh. Lack of social skills isn't the same as
preferring certainty and regularity over uncertainty and wild
complexity. "Soft" subjects require a lot of work (and different
approaches) than "hard" subjects, which often means that you need a far
bigger knowledge base in them to say anything rational.

So, if Google starts dropping in accuracy, what will replace it? I've used

Jacques Du Pasquier points to the following in disgust:
http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020313/ap_on_re_eu/france_frozen_corpses_5

"According to French law, a corpse must be buried, cremated or donated
to science."

In Louisiana, there are cemetaries and cemetaries filled with tiny
*above-ground* crypts of dead people- due to the Mississsippi rising,
it's necessary to bury the dead that way, otherwise Grandpa might
float away.  (see "City of the Dead" near New Orleans for an example).
Louisiana, is organized politically and legally via the French parish
system. Can one use something legal from there?

For every measure there is an inequal but opposite countermeasure. 
Google will be strengthened by this if their programmers are any good at
all.

I've gotten good results from http://vivisimo.com -which orgnaizes your
search into a (fairly) logical tree, rather than page after page of
dubiously relevant miscellany.

See, for instance, the 4th entry for "reliable rocket engines"...

What about Google? The problem mentioned seems fairly manageable, and
the Google people tend to update their algorithms over time.

Would seem to require real AI. I've been planting my .sig into diverse web
archives for a while to jiggle the Google ranking for "leitl". It's not
easy for a spider to tell the poisoning of the googlejuice (pardon the
freebasingprimateism) by just looking at the link, and human eyeballs are
really scarce, so I don't see how you could do much but to blacklist
certain well known services (yahoogroups would come to mind).

However, the days of Google's greatness might be passing (who does still
remember AltaVista these days?). Going PC on ads is the first sign of
decline. They're still doing cute stuff (witness the Googlebar for the
Exploder), but they're starting to tarnish around the edges.

P2P search engines seem to kill their original niche anyways, so they'd
better diversify.

Things are confused tonight. The ruling apparently hasn't been
executed yet. Though the ruling implies it can be excuted any time,
Rmy Martinot's (the couple's son) lawyer is said to have appealed all
the same (not sure what it means if the decision is "executory"), and
aptly argued that (my translation) :

  on the law side, there is a real debate that we have started but
  that has been truncated by this urgent procedure. One shouldn't

  didn't dare to confront the problem [Dr Martinot's wife is frozen
  since 1984]

and

  my client had a right to a fundamental debate with intervention of
  medical experts and, why not, philosophers

I had a good contact today with Libration, a major daily newspaper

Picked up via Reuters....

French Intellectuals to be Deployed in Afghanistan to Convince Taliban
of
Non-Existence of God

The clean-up portion of the ground war in Afghanistan heated up
yesterday
when the Allies revealed plans to airdrop a platoon of crack French
existentialist philosophers into the country to destroy the morale of
the
remaining Taliban zealots by proving the non-existence of God.

Elements from the feared Jean-Paul Sartre Brigade, or 'Black Berets',
will
be parachuted into the combat zones to spread doubt, despondency and
existential anomie among the enemy. Hardened by numerous intellectual
battles fought during their long occupation of Paris's Left Bank, their
first action will be to establish a number of sidewalk cafes at
strategic
points near the front lines.

There they will drink coffee and talk animatedly about the absurd nature
of
life and man's lonely isolation in the universe. They will be
accompanied by
a number of heartbreakingly beautiful girlfriends who will further
spread
dismay by sticking their tongues in the philosophers' ears every five
minutes and looking remote and unattainable to everyone else.

Their leader, Colonel Marc-Ange Belmondo, spoke yesterday of his
confidence
in the success of their mission. Sorbonne graduate Belmondo, a very
intense
and unshaven young man in a black pullover, gesticulated wildly and
said,
"The Taliban are caught in a logical fallacy of the most ridiculous.
There
is no God and I can prove it. Take your tongue out of my ear, Juliette,
I am
talking."

Marc-Ange plans to deliver an impassioned thesis on man's nauseating
freedom
of action with special reference to the work of Foucault and the films
of
Alfred Hitchcock.

However, humanitarian agencies have been quick to condemn the operation
as
inhumane, pointing out that the effects of passive smoking from the
Frenchmens' endless Gitanes could wreak a terrible toll on civilians in
the
area.

Monkey moves cursor by thinking


- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Alex Dominguez



March 13, 2002  |  

A monkey with a fingernail-size brain implant moved a cursor on a computer
screen just by thinking -- the latest in a series of experiments that
have raised hopes that paralyzed people might one day be able to control
complex devices with their minds. 

While humans have already been implanted with a similar device that allows
control of a cursor, the set of thin wires used by the Brown University
researchers is less bulky and worked by measuring fewer neurons. 

Three rhesus monkeys were given the implants, which were first used to
record signals from their motor cortex -- an area of the brain that controls
movement -- as they manipulated a joystick with their hands. Then those
signals were used to develop a program that enabled one of the monkeys
to continue moving the cursor with its brain. 

During dozens of trials over several months, the monkey moved the cursor
just by thinking and used it to touch dots that appeared on the screen,
earning orange juice as a reward, said John Donoghue, chairman of neuroscience
at Brown. 

The results are promising enough that the device could one day be used
on humans, the researchers reported in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature. They would not speculate on how long that might take. 

Anything that can be controlled with two- or three-dimensional coordinates
can be controlled by similar implants, Donoghue said. 

"Anything you can imagine can be engineered. What can you do with point-and-click
navigation on the Internet?" he said. 

In 1998, researchers at Emory University in Atlanta reported that a paralyzed
man was able to control a cursor with a cone-shaped, glass implant, using
it to operate a voice synthesizer that allowed him to communicate. 

The key advance in the Brown study is that the researchers were able
to use fewer neurons -- between seven and 30 -- to control the cursor,
said Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi, a Northwestern University professor and staff
member of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. 

Mussa-Ivaldi said the glass cone implant is bulkier, but its advantage
is that brain cells grow around the glass, holding it in place. 

In November, Duke University researchers reported they had wired the
brains of monkeys to control robotic arms. When the monkeys reached for
food or manipulated a joystick, the robotic arms mimicked those motions.


Duke researcher Miguel Nicolelis, who was involved in the robotic arm
research, said similar work has also been done with rodents. 

As for transferring the implant technology to humans, "I always estimate
these transfers as somewhere between five and 10 years, but it's very
encouraging," Nicolelis said. "It now shows in rodents and in monkeys
that this is feasible. It gets us very much on the track to potential
applications in humans."

I hope Liberation will publish a paper. I think what is needed is
something that catches the attention of the media and makes a major
story of it. The events themselves should be enough, but I believe a
"mass" demonstration to prevent authorities from entering the castle
would do the job. If there is at least some simpathy from the public
it may become politically dangerous for authorities to carry out the
sentence.

I think if this were in the U.S. or the U.K.(home to cryonics orgs) we would see the kind of reaction you want.  France is in the "frontier" as far as cryonics goes.  

I agree with you that there needs to be more action here.  But at least we have Jacques Du Pasquier TRYING VERY HARD to help this frozen couple.  He just does not have much time here to make the connections and affect change.

I admit that so far the reaction on the Cryonet list has not been the way I had expected.  I wrote several prominent cryonicists who felt the matter could only be dealt with by having French cryonicists move forward on the issue.  

Luckily, just as we have(to my knowledge!) one Frenchman on the extrolist, we also have one on Cryonet.  I hope they can successfully network to get something done.

Unless your fellow extropians are officers of Alcor, CI or some other cryonics organization, it's not their mission to be looking out for your rights!

I know enough about at Alcor and the Cryonics Institute to say you will be standfastly watched over with either group! 

And if the rights of people with either org were seriously threatened, I honestly believe Max, Greg, Shaun, Harvey and Natasha would rally the troops to counterattack.  

I wish the French doctor who is now frozen along with his wife had decided to not go it alone!  He should have done his research and decided to do this with the aid of U.K. Alcor.  Cryonics organizations are not so generous with those who did not make the proper arrangements beforehand.

I'm not even sure if the French government would allow that!  But at this point it seems no wealthy patron will be coming forward anyway.  And I did try enlisting one! lol  Oh, well.

I laconically observed:

>I should think that the EU's provisions regarding human rights would prove
>useful in protecting the suspended couple.

Then I got curious.  What *would* the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights say?  
Having googled, I here summarize some potentially applicable provisions.

Art. 1:  "Human dignity is inviolable.  It must be respected and protected."

Art. 2.1: "Everyone has a right to life."

Art. 3.1: "Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and 
mental integrity."

Articles 6 (liberty and security), 7 (respect for family and private life), 
10 (freedom of thought, conscience, and religion), and 11 (freedom of 
expression) might also prove useful.


That said, the Charter strikes me as a very poorly written ("Everyone" does 
not agree with "his or her") and internally inconsistent (mixing liberty and 
welfare rights) document.  It also has some odd particulars, including art. 
3.2 (banning human reproductive cloning).

The more I think about, it the more I come to believe
that the single greatest plague on modern quality of
life is bad transport.  Hell is a world built to serve
transport, rather than a world where transport is
built to enhance living.

I love the New York subway, dirty and noisy as it is. 
I love the Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) because it is
clean, quiet and (when above ground) scenic. I love
leaving the street, going down to the train, getting
off at my destination station, and climbing back up to
the street and being where I wanted to go.  If it
weren't for the traffic hell at the street level, the
horrific incessant noise, the exhaust, the visual
clutter, and the neaver-ending
pedestrian-vs-motor-vehicle restrictions on personal
movement/physical jeopardy, life could be one
continuous stroll/bike ride from mall to mall to
Mayberry to park to mall to Willoughby etc.  

I say follow the Disneyland model, put all (the
utilities and) the traffic that isn't local, isn't for
pure cruising pleasure, and isn't serenity
compatible--like San Francisco cable cars; slow
pleasant hop on, hop off--put all the noisy hustle
below ground.  The surface level should be a
people-friendly social/living/lounging area.  The 
below-ground 'transport' should be made maximally
efficient:almost certainly electric and most certainly
ultra-automated.  Which is to say, leave the driving
and the traffic management to computers.

I envision everyone having their own personal
transport pod, equipped according to your particular
wishes, and containing your personal property.
Propulsion and guidance would be provided by
ubiquitous and interchangable units. When you wanted
to go somewhere, your pod, mated to a propulsion unit,
would be there to meet you, automatically. You pod
would be demated from its current propulsion unit when
appropriate, either for propulsion unit maintenance or
for pod maintenance, or when transferring from one
mode of transport to another--high speed long distance
tube transport to a shorter-range local grid, for
example.

You get the idea.  In the midst of a city, I live on a
dead end, traffic-free street/hill. My dog sits, ever
vigilant for vagrant felines, complacently in the
middle of the street. This is life as it should be. 
Road rage is logical.  Traffic is evil.   

Best, Jeff Davis

No, this is an old article, dated 8 mars. So "next week" there refers
to this week.

At Airport Gate, a Cyborg Unplugged

By LISA GUERNSEY

STEVE MANN, an engineering professor at the University of Toronto,
has lived as a cyborg for more than 20 years, wearing a web of
wires, computers and electronic sensors that are designed to
augment his memory, enhance his vision and keep tabs on his vital
signs. Although his wearable computer system sometimes elicited
stares, he never encountered any problems going through the
security gates at airports.

Last month that changed. Before boarding a Toronto-bound plane at
St. John's International Airport in Newfoundland, Dr. Mann says, he
went through a three-day ordeal in which he was ultimately strip-
searched and injured by security personnel. During the incident, he
said, $56,800 worth of his $500,000 equipment was lost or damaged
beyond repair, including the eyeglasses that serve as his display
screen.

His lawyer in Toronto, Gary Neinstein, sent letters two weeks ago
to Air Canada (news/quote), the airport and the Canadian
transportation authority arguing that they acted negligently and
seeking reimbursement for the damaged equipment so that Dr. Mann
could put his wearable computer back together again.

The difficulties that Dr. Mann faced seem related to the tightening
of security in airports since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
But he had flown from Toronto to St. John's two days earlier
without a hitch.

On that day, Feb. 16, he said, he followed the routine he has used
on previous flights. He told the security guards in Toronto that he
had already notified the airline about his equipment. He showed
them documentation, some of it signed by his doctor, that described
the wires and glasses, which he wears every waking minute as part
of his internationally renowned research on wearable computers.

He also asked for permission not to put his computer through the
X-ray machine because the device is more sensitive than a laptop.
He said that the guards examined his equipment and allowed him to
board the flight.

But when he tried to board his return flight on Feb. 18, his
experience was entirely different. This time, he said, he was told
to turn his computer on and off and put it on the X-ray machine. He
took his case to Neil Campbell, Air Canada's customer service
manager at the St. John's airport, and spent the next two days
arranging conversations between his university colleagues
and the airline.

The security guards continued to require that he turn his machine
on and off and put it through the X-ray machine while also tugging
on his wires and electrodes, he said. Still not satisfied, the
guards took him to a private room for a strip-search in which, he
said, the electrodes were torn from his skin, causing bleeding, and
several pieces of equipment were strewn about the room.

Once his system was turned off, turned on again, X-rayed and
dismantled, Dr. Mann passed the security check. When he was finally
allowed to go home, some pieces of equipment were not returned to
him, he said, and his glasses were put in the plane's baggage
compartment although he warned that cold temperatures there could
ruin them.

Without a fully functional system, he said, he found it difficult
to navigate normally. He said he fell at least twice in the
airport, once passing out after hitting his head on what he
described as a pile of fire extinguishers in his way. He boarded
the plane in a wheelchair.

"I felt dizzy and disoriented and went downhill from there," he
said.

Air Canada said that there was no record that any of Dr. Mann's
baggage had been lost and that the Canadian transportation agency,
Transport Canada, had required that his belongings be X-rayed. "We
don't tell the security firms that there is going to be an
exception made," said Nicole Couture-Simard, a spokeswoman for Air
Canada. "We don't have that authority."

Transport Canada declined to comment on the case except to say that
it was reviewing it.

Considering that even tweezers may be confiscated when a passenger
boards a flight these days, the stricter scrutiny that Dr. Mann
faced may not seem surprising. But for him, the experience raises
the question of how a traveler will fare once wearable computing
devices are such fixtures on the body that a person will not be
able to part with them.

"We have to make sure we don't go into a police state where travel
becomes impossible for certain individuals," Dr. Mann said.

Since losing the use of his vision system and computer memory
several weeks ago, he said, he cannot concentrate and is behaving
differently. He is now undergoing tests to determine whether his
brain has been affected by the sudden detachment from the
technology. Alejandro R. Jahad, director of the University of
Toronto's Program in E-Health Innovation, who has worked closely
with Dr. Mann, said that scientists now had an opportunity to see
what happens when a cyborg is unplugged. "I find this a very
fascinating case," he said.

There will be an online debate featuring Francis Fukuyama vs.
Gregory Stock on the subject of whether we should allow genetic
and biological manipulations with the potential to alter human
beings. It will start at March 18, and seems highly relevant. 

http://reason.com/debate/eh-debate1.shtml

This is *very* important for the transhumanist community to
monitor, because Fukuyama is coming out with a book _Our
Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution_
in April. From
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374236437/ref=ase_reasonmagazine/104-0500157-4582347 :

	Fukuyama argues that "the most significant threat" from
	biotechnology is "the possibility that it will alter
	human nature and thereby move us into a `posthuman'
	stage of history." The most obvious way that might
	happen is through the achievement of genetically
	engineered "designer babies," but he presents other,
	imminent routes as well: research on the genetic basis
	of behavior; neuropharmacology, which has already begun
	to reshape human behavior through drugs like Prozac and
	Ritalin; and the prolongation of life, to the extent
	that society might come "to resemble a giant nursing
	home." Fukuyama then draws on Aristotle and the concept
	of "natural right" to argue against unfettered
	development of biotechnology. His claim is that a
	substantive human nature exists, that basic ethical
	principles and political rights such as equality are
	based on judgments about that nature, and therefore
	that human dignity itself could be lost if human nature
	is altered. Finally, he argues that state power,
	possibly in the form of new regulatory institutions,
	should be used to regulate biotechnology, and that
	pessimism about the ability of the global community to
	do this is unwarranted. Throughout, Fukuyama avoids
	ideological straitjackets and articulates a position
	that is neither Luddite nor laissez-faire.

Given that Fukuyama is an important vector for ideas in our
current society, that he is on Bush's bioethics comitte, that
he takes a stance *against* what I would regard as core
transhumanist values (based on his limited view of human
nature) as well as explicitely naming the bad future posthuman,
the importance of the situation cannot be overestimated. This
really is the big ideological fight we cannot afford to lose. 

We need to act now. Time for everybody to get writing and
thinking! We need to build our case for posthuman dignity.

In my particular case, I telnet to the WELL from my "personnal"
machine here in Chicago, (NCR 386/SX20) via T-3, and download mail
as ASCII text, reading with LIST.com, and editing with WordPerfect
5.1, which I then re-translate into ASCII. So the wrapping is
automatic, and software related.

As a result posts that exceed 80 characters per line, or those
filled with HTML or base 64 addendums or both, are rarely read.

Of course he's absolutely right--and this has happened before
many times.  Human nature used to involve small bands of hunter-
gatherers, and social institutions and values based on that.
With agriculture, we had to create new institutions and new
values.  With the industrial revolution, we had to do it again.
It was difficult, and painful, but we are better for it.  Does
Mr. Fukuyama think that technologies like birth control and
personal defense destroyed the "feminine dignity" of women whose
lives used to be based upon their nature as weak and vulnerable?

Yes, human nature will change, and our present social values
and institutions won't be able to cope: so fix them!  Upgrade
the society as well as its members.  Societies are built to
serve us, not we for them.  Let us charge into the future as
masters of our fate, not cower in fear of changes that will
empower and enrich us all.

Good news !

I had the lawyer's office on the phone earlier today. They confirmed
they had just filed a formal appeal to the decision this afternoon.
But the nature of the decision was such that one was not guaranteed
that it wouldn't be executed all the same (before the appeal was
considered).

In the meantime, however, we learnt from the press that the "prfet"
of Maine-et-Loire said that he would not execute the decision in a
hurry, even though the appeal was not suspensive, and would wait for
the decision of the Court of Angers on the appeal. He said he would do
that out of respect for the family's mourning and the serenity with
which this issue should be treated.

I wrote yesterday to all the main newspapers and teles in France. On
the other hand I never read the newspapers and haven't watched tele,
so I don't know if it had an impact :-) Press in general may have had
an impact, as things were put into the Prefet's hands by the
situation, and he could take quick action without risks only in the
complete absence of interest.

We will try to coordinate with people who feel concerned about this
(I have found quite a few, to various degrees, some even slightly
organized), to raise public attention and try to influence the course
of events.

Jacques

> Because emails that are set to not wrap look really funny in most readers.

Any mailer which inserts a hard line break in the middle of a continuous
string is broken, regardless, whether this is an URI, or not. Most
applications today are URI-aware, recognizing and offering a choice of
action on a particularly formatted string. By inserting a line break you
make it impossible to decide whether the line below belongs to the URI, or
not. So, what do *you* do with a wrapped earl?

A double offense. And an indication that technology frequently does
advance -- in the retrograde direction.

       Many thanks for your insight John. Much appreciated. This whole affair 
has prompted me to take a serious look at the 'Human rights' aspect of 
cryonics. Once I have gathered my thoughts on the subject and accumilated the 
relevant legal details. I will post my ideas regarding the issue. I hope that 
this will prompt some serious discussion. 
       I hope that the situation in France comes to a favourable end. I'm 
sure that with people like Jacques working the issue, reason will prevail 
over red tape. I certainly hope so. Again, I wish I could do more.

<HTML><FONT FACE=arial,helvetica><FONT  SIZE=2>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many thanks for your insight John. Much appreciated. This whole affair has prompted me to take a serious look at the 'Human rights' aspect of cryonics. Once I have gathered my thoughts on the subject and accumilated the relevant legal details. I will post my ideas regarding the issue. I hope that this will prompt some serious discussion. 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the situation in France comes to a favourable end. I'm sure that with people like Jacques working the issue, reason will prevail over red tape. I certainly hope so. Again, I wish I could do more.

>> [Fukuyama's] claim<<

>Of course he's absolutely right--and this has happened before
many times.  Human nature used to involve small bands of hunter-
gatherers, and social institutions and values based on that.
With agriculture, we had to create new institutions and new
values.  With the industrial revolution, we had to do it again.
It was difficult, and painful, but we are better for it.  Does
Mr. Fukuyama think that technologies like birth control and
personal defense destroyed the "feminine dignity" of women whose
lives used to be based upon their nature as weak and vulnerable?

Yes, human nature will change, and our present social values
and institutions won't be able to cope: so fix them!  Upgrade
the society as well as its members.  Societies are built to
serve us, not we for them.  Let us charge into the future as
masters of our fate, not cower in fear of changes that will
empower and enrich us all.<


APPLAUSE!  Bravo!  Yaaaaaay.

This is *very* important for the transhumanist community to
monitor, because Fukuyama is coming out with a book _Our
Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution_
in April. From
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374236437/ref=ase_reasonmagazine/104-0500157-4582347 :

	Fukuyama argues that "the most significant threat" from
	biotechnology is "the possibility that it will alter
	human nature and thereby move us into a `posthuman'
	stage of history." The most obvious way that might
	happen is through the achievement of genetically
	engineered "designer babies," but he presents other,
	imminent routes as well: research on the genetic basis
	of behavior; neuropharmacology, which has already begun
	to reshape human behavior through drugs like Prozac and
	Ritalin; and the prolongation of life, to the extent
	that society might come "to resemble a giant nursing
	home." Fukuyama then draws on Aristotle and the concept
	of "natural right" to argue against unfettered
	development of biotechnology. His claim is that a
	substantive human nature exists, that basic ethical
	principles and political rights such as equality are
	based on judgments about that nature, and therefore
	that human dignity itself could be lost if human nature
	is altered. Finally, he argues that state power,
	possibly in the form of new regulatory institutions,
	should be used to regulate biotechnology, and that
	pessimism about the ability of the global community to
	do this is unwarranted. Throughout, Fukuyama avoids
	ideological straitjackets and articulates a position
	that is neither Luddite nor laissez-faire.

Given that Fukuyama is an important vector for ideas in our
current society, that he is on Bush's bioethics comitte, that
he takes a stance *against* what I would regard as core
transhumanist values (based on his limited view of human
nature) as well as explicitely naming the bad future posthuman,
the importance of the situation cannot be overestimated. This
really is the big ideological fight we cannot afford to lose. 

We need to act now. Time for everybody to get writing and
thinking! We need to build our case for posthuman dignity.

I don't know if you did this deliberately or not, but your reply message
started with "begin", which is a known bug in Outlook Express which shows up
as having a phantom attachment and no message body. The only way to read the
message is to look at the source, the quickest way being control-F3.

If you did this deliberately, then I would like to bitch back at you, quit
your whining, get a 21st century MUA that can render in-process or with an
external plug-in or utility, HTML or MIME attachments with quoted-printable
text, etc.

If you did not do this deliberately, then to answer your question, most mail
readers (like Outlook Express) that send unformatted text are configured to
wrap lines when the message is sent. Some filtering may occur with the
mailing list software (majordomo?) but I doubt it. Detection is usually not
a general pattern-matching expression for a URI, but specifically email
addresses with an "@" or anything that starts with http:, mailto:, file:,
ftp:, or ends with known TLD's like .com . The pattern matching is of course
implemented differently in each MUA renderer. A smart one would be able to
join the split lines back up. You obviously don't have a smart enough MUA
(and neither do I, apparently) I get around wrapped "earls" with the classic
copy/paste/alt-tab/click/mouse-movement method (or learn your keyboard
shortcuts for mouseless navigation of applications and text editing).

Looking at the mail headers of Brian's message, there is no X-Mailer: header
which is a de facto standard for specifying the MUA used to compose the
message. Your message has no X-Header either. That tells me that either
Majordomo mangled it, or the message was composed on a Web interface that
does not fill in the X-Mailer: header, or that both you and Brian have lame
MUA's and should think about upgrading to something more modern.

HTH.:-P

cheers,
    Simon

Any mailer which inserts a hard line break in the middle of a continuous
string is broken, regardless, whether this is an URI, or not. Most
applications today are URI-aware, recognizing and offering a choice of
action on a particularly formatted string. By inserting a line break you
make it impossible to decide whether the line below belongs to the URI, or
not. So, what do *you* do with a wrapped earl?

A double offense. And an indication that technology frequently does

We could add to this the possibility of (non-super) AI which could force
us to expand our definitions of what entities deserve and require that
their rights be respected.

I wonder how our local "natural rights" theorists see this.  It's always
seemed like a serious problem with the natural rights approach, that
as we change what is natural we lose all guideposts as to what rights
should exist.

Of course I hope that we do not see these kinds of restrictions, but
contrary to many here, I welcome consideration of these issues by writers
as influential as Fukuyama.  It is time for the larger world to begin
to grapple seriously with the changes ahead.  They can no longer hide
behind the comforting belief that it's all just science fiction.

I hope that the debate between Greg Stock and Francis Fukuyama is
conducted in an open-minded and flexible style, rather than as a
confrontational, take-no-prisoners memetic slash-and-burn mission.
This is just the first step in a public dialogue which will be going
on for decades.  We need to seek common ground and encourage consensus
rather than confrontation.

Hal

I've recently added four articles on alternative currencies
to BuildFreedom.com:

* Is the Private Sector Really Part of the Public Sector?
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/economic/eco_10.html>
* E-Gold and Alternative Currency FAQ
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/economic/eco_11.html>
* Alternative Currency Debit & Credit Cards
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/economic/eco_12.html>
* Massive Change Is Upon Us
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/economic/eco_13.html>

The articles may be of interest to anyone involved in
businesses utilizing digital gold currencies and other
alternative currencies and payment systems.

* E-Gold and Alternative Currency FAQ
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/economic/eco_11.html>
includes some security information that may be of
interest to people with individual alternative currency
accounts.

The articles may also be of interest to anyone to
whom the expansion of freedom is important.

I would appreciate suggestions for improving
the articles.

For those of you interested in comic-strip visuals:

The New York Times (3/14/02, Section B2) article" A Museum Gives Comic-Strip Works a New Cachet" (Stephen Kinzer) discusses the "dynamic and powerful aesthetic vocabularies that seize and sustain attention through the creative juxtaposition of words and images".

The Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery at University of Nebraska was designed by famed architect by Philip Johnson and, apparently, just the right spot for exhibiting the comic-strip show.

I don't see any reason to 'lose' guideposts, nor do I see transhumanism
as being against a natural rights POV. Much extropic thought has been
focused on using technology to allow the individual to RECLAIM those
natural rights which have been confiscated by religions, statists, and
industrial complexes in the past couple of millenia. Aristotle's
statements about natural rights recognise that technology is man's
natural right to use as he sees fit (derived from the existence of the
hand and the inventive mind), which Fukuyama should be aware of.

Fukuyama is contradicting himself when he supports using government
force to restrain the right of the individual to determine their own
path of development. It indicates that for all of his posing about
trusting the individual, he still defaults toward statism when it comes
to these future technologies.

Part of it is that there are, in fact, real risks to these technologies.
What Fukuyama fails to note is that it is government and state-like
multinational corporations who are far more likely to abuse these
technologies in the risky areas of exploitation, seeking to use them as
weapons or to exploit consumers and employees. It is not the individual
who needs to be restrained with regard to these technologies, it is the
state.

History has shown that far far more damage is wrought by the state with
technology, both in human lives lost as well as loss of liberty and
environmental vitality. Large scale industrial application of technology
to both agriculture and industry, by both states and corporations, come
in second to this, while use of technology by individuals is far less
damaging.

Of course, a major problem with individual action at all levels is that
both state and corporate mechanisms generally shield the individual
within such structures against responsibility for their actions. A huge
percent of the human race is still unable and/or unwilling to act in
their own * rational long term self interest *, and as such DO tend to
act in ways which lend support to statist mistrust of individuals. This
is primarily due to a lack of available technology needed to efficiently
access and exploit resources, but also undemocratic force monopolies
practicing looter economics.

Folks, this story is much too important for most of the 
responses to be about nothing of more substance than whether the 
URI is wrapped or not!

As we hopefully become increasingly augmented there are very 
important questions of whether our augmentation will be 
considered as much a part of us as our brain or eyes or will 
always be considered mere equipment to be turned off, removed or 
damaged at the discretion of any official or semi-official. 
Will we be forced to implant such augmentation so that it can't 
be removed to escape such mangling of ourselves?  When humans 
commonly wear hearing aids or protheses they are not asked afaik 
to remove them at security checkpoints.  When humans someday 
wear as much gear as Dr. Mann will the effectively be partially 
blinded, mentally slowed down, have some of their memory removed 
and be effectively maimed at the discretion of a clueless world? 
Or will enough of us understand the seriousness of the issue to 
press for protection from such nastiness?

I hope Dr. Mann sues their asses off.

sorry for all the late posts - its taking me awhile to get caught up :P

I don't know much about the medical/scientific part of HIV but I learned a 
little bit about the social side from some people who were infected. I lived 
in Dupont (well-known for being a community of gay men) for awhile in DC & 
it's a big problem there. (I think there was an article awhile back in the 
NY Times about the HIV problems in Dupont & Anacostia.) When I had to go to 
the hospital, practically the entire ward was HIV positive drug addicts, and 
most of them were gay males or transexuals. I got to know some of them 
pretty well & they were very candid about their attitudes toward being HIV 
positive. I usually got either one of two responses: #1 It was hopeless & 
they were going to die anyway so they may as well get strung out or #2 That 
with the medical progress being made, they could continue their destructive 
lifestyle without any additional harm. While these attitudes (especially #2) 
may not make rational sense to us, they are very real in the minds of these 
people & from what they say, this is a common position among HIV positive 
users in that particular community. My roommate did some work for 
Whitman-Walker in Dupont & her personal experience also confirmed this. The 
reason I feel I can rely so much on what I learned in my personal 
interactions, especially in the hospital, is that it wasn't a one time deal 
- I unfortunately ended up there several times and the only thing that 
changed were the names & faces - everything else including their stories & 
histories were identical - it was shocking. I think its interesting to 
compare the characteristics of this population in different regions. Because 
I'm speaking only from my personal experience, I can only compare the places 
where I lived - Washington DC & Northwestern Massachusetts. I live in 
Massachusetts now where the drug of choice in this area seems to be heroin 
rather than cocaine (though I noticed crack is equally prevalent in both 
places) & the dominant health problem seems to be Hepatitis C rather than 
HIV.  People infected  here cite sharing needles to be the cause of their 
infection while in DC it was usually tied to unprotected sex. Another 
difference involves the social & political response of each community to the 
epidemics.  Of course, it all comes down to local budgets & the funds 
allocated to social programs. But the approach to HIV up here in Mass 
(despite recent budget cuts) is very proactive in terms of education, 
prevention & getting out into the streets - safety programs, needle 
exchanges, and free anonymous testing. HIV testing, specifically the rapid 
test, is getting really big really fast.
http://www.medadvocates.org/diagnostics/RapidHIVTestMainPage.html gives a 
good list of rapid tests, but the corporate & manufacturing information is 
limited. I'm not sure about the exact methods or chemistry of these tests 
but the links provide that info.
http://www.biospace.com/news_story.cfm?StoryID=6728415&full=  U.S. Food & 
Drug Administration has granted an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) 
for Efoora's HIV Rapid Test.
If I'm not mistaken, the other test granted an IDE was one of Trinity 
Biotech's Uni-Gold tests: http://www.trinitybiotech.ie/catalog/rapid_hiv.htm
Both of these tests have over 99% accuracy. Surely lots of companies have 
been scrambling to be first in on this new market for rapid testing. I 
became interested in the market for rapid testing just recently when I was 
in rehab. I was offered the opportunity for a free (state funded) anonymous 
HIV test. The rehab centers contract out for the HIV counselor to come in & 
do testing. Like I said, I don't know anything about the science of these 
tests, but the one I took at rehab involved rubbing this cotton swab kind of 
thing against my gums & holding it there inside my mouth for about a minute 
- no blood was drawn. I spoke to the HIV counselor on several occasions & he 
mentioned something about Efoora's rapid test. The HIV clinics in the area 
were participating in Efoora's last phase of preliminary testing & he 
encouraged people to participate through the clinic. He said they needed 
more names, more results to submit before the cut off date. They were not 
merely offering a free rapid test to anyone interested, but they were 
actually PAYING people $25 just for participating. These tests, however, 
were not anonymous. By this point I had already gotten my results through 
the program at rehab, but I was really curious about how this worked (the 
$25 didn't sound bad either) so I went to check it out. I had mixed feelings 
about being there - it was good to see such programs in effect & available 
to the general public, but it was also sad to see some of the shit going on 
there (like some people actually had to draw their own blood because the 
tech couldn't get a vein). It only took like 20 minutes but they had to draw 
a lot of blood (well, it felt like a lot to me anyway) about 5 viles or so. 
They told me I was fine (which I already knew) but to check back in 2 weeks 
for confirmation of the official results. I asked the technician & she said 
out of about 400 people she tested since january, maybe 2 people had final 
results different from the rapid. They cut me a check & that was that.
So I tried to look up some information on Efoora but there wasn't much. I 
found something about a merger of sorts a couple of years ago. But it seems 
like things were set up in anticipation of the test's release this year back 
in 2000, which was well before the date of their IDE. Something didn't seem 
quite right, like they knew they'd be approved for IDE a year before they 
even began trial testing. So there's all this stuff going on between these 
corporate industries & the government - not too sound nave, but I just find 
it kind of disturbing.  I don't know - it just made me think about these 
giant medical industries & all the political factors involved. You can't 
help but wonder how much further technology (& social change as well) could 
progress without being inhibited by these dominating political forces.

I'd call this just rationalization.  Most people know how you catch HIV and
how to get risks pretty low.  Those who catch it today are a subset of people 
who usually have either poor impulse control or a low valuation of distant
events.  It frustrates me greatly that our government is so resistant to
HIV education - preventing spread in the drug community is relatively easy
but needle exchange, etc. is generally illegal.

[By way of explanation - poor impulse control and time discount functions
are faults, but not ones people should be forced to die from.]

Do these people respond to the issue that their actions put others at risk?

My experiences with medical companies included a lot of wishful thinking.
People in these companies generally really believe in their stuff, and are
convinced the FDA will leap to approve it.  They're quite shocked at delays
or rejections.

Just to put in a plug for "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud.  It's a 
analysis
of comics as art, done in comic book format, and it's superb.  As he's 
discussing
how comics can be used for unique and interesting goals, he's showing by 
demonstration
that it's a suitable medium for artistic criticism.  Wish he were at a 
university 
somewhere.  Not hard to get; I've seen it in bookstores.

Indeed, this could be the "killer app" reason behind implants.  Most
augmenting devices, it's cheaper and easier to wear them externally, and
usually considered safer *precisely because* they can be removed,
powered down, and even destroyed without causing major physical risk to
the wearer (or, at least, so's the majority belief, correct or not).
Anything which requires surgery to remove, at least for the near term,
the public would be up in arms about if people were forced to remove
them.  ("Today, they took this chip out of that person.  What next,
mandatory liposuction to make sure you're not smuggling a mininuke in
your blubber?"  Well, ok, that particular example might actually win
some support, especially with the prospect of it being done at
government expense, but you know what I mean. ^_-)

No?  I recall seeing someone with an artificial leg being asked - at
gunpoint, by the security people - to remove it at an airport security
terminal, way before 9/11.  (Granted, this could have been a special
circumstance; maybe the guards had evidence the limb was being used to
smuggle drugs or something.  The dangers of anecdotes...)

Sadly, I see almost any judge saying "this is not a medical condition,
you did this to yourself, and you knew the risks; the 'national 
interest' is superior to your technobabble concerns".  At most, he could
get damages for the parts that really did bleed, but legal precedent is
that non-life-sustaining equiment, even artificial limbs, is more
property than body.

Francis Fukuyama has an original essay in the current (March/April 2002)
issue of Foreign Policy magazine.  The main essay is also available at
FP's website:

http://www.foreignpolicy.com/issue_marapr_2002/fukuyama.html

The piece is based on (but not lifted from) his new book, "Our Posthuman
Future," mentioned in Natasha's email.

The print edition of the magazine has an additional short essay by FF,
and, IMO, is a particularly good issue of a consistently good magazine.

Best,

Bill

Great idea Jeff!  We could make freeways pass *below*
cities, with upramps and downramps.  Currently the east-west
freeways have even numbers and the north-south have odd
numbers.  We could name the underground freeways with...
negative numbers.

Freeways with no ramps except the at the start and end
would be named with prime numbers.

Freeways that we would like but do not have,
would be named with imaginary numbers.

Freeways that are built for no apparent reason
would be named with irrational numbers.

Freeways that pass over the office of the
doctor of oral health would be named with
transcendental numbers.

Whew!!!  I am SO relieved!!  I had gotten the impression they were all hellbent on burying the bodies as quickly as possible.  It is truly great news.  And thank you for correcting me regarding the online article.

I wrote yesterday to all the main newspapers and teles in France. On

an impact, as things were put into the Prefet's hands by the

That is all great news!  I hope my cryonet friend can also be of great help to you.  He's a pretty sharp guy.  Anyway, I am very grateful regarding your efforts for this couple.

What would be the value of these features, other than to read the broken
output of other lame MUAs? Having these features doesn't let you say
anything in email that you couldn't say already, though it does give you the
opportunity to demonstrate bad taste in style.  I'm seeing lots of downside
and precious little upside.  I use the latest, greatest 21st Century Wonder
Email Client, and I take advantage of its power and flexibility to
intelligently undo all the formatting and give me plain text.  Half the
formatted email I receive is far worse to read than the plaintext email, and
none of it is actually better.

The justifications for the latest bright-n-shiny formatting features of MUAs
sound more like marketing copy than solid reasoning.

Thank you Alex, Jacques, John and the others who contributed to this
important ethical discussion. While we may not all  agree on exactly how to
go about dealing with this dicey issue, it's comforting to see that at least
it hasn't been a matter of simply shaking our heads and muttering.

I'd like to point out that by specifically referring to the couple by name,
we give ourselves a welcome memetic booster shot against the possibility of
slipping into depression should the unfortunate situation arise where we too
must face the prospect of becoming metabolically challenged, or worse,
sleeping through the singularity.

I'd like to dedicate this poem I wrote awhile back to Raymond and Monique.
May they read it one day and shake their heads in rapt horror that they came
so close and having had the likes of me in their corner.

Millennium 3000 Scenarios
Theodore J. Gordon

Experts in various areas were asked
to speculate on life in the year
3000. Their ideas were compiled into
six scenarios by two leading
futurists for the Millennium Project
of the American Council for the
United Nations University. "The
authors provide some insightful
scenarios," says Ray Kurzweil.
"However, I feel that their time
frames do not adequately reflect the
accelerating pace of progress
inherent in what I call the law of
accelerating returns. The types of
changes they describe for 2050 and
3000 respectively will arrive much
earlier in my view, but the issues
raised by such developments as
femtotechnology and nonbiological
intelligence are compellingly
described."

If he does then we have some work to do to raise hell about such 
a ruling.  It certainly will not actually end there.  Any 
reasonably competent shyster should be able to show extreme 
cruelty, reckless endangerment, major psychological trauma just 
for starters.  The concerns are certainly not "technobabble" in 
the least.  What is the difference between what he wears today 
and when you or I have our memories boosted (non-medical need) 
with embedded chips or when we have extra processing power or 
skills embedded to improve on nature - not merely to somewhat 
recover from disease.  The pursuit of happiness means nothing if 
we are not free to improve ourselves in such ways.  Where is the 
boundary that makes external wearable fundamentally different 
form internal augmentations?  Where is the boundray between a 
laptop and a wearable if that laptop is a significant aid to a 
very large part of your functioning?  An artificial limb is my 
limb, without it I am crippled.  Does the court claim the right 
to cripple me at its discretion?  I think this falls under cruel 
and unusuable punishment, not to mentioned legalized mayhem.

Such rulings would amount to saying it is a sometiems tolerated 
privilege, at best, to go beyond the hardware you were born with 
unless you cannot live any other way.  That is a pretty slippery 
slope.

Of course I did that deliberately. I wasn't even nice enough to put an end
at the end of my message, thus screwing up the rest of the list digest
subscribers who also happen to be Outlook users.

begin  if you're an MS Outlook user, you can't read this. The suggested
"fix" from Microsoft is to not use begin followed by two spaces at the
beginning of the the line. I kid you not, that's an official "fix".

You misunderstood the entire point of my diatribe. I don't render rich
content (Redmond even managed to sneak buffer overrun vulnerabilities into
their frigging RTF processing code) as default as a matter of privacy and
security. (And, yes, the question of filtering and sandboxing is
undecidedable, and a waste of my time).

If people don't talk to me in plain text they obviously don't want to talk
to me.

Um, so does my mailer. However, it

An URI is just a special case for this.

Meaning, if your MUA does this, it's broken. Simple enough.

The pattern matching is not the problem of my MUA. It's the problem of the
text buffer renderer (I don't know whether it's Sawmill, Gnome or xterm
doing this, but it works). Kitchen-sink approaches such as DEIOP are Bad
Design.

The question of wrapped URIs is undecidedable. It requires a human mind to
fix a preventable problem. I don't want my MUA come with a built-in mind.
I want something which renders plain text messages. Which would run on a
32 MByte wearable, and render directly to an array of luminous pixels in
my hud.

Wrong attitude. I have a computer, I don't have to cut&paste, and to edit
the URIs. I've shown above why the brokenness is at the end of earl
wrappers, not at my end. I don't have any possible use for wrapped earls.

Where is the RFC requiring that to be inserted? Why do I need to specify
my MUA, so that you can select the proper exploit from the vulnerabilities
library? I think not.

Yes. I'm upgrading to mutt (currently pine user), as soon as I can get the
DSL home box finder to work. The next evolution of this is a web front end
to a SQL database containing a few millions of individual mails. It's just
that this would take more time to set up than I have. In case anyone here
has created something like this for their private use or know of any such
solutions, please drop me a pointer.

Ok, then, perhaps a rephrase: transhumanism includes an element where
people other than those who control vast amounts of power anyway
(high-level politicians and corporate executives) stand a good chance of
significantly impacting society.

Alternately, consider: "how the common man really lives" - society
shaping is well and good at the grand level, but how are you and I
directly impacted by the decision of, say, whether or not to drill in
Alaska?  ("Price at the gas pump" - maybe, but the real, short-term
effect there is minimal at best.  "Reduced war" - not a direct effect,
unless you're in the US military or a contractor for them, and even then
not much when you average the few who participate in, say, Afghanistan
over the rest of the armed forces personnel.)  Now compare this to, say,
the impact of a simple, open-source AI that could get rid of most of the
spam in your inbox, or of a company with actual (flying) spacecraft that
offered any-major-airport-to-any-major-airport in one hour service (or
just a trip 'round the Earth in one and a half hours) for $20K or so a
pop, or of an uploading service to transfer consciousnesses from failing
old bodies into androids, or...

We don't have to go through governments, or similar large bearaucracies,
to implement our changes.  Or maybe we will go through them - like a
knife through hot butter.  And this is not the least bit scary to those
used to How It Was?

I have stated earlier on this list that I ran into that exact ruling.  I was
born with VERY poor eyes.  One day my eye doctor comes in with "I have great
news... You have cateracts."  Turns out that the AMA considered lens
replacement for me as "enhancement" and therefore unethical.  Only after I
developed a disease did they consider lens replacement ethical.

So it's not a slippery slope (meaning we might go further), because it's
already here.  Enhancement is considered "unethical" by the AMA.  We have to
work to make enhancement actually allowed, then accepted, then viewed as
"necessary equipment" for some people.

You could use the URL forwarder at http://messagenet.com/fw/

It's really just a crappy little program that should use a text file of
references instead of making small web pages. It works though. Actually,
I should rewrite it and just offer it to anyone, but it's simple enough
that anyway familiar with perl should be able to write a replacement in
less than a hour anyway.

I think its far worse than that.  As far as I can see flight
by a nano-enhanced individual on a public air traffic system
seems impossible.

Take the simple respirocyte model where an individual is loaded
with a dose of respirocytes hyperpressurized with O2 to around
100000 atm vs. tne normal 1000 atm.  Such devices engineered
with a trigger mechanism that would enable rapid release of the
gas would function very efficiently as a suicide bomb.  I
don't see an easy way of detecting this short of loading the body
up with a massive dose of inquiry-bots, and even then I'd have my
doubts if the respirocytes were designed to look like 'normal'
respirocytes.

I can only conclude that the current mode of air travel is
doomed.  One will only be able to travel with individuals
whom you can personally verify as trustable.

There's going to be a lot of resistance to augmentation before it's
generally accepted. Everyone thinks it's OK to level the playing field
with hearing aids, glasses, eye surgery, etc., but the masses aren't
comfortable with the idea of augmentation--"fixing what ain't
broken". Performance enhancing drugs and blood doping are considered
cheating in athletics, for example.

Augmentation proponents need to understand this and respond
nonthreateningly. We need to move slowly and take the concerns of the
masses seriously lest we really freak them out and end up making the
situation *really* bad. Augmentation *is* a serious threat: how could
a natural person compete against a seriously augmented person with
similar natural abilities? Perhaps promoting augmentation as a benefit
to humanity, rather than as a way for the wealthy to make themselves
into supermen, would help.

Calling the world "clueless" is exactly the kind of thing that's going
impede the progress of augmentation--if not get it outlawed outright.

Sure, for whatever equipment was damaged. But neither he nor they had
any idea that removing his equipment would cause possibly serious or
permanent psychological damage. And he could have refused to remove
anything and made alternate travel arrangements.

I agree.
But I don't think three seconds to highlight, ctrl+c to copy, ctrl+n to 
open a new window, ctrl+v to paste the url is that huge a waste of time, so 
I don't complain.

Are you sure that is the precise AMA position?  If it is are a lot

As wearable life support becomes more widespread, pulling off random
electrodes and switching off boxes will become a major no-no. You could
kill a person that way. First time it happens security will be

Actually, the standard header is "User-Agent:"; all of the "X-"
headers are non-standard, including "X-Mailer:".  Of course, the
most popular mailers (Outlook, Netscape) use "X-Mailer:", so that's
become a de facto non-standard.

Also the published URI standard says that URIs can be broken if
they are enclosed in angle brackets, like this: <http://piclab.com/
lee/>.  I don't know of any mailer that correctly handles those.

At any rate, the moral of the story is that before you guys
complain about what's standard and non-standard, you might want
to actually read one.

...or we can go back to the way air travel was throughout most
of its history, and abandon the fruitless paranoia that people
seem to think has always been with us.  Up until the 60s, any old
joe sixpack could board a flight with a gun on his hip; it was
normal and expected that some people would do so, and that just
as in society at large, they tended to keep the peace.  It was
only after irrational fear of hijackings took over and guns were
banned that hijackings actually became a problem.

I don't suppose any artificial heart transplant patients have yet gone
flying commercial; given their general poor state of health I doubt any
have tried.  Forcing such a person to remove his power pack would be
negligent homicide as the very least- the would-be passenger would
likely say, "Hey, it ain't worth my life to get there today, I'll come
back tomorrow with my doctor, okay?" before it came to that.  I hope.

If you're referring to RFC 2396 Appendix E, it's only a
"recommendation".  The behavior you're describing is NOT
required by the standard.

And Opera 6.1 saw it, too. So I'm glad I know about that, I'll be sure to

On page A-18 of todays Investors Business Daily, Steve Forbes rips
the IMF and it's policys, especially on countries such as
Argentina.

He lays out 5 very sound rules for a good economy.

1) Firmly establish the rule of law

2) Create sound money

3) Keep taxes low

4) Make it easy to open, run, and expand a business

5) Reduce trade barriers to increase the flow of goods and        
   services, create jobs, and expand a nations wealth.

Sound wisdom.

He also point out that the Russians told the IMF to get lost,
brought in pro-growth economists (including Hernando Desoto)
instituated a flat tax last year and revenue is way up. Putin is
also considering major property rights reforms.

In another article on the same page Gorbachev admits that communism
is "pure propaganda" and an "unreal system".

Yeh, thanks so much for ending with an "end" that time, maybe you're not
such a bad guy after all. On behalf of all of us poor saps who currently use
Microsoft mail readers, we thank you.

No, they do want to talk to you. Even if it's in broken English with poor
grammar and speelling misteaks they want to talk to you. It is you who
chooses to punish those who don't conform to your idea of how things should
be. We may disagree on few or many things, but the communication transport
is always open for us to express ourselves. You choose to sabotage that
transport by knowingly using those bugs.

An example of a URI with characters such as "?" and "-" would have
illustrated your point better, but nevertheless I agree with you. When
Outlook Express sends a message in plain text, it can be configured to wrap.
While I'm composing this message, everything looks fine and is wrapped
within the compose window with a horizontal scrollbar for that really long
word you created above. Wrapping is used to accomodate clients that don't do
their own wrapping when rendering the message. Maybe I should turn off word
wrapping from now on and see if anyone complains.

But we see several ways to render plain text - wrapped and unwrapped, URI
detection, email address detection, general hyperlink detection, etc. The
URI detection for example is a feature of the application that allows you
(hyper-)link to other text. If you don't want that feature in your HUD,
don't install or enable that component. You'll still have your split URI
problem, and you don't need a mind to join the lines together, you just need
an algorithm.

The problem is not with the wrapping, it's the detection of the full URI.
Your MUA's URI pattern matcher algorithm doesn't account for line breaks in
the raw text, simple as that. If you use a fixed-width character-cell
renderer and it is displaying a URL that's 200 bytes long, it doesn't matter
whether the renderer wraps it or not on the screen, so long as you get the
utility from it when you use the hyperlinking feature in your MUA. If
"clever" MUA's sent you a pre-formatted URI with line breaks encoded in it,
then approximately the same amount of cleverness on the renderer's side
probably could decode the true utility of it.

How very unFriendly of you :-) I hope the first superhuman AI is not based
from any of your uploads ;-P. Why would I or any other Extropians want to

This post, and the replies, seem to all share the assumption that people
concerned about overpopulation are concerned with spatial overcrowding.
 From that angle overpopulation is a straw man.

But the environmental concerns I read about aren't about overcrowding,
they're about excessive demand on resources.  Fresh water, fertile
agricultural soil, greenhouse emissions, energy.  Concerns that humanity
is already intercepting 40% of the primary productivity of the Earth,
for example, or whatever the exact number is.  These may be addressable
concerns, but not by simply pointing to the open spaces of Alaska.

You know all those Make Money Fast type letters?  Annoying (and
usually scammy) as they may be, they illustrate a possible way to
spread alerts.  I've yet to hear of such a method being used to
spread legitimate information, but over on /., they've proposed a way
to use this to counter the proposed SSSCA law.  I suspect most of the
people on this list would like to see the SSSCA not become law, even
non-US Extropes (so it doesn't become a model for your own country to
adpot, and/or so certain overzealous employees of the US government
won't be tempted to bully your country into complying with this law).
Would spamming be ethical in this case, since the information within is
verifiably correct?

Here's what they've come up with so far.

---

Congress and Hollywood to make you pay

Hollywood has gotten Congress to propose a law that will force you to 
have to buy new VCRs, CD players, and computers. If you keep your old 
ones, any new CDs or movies you buy won't work! If you buy a new one, 
any old CDs or movies won't work! Either way, we're in trouble! Also, 
forget about taking home videos -- you'll need to go to a professional 
place if you want to make copies for your folks. This little surprise is 
called SSSCA and is being slipped in by the hollywood movie moguls so 
they can make more $$$ and force us to buy the same stuff twice. Anyway, 
I'm passing this along to everyone I know, it'd be great if you did the 
same. I guess you could fax your congressman or complain at your local 
Best Buy on this.

This is close enough to the existing successful "spread this useful
information" memes and targetted at the wallet -- I think it'd stand a
chance of working. Add a few more major stores to the list.

So it's a Good Plan. Reason seal of approval.

The scary thing is that it sounds completely unreasonable and crankish when
put like that below. And it's mostly true. Ever onwards that thing that
likes to call itself the land of the free. Hah.

Exactly, and the fact is that we see almost every day incidents where
individuals do manage to get on board aircraft with supposedly 'banned'
items. The only two real options are to make everyone fly naked or else
allow anyone to be armed.

Right now, the FAA is staging a coverup of one aspect of the 9/11
incident: it seems one of the hijackers of flight 11 was armed with a
firearm and shot a passenger. A flight attendant reported the shooting
to air traffic controllers, and this is all documented in memos and
flight tapes, which are now all being suppressed by the FAA, which now
claims there was no gun and no shooting on board flight 11. Oddly
enough, the FAA is at the same time opposing a bill in congress that
would allow pilots to fly with firearms. Gee, I wonder if there is a
connection...

None of which are covered by insurance. Then again, the AMA is not a
monolithic group. Only a small percentage of doctors are actually
members. The AMA has devolved into a rather well promoted clique of
aristo-liberal practitioners with far more clout than they deserve,
primarily due to their medical journal.

Where things will get interesting with augmentation is when an
augmentation for a handicapped person makes them MORE capable than the
norm. When this occurs (and it is already in the area of amputee
sprinters), then it will become undemocratic to prevent the normal from
becoming augmented. The luddites may try to pass regs which require that
augmentations do not provide more ability than the norm posesses,
whereupon the advocates for the handicapped will ramp up their lobbying
bandwagons...

And he has a webpage at <http://www.scottmccloud.com>. IMNSHO, he's one of

Yes, and it certainly a good idea to be concerned about such.
But the average agricultural productivity is currently using
1-2% of the energy available from sunlight.  This can definately
be pushed to 8-9% using current photosynthetic systems in
simple bioreactors and perhaps into the 10-30% region using
structured bioreactors.  So it is reasonable to assume that
from an solar energy standpoint we could support a population
10x greater than the current population (or somewhat smaller
with everyone at the energy consumption levels of the U.S.).

> Fresh water, fertile agricultural soil, greenhouse emissions, energy.

Fresh water is a red herring.   The majority of the photosynthetic carbon
fixation that occurs is the oceans in salt water. 

Fertile agricultural soil is a red herring.  You can grow what you
need in solar ponds where your only requirement is the addition
of small amounts of essential minerals required by catalytic
sites in enzymes.

Greenhouse emissions are of course a concern.  We have to move
to a sustainable situation in which everything we put into the
atmosphere we subsequently remove before it can cause destabalization.

The number isn't anywhere near that high.  I'd venture its closer
to the 5-10% range.

Agreed.  One points to population densities as being the source
of local problems (pollution, resource shortages in some years, etc.).
One points to the overall population level and growth rates with
regard to the situation on the planet as a whole.  But one does
not leave our ability to improve on what nature has provided
out of the equation.  We are after all a race of toolmakers.

That's only if a) you adopt the current mish mash definition of rights
(including both negative and positive rights as well as individual and
collective ones and even throwing in religious arguments or no arguments
at all for them) and b) if you make rights somehow a defining trait of
being human and human an exclusive domain.  If instead, you allow rights
if a being has certain traits, then there's no reason such rights that
might be given to one set of beings with said traits -- e.g., humans --
should not also apply to other beings with the same traits even if they
are otherwise radically different -- e.g., AI, posthumans, aliens,
uplifted animals, etc.

The story did actually show up in German TV news (ZDF, Thursday

Just to add two more data points, Pine for Solaris (and I assume the other

Late response, I know, but this is pretty cool.  I've always wanted a
sound system that could localize sound without headphones.  I don't like
wearing headphones and would like, e.g., to have such localized sound in
my cube at work or even when I'm walking around anywhere.

Thanks for sending this.

Hi, guys!  I just figured out a way to - without ontotechnology - insert a
short natural-language message into Pi, starting at (for the sake of the
discussion) around the 1000th digit, and continuing for one or two extended
sentences, maybe 30 to 100 letters total.  I guess it just goes to show that
you should never leap to conclusions about what post-Singularity entities
can and can't do!

(Far as I can tell, the "Contact" scenario is still impossible, though.)

Sincerely,
Eliezer.

What's the relevance of that?  We need fresh water for human
consumption, industry, and agriculture.  Mostly the latter two.  Our
agriculture is freshwater.  It may be possible to grow GM wheat in
saltwater, but it's hardly been done, and someone could ask about the
energy losses if it was done.

At a global level I think there's enough fresh water to go around, but
the distribution is uneven, and the moment large regions are short or

Huh, that's a new one.  I usually think of more intensive hydroponic
systems.

insolation per human being on the Earth.  (More like a megawatt per

oxygen, food, sufficient light to stay sane, etc.?  Where by "know how"

which will actually work efficiently and do literally everything needed?

The only way I had thought of to do something like this would be to
control which mathematical constants turn out to be found interesting
by the likely inhabitants of a universe.

Our universe is 3 dimensional, gravity pulls things into balls with 2D
surfaces, plus we write and draw on 2D surfaces.  This calls our attention
to the mathematics of plane geometry and we soon learn about Pi.  It is
am important constant for us.

But in the abstract mathematical sense, Pi is not all that simple.  You
need to create axioms to represent all of Euclidean geometry, plus
arithmetic, to even be able to write a formula for Pi as we know it.
(Actually you don't really need geometry, you can do it with infinite
series.  Pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ....  But that's still quite a
few axioms just to define the numbers and arithmetic.)

You can think of an axiom system as a string of characters, or even
more simply as a string of bits which acts as a computer program which
can generate theorems or verify proofs.  The length of this program
then represents the complexity of the mathematical system.

It is plausible that the minimum mathematics needed to define Pi is
similar in size to what Eliezer describes above, a few hundreds or
thousands of bits.  Given this fact, there are a similar number of other
constants which might be defined using the same amount of information.
Each of those constants would be "simple" from the perspective of the
particular mathematical system defined by those axioms.  But with that
many different constants to try, it should be possible to find one which
has the desired message embedded in it, yet is fundamentally no more
mathematically complex than Pi.

All that remains is to create a universe which somehow embodies the
mathematical axioms which lead to the constant that has the message
you want to convey.  That seems to be the hard part, because presumably
only a tiny fraction of all theoretical universes are even capable of
evolving intelligent life.  The universe creator needs to satisfy two
constraints at once, that the universe evolve intelligence and that the
required mathematics is fundamental and important.  But perhaps for a
powerful enough universe creator this is a solvable problem.

In such a universe, some other mathematical constant would have a
similarly fundamental role as Pi does for us.  To the inhabitants of
that universe it would seem impossible that their constant could have
been manipulated by anyone.  It has an inherent mathematical simplicity
and elegance which would make inserting a message impossible, just as
we consider to be true for Pi.  But in fact the message is sent, not by
changing a constant, but by controlling which constant the inhabitants
discover.

What I want is the opposite.  I want to have a pair of microphones
that can pinpoint the direction of a sound.  Perhaps the technology
is adaptable.

What I have in mind is a new sport, related to hunting.  Currently
hunting is not even what I would call a sport, since there is no way
the hunter can lose.  The hunter can win: the prey loses its life.  If
the hunter misses and the game escapes, one would have to call it
a draw, for neither "competitor" has gained or lost.

Another drawback to the current hunting "sport" is that we need to
pay all these game wardens to ensure the animals have a chance.
These require a bureaucracy and cost tax money, most of which
is paid by those who do not hunt.

Suppose instead we released into the wild a number of game
animals that could shoot back?  Remember that robo-lamb idea?
What if we made a robo-deer with a reverse point-n-shoot
device that could react to the sound of gunshots, estimate the
position of the shooter and return fire?  Would not that be a bit
more sporting?  Would not that add a whole new dimension to
the "sport" of hunting?  Would that not add a certain "excitement"
and "thrill" to hunting?  That is an activity I would be willing to
call a "sport".

We know that some unsporting individuals sneak right up on
the prey and fire from short range.  Such a device would
surely keep the hunters back at a sporting couple hundred meters,
for he would not want to take return fire at close range.

Game wardens have trouble with drunken proles firing at game
from the road.  A robo-deer would discourage this by putting
holes in the side of Billy Bob's pickup truck, thus reducing the
need for expensive state employees.

Now of course, there is some risk that hunters involved in such
sport might get injured or seriously killed.  But this might actually
increase the appeal of the game, for most popular sports involve
some form of danger.  If some wimpy hunter is too afraid to
take a little return fire, he is free to use a safer and quieter
alternative such as bow and arrow, which really does give
the prey a fighting chance.

We could further reduce the temptation of illegal forms
of hunting by giving illegal game more dissuasive weaponry.
For instance, a robotic 4-point buck would be given a 30-30,
whereas a mechanical doe would have a magnum .30-06
with enhanced accuracy in the aiming software.  A fawn
could be sent out packing Mr. Twelve Gage and his nephew
Buckshot.  This technology could give an entirely new
meaning to the term Point-n-Shoot, as well as the name
BAMbi.

ps. Hope everyone had a happy pi day Thursday.  I am part of a

Cyanobacteria (salt water bacteria) harvest CO2 using photosynthesis.
You use the bacteria to feed shrimp and the shrimp to feed fish
(if you want to go that much further up the food chain).  Our
agriculture is non-salt based because much of the relatively flat
agricultural land isn't near any salt water.

There are some energy losses because plants would have to expend
energy to pump out excessive amounts of salt.  But it isn't a show
stopper.

Its just that most of the food crops have been bred to utilize
fresh water.  No reason we can't fix that with a little genetic
engineering.

Nope.  You engineer the bacteria to grow most of the pond for you.

You can do it quite easily by engineering more complex bacteria to
perform the various functions required.

No wait, this would never work.  You know as soon
as we tried it, the animal rights mafia would get
together and write viruses that would invade the
operating system: a number of well-armed robo-
bambis might organize a command-doe raid on a

This seems like the hard way to me.  Without having to manipulate a universe, or
the development of mathematics, you just have some "angles" appear to the elders
of the tribe with some stone tablets.  The tablets would establish the first
written language, with some simple arithmetic (be sure to put in some hygiene
rules to help this group propagate).  Say, you give them a 16 letter alphabet and
base 16 counting, and a full literacy commandment.  In this case, the medium is
absolutely going to be the message.  The vocabulary and syntax might be quite
strained, but what the heck, it's from angles.

A thousand years later, someone is cranking out the digits of pi, and lo and
behold, a big chunk of the religious text comes forth, which all the intellectuals
had dismissed as mumbo-jumbo centuries ago.  Deus ex pi.

It seems that the army is investing in nanotechnology, though luckily none 
of the stuff I've heard about sounds anything like red goo.

Absolutely.  This is a big area of agricultural research. See:

http://www.gla.ac.uk/ibls/BMB/pjd/salinity.html
http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9606/18/t_t/saltwater.farms/
http://www.gci.ch/DigitalForum/digiforum/articles/article2001/massawa.html

Irrigation causes increases in soil salinity, which then requires more
irrigation.  Making crops resistant to salt is one of the biggest ways to have
more water, and, in effect, make more land.

When this progression gets far enough, it will be possible to come up with an
entire GM farm that floats out in the ocean (like the kelp in the Sargasso
Sea) and produces whatever crop you want.  You would not have to plow it, or
water it, and you would be able to load the product right onto the grain
ships.

Generally, I think there are times where bulk email is quite 
justified.  If a message needs to reach as many people as 
possible and that is the best means of reaching them I think it 
is every bit as legitimate as a massive slow mail campaign. 
That you don't have to pay much or anything to do it with email 
or that you can reach many more people does not intrinsically 
make doing this by email wrong.  Neither does the fact that most 
people are fed up with spam.

Why should there be any necessity in a free country to convince 
anyone that what you wanted in the way of augementation, 
implanted or not, is "necessary"?  By what right does any 
government get to legislate how bright or capable their 
citizen's make themselves in any capacity or the means they use 
to do so?

Don't we (those of us who believe in the right to augments) to 
challenge every single assumption that it is valid for any body, 
governmental or otherwise, to regulate such individual choices?

To me, anything less than a total negation of anyone's right to 
limit such is giving our opponents a decided advantage.

Speaking of the "Army investing in nanotechnology" post, the red or grey goo 
scenerios reminded me in many respects of the book "/Slant" by Greg Bear. The 
book talked about several 'grades' of Nano, the most powerful was called MGN 
(Military Grade Nano) which could create entire functioning machines from any 
and all raw material around it. MGN was stable and intelligent, and did not 
revert to an uncontrollable state. I would have to reread the book to figure 
out if controlling the nano was discussed in any detail. I think Drexler 
touches on some possible containment methods. To me it would seem the only 
way to contain the spread of dangerous, self-replicating nanobots would be 
some form of electromagnetic or other energy disrupting forces, such as 
magnetism. Someone correct me if I am wrong, but grey goo type nano can only 
spread if it comes into direct contact with suitable matter, or in theory can 
a nanorobot snag atmospheric particles and break them apart and use them, and 
also I suppose that the nano could also be dispersed in gaseous form if the 
machines are small enough, and possibly even self-propelled? Aah I am 
rambling again! Let me know what you think! :D

I'm sure some of you have read the book "/Slant" . Slant is an EXCELLENT book 
with many many examples of how nano can be used in the future, including 
biomodification, manufacturing, cryostasis, uploading, artificial 
intelligence, information dispersal through "viral" nanoagents in the air, 
and automated medical diagonoses, to name just a few.

My 2 Cents,

Brian Shores (aka Artillo)

It is a pretty dumb play on the word "natural" that hasn't a 
thing to do with natural rights per se.  The "natural" in 
natural rights is there to anchor rights in the nature of the 
beings involved.  Whether that nature came to be through 
evolution or through technological means is utterly beside the 
point.  Any respect I had for Fukuyama falls quite a bit when I 
see such a spurious argument being used.

Obviously a silly argument given the above.  If the nature of 
augmented humans, posthumans, AIs and so on requires certain 
conditions in order for said beings to flourish then natural 
rights are alive and well.

I don't believe that "the larger world" is competent to "grapple 
seriously" with the changes ahead.  How can I believe it when 
the majority of that world is utterly uneducated on much that is 
relevant to such considerations?  The larger world is ruled by 
powers that have ample reason to fear massive change and to 
oppose any change that may upset their power base.  They also 
have opposed, quite successfully, much of the population 
possessing the ability and willingness to think.  It is one 
thing to question on the basis of whether humanity can survive 
much less thrive under what is to come.  It is another entirely 
to string together bogus arguments and call for force to be used 
to prohibit any/all that disagree and act on their 
disagreements.  I see nothing in how cloning and bioegineered 
crops are being handled by the public to make me anything but 
fearful of the public becoming more involved, especially in a 
legislative capacity.

Consensus is not the friend of innovation. It is incompatible by

Scott's "Zot" on that site covers some basic transhumanist themes at the
same time as poking gentle fun at the tropes of the golden age. Well worth a

Hmm -- I wasn't thinking mass mail. This is a viral mailing tactic along the
same lines as urban legend e-mails, send money to cancer victim, beware of
virus X hoax. You send it to a few seed types and propagate through people
forwarding it on to friends, mailing lists, etc.

People are fed up of spam, but the fact that e-mail meme virii still survive
show that they're still happy to do what people do; i.e. pass on
information.

Insofar as right and wrong go, this is on the side of the angels so far as
my moral compass goes. Now if it involved actually mass mailing, I'd have to
think about it...

Nanotech can be completely disrupted by high levels of radiation or
high temperatures, both of which may be produced using non-nanotech.
This is something generally ignored by people overly concerned with
some-color-of-goo scenarios.

This is true.  It suggests an alternate defense that would involve
removing either the matter (creating a vacuum around the nano)
or shielding the nano from energy sources required to utilize
the matter.

A close examination of the current nanoscale parts would reveal
that they all have some essential element that is not in significant
abundance in the atmosphere (carbon for example).

It would of course be interesting to know whether nano that is
suboptimal, but is built out of the most abundant elements (O/N/Si)
could trump optimal nano (C/BN/Al2O3/TiC) manufactured from less
available resources.  This would be a question of whether quantity
can trump quality.

How much comfort should we take in this? Unless I am in a hermetically
sealed container surrounded by a sphere of high temperature or radiation it
seems that some of the darker goo scenarios really are a worry. A fleet of
microsubs and microhelicopters carrying nanotroops could destroy our
civilization in pretty short order. How will we disinfect and protect the
world's air and water supplies? And if a few manage to survive holed up in
some fortress protected by radiation or heat, it seems the nanotroops still
have the option of constructing retroweapons such a nuclear bombs to coax
you out.
I would love to be convinced that the reality of the situation is happier
than this.

No, I'd say you've stated it pretty much correctly.  Offense has so far
tended to run ahead of defense at extremes of technology, and an impervious
shield against military nanotech must not only defend against bots but also
against fusion weapons constructed by those bots.

Umm, BZZT! *Reality check*

They won't even tell us that burning exotic composites in open pits in Nevada
at undisclosed (denied outright) locations is a possible health hazard.

Regardless of your take on offensive vs. defensive technology, there's
the question of development.  If we don't develop adequate defenses,
then it's academic anyhow.  In other words, it might be that if two
equal units develop nanotech and one develops the purely offensive side
of it while the other does only the defensive side, there might be a
stalemate or even defense might "win."  But who is now developing
defensive nanotechnology?

I also think if I were inclined to develop offensive nanotech, I would
make weapons that could swarm and survive.  A nanobot might not be able
to survive a direct hit from a high energy weapon, but what can?  But
10^23 of them might be able to scatter and even just out wait any
defense.  (Even if the defense gets better over time, there's no reason
to suppose that the offense, too, won't grow.)

Still, I remain optimistic about nanotechnology...

My two cents!

This isn't really accurate. While in the modern world, a hunter goes
home and eats his supermarket steaks, there is a cost in that he is not
able to partake of the healthier venison, and is thus imposing health
risks by not 'winning' in the hunting game. Of course, this isn't as bad
as going home hungry without any food for your family, as hunters used
to (and many still do around the world).

This is also false. The cost of state and federal wildlife protection
and conservancy is MORE than paid for by hunting license fees. There is,
in fact, a distinct surplus which the anti-hunting bureaucrats tried in
the last administration to pillage for use in promoting the anti-hunting
message.

The fact is that hunters have paid for and engaged in far more wildlife
habitat conservation and reconstruction in the last several decades than
the anti-hunter crusaders. Non-hunting wilderness recreational
activities pay little or none for wildlife conservation. The taxes they
pay generally go ONLY to the construction and maintenance of
infrastructure that benefits their own sports: boat docks and ramps,
hiking trails, camping areas, and bridges, and even then, they pay only
a fraction, in most cases, of these costs, siphoning other taxpayer
monies for their activities.

The problem with this is that the robot is not an actual animal
defending itself, it is the property of the state, and as such the state
would be found liable for the deaths an injuries imposed.

What a misrepresentation. Who have you been listening to, spike?
"Sneaking up on prey" is the most difficult thing to do, so it is hardly
'unsporting'. The unsporting way would be to shoot from long range or
from aircraft. Such practices, in many cases, result in far more
wounding of animals which get away only to die very painfully in the
wild than a quick death imposed from close range.

Actually, we already have 'robo-deer' that wardens use, though they do
not shoot back.  There are also robo-turkeys and robo-pheasant. Wardens
set them up by a road and lay in wait for road hunters to come by to
take potshots. This is very effective for nailing these types.

Those who are 'not wimpy' already engage in hunting which incurs
significant risks. Moose hunting, for example, is not just shooting at
stupid and tame ungulates. Moose are, in fact, quite agressive during
the hunting season (which is in conjunction with the rutting season) and
will frequently charge hunters. The moose hunt my brother and cousin
engaged in a few years ago resulted in the bull moose getting up and
charging my brother after four shots to the heart had felled him. I know
of a fellow my father works with who was gored in the hand by a bull
moose he had shot several times as he was being charged.

I have seen deer hunters who were charged by bucks and kicked and gored
(generally because they applied doe scent to their clothes).

This is just in north america, where you can also hunt grizzly bear in
Alaska with similar levels of risk. You can travel to Africa if you have
the green to hunt elephant (which are NOT endangered), or the highly
dangerous cape bull buffalo, among others. In asia there is the Siberian
brown bear which one can hunt which are very dangerous.

Non-member submission from ["ddd" <dddd>]

I'm always interested in how others see extropians and transhumanists
especially in literature.

Neal Stephenson does a rather flattering portrait of the Extropians in
"Cryptonomicon" and even has an imagined flamefest on this list as a plot
device. I've also just finished Eugene Byrnes hilarious "Thigmoo", where the
world is taken over by "Extropian Marxist" AIs whose ideology could be quite
attractive to a certain set of European Transhumanism including yours truly.
I recall Gregs Bear and Egan namechecking the  Extropians as well. Has
anyone got any other pointers to  transhumanists portrayed in modern
literature.

One could extend the MAD paradigm (not that I'm happy with that mind you).
I believe this is the current position the U.S. (or any other nuclear power
would take), e.g. that the use of any nanoweapons to attack their nation
is justification for a nuclear response.

If someone is mad enough to seek the destruction of civilization.
Otherwise there is little point to launching a nanoscale attack.

> How will we disinfect and protect the world's air and water supplies?

You have that problem already to a lesser extent with currently existing
chemical weapons.  Anthrax as well has a significant clearance problem.
If one has the technology to produce and distribute nanoweapons
presumably one also has the technology to clean it up.

Nuclear weapons do have depth limits.

> than this.

Until one can build a society where everyone highly values
one anothers security I doubt that will be the case.  But
as current reality shows, it seems fesible to survive even
though the situation is risky.  It is probably worth pointing
out that humanity has always been at risk from "natural" hazards.

With regard to nanotech, it is important not to underestimate
the complexity of the design problem for "nanotroops".  If we sit
on our hands while some crazy person manages to develop these
then we are likely to get what we deserve.  As Eric and others
have pointed out we already have a good example in our immune
system of how to repel such attacks.  In that case there is
a much simpler weapon in addition to heat or radiation --
more mass.  Macrophages trump bacteria because they are much
bigger, can engulf them and then rain harmful substances
down on them.

I see no reason why the same approach can't work with nanotech
*if* we are wise enough to design nanomacrophages first.  A
really simple defense would be defensive utility fog -- bacteria
sized nanobots designed to engulf a nanotroopbot, link arms,
deploy a spherical plating surface.  The interior of the sphere
is evacuated and there is no more material for the nanotroopbot
to use for replication.  The exterior defense bots would deploy
radiators that would allow them to remain cool, then direct high
temperature torches onto the engulfed nanotroopbot until it is
nothing more than a mass of slag.  So long as you have sufficient
numbers of nanodefensebots stockpiled there isn't any problem.

There might be some good in investigating the history of weapons
development to try and understand *why* offensive weapons have
lead defensive weapons.  I would actually question the claim.
Walled cities came before cannons that could destroy the walls.
Presumably offensive weapons have developed because people wanted
the wealth associated with some land, buildings, possessions, etc.
As "wealth" becomes increasingly virtual, offensive weaponry would
move into that realm.  So nuclear weapons and nanotroops become
increasingly irrelevant.  Instead we will be looking to defend
ourselves against viruses that seek to gain control of the
computronium.

The current vectors seem to suggest we will get molecular electronics
first.  That means we will have the computing capacity to support
uploads.  Then the pressure will start to build on producing methods
for uploading.  Once uploaded, you can distribute yourself to
a much greater extent, making the goo scenarios pretty irrelevant.

Robert

You're very welcome! Another really incredible webcomic is "When I am 
king" (I think, I havn't read it in a while), which is at 
<http://www.demian5.com>. There are a few more I remember reading about 
that were very great (most of these reccommended by Scott McCloud, I 
think), but I don't remember any of the URIs. Oh well.
And a more traditional comic that is also wonderful is Megatokyo 
<http://www.megatokyo.com>, which beats out even Fushugi Yuugi and Gundam 
Wing for my favorite manga.

To sterilize this planet*, all it takes is a giant impact, enough to melt
the crust some 10 km down. Nothing to it.

If I have a bottle of gray goo sitting on my table, it's trivial to
destroy it. (Well, I'd need access to a special lab to dispose of it
properly, but you get my point). If I have that same bottle broken up and
contents released in the winds at 10 km height, we have a different
problem class altogether. The only solution would seem to demand a
somewhat radical treatment, as above.

A smart solution would require a worldwide nanoimmune system, but if you
look at it en detail you realize that the presence of blue goo screws the
ecology just as badly. (Even if you manage to install blue before someone
starts peppering you with gray). Machine phase stuff can be in a dynamic
equilibrium with each other, but unfortunately wet life winds up at the
loser end.

(*=just this planet, impact ejecta will carry the seeds everywhere (well,
they are everywhere already, so it doesn't matter that much).)

Awww come on Mike, cant a guy have a little fun on the
extropians list?  The entire post was meant as a Saturday
evening entertaining diversion.

But you did bring up an interesting point:

... and as such the state
would be found liable for the deaths an injuries imposed...

In those regions where grizzlies and wolves have been
eradicated and the fed reintroduces them into the
wild, suppose some drunken prole is slain or damaged 
in some way by the introduced wildlife.  Would not the
fed be liable as all hell for that?  

If not, I propose reintroducing rattlesnakes and
copperheads in the region that is now occupied by 
the federal government, and steps taken to insure 
the native snake population remains as high as its 
historical levels, before President Jefferson 
destroyed the habitat by placing government 
buildings there.  {8^D  spike

I think discussions of military self-replicating nanoware is currently
confined to lunatic fringe think tanks. We should be really thankful for
it, because a big programme could considerably widen the window of
vulnerability (it ain't just AI, obviously).

Carbon lacks resistance to oxygen; faced with diamondoid grey goo, toss
in a lighted match.  It'll be like a coal dust explosion.

Or think "Thread" on Pern; flamethrowers are excellent.

Good to hear silicon has an ultrasound vulnerability.

...which leads to another query: has anyone ever heard of such a scheme

What, is this about carbon composites disposal? I'm told the graphite
fibers clog up the electrostatic dust filters. But open pits? Huh? Makes
zero sense. But, all military installations are notoriously slovenly. Lots
of contamination in former U.S. bases here.

I think it's both missing supervision (do mil types have to succumb to eco
audits now?) and an intrinsically bad attitude.

If it's floating, and not passivated. A few atomic layers of silica or
alumina on top of it, and you can use it a filling for fire extinguisher.

Flesh and grass has that, too. Plus, sonickating a whole planet would seem
to require a rather large ultrasonics bath.

What is interesting is that nanoporous silicon with nitrates allows
self-destructing dies. Could be a good way to blow up die areas containing
secrets in tamperproof crypto designs.

I was just curious to know how things were progressing with the game?  It is an idea just too good to be played with and than forgotten about!  

I have emailed Steve Jackson for the job of making this game a reality and presently await his response.  I included a link so he could read the extrolist posts on the subject.  Perhaps he will bring his talents and resources to bear on this cool project.

No one could do it as well(design, graphics, marketing, distribution, etc.) as he would. : )

best wishes,

John

Notice that even a bracketted URI will be mangled by quoting signs.

Odd, military bases in the US are considered some of the best conserved
habitat, at least as compared to civilian state and federal conservation
lands. The one location Mike noted is Area 51, where there was
absolutely no oversight due to national security. There were huge
amounts of carbon based materials used in steath designs that needed to
be gotten rid of without having to file environmental impact statements
which would have required that the USAF detail the chemical composition
of the stealth materials being disposed of, in public documents.
Obviously, epa regs are contrary to national opsec.

Personally I'd have buried it all underground with one of the nukes they
were testing next door at the test range. The bomb tests would have
incinerated the material as well as left it too hot radioactively to
deal with for a number of decades afterward, as well as buried, a
perfect way to keep stealth materials out of enemy hands.

The one location that we have a clear good guess about.

It's not just carbon, it's also whatever else they throw(/threw) at the
low-observables problem. For all I know it could include beryllium, other
weird metals and/or particulates, epoxy amides, nasty mutagenic/carcinogenic
dielectric substances and Ghu knows what else. I also have no idea whether
it's stopped. Hey. why bother stopping when you've already got carte blanche?

Next door? More like "down the block." Not a totally bad idea, but it would
have taken an unusual level of cooperation between two rather distinct
tentacles.

Apart from open burning, there are _other_ materials disposition/activity
questions about Rocky Flats and some other locations. Point remains: if there
is a compelling reason, "the government", like just about anyone else, will
lie through their teeth. I swallowed the cover story for the Glomar Explorer,
too.

I recently received this chilling article on the cryonics mailing

Libertarianism hasn't caught on, why the US is plagued by
terrorism, and even why some individuals sometimes behave in
petty or cruel manners, even to their own detriment.  "What a

Research Shows Just How Much People Hate A Winner

New research by economists at the Universities of Warwick and Oxford in the
UK has provided surprising insight into just how much people hate a winner.

It also shows what lengths human beings are prepared to go to damage a
winner out of a sense of envy or fairness.

The researchers, Professor Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick and
Dr. Daniel Zizzo of Oxford, designed a new kind of experiment, played with
real cash, in which subjects could anonymously  burn  away other people s
money -- but only at the cost of giving up some of their own.

Despite this cost to themselves, and contrary to economists  usual
assumptions, 62% of those tested chose to destroy part of other test
subjects  cash. In the experiment, half of all the laboratory earnings were
deliberately destroyed by fellow subjects.

Everyone in the laboratory sessions was anonymous and hidden. The subjects
had only a computer terminal, into which they played, and in which they
could see how much other people were winning.

In each session, the test subjects began with a betting stage which gave
them some money (about 10 pounds, but sometimes much more), creating an
unequal wealth distribution.

In the final stage, the  burning  stage, subjects could if they wished
eliminate ( burn away ) other people s money -  but only by giving up some
of their own cash winnings. At the most expensive level, they had to give
up 25 pence to destroy 1 full pound owned by someone else.

It was made clear to all subjects that burning others would reduce the cash
of the person choosing to burn.

The economists expected little burning, and especially that the laboratory
subjects would stop destroying other people s money once the price reached
0.25, but in fact they found that even this high price did little to stop
people from annihilating other people s wealth. Most individuals still
chose to hurt others, despite the large cost to their own pocket.

The researchers found that those who gained the most additional money at
the betting stage burned poor and rich alike, while disadvantaged
laboratory subjects mainly targeted those subjects they saw getting what
they perceived as undeserved financial windfalls.

The authors conclude that  our experiment measures the dark side of human
nature.

I'd be up for it. We just send it out to a bunch of people we know as if we
received it and consider it worth passing along. I'd pick the people I know
that keep huge mailing lists, maintain blogs/webcomics/rant pages, and are
charmingly naive enough to occasionally drop existing viral e-mail memes
into my inbox. Sometimes with a cc list of a hundred people. Sheesh.

Morally legitimately use of viral meme e-mail? You know, I can't think of
any. Interesting. That would make us trendsetters if we got this one
underway :)

===================
The Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, Ethics and the Human Genome
By John Sulston and Georgina Ferry
Bantam/Random House Australia, 310pp, $A55.00

Reviewed by Damien Broderick

Nearly two years ago, US President Bill Clinton stood proudly at a podium
to announce that the human genome draft was complete. Actually, this map 
of our common genetic recipe was still badly gappy. Clinton called it `a
day for the ages'. He was flanked at his left by Dr Francis Collins, devout
Christian leader of the painstaking public American end of the global
Human Genome Project (HGP). At his right stood Dr Craig Venter, the
carpetbagger who'd roared into Dodge fixing to finish off the genome by the
`shotgun' method, beating those slow-poke bureaucrats even though they'd
drawn first--and, if his Celera Genomics company could get away with it,
patenting the spoils.

The fabled DNA helix, one thread of this book's title, was unravelled in
Britain
in 1953 by an Englishman and a visiting American. Nearly half a century
later, a key strand of the HGP's thread in this vast common project was
largely overlooked. Prime Minister Tony Blair seized photo ops, but not
many people knew that a major player in this epochal search was a genial
expert in nematode worms, John (now Sir John) Sulston. Yet in 1989 Sulston
had helped start the sequencing project, with DNA helix co-discoverer Jim
Watson and another American worm specialist, Bob Waterson, and ran the UK
end, the Sanger Centre, until late in 2000.

The speed of their successful efforts has been genuinely breathtaking. As
recently as mid-1996, the effort was gearing up after vast preparation for its
major push, massively and crucially funded by the philanthropic Wellcome
Trust. Only a few percent of the three billion genetic letters had yet
been read. In May, 1998, with the aid of venture capitalists, Craig Venter
entered the arena, ready to complete the human sequence within three
years--four or five years earlier than the public project's goal--and without 
a cent of taxpayers' money.

Journalists were agog. Here was the brash American way at its best:
audacious, putting its money where its mouth was in expectation of
prodigious rewards, perhaps even a bit unprincipled. The race hotted up
with incredible speed. To everyone's astonishment, a little over a year ago
private and public wings released their data simultaneously to the
scientific press--Sulston's team (although by then he had resigned) through
the British journal Nature, Celera's via the American journal Science. The
human genome had been decoded in barely more than a decade, we were told, a
triumph comparable to placing men on the Moon, with unfathomable future
consequences.

The trouble with this story, like the one about asylum seekers throwing 
their children overboard, is that it's wrong, and politically motivated.
Sulston's brilliantly enthralling tale blends his amused, amusing and slightly
bumbling persona (as captured by science journalist Ferry, who adds meaty
chunks from her interviews with other major players) with the increasingly
furious, indignant tones of a prophet scorned. Those publications in
February, 2001, were not at all the glorious consummation trumpeted in the
press. Indeed, the human genome still isn't finished, although some 90
percent is now in the bag. Possibly it will not be complete until the
original HGP target date, 2003.

What's more, Sulston explains, Venter's spectacular coup in starting from
scratch years after the public program had allegedly plodded along, roaring
to a neck-and-neck finish, is at best spin and at worst flat untruth.
Celera's celerity depended on late generation sequencing machines developed
originally with funding from the public purse. Worse still, Venter's
`shotgun' method of sequencing chunks of code, then patching them together
like a jigsaw puzzle, only worked--to the extent that it did--because he
could appropriate maps generated by Sulston and others who strove to keep
the genome code in the public domain.

Despite promises, Venter's own data was rarely posted openly; indeed,
researchers were obliged to sign non-disclosure documents. This is not how
science has been done, as Sulston furiously points out, nor should it be.
Perhaps old-world gentlemanly openness just doesn't cut the mustard any
longer, does not produce either the scientific nor commercial goods? But
market exploitation, Sulston replies, simply has not achieved what it claims.

Celera, he argues, did science and won prizes by press release. Bizarrely,
the HGP and Venter's team shared an award for mapping the `landscape of the
genome' at a time when the public project's data was posted daily for all
to see, yet Celera's was not. None of it. `Had this ever happened before?
That an internationally reputable society would give an award for research
that was unpublished and unseen?' Easy to sympathise with Sulston's wrath,
although the press seems largely to have treated it as pique.

Does it matter, though, finally? Sulston shows how the public side of the
race was muffled or even effectively silenced in the USA by politics, for
nobody could speak out against market interests without upsetting Congress,
risking the sack or loss of government funds. Well, isn't this in turn just
another ideological spin? Sulston is clearly and unashamedly an old leftie
humanist who inveighs against `the power of the rich countries and of the
transnational corporations... used in a bullying and inequitable fashion.'

Economic libertarians will shrug off his rhetoric, noting that everyone
benefits from the swiftest possible unpacking of this genetic treasure
trove. That might be true in part; then again, private interests have tried
to patent not just partly mapped gene sequences (built by evolution, of
course, rather than human ingenuity), but also any future medical
applications of proteins the genes encode. It is like patenting air, then
levying a charge on breathing, inflated tyres, and the atmosphere of
Jupiter. You want to laugh out loud, but we dare not treat it so lightly.

I expect Sir John will have a Nobel Prize soon, and stand gritting his
teeth as Craig Venter shares it. Or maybe the Sanger Centre et al will be
written out of history. Let nobody be tempted to allow this, he urges us.
`The struggle over the human genome was necessary, and things would not be
the same today had not the public project stood firm.' Luckily, his book is
at once modest and a rattling good read. It might make a dynamite movie,
but Russell Crowe is probably way too intense to play the lead.

Sounds like a plan.  When you send it...just out of curiosity, let me 
know exactly how many you send it to in the first wave.  (Or have you
sent it already?)

Perhaps we can use this as an example to help set up a code of ethics
for this type of mailing.  The most obvious rules from this case: make
sure to include some way for the recipient to independently verify what
you claim, and only spread the truth.  (In this case, the "SSSCA" is
more or less well known among the halls of Congress, so any US
Representative or Senator should be able to confirm its existence.)

I had an offer for card design to - *possibly* - be one of the sessions
at the next Foresight gathering, but I haven't heard anything else about
that; since the program they've posted for said gathering doesn't seem
to leave any significant slots for this, I doubt it will happen (beyond
brief - say, 10 minute max - discussions that would most likely not
yield any significant contemplation as to what cards should be added).
Beyond that, just about all that's been going on, has gone on on this
list - including nothing for the past week or so.

To be perfectly honest, I was thinking Looney Labs or Cheap-Ass Games.
Steve Jackson might be too much for a targetted game like this.  But, if
you really think SJG might take a project like this seriously without
repurposing it to high sales and profit (which is any game company's
prime objective) as opposed to getting the message out...sure, it's
worth a shot.  (My main concerns specifically: making the game more
public-friendly in ways that utterly destroy its impact or even turn it
against us, and the ever-so-slight-but-nonzero chance of legal trickery
to try to claim rights to this type of game - not only to put control
into the hands of those who would never listen to us, and thus invoke
concern number one, but also to stop us from developing this game on our
own with any other publisher in order to address any severe philosophic
deficiencies.)

At least the legalese gives them a single person to contact, so I'll
know if they're taking the bait.

To me there seems to be a fundamental problem with the game structure. As I
understood from an (admittedly brief) skim of the paper, it went like this:

For each player:
- Get a sum of money (uneven; some players get more than others).
- Bet a sum of money (1 chance of triple money, 2 chances of lose bet)
- Choose which players to burn, and by how much.

The first two steps are totally in isolation from one player to another; one
player's bets make no effect on other players. Each player can see what is
happening for all players, however. This is meant to inform them of the
inbalance (inequity) in the game.

My problem is with the third step. 

The third step displays a grid with all player's earnings, and lets each
player choose how much to burn each other player, clearly showing the effect
on the burner - the player may experiment with different options before
comitting to a decision.

The problem is this... at the third step, the players are presented only
with the option to burn. Not burning seems to be performed by burning each
player for 0.

So the experimental subject is presented with a stage in the experiment
which appears to have no purpose; it's like a trick question. The subject
must ask "why is this here? am I missing something?"

I think it is likely that many players burnt others because they felt they
were expected to do something in the third stage. After all, these
experimenters are paying cash; you want to keep them happy. Doing nothing
doesn't seem to be, well, grateful, or being a team player, or whatever.

So, I suspect that experimental subjects felt some kind of implicit pressure
from the experimenters, via this burning screen at stage three, to burn the
other players. 

If such an expectation exists, then the experiment echoes the classic
experiment in which a person will administer electric shocks to another
person until they think that person has died, if an authority figure (white
lab coat) stands next to them and orders them to continue.

How would you fix this methodologically? For starters, you would make the
experimental subject make a deliberate choice to go to the burning stage,
which didn't make it feel like the "right path", but rather like a purely
optional stage. 

Also, you might allow giving money to others at cost to yourself, as well as
punishment at cost to yourself. If the experimenters are correct about
burning behaviour as deliberate, the subject should seek out the punitive
option, and should choose it even in the face of being able to reward
instead.

Having spoken to the founder of CAG before, I'd note that he has a "publish
it your damned self if it's such a good game, like what I did" attitude. He
has more games than he knows what to do with floating around in his head,
and more power to him.

SJG is scaling down operations at the moment, as I recall. OTOH, they're

OK.  Assuming that the research isn't totally flaky,
you know, like something performed by the Institute
for the Confirmation of Human Venality,... 

The article says that 62% of the folks behaved badly. 
Now, how about a more in-depth analysis. Specifically,
what are the characteristics of those
people--personality factors, ages, ethnicities,
educational levels, religious types/fervor, etc.--who
are winnerphobic vs those who are winnerphilic.

Best, Jeff Davis

Awhile back Eliezer shared about finding a very strange group on the net.  

Otherkin

http://www.otherkin.net/index.html

I perused this subculture website of "lost souls" and found it rather fun.

Some claim to be descended from angels, weres, dragons, elves, and various other magical creatures.  I think my own heritage is incubus/satyr on my father's side, and angelic/dragon on my mother's.  What a combination!

I'm just another otherkin mutt. ; )

I wonder what some of you might be?  This is a fun way to look at personality types.

best wishes,

John

Congress and Hollywood Want To Make You Pay More

Hollywood has gotten Congress to propose a law that will force you to have
to buy new VCRs, CD players, and computers. If you keep your old ones, any
new CDs, DVDs or movies you buy won't work! If you buy a new one, any old
CDs, DVDs or movies won't work! Either way, we're in trouble! Also, forget
about taking home videos -- you'll need to go to a professional place if you
want to make copies for your folks.

This little surprise bill is called "SSSCA" and is being slipped in by the
Hollywood movie moguls so they can make more $$$ and force us to buy the
same stuff twice. Anyway, I'm passing this along to everyone I know, it'd be

<rather chilling paper>
This research actually made the national press here in Britain a couple of
months ago. It even made my local paper (the Manchester Evening News).
(Interestingly, their take on it was that it showed people didn't like
people such as a certain well known football player who plays near here.)
Apart from its implications for technical economics (this blows a big hole
in several models of 'rational choice') I think there are two distinct
messages, one not so discouraging, the other very, very, discouraging. The
key finding for me is that there are two kinds of 'burners'. The first are
those who do less well in the initial allocation and/or betting stage. They
only 'burn' the better off when they perceive that they do not deserve their
winnings. The problem for the two economists is that while they recognise
the importance of a notion of desert for the 'burners' they have no way of
defining it or modelling it.  This finding confirms what anecdotal evidence
and empirical social research here in Britain would tell you, that there is
relatively low hostility to wealth and success when these are seen as earned
by hard work, ingenuity, or skill but very strong resentment of wealth which
is seen as disproportionate to any effort or the result of institutional
factors rather than the qualities of the individual involved. The second
kind of 'burners' are those who are relatively successful but still chose to
'burn' and when they do, 'burn' the lucky and unlucky alike. This is much
more disturbing and hard to explain except as pure envy and malice or
dislike of any kind of inequality, no matter how caused. I agree that a way
to check some of the findings would be to offer the option of transferring
some of your gains to others. Steve Davies

A story that's both amusing and interesting. It involves an experiment in
which a professional investment analyst, an astrologer and a five year old
girl were each given a notional sum to invest in the stockmarket. After a
year the five year old had a score of plus 5.8%, the astrologer had minus
6.2% and the analyst minus 46.2 (the stock market as a whole had minus 16%.

Quite apart from giving us the opportunity to laugh at the discomfiture of
the the analyst - schadenfreude is wonderful - this does raise yet again the
interesting question of prdicting the outcome of complex systems. Steve
Davies.

"How would you fix this methodologically? For starters, you would make the
experimental subject make a deliberate choice to go to the burning stage,
which didn't make it feel like the "right path", but rather like a purely
optional stage. 

Also, you might allow giving money to others at cost to yourself, as well as
punishment at cost to yourself. If the experimenters are correct about
burning behaviour as deliberate, the subject should seek out the punitive
option, and should choose it even in the face of being able to reward
instead.

Emlyn"

    ---------------------------

Indeed, it would be interesting to see how many of the 'winners' give up
some of their hefty winnings.  And how the other 'losers' would respond to
witnissing the winners give up some of their cash to the more harsh losers.
After all, that is what charity is all about, in essence, this expirement
made charitable donations impossible.  It seems reasonable to me that if the
rich were forced by law to keep all their earnings, then the poor would
definately seek retribution even at cost to themselves.  This paper and
expirement did not seem to be a very accurate represenation of reality.

Yes, I too would be interested in that.  In addition to radiation,
heat, ultrasonics and quantity there would appear to be opportunities
for fouling the intakes with small molecules that would tend to clog
the molecular sorting rotors.  The blue goo doesn't have to be deployed,
it can be stockpiled in local caches to be released upon detection
of excessive thermal densities.  As Robert pointed out in the ecophagy
paper "goo" scenarios are detectable by the heat density of rapidly
replicating nanotech.  If it keeps its replication level below
the detection threshold (i.e. no more than the background biomatter)
then random sampling techniques should suffice to determine whether
a stealth breakout is being attempted.

I don't see blue or grey goo interfering that significantly
with the green goo.

(As an aside, I'll note a new theory on the breakout of HIV
is attributing its spread to blood-sucking flies in African
markets where Chimpanze carcasses are sold as food.  The goo
is here already.)

Well, you could look at it as a sort of objective confirmation that
there is a natural human disposition to be a jealous materialistic
confiscatory socialist bastard (at least in England).

Another way to look at it is that it does conform to one of my own
rules: Anybody who tries to fuck Mike over will wind up enjoying the
experience even less than me. This is one of those rules that helps push
for a polite society. We shouldn't be surprised that England, being
still one of the most polite societies around, would have such a
strongly similar reaction, given the acceptance of the assumption that
someone elses gain is always your loss under any circumstances.

If such a behavior is universal, then we need to look at social
mechanisms which help keep such in check. In this case, popularizing the
meme that we should be happy when others get richer, on the theory that
eventually it will be our turn to do so, or something to that effect.
Aha, well then, we need to practice capitalism.... ;)

Well, keep in mind that it WAS conducted in England, where class
resentment remains one of the most popular sports. I'd be interested in
seeing how this experiment played out in different countries with
significantly different economic traditions.

Given the 4 to 1 cost ratio involved, its rather obvious that the
poorest came out the biggest losers in the end, as they wasted their
money on a spite they couldn't afford, and drew the greater ire of the
wealthy down upon them, and possibly helps to explain the 3rd generation
effect beyond just internal causes.

Well, I imagine the five year old girl probably bought stock in
companies whose products she used and liked. This strategy is one used
and advocated by Warren Buffet, so it can't be all bad. Of course, a
year period is not really sufficient. As any analyst will tell you, one
should always invest for the long term. One year is decidedly quite
short term. Going by decades, there is no other investment you can make
outside stocks which will always provide positive returns (or higher
ones).

This is all rather relative. Its the MISUSE that is the threat, not the
USE. So development of the technology per se is not necessarily a bad
thing. There are far more possible benefits from nanotech than risks,
and many of the risks are generally overblown based on insufficient
data. The risk in nanotech isn't from what we know, but from what we
don't know, and only further research is going to answer the questions
needed to accurately determine actual risk.

If mankind followed the precautionary principle through its history,
we'd all still be in the trees.

The girl actually picked shares to buy by picking up pieces of paper off the
floor, so it's as close to random as you can get (I agree the Buffet method
is a good one, unless you have really strange tastes). The point about a
year being short is true of course, but even so the interesting fact for me
is that in a year when the stock market fell 16% this random choice made a
5% gain while the analyst using computer models made a 42.6% loss - much
worse even than the average, never mind the little girl's performance.
Reminds me of the way Malachi Constant and his dad did their investment in
'Sirens of Titan' - by dividing the text of genesis up into three letter
blocks and investing in companies that had those initials:)

Sulston's pique seems to be based on a false premise: that there is a
public perception that the success of the Human Genome Project represented
a triumph of private enterprise over a government program.  But I don't
believe that this is how the public sees it, at least not in the U.S.
Even among libertarians, who are predisposed to believe the worst about
government, I don't think many would be comfortable giving the private
system this much credit.

At most I think people might say that Venter's challenge forced the
government program to get cracking and solve the problem more quickly.
The competition forced them to abandon their leisurely schedule and
produce the results that many years sooner.  But in the end I think the
perception is that the government at least tied Venter.

More generally, I think most Americans are quite oblivious to some of
the issues which are of overwhelming importance to British leftists.
The characterization of the conflict as being a cross-Atlantic rivalry,
with the government HGP program as being born out of a British effort,
in contrast with the "brash Americanism" of Venter, is new to me.
The significance of the fact that the HGP published in a British
journal while Venter published in America was also new.  Likewise the
casting of the competition in ideological terms as left versus right is
contrary to the American perception.  I think Americans generally see
it pragmatically, that the competition made both efforts work a little
harder and everyone benefited as a result.

That's an excellent analysis, Emlyn.  I would feel exactly that way
in an experiment of this type.  It would seem impolite to refuse to do
anything in this part of the game.  Your idea to give people some more
positive alternatives is very good as well.  I predict that we would
see completely different behavior in a game such as you describe.

Yes! 

I like this piece of Extropic Art because it seems Nancy Nisbet experienced an authentic "urge" when something clicked for her about the chip and potential personas. Like any insightful moment, she took this urge and implemented a connection artistically when she recognized its cultural significance.  

The beauty of the creative moment is when an abstract concept takes on a mental/emotional manifestation and is brought to fruition. It is more profound when an artist experiences the creative process in an urge-like moment, rather than strategically trying real hard to be cyborgish.

The National Organization of Rocketry (NAR) and the Tripoli Rocketry

http://www.tripoli.org/Documents/ATF_lawsuit_0200.html

I've thought about building hybrids from time to time, partly because rubber
is nearly inert until the oxidizer shows up. But if this recent activity is
evidence, not inert enough, maybe.

Despite my state of ill health, I am finding the energy to reply
to your insightful response, your understanding being refreshing
at a time when when so many others who have not read my books
are speculating, or commenting that it's no different from
a laptop and that I should simply remove it and run it through the
X-ray machine, etc..

And it was great to have had you on my thesis defense, since you
clearly have understood and appreciated my contributions.

The flurry of more than a thousand misinformed responses is
stressful and more than I can respond to individually.

Over the past 22 years, the system I wear has evolved, but still
consists of various phisiological monitors, actuators, etc., in a
multidimensional space that takes time to adapt to.  Adaptation is
evolutionary, and, unlike George Stratton's simple upside down
glasses that only take a week to adapt to (and only a day or two of
tripping and falling or bumping into doorways after the glasses are
removed) it takes me 2-3 years typically to adapt to any major
change in the design of my apparatus (it has evolved through
changes every year or two).  Early on, I did not wear it all the
time (but then again, most people don't wear their rigs all the
time, e.g. am I the only one who has never attended a wedding,
including my own, without having worn my rig?, e.g. despite social
pressures to conform to being not wired).  If I take it off for a
short time, I can "get back in" quickly, e.g. while bathing or
splashing around in the pool (which is different physics, anyway,
than walking so it doesn't "erase" the adaptation), but if I go
more than a day or so without being exposed to it, I feel that I'm
suffering brain damage to the large collection of neural pathways
that I've "grown" around my rig.

I think of this "brainmod" as the next step beyond implantables.
Implantibles.com as we envision them, are merely a "bodmod",
not much different than the tattoo on the forearm of a prisoner,
and as I describe in my book (my experience at Schwabia, Q.,
for example), implantables are not much different from wearables.
However, what's next beyond implantables is to "grow" the brain
and let it evolve, so that the natural wetware forms, e.g.
1970s: wearables that look like headphones, headsets, helmets;
1980s: smart sunglasses and jacket or vest based computing
(wearcomp4);
1990s: covert eyeglasses, dermaplants, etc.;
2000s: vitrionic contact lenses, implantables.com,
but a common "thread" running through my book, is the idea of
"growables" (the next thing after implantables become old
fashioned) which i expect others to begin experimenting with and
using around the 2010s.

That being said, my doctors are still uncertain what component of
my ill condition is due to head injuries and what is due to changes
to the brain after going more than a day or so without stimulating
the "grown" portion, kind of like atrophy of a big part of my
brain...

I could go on at length, but since enough people in the wearables
community seem interested in this, perhaps I should submit a paper
about it to ISWC, assuming that the organizers would be willing to
receive a paper presentation as a cyborg webcast (e.g. so I could
present it without having to undergo air travel)???

Presently I have an immediate need:

When I got back from the hospital, eight of my students unpacked
everything and determined that the raw components that were damaged
would cost approx. $60k to replace, machining, some manufacturing,
assembly and calibration costs being extra.  Perhaps folks have
some thoughts and ideas on how I could recover these immediate
expenses sooner than the typical 3 to 4 years a lawsuit ordinarily
requires.

I appreciate the outpouring of public sympathy and perhaps folks
have some thoughts and ideas on how to pressure the responsible
parties to mitigate their future liability by not prolonging the
damage that this "down time" is causing.

Another interesting paper along these lines is David Friedman's
"Economics and Evolutionary Psychology", a short and pleasant read
on his website <http://www.best.com/~ddfr/>.  It seems there are
many situations where people do not behave as rationally as
economists would predict, and reasonable good reasons for that.

No problem! If it's really necessary I can probably go in and edit out all 
the extraneous crap, but it's been a loooong time since I've done any html 
work and I've never done much with javascript so I don't know how good at 
getting things out I'd be.

Have you ever noticed how some kids can kick any adult's backside at many
computer games, including complex sims like the Sim City family, where they
can't even be expected to understand a lot of the concepts (eg: marketing,
demographics).

Discounting the possibility that kids have more time to practise (which is a
reasonable assumption, but hey), I wonder whether kids are good at some of
these games precisely because they don't understand what is being modelled?
While an adult who understands economics might approach a sim as though it
behaves like the real world, a kid would have to discover the behaviour of
the sim, completely divorced from its status as a model.

Similarly with the story below, are those who are naive about the stock
market better able to take on board observed patterns, and less weighed down
by expectation about how the market *should* behave?

I wonder if, with all the simulation computer games out there now, and
massively multiplayer games, we are training our kids to understand complex
systems in a deeper, though more intuitive way, than their elders do?

I imagine that there is a body of research in psychology investigating the
relationships between computer system, experimenter, and subject, in this
common modern psych experiment format (experimenters assist subjects who run
through a bunch of screens on a computer). The problems with this experiment
must be similarly confounding the results of many others.

If there isn't a strong body of research in this area, there really should
be.

The question is *what kind* of complex systems they are being trained to
understand.  Some relevant properties may not generalize from the kind of
complex systems that programmers create to the kind of complex systems that
arise in real-world ecologies, just as the social systems that arise in
MMPGs may not be fully analogous to our own society.  I would not say that
they are being trained to understand complex systems, but rather that they
are being trained as an army of conquest under the command of the game
designers.

Despite statement in the original post that this research explains the insufficient popularity of Libertarianism, IMHO this research
actually warns us *against* implementing systems like Libertarianism without fully understanding the effects or nature of human
irrationality and either taking steps to eliminate it or mitigate it. However, this might explain some aspects of communism quite
well.

As always, society experimenters should try their own systems at their own risk, with an opt-out option. They should also avoid
claiming that they have an ideal system until they can at least get it to work first.

What distinguishes this process from a machine randomizer, amusingly
enough, is the abstract possibility that the child's unprejudiced mind used
a black box combination of paranormal precognition and psychokinesis to
forecast the market and then guide the tumbling slips of paper to her pudgy

Actually, I don't think anyone was thinking of MY rights.  They were
legislating what surgeries the DOCTOR can ethically perform.  Cutting and
sewing human parts (or even the possession of a human part) is very much
regulated in the US.

If my augmentation could be done without surgery, I don't think I would have
had any problems.

Indeed, and Sulston's case (quite detailed in the book, of which my review
was a horribly reduced and abbreviated partial summary) is that the public
project was *not* `leisurely'. Its projected course, which is still not
complete, followed a pattern very familiar to people on this list if
nowhere else: a kind of accelerating curve where a load of difficult
ground-breaking exploratory machine-devising work produced small but
definite gains, which then bootstrapped later work incrementally into rapid
production of well-characterized and mapped sequences. It was always known
that most of the productivity would occur in the last few years, and this
happened pretty much on schedule (or so Sulston argues).

That's not it exactly--more that the US end of the public effort (under
Watson and then Collins) was more ideologically mired than the British end,
which was largely funded (ironically) by the non-government funds of the
Wellcome Trust. But you'll need to read the book for the interesting
details. It will be interesting to read some detailed reply from the
opposed corner.

>The significance of the fact that the HGP published in a British

That's *extremely* interesting; essentially, Sulston's view is that Science
breached its own traditional canons in running the Celera paper, since it
was grotesquely deficient in certain respects (mostly to do with the
inability of referees or other readers to gain access to key but restricted
information; again, the details are in the book). This was not Sulston's
`pique', by the way; Nature would not have accepted the defective US paper. 

"Michael Ashburner, the Cambridge Drosophila geneticist, joint head of the
European Bioinformatics Institute and a staunch supporter of unrestricted
data release, wrote an outraged letter to every member of [Science's] board
of reviewing editors, of which he himself had been a member until not long
before. He told them that he was refusing to review any more articles for
Science, or to submit any to the magazine if Science went ahead with the
Celera paper on the existing basis..." The letter circulated widely and was
much discussed, but barely surfaced in the press. Sulston's team had
originally intended to publish in Science, but finally withdrew and took
their work to Nature. The details in the book are quite fascinating,
whether or not one agrees with Sulston's position.

My boss, Jeff Greason, isn't a member, but you should run into him
there.  Are you the Elaine I'm thinking of, that I've met at Space

This is one of the reasons I have attempted to point to needed 
changes in human psychology and social institutions.  As long as 
people believe that others having means they have less they will 
react in these suboptimal and increasingly dangerous ways.  The 
same competition for limited resources type fear drives being 
against human augmentation and seeking to marginalize or 
penalize the more intelligent or capable.  The same mechanism 
will create great hatred of the first AIs.

I would not say the results show the dark side of human nature. 
  Saying that implies that we are stuck with this and there is 
nothing we can do.  I would say that this behavior shows the 
logical consequences of certain deeply embedded assumptions.  In 
  a world where scarcity has become sufficiently scarce we need 
to learn how to question and overcome those assumptions in 
ourselves and in our socio-economic lives.  The ability to 
create a viable future may well depend on it.

Your response doesn't seem to be quite what is going on or at 
least it doesn't seem to address what I was attempting to get 
at.  If doctors were being regulated to only necessary surgery 
then liposuction and plastic surgery would not be performed for 
as many reasons and as often as today as someone else mentioned. 
No, the underlying goal, whether voiced or not, is to avoid 
"unfair" multiplication of ability when it is applied to 
artificial enhancements.  In any case, if we want to augment 
freely then we must fight for the right to do so or sidestep 
such regulations.

If your augmentation is done without surgery then it may be 
confiscated as "mere property" as in the case of Steve Mann. 
Also, many types of augmentation likely can not be done as well 
without implantation.

A lot of people appear to be taking this experiment seriously. I think this
is probably a mistake.

I agree. The test seems to be logically the equivalent of a computer game.
People are trained to kill from the moment they sit in front of a screen.
The game was pre-set to generate the outcome and I bet it gets a lot more
publicity for those involved as a result. A touch of cynicism here?

Let the players look the opposition in the eye and have real stakes that
hurt. Hopefully some self-interested altruism will filter in.

So I sent the following out (with variations in the commentary, and the
subject "FW: Congress and Hollywood Want To Make You Pay More") to a bunch
of people I know. Anyone on the list who wants to try their hand at seeding
this viral meme as well, go for it. More the merrier!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is something of an experiment in activism for me and a few other
people; it came up on a mailing list. I know that you know a number of
people who tend to pass self-interest meme e-mails along, and this was
crafted to appeal to that mindset. I'd appreciate it if you could delete my
commentary and forward this to those people you know. Everything below is
100% true, by the way, and really only the tip of the iceberg if this thing
gets passed.

--------------

Congress and Hollywood Want To Make You Pay More

Hollywood has gotten Congress to propose a law that will force you to have
to buy new VCRs, CD players, and computers. If you keep your old ones, any
new CDs, DVDs or movies you buy won't work! If you buy a new one, any old
CDs, DVDs or movies won't work! Either way, we're in trouble! Also, forget
about taking home videos -- you'll need to go to a professional place if you
want to make copies for your folks.

This little surprise bill is called "SSSCA" and is being slipped in by the
Hollywood movie moguls so they can make more $$$ and force us to buy the
same stuff twice. Anyway, I'm passing this along to everyone I know, it'd be
great if you did the same. I guess you could write, fax or call your
congressman or complain at your local Best Buy, CompUSA, or Circuit City on
this.

Write Your Representative:
	http://www.house.gov/writerep/

Don't forget to add your signature to the petition!

Pass the message on!

You've probably heard that the Mayor of Nederland, Colorado, offered
to keep the "temporarily dead" Raymond Martinot and Monique Leroy, in
case the appeal is rejected. (It doesn't seem very serious though.)

http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1002,53%257E463571,00.html

In the meantime, several people at cryo organisations contacted me,
and asked for contact info (which I provided), as they were willing to
help or make propositions.

There were a few newspaper articles here, like this one by Le Monde
(very bad, doesn't deserve translation):

http://www.lemonde.fr/recherche_articleweb/1,9687,267032,00.html

It dismisses from the start any rational foundation to cryo, speaks
about the Egyptians already trying to preserve the bodies, about our
society unable to cope with death, etc.

It even speaks about "certainty" in the case of Martinot, while he
actually said he thought his attempt had only a very small probability
to succeed. (Had he been less isolated, maybe he would have been
slightly more condident.)

Following my writing to the medias, a journalist of "Le nouvel
observateur" is preparing a seemingly more interesting and thorough
article and we will talk about it together tomorrow morning.

Finally, a nice picture, not shown in the media:

http://hem.passagen.se/eled/whatisit2.html

Advice and suggestions always welcome. (probably best in private, but
do as you see fit)

I don't think the mindset is that surgery is "necessary" if it restores what
is considered "normal".  Liposuction and plastic surgery are done to
"restore" a person to normal-ness.  Plastic surgery started by correcting
gross deformities.  After a while, even a millimeter imperfection was
allowed to be corrected.  I suspect that a plastic surgeon who gave someone
three eyes or pointed ears would be frowned upon, maybe even have their
license revoked.

(I am not defending this point of view.  I am just stating that this is what
I think is going on.)

I don't think this is concious in the mind of doctors, but I will agree that
it is a concious decision in sports.  You can't take any drugs.  Think of
the uproar if someone with (superior) artificial limbs were to win in some
sport!

Yes. I think Emlyn's analysis a few posts back is correct - there is a
real risk for subject bias here. The situation reminded me of Eliezer's
"The game with no rules" - a lot of people see competition where there
are none, and if the setting also suggests that competition is somehow
relevant it might occur anyway.

I think that is a tad bit too cynical. This kind of paper is a dime a
dozen; lots of people are studying game behavior and getting all sorts
of suprising (and unsurprising) results. Some of these papers then get
noticed by the popular press, but that seems to be a more or less random
phenomenon.

It is cute, a bit sad but also says something important about the human
condition. From the FAQ (about whether this is all head-games): 

For example, if you can keep a stable job, a roof over your head, keep
up friendships, relationships and/or a social life, pay your bills, and
generally behave like a functional adult (if you're an adult :) ), then
it doesn't matter whether you consider yourself a human or a creature
from another planet. 

On a deeper level, many otherkin find that identifying as such --
identifying as an elf, or a dragon, or a vampire, or a pixie, or
whatever -- actually gives them *more* of a sense of stability in their
lives and understanding of themselves. If it's simply something you call
yourself, then maybe you are just playacting. But more likely, you've
found (or will find) that accepting and embracing your identification
and your nature as otherkin helps you understand things about yourself
that never made sense before. And if it does, then calling yourself
otherkin may be helping keep you sane.

(http://kinhost.org/res/Otherfaq.html)

Compare this with what Fukuyama wrote in the debate in Reason today.
Fukuyama claims that if people do not share the same human nature, then
we will end up in a bad, Nietzschean society. Otherkin are in a sense a
demonstration that this is by no means self-evident: they do not
consider themselves human, but still can function with other people who
have a different sense of species. What matters is not whether you are a
dragon in a human body or a clone, but if you can function together with
other people - that is really the only definition of "humanity" we need.
It feels good that we live in a society where human individuality has
gone so far that it is acceptable to claim to be one's own species.

In the future trans-species surgery and body alteration might become
possible, and then the otherkin and furries are really going to be
cutting edge.

Well, I have memories from a future life as the information
infrastructure of the Amsterdam metropolitan region, but my friends
here tend to claim I'm a quarter troll or a robot.

Damien, is there any discussion in the book of the switch
that took place in the American strategy?  Before Celera
was on the scene, the American strategy was similar to the
European strategy on the Yeast Genome Project -- many labs
taking a chunk of a chromosome and sequencing it.  After
Celera was started it switched to more of an industrial mode.
They decided to dump a lot of money into scaling up just a
few labs (MIT, Washington University, the DOE Joint Genome
Center, and perhaps a couple of more).  These are the labs
that ended up with rows and rows of capillary sequencers,
These were typically Molecular Dynamics machines because Celera
had a virtual lock on the production of the Applied Biosystems
machines.

In the end, much of the U.S. sequence came out of these labs
and not the couple of dozen centers that the project started
with.

Interestingly enough, there is such a lack of clarity with

Hello.

I hope I'm not going to step on anyone's toes, but
I've a few questions on transhumanism. I first ran
into the concept in Orion's Arm, a sci-fi setting at
www.orionsarm.com . In the course of that, I was
directed to the Extropian web site, and came across
their Extropian philosophy. It's sparked quite a few
questions, and I hope someone or -ones here can help
me with them.

The aforementioned philosophy is summarised in several
points, which I have taken the liberty of quoting
below.

"1. Perpetual Progress - Seeking more intelligence,
wisdom, and effectiveness, an indefinite lifespan, and
the removal of political, cultural, biological, and
psychological limits to self-actualization and
self-realization. Perpetually overcoming constraints
on our progress and possibilities. Expanding into the
universe and advancing without end."

At what cost? Every path you take means you're not
going down a different path. What paths have
been/are/will be passed over instead of going down the
path of perpetual progress?

That sounds negative, which is NOT my intent - merely,
there's a purpose for stability, for progress, even
(perhaps especially) for backsliding/entropy/etc. When
you choose one, the other(s) suffer. Not saying that
this is a bad thing, but I do wonder what other goals
have been sidelined in place of perpetual growth.

"2. Self-Transformation - Affirming continual moral,
intellectual, and physical self- improvement, through
critical and creative thinking, personal
responsibility, and experimentation. Seeking
biological and neurological augmentation along with
emotional and psychological refinement."

Is the order of self-improvements intentional?
Least-important to most-important, or vice versa, or
all important? What if they conflict - which takes
precedence?

"3. Practical Optimism - Fueling action with positive
expectations. Adopting a rational, action- based
optimism, in place of both blind faith and stagnant
pessimism."

What about faith in the general goodness of humanity -
which everything I've yet seen in transhumanism seems
to implicitly include. 

What about cautious pessimism, that keeps you from
destroying a top-rate mind with a poorly understood
experiment? 

My point is, is that this is a shades-of-grey
spectrum, not black & white. Practical optimism's a
great concept, IMHO, even if I may be seen as
pessimistic.

"4. Intelligent Technology - Applying science and
technology creatively to transcend "natural" limits
imposed by our biological heritage, culture, and
environment. Seeing technology not as an end in itself
but as an effective means towards the improvement of
life."

*nod* & *applause*. Tool USE, not becoming tools. This
is a wonderful statement, IMHO.

"5. Open Society - Supporting social orders that
foster freedom of speech, freedom of action, and
experimentation. Opposing authoritarian social control
and favoring the rule of law and decentralization of
power. Preferring bargaining over battling, and
exchange over compulsion. Openness to improvement
rather than a static utopia."

The previous comment about the faith in the goodness
inherent in the human beast applies here, IMHO.

Also - a general question when I start seeing the word
'freedom' tossed around - what about your
RESPONSIBILITIES? Are you responsible for your
neighbor's action? No? Then who helps you when your
other neighbor's "freedom of action" starts to be
applied to your nose, or dog, or daughter?

As for experimentation, that goes literally without
saying. The trick is experimentation without
inappropriate repercussion. Example - a woman walking
around without a veil/purdah in a fundamentalist
Islamic state: Should she be beaten? Is that an
appropriate response to her experimentation? I'm
pretty sure that one dose of the cane prevents most
further experimentation along those lines! However,
you can stop experimentation by the human creature by
either 1) complete and utter control, or 2) death. We
question, and in questioning experiment, and in
experimenting, learn. The trick is, as mentioned
above, to teach the cat not to sit on a hot stove.
(Story told by Mark Twain which may be paraphrased,
"If the cat sits on a hot stove lid, that cat's
learned a lesson - not to sit on any stove lids!")

"6. Self-Direction - Seeking independent thinking,
individual freedom, personal responsibility,
self-direction, self-esteem, and respect for others."

OK, throw out the old mores that brought us this far
and start fresh. *wry grin* I know, not quite what is
meant - more like, throw out the parts we don't like
and keep going. Question - WHO DECIDES? And again,
what happens when your neighbor's choice(s) threaten
you, either directly or through your loved ones?

"7. Rational Thinking - Favoring reason over blind
faith and questioning over dogma. Remaining open to
challenges to our beliefs and practices in pursuit of
perpetual improvement. Welcoming criticism of our
existing beliefs while being open to new ideas."

In general I strongly agree with this point. 

I hope that the members of this list will not take
this as an attack on their beliefs - such is not the
intent. Rather, these are concerns I have regarding
the aforementioned document, and I'd like some help
resolving them.

Thanks in advance,
John Benner

There are individuals, some of whom Natasha can clue you in on, who have
gotten legitimate doctors to do such surgeries: implants in the scalp
that appear as nascent 'demon horns', grinding and augmenting teeth to
appear more canine/feline or vampire-like. Furthermore, the whole breast
implant trend does more than just 'restore normalness' when 16 year old
girls are asking for Pamela Anderson type breats.

Of course, the good old boys in congress are all for breasts, so that
sort of above average augmentation sneaks on by. They also seem to be
for letting men have larger penises as well.

All of this, though is in the area of appearance, cosmetic surgery. It's
only when the surgery applies to improving something beyond mere
appearance and above the average that the 'ethicists' heads start to pay
attention (though a larger penis is certainly pushing the envelop...).
Improving the performance of things which 'really matter' like brain
function, eyesight, hearing, and sporting competetiveness are all areas
where augmentation above the norm is considered unethical.

As I've said before, the way to overcome this resistance by ethicists
will require that we help improve augmentations for the handicapped so
that the performance they acquire with augmentation is far above that of
normal people. When that occurs, normals can then sue to have these
outmoded ethical constraints removed because of democratic
considerations of equal protection: normals should have the same right
to a higher than normal level of performance that the handicapped enjoy.
Without such a development, it is normals who then become the real
'handicapped'.

First, this is Extropians, not to be confused with other brands of
transhumanism.

Every time we start down a particular path we eliminate other
possibilities. This is not exclusive to Extropianism. Rather than
remain satisfied with the status quo, we seek to advance ourselves
as well as provide the opportunity to others.

Concepts don't "suffer", and the concept is "perpetual progress"
not necessarily growth, at least not in the physical sense.

Intentional, although we welcome serendipity as well.

We have a positive outlook, which is very different than faith. We
do not delude ourselves about human nature.

A cautious pessimism might work, try it out and report back on the
results.

It's important to maintain a positive outlook.

While some may augment using mechanical devices this does not make
them less than human in this philosophy.

No, we believe in rule of law, just not that government is the only
possible source of such laws.

My neighbors freedom ends where he interferes with mine. In the
U.S. for example this is normally handled by governments. As
Extropians we also acknowledge our own rights to defend ourselves.

We support societies where individuals are free to experiment. We
seek to change societies where they are not.

Not necessarily throw out, but examine and question the validity
of. The individual decides, and as previously mentioned the end
result of personnal responsibility is that the individual assumes
responsibility for their own defense.

We welcome well reasoned challenge, it's how we stay sharp ;)

Thanks for the interesting points raised, I'm sure others will
comment.

In a carefully written and wonderfully polite message dated 3/19/02 7:32:28

Although I can understand why someone might think that transhumanist thought 
in general, and extropianism in particular, attributes inherent goodness to 
humankind, I think that interpretation would err.  I understand those world 
views to instead regard human as *including in their number* an appreciable 
number of intelligent and capable individuals who recognize the mutual 
benefits of peaceful cooperation.  Some humans, of course, lack those 
attributes, as realistic transhumanists recognize.

The error arises, I suppose, because transhumanists at least do not blame 
humankind for harboring inherent evil.  The converse does not hold, however.  
Rather, transhumanists go after the "inherent" part of that description, 
rather than the "evil" part.

Huh?  Of course humans are inherently evil.  And inherently good.  And
inherently acclimating to the environment.  And inherently general
intelligent.  And inherently constructors, communicators, and arguers of
moral philosophies.  I don't see why transhumanism would need to assume
anything in particular in this area.

Nope! At least the ears. 
<http://www.bmezine.com/news/people/A10101/htc.html> The bit on ear 
restructuring is about halfway down. Granted, Steve Haworth isn't a surgeon 
per se - but there are more people than you'd think with horns or o-rings 
in their arms or other such "weird" mods. AFAIK, Katzen's the only one 
who's gotten pointed ears, though.

Three eyes would be really neat if the new one could somehow be made 
functional.

A quick correction: when you asked whether the order of improvements
listed under "Self-Transformation" was intentional, did you mean
whether the various improvements were listed in order of desirability?
The answer is no, I think there was no intention to rank, say, moral
above intellectual above physical self-improvement, simply because that
was the order in which the words appeared.

Let me give you a more general answer rather than looking at your
questions point by point.  Extropianism is a personal philosophy,
and as such is not suited for everyone.  It seems that you find some
of the principles attractive, some not so much, and others perhaps
not practical.  It might be that Extropianism is not suited for you.
That's fine, it isn't meant to be for everyone.  On the other hand it
is possible that with time and thought, you would come to agree with
the key ideas of Extropianism.

A question you might ask yourself in order to determine whether you would
want to pursue Extropianism is this: Can you perceive an underlying
connection or common rationale behind the Principles?  Do you see how
they fit together to form a unifying whole, or do they instead seem to
you to be a random hodgepodge of ideas, some good and some bad?

To me, they all fit into a common pattern.  It's hard to boil it down into
a few words (that's why there are so many Principles) but the basic idea
is to take responsibility for your life and to try to be the best that
you can be.  All of the Principles fit together to provide guidelines that
can help and inspire us to continue to move forward towards this goal.

In itself, there is nothing radical about this philsophical goal.
I'm not a philosopher but I'll bet it goes back to the ancient Greeks.
What is new in Extropianism is to take it seriously; you might even say,
to take it literally.  With the new technologies that are going to be
becoming available, self improvement is taking on entirely new dimensions.

Extropianism embraces these new possibilities whole-heartedly and
courageously.  It takes the ancient idea of self-perfection and says,
at last we have the tools to make it happen.  We can take this old idea,
which in the past could be implemented only in the most minimal way,
and finally do something with it.

Extropianism provides a path through the 21st century and beyond.
But it is only one possible path.  Extropians have a head start because
most philosophies have not yet begun to grapple with the challenges that
the new technologies will pose.  But eventually other philosophies will
arise that provide their own paths.  It will be up to you to find the
way that is in accord with your own values and beliefs.

I just read today another case like this, at New Scientist,
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992061.

Science will be publishing a special issue to commemorate the sequencing
of the rice genome on April 5.  This is considered one of the most
important plant genomes because rice is the primary food source in many
parts of the world.  The hope is that the having the genome will help
in engineering rice to improve its productivity and nutritional value.

However the company which did the sequencing, Sygenta (a Swiss company),
isn't sure that they want to release the data to the public.  Ashburner,
referenced above, is up in arms.  He has released another letter,
co-signed by 20 top geneticists, demanding that Science not let them
publish if they won't release the data.

Normally it is a requirement for publication in Science (and in
science, for that matter) that the experimental data be made available.
An exception was made for Celera's publication of the human genome in
Science.  Now presumably based on that precedent Sygenta is waffling on
whether it will release the data.

It will be interesting to see how it comes out.  We saw a case with
the bubble fusion a few weeks ago where pressure on the Science editor
backfired.  It seems that he has a stubborn streak.  Paradoxically,
Ashburner's letter might make him react the same way, which would
strengthen Sygenta's hand and make it easier for them to publish without
releasing the genome.  Watch for what happens on April 5!

Well, since artificial eyes have been tested, it could conceivably work,
but the problem is on the processing end, since you've got only two
optic nerves. You are left with trying to splice into one of the
preexisting ones or else somehow engineering a third optic nerve.

The point is that each individual should be free to determine their own
path, no matter what that path may be, so long as it doesn't harm
others. We want all paths to be available for all, not just for one.

So long as it is left to the individual to choose their path, they can
choose to live in stasis, progress, regress, etc.

That is why its practical rather than pollyannish. Practical optimism
takes into account that while most people try to be good most of the
time, there are and will always be exceptions. We just don't think that
everyone should be dunned all the time because of the occasional bad
acts of a few.

We think that the world should be structured in a way that trusts people
to be innocent until they do something bad, to use technology safely
until they, as individuals, do not do so.

I am assuming that you are an American (please correct me if I am
wrong). In the US, at least, it has always been your own responsibility
to defend yourself against the offenses of others (numerous Supreme
Court decisions can be cited). The alleged police motto of 'to protect
and serve' is untruth, propaganda, without substance. Outside of this,
under the UN UDoHR, the right of self defense is a recognised human
right.

We as extropians 'supporting social orders' that promote open society
therefore support the right (and concommittant responsibility) for the
individual to defend themselves against the improper initiation of
coersion.

Fundamentalist islamist societies have been a bane on the individual for
many centuries, and on this list there has been regular comment against
the sort of coersion that occurs in such societies for a number of
years.

However, IF an individual chooses to belong to such a society, to
believe in such a society, they are consenting to the above described
repression. If they are trapped, unable to leave, that is certainly the
case with a large number of the women in the muslim world, that is
another case. However I find it rather interesting that so many Afghan
women are freely choosing to continue to wear the burkha. Makes you
wonder who it is that is actually feeling repressed.

We generally follow the small 'l' libertarian principle of
non-initiation of violence. This is not an absolutist pacifism. You are
free to use proportionate force against one who initiates force against
you. Your neighbor's right to swing his fist ends at your nose.

I, and many others here, are generally opposed to the idea that freedom
means that a strict moralist should be free to impose their morals on
others. A landlord who engages publicly in commerce shouldn't be able to
grant or deny housing to those who engage in activities they disagree
with (though whether such activities are legal is another point
entirely), any more than you should be able to refuse service to someone
who is black, or female, or foreign, etc. if you engage in public
commerce. Private commerce is something else entirely, and generally,
obviously, it can at times be difficult to delineate between the two.

You may be free to deny service to others, but if so, then those others
are free to tell the world about it, and if the rest of the world denies
service to you as a result, well, then, that is your problem, isn't it?

I generally don't see this as any sort of attack, merely questions about
finer points of interpretation.

My comment probably didn't make any sense to most people.
(Thats what happens when you spend the day reading a
couple of hundred PubMed abstracts...).

I was thinking along the lines of "experimenting" to
correct the genetic/mental defects of "sociopaths".
In which case it would likely be preferable to postpone
correcting such conditions (via experiments) until they
were "well understood".  I'll admit that this may be
difficult given the complexity of the human brain.

There is nothing wrong with "cautious pessimism" but you
have to avoid this sliding into the "precautionary principle"
(where you never do anything until you are 100% sure it is safe).
Different humans have different tolerance for risk.  I would
hate to see us sliding into one degree of risk fits all
society.  I expect, like seatbelts and motorcycle helmets,
that experimental risks should evolve into an enclave
situation.  In some enclaves you will not be able to
give informed consent with regard to some experiments
without having an MD and a PhD in molecular biology.

Trying to recall the name of the English SF Author -
he's been mentioned before on the list as an
Extropian, in belief, if not in name - who wrote a
whole future history series in recent years in which
transgenic art played a major role.  One of the
characters had renamed himself Oscar Wilde and set out
to sleuth a murder in which transgenic art pieces were
the weapons as the plot of one of these.  Who knows
who I'm referring to??

scerir (scerir@libero.it)on Thu Mar 07 2002 - 14:31:09
MST quoted 'Transgenic art, I propose, is a new art
form based on the use of genetic engineering
techniques to transfer synthetic genes to an organism
or to transfer natural genetic material from one 
species into another, to create unique living beings. 
Molecular genetics allows the artist to engineer the
plant and animal genome and create new life forms. 
The nature of this new art is defined not only by the
birth and growth of a new plant or animal but above
all by the nature of the relationship between artist,
public, and transgenic organism. 
Organisms created in the context of transgenic art can
be taken home by the public to be grown in the
backyard or raised as human companions. 
With at least one endangered species becoming extinct
every day, I suggest that artists can contribute to
increase global biodiversity by inventing new life
forms.'

RU kidding?  Just to view this stuff is beyond most
people's computer.  6000 x 6600 is a LOT of bytes. 
Even jpegged down to the lowest I could get without
being seriously noticeable, that's 12 Megs.  When I
printed it out at the local digilibrary on their
wonderful FREE wax-transfer Xerox printers, I had to
cut it up into a bunch of pieces to fit on floppies -
about 9 of them, as I recall.  If we ever have any
meetings here in OC, I'll try to bring some prints.

Why not the genomes of organisms used in/for medical experiments?  This
way, there can be an even tighter link between medical research and
genomics.  Also, the genomes of organisms used for food or any human
use, such as trees used for lumber.  This might have manufacturing
applications.  (I'm talking about the ones that haven't been done yet.)

In response to my suggestion that transhumanists do not attribute inherent 
attributes to humankind, Eliezer S. Yudkowsky wrote, in relevant part:

Those juxtapositions suggest that you took me to say that *no particular 
human* has an inherent nature.  I instead meant to convey the notion that 
transhumanists do not attribute the same set of attributes to each human.  
Hence my use of "humankind" rather than "humans."

Even at that, I suppose that transhumanists need not necessarily regard 
humans as variable and flexible.   I think that transhumanists generally do 
and should hold that view, however, since the alternative would trivialize 
their philosophy.  A transhumanist who claims all humans are by nature and 
definition uniform and unchanging would have to claim "trans" status for even 
relatively trifling modifications of the human stuff.  Better, I think, that 
transhumanists should recognize variability and flexibility as fairly common 
among humankind, and present their call for more radical self-modification as 
a logical extension of those virtues.

Its already beyond that.  People are doing double and triple knockouts
to determine gene function and have genes they can switch on and off
in specific tissues or in response to specific external signals to
test a hypothesis.

The problem is this isn't the mission of the DOE.  Though the
DOE has funded the sequencing of several organisms that can
digest cellulose and/or lignin.  I think this is in the hope
less energy intensive methods for paper production might be
developed.

As someone pointed out there is a big debate brewing about the
open publication of the rice genome.  I know there are perhaps
two or more other groups working on sequencing rice.  Corn and
especially wheat will probably be postponed for a while because
they are really big genomes.

There is a big gap between a microbial genome of a few
megabases and higher level organisms that start at around
~500 MBP and go up to 10's of GBP.  You can get a lot of
microbial genomes for the cost of a single higher level
organism genome.

> This might have manufacturing applications.
> (I'm talking about the ones that haven't been done yet.)

Yes, there are certainly some interesting manufacturing
applications.  Surprisingly there is a big gap currently
between what we already have (more than 100 genomes) and
applications of that information.  I think I've got until
March 28th to get my favorites list into the DOE, so if
anyone has any good ideas please let me know.

Robert

What about those bacteria used to produce electricity from mud reported
in Nature a while back? And while we are still at it, Pseudomonas
stutzeri AG259 (which grows regular silver crystals) might be useful. 

Another useful genome would be the mosquito genome, since it is a highly
relevant disease vector. But that may not be DOE's table.

I would certainly tend to attribute the same set of brainware adaptations to
each human.  Of course different humans may use them differently.

I tend to break it all down into the panhuman layer of complex functional
adaptations; the gaussian layer of variance in abilities and other
bell-distributed quantitative variables (height, weight, etc.); and the
personality layer containing patterned content such as mind, memories, and
so on, plus analogous physical characteristics such as facial features.

A "transhuman" is, at the least, a couple of sigma *off the curve* with
respect to the gaussian layer.  I'm not even sure I would regard that as
transhuman.  I think real transhumanity requires improvements at the level
we currently regard as panhuman.

I think that transhumanity involves a difference-in-kind from ordinary
self-improvement.

You might like these, they are not 'Chaos' though. The engine

Quoth Hal Finney:
"A quick correction: when you asked whether the order
of improvements listed under "Self-Transformation" was
intentional, did you mean whether the various
improvements were listed in order of desirability? The
answer is no, I think there was no intention to rank,
say, moral above intellectual above physical
self-improvement, simply because that was the order in
which the words appeared."

Thank you for the clarification (and your
confirmation, Dr. More.) However, this brings up an
interesting point.

Improvements are, IMHO, something we need to seek out.
However, we're well ahead of the curve in some fields
of inquiry (notably technical/science) and well behind
the curve in others. The field I feel we are furthest
behind in is the adaption of people to technology.

As a case in point, television is a relatively-new
technology which has been sought after for several
hundred years. We Americans (and many other
nationalities - I'm American and prefer to speak to
what I know best) have spent the last seventy years or
so adapting and acclimatizing ourselves to deal with
it and its repercussions. I'd like to point out the
increase in 'couch-potatodom' and the rapidly blending
youth cultures as two examples of ongoing processes.

However, we're not trying to adapt to a static
baseline. The technology we're starting to add to the
situation (TIVO and the like) exacerbates the changes
we're making - in unpredictable ways. 

The point of all this, is that as technology
increases, our grasp of it decreases - the singularity
approaches. And, rather than some mystical event
occurring where humanity suddenly understands
technology much faster (Ok, not mystical, but
potential IA or AI technology isn't something we can
do TODAY and which we have no real conception of its
limitations) we just keep falling further behind,
perhaps to the point where we can no longer adapt to
our technological changes.

Other systems which we're still adapting to include
(but by no means are limited to) cars,
internetworking, and digital recording, just as other
representative major technologies.

Sure, perpetual progress is a wonderful goal - but IMO
we need to worry about WHAT we're progressing on. Do
we have even the beginnings of an understanding on how
the technology will disrupt the social, political &
economic systems we currently depend on? Usually there
are hints which are quite visible in retrospection,
but quite difficult to pick out before they hit. 

Do I say stop developing new tech? Understandable
interpretation, but it isn't my intention at all.
Rather, we need IMO to focus on the USE (and abuse) of
the technology as much as on developing it.

Mr Finney also stated,
"A question you might ask yourself in order to
determine whether you would want to pursue
Extropianism is this: Can you perceive an underlying
connection or common rationale behind the Principles?
Do you see how they fit together to form a unifying
whole, or do they instead seem to you to be a random
hodgepodge of ideas, some good and some bad?"

As with any large-scale philosopy, I do perceive
potential for both good and bad results derived from
it. It depends on the interpretation and emphasis
which are applied to the written words. This is why
I'm asking for input from the mail list regarding some
of the terminology and wording used - I see some areas
in the philosophy as written which worry me, and other
parts which I applaud. I'd LIKE to say I see the
worries totally disappearing and the applaudable
sections approaching unity, but I'd be lying if I said
I did. 

As stated elsewhere in the posts in regards to my
example of a fundamentalist Islamic state, these
states are strongly repressive. However, the written
word which (supposedly) guides Islamic states - the
Quran/Koran - is quite a liberal document, strongly
supporting the rights of the individual and condemning
violence. It is the interpretation which the various
governments utilize which I see as 'bad'. 

Yes, I personally do see a connecting thread between
the elements identified in the extropian philosophy.
However, most any self-coherant philosphy - be it
christianity, radical nazism, whatever - maintains a
connecting thread between the elements in the minds of
those who espouse the belief. I personally do not
espouse the extropian philosophy, but I am intrigued
by it. I am VERY glad that this is an 'open'
philosophy - that is, one which recognizes that there
may be other valid paths forward. There is much good
in the extropic movement, and I'd hate to loose access
to the minds who brought this about.

Thanks for your time,
-John Benner

Assuming that we can agree on what the singularity is, I will bet $10,000 US
dollars that it will not occur by Jan. 1, 2010.  I will make such bets with
as many people who want to bet.  This could be my new retirement plan.

I really had to laugh when I read this, Mike.  For my 'O' level English
examination final (British System) we were asked to write a short story.  My
effort was a Spy Story that told how a secret agent single-handedly gathered
a huge library of intelligence data, encoded it into DNA, injected it into
the living cell of a single hair follicle which he then implanted into his
skull.  On the way out of the 'foreign' country he was searched from
head-to-toe, his clothes & baggage were confiscated, etc., but he still got
out with the data "in his head".  This was waaaay back in 1981 (cold war and
all that) so the story line might seem a little dated, but hey!  I was only
16.  The Examiners must have liked the story because, even though I am
certain it was too short, and filled with spelling and grammatical errors,
they still gave me a B+    :-D

Perhaps, more than twenty years later, technology is starting to catch up
with my youthful imagination?

Naaaaah!  ;)

I'll book 'em if you want to make 'em: I'll set the line
at 2020.  Personally I'd take the "over" on that line, but
I'm one of the pessimists on that score here, so I think
that line is likely to be about right.

Dude, that is so weak.  If you're going to encode messages in DNA, I expect
all the information to be encoded by selecting between several different
codons that indicate the same amino acid.  For example, UUU and UUC both
code for phenylalanine; UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, UCA, and CUG all code for
leucine, and so on.  By selecting which codon represents a given amino
acide, you should be able to code at least one bit of information into most
codons.  That way you can encode information into the specification of an
arbitrary protein, with the expressed protein remaining constant through the
encryption process.  Of course this does not permit you to encode one letter
per codon, more like one bit per codon, but the one-to-one correspondence
was a weak scheme anyway.  Alas, I'm not sure this trick would work with
whole organisms; it might throw off the genes that regulate the suppression
and expression of genes.

Isn't it just as, or, more important, to 'adapt the technology to the
people'? Your question seems to assume that technology is forced on
the individual.

The individual *chooses* (building it, if possible, or
buying/accepting it, if available) of what is and what is not useful
to advance one's life, furthering one's goals.

Ah, yes, the old Singularity-As-Sucker-Bet trick.  Heck, I'll bet $10,000 US
against $100 US that the Singularity will not occur by Jan. 1, 2030.  This
could be my new source of pocket change.

In the above, UCA should have read CUA.  As we all know, UCA is the codon
for serine, not leucine.  You can all stop the derisive laughter now.

An excellent philosophy, IMO. However, the bugs within
it are quite pointy of jaw. Who maintains these
freedoms? IE - if the Schmoe Clan decides their
freedom to ride their (insert vehicle/beast here) over

we're not talking freedom - we're talking a form of
violent anarchy. If there are social restrictions, do
they truely inhibit everyone? If there are technical
restrictions (publicly accessible nanobot reporters,
for instance), how hard is it to spoof them or
otherwise subvert them? 

Unless there's some external force - a government, a
utterly fair clan of judges, massive social stigma
against it - just the search for freedom will (IMO)
become something much worse quite rapidly. It's a
little more stable than true anarchy, but not by much.

I agree, I'd prefer to live in a world where it's safe
to assume that the neighbor's breeder reactor is
utterly safe and the aforesaid neighbor has no
intention of nuking myself or others. However, finding
an active breeder reactor upstream or upwind would
worry me significantly due to the incredible toxicity
of its products and the relative ease with which
mistakes may be made. 

To address your second paragraph, I don't believe the
great majority of people are intionally planning mass
murder, but I would like to be able to determine which
of my neighbors ARE intending it, if any, and be able
to react to that threat before it materializes.

Does this make sense to you?

interesting that so many Afghan women are freely

wonder who it is that is actually feeling repressed."

Or, more likely to my mind, who has been conditioned.
Learning isn't always a beneficial experience. It is
possible to 'teach' someone (better known as
'condition') to avoid certain thoughts and practices.

Indeed. And this is one of the big sticking points
between public sector and private sector. However, and
please correct me if I'm wrong here - doesn't the
extropian community suggest going with private law?
And, as it's private law, wouldn't this give the
people involved the right, per your arguements, to
deny service (infringe the rights of?) others?

The Singularity *is* IA and AI, by definition.  The Singularity is the point
in time when technology improves on human intelligence, and the subsequent
breakdown of our current models.  This is Vinge's original definition.  The
latecomer "acceleration" version of the Singularity is a noncanonical mutant
spinoff meme.

There is a claim on the Foresight Exchange about the winning of the
Feynman Grand Prize, http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=FyGP.

This requires assembling many copies of two extremely ambitious nanotech
devices: a robot arm capable of 1000 positioning motions/sec with 0.1
nanometer accuracy(!) anywhere in a 50 nm side cube, said arm fitting
entirely within a 100 nm cube; also, an 8 bit binary adder fitting
within a 50 nm cube which produces its outputs as raised bumps on a
smooth surface.

I suspect that it will take nearly Singularity level technology to
produce these devices, or alternatively that producing them means that
we are so far along the nanotech development path that the Singularity
is just around the corner.

The claim is designed to produce an estimate of the date at which
this prize will be awarded.  I created it in 1996, and for the first
couple of years the date was in the late 2020's to the 2030 time frame.
Since 1999 it has stabilized around 2020 or a year or two earlier.
Currently it is at 2018.

I believe Drexler's Foresight Institute was running some kind of betting
pool about nanotech, but I couldn't find any information on their web
site.  Does anyone have information on what kinds of dates it predicted?

Subject: Growing meat in vats
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org

An ancient science fiction dream has been growing meat in vats, providing
high quality protein without having to kill animals.  New Scientist has
an article at http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992066
about an early experiment showing promise along these lines.

Chunks of fish muscle tissue 5-10 cm long were immersed in "fetal bovine
serum", a growth medium made from calves blood and widely used for cell
growth experiments.  After a week, the muscle tissue had grown 14 percent.

FDA regulations forbid tasting the meat, but the researchers actually
fried it up with a little olive oil and by all accounts it looked and
smelled delicious.  Apparently there's no law against cooking the meat,
you just can't eat it.

They are hoping to find a growth medium less likely to gross people out
or make them worry about mad cow disease.  Not to mention that having to
kill a bunch of fetal cows in order to grow meat in vats kind of defeats
the purpose...

In other words, you think people should be forced to do business with
people whose morals they disagree with? A black gun store owner should
be forced to sell to white supremacists?

I don't understand the distinction between public and private
commerce. Could you elaborate?

Exactly. So why the public/private distinction?

Private discrimination is one of the contentious issues of
libertarian thought, along with others such as capital punishment,
intellectual property, "acceptable" risk to others, emergency
use of coercion, etc.

Mike's position is not typical, but is not uncommon: Most libertarians
fully support the right of private individuals to discriminate,
including in their "public" affairs and business, such as choosing
who they will sell to or rent to.  Bigots have the same property rights
as more sensible folk, and their irrational practices should be punished
in the free market, not the courts.  They acknowledge, though, that the
government, and monopolies supported by the government, do not have
that right, and such monopolies must treat all persons equally.  The
government and government-supported monopolies by definition cannot be
pubished by the marketplace.

Current U.S. law is a confusing hybrid of the two positions.  There
are specific sets of actions and specific types of discrimination that
are prohibited even by private individuals and businesses, but other-
wise individuals are free to discriminate.  Likewise, the government is
prohibited from discriminating for a specific set of reasons, but it
too is allowed to discriminate for others.

I think the Extropian priciples recognize that such behavior is
irrational, and that it should therefore be disapproved of; but
that it is not in itself sufficient justification for using force
to override individual choice.  I would classify discrimination as
a sin along the lines of using astrology: you should know better,
but I'm not going to stop you.

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; ### Do you think that the feedback loops focusing the AI</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; on a particular</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; problem might (in any sufficiently highly organized AI)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; give rise to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; qualia analogous to our feelings of &quot;intellectual unease&quot;,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; and &quot;rapture</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; of an insight&quot;?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Eliezer:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; I do not pretend to understand qualia.&nbsp; But what focuses the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; AI on a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; particular problem is not a low-level feedback loop, but a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; deliberately</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; implemented feedback loop.&nbsp; The AI controls the feedback.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; The feedback</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; doesn't control the AI.&nbsp; Unless an FAI deems it necessary to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; shift to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; human pleasure-pain architecture to stay Friendly, I can't</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; see vis mental</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; state ever becoming that closely analogous to human</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; emotions.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; #### I tend to think that qualia might be the unavoidable</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; accompaniment of information processing. This is in a way equivalent to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; saying that consciousness is a feature of every information processor,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; albeit to a varying degree. My PC has the amount of consciousness (if you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; excuse such a vague expression) perhaps equivalent to a beetle.&nbsp; An SAI</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; would have much more of this precious quality. Whether there would be an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; analogy to human emotions would depend on the amount of similarity between</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; the panhuman template and the SAI's motivational mechanisms, but I do</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>think</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; that qualia of some sort would be present.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Eliezer:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Another academically popular theory is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; that all people are blank slates, or that all altruism</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; is a child goal</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; of selfishness - evolutionary psychologists know better,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; but some of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; social sciences have managed to totally insulate</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; themselves from the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; rest of cognitive science, and there are still AI people</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; who are getting</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; their psychology from the social sciences.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;Me:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; ### Is altruism something other than a child goal of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; selfishness?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Eliezer:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Within a given human, altruism is an adaptation, not a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; subgoal.&nbsp; This is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; in the strict sense used in CFAI, i.e. Tooby and Cosmides's</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &quot;Individual</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; organisms are best thought of as adaptation-executers rather</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; than as</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; fitness-maximizers.&quot;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Me:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; What is an adaptation if not an implementation of a subgoal</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; of a goal-directed process? Whether you view a behavior as an adaptation</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; a goal in itself depends on your value set. Since I tend to see my</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>survival</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; as the one foundation of my goal system, all other elements of my</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; personality are either adaptations (e.g. controlled altruism allows me to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; participate better in the society) or obstacles (e.g. laziness). Other</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; thinkers might adopt the (hypothetical) view-point of &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;The Human</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Being&quot;, etc., yet independent, absolute criteria can only indirectly force</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; choice of any of these outlooks - outlooks incompatible with long-term</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; survival are likely to disappear from the pool of participants in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; discussion.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Eliezer:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; total altruists ninety-nine point nine percent of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; time. Thus, even</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; though our &quot;carnal&quot; desires are almost entirely</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; observer-centered, and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; our social desires are about evenly split between the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; personal and the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; altruistic, the adaptations that control our moral</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; justifications have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; strong biases toward moral symmetry, fairness, truth,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; altruism, working</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; * &gt; for the public benefit, and so on.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; *</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Me :</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; ### In my very personal outlook, the &quot;moral</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; justifications&quot; are the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; results of advanced information processing applied</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; in the service of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &quot;carnal&quot; desires, supplemented&nbsp; by innate, evolved</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; biases.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Eliezer:</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; By computation in the service of &quot;carnal&quot; desires,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; do you mean computation</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; in the service of evolution's goals, or computation</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; that has been skewed</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; by rationalization effects toward outcomes that the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; thinker finds</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; attractive?&nbsp; In either case the effective parent</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; goals are not limited to</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Me:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; I think that it would be counterproductive to say</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; that evolution has goals. While evolution leads to some future state, this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; state is not a goal. You need to have a representation of a state within a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; structure capable of controlled behavior (human brain, thermostat)&nbsp; for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>this</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; state to be called a goal.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Did you say &quot;carnal&quot; in the strict sense of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &quot;related to the bodily, especially sexual, needs&quot;, or in the looser</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>meaning</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; of &quot;related to subjective, self-oriented needs&quot;? My analysis was based on</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; the latter interpretation.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Me:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; The initial</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; supergoals are analyzed, their implications for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; action under various</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; conditions are explored, and the usual normative</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; human comes to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; recognize the superior effectiveness of fairness,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; truth, etc., for</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; survival in a social situation.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Eliezer;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; I think this is a common misconception from the &quot;Age</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; of Game Theory&quot; in</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; EP.&nbsp; (By the &quot;Age of Game Theory&quot; I mean the age</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; when a game-theoretical</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Eliezer;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; And even then the results would be suboptimal</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; because people instinctively</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; mistrust agents who employ altruism as a subgoal</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; rather than &quot;for its own</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Me:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Yes. We want to deal with humans who are prevented</FONT>

I don't see what's wrong with this.  One possibility is that you might just
gulp down a couple hundred (thousand) IQ points directly, thus obviating
"eventually".  Another possibility is that after chatting with the FAI for a
couple of hours, you would have heard several major revelations about
morality - i.e., incremental advances small enough to be accepted relative
to your current knowledge - and would therefore be willing to credit that
the FAI knew something about morality.  Based on the inductive
generalization from observed abilities of the FAI, and deductive reasoning
about the probable capabilities of a transhuman, you might then be willing
to assign a high probability that moral guidance received from the FAI is
accurate.  I guess you could call that "faith" but I don't see why it
couldn't be governed by the Bayesian Probability Theorem just like
everything else.

The 80% of humans who wish to "strike down the infidels" all wish to strike
down different infidels, and would, if asked for a moral justification of
their various hatreds, ground their justifications in moral reasonings that
rest on different objective falsehoods.

Earth, the Galactic Luddite Preserve, may ban nanotechnology (i.e., the
summed volition of the Pedestrians may be a ban); I see no reason to ban it
anywhere else.

Perhaps humans will tend to accept what an FSI says to the extent that they
want the FSI to talk to them, as opposed to wanting to be left alone.

We verify the excellence using the same philosophy we used to arrive at all
the moral content we gave the FAI to start with.  If an FAI develops the
ability to do moral thinking that is so advanced as to be incomprehensible
to us mere humans, it would presumably be accompanied by the ability to toss
out a few trivial tidbits that are tiny enough incremental advancements over
current understanding for us mere moral bozos to grasp them and be
enormously impressed.

Okay.  I disagree.

Human subgoals are far more context-sensitive than evolution's subgoals. 
Evolution is limited to induction.  If it didn't happen to your ancestors at
least once, then from evolution's perspective it doesn't exist.  A subgoal
can be adjusted in realtime; adaptions are fixed except over evolutionary
time.

The philosophers rationalized an impulse which they already possessed.  That
humans possess altruism as an indepedent adaptation tells us that there were

were not produced by independent a priori reasoning in at least some humans
at least some of the time.  Otherwise there would have been no selection
pressure.  That some philosophers may have been able to rationalize
evolution's conclusion after the fact does not mean that they rationalized
all of the conclusion, that they would have reasoned to that conclusion

As I detailed later, its all a matter of market signalling. You can
refuse to do such business. Just don't be too shocked if the rest of the
world refuses back.

Should a white store owner sell to Black Panthers, or just to the local

There was a radio-show from the 1950's, which had a chicken-heart experiment, 
in which unlimited growth ended up covereing large parts of the earth. I 
suspect it had a happy ending (Col Saunders showed up?). Perhaps less a 
chance to grow food then an express use for tissue engineering?

I'd just like to take this opportunity to say that Fukuyama really makes me
grit my teeth. I find it hard to fathom how someone can be either a) so
completely slimily duplicitous in arguing for a point of view advocating the
deaths of billions, or b) clueless and smart at the same time. And he has
the ear of people who write legislation.

Survival is not a binary state.  Are you trying to increase the average
survivability of all humans, or making sure that all humans survive
minimally?  Having everyone "win" could very well mean that no one wins.

And what is an "innocent human" in the context of survival?

Nanotubes are Hot, and might be made to act like tiny filamentary
light bulbs, a nanometric equivalent of the carbon filament light
sources of a hundred years ago. A group of physicists at the
University of Claude Bernard in Lyon, France sends currents through
carbon nanotubes. The electrons, when they arrive at the end of the
tube will, if the voltage is high enough, fly forward toward an
anode. Such a "field emission" (FE) effect could someday be a
component in flat-panel displays.(Physical Review Focus 3/13/02)

Entropy Gives DNA a Shove. Snaking Around. Long, ropelike DNA
molecules maximize their entropy by slithering free of a confining
forest of small pegs. DNA isn't just for cloning sheep. The stringy
stuff also ideally illustrates the effects of entropy, the elusive
thermodynamic property that reflects disorder. In the 25 March issue
of PRL, physicists have demonstrated its newest entropic trick: an
elongated DNA molecule squirts from a confined space into an open one
under the propulsion of entropy alone.

Cornell researchers turn "plumber's nightmare" into flexible ceramic

chemistry, researchers at Cornell University have developed a new
class of hybrid materials that they describe as flexible ceramics.
The new materials appear to have wide applications, from
microelectronics to separating macromolecules, such as proteins.
What is particularly striking, even to the researchers themselves, is
that under the transmission electron microscope (TEM) the molecular
structure of the new material -- known as a cubic bicontinuous
structure -- conforms to century-old mathematical predictions. "We in
polymer research are now finding structures that mathematicians
theorized long ago should exist," says Ulrich Wiesner, associate
professor of materials science and engineering at Cornell.

I was running my e-mail through outlook express (5) on my Gateway (Windows
98). I now have a new Dell (Windows XP-Outlook Express 6) and have imported
all of my system settings (including my email client). I find that when I
copy and paste text from a webpage the html code is sustained into my email,
and get this, when I copy paste from the webpage into notepad (that doesn't
even use html) my spacing and rows are changed  when I copy and paste back
into my email document (I was trying to use notepad as a middleman). My
settings are exactly the same as my old computer, meaning, under tools,
option, and send, I have plain text selected for both options. Any help
would be appreciated. Thank you.

Well, I imagine the five year old girl probably bought stock in
companies whose products she used and liked. This strategy is one used
and advocated by Warren Buffet, so it can't be all bad. Of course, a
year period is not really sufficient. As any analyst will tell you, one
should always invest for the long term. One year is decidedly quite
short term. Going by decades, there is no other investment you can make
outside stocks which will always provide positive returns (or higher
ones).

Sounds like a plan.  When you send it...just out of curiosity, let me 
know exactly how many you send it to in the first wave.  (Or have you
sent it already?)

Perhaps we can use this as an example to help set up a code of ethics
for this type of mailing.  The most obvious rules from this case: make
sure to include some way for the recipient to independently verify what
you claim, and only spread the truth.  (In this case, the "SSSCA" is
more or less well known among the halls of Congress, so any US
Representative or Senator should be able to confirm its existence.)

To me there seems to be a fundamental problem with the game structure. As I
understood from an (admittedly brief) skim of the paper, it went like this:

For each player:
- Get a sum of money (uneven; some players get more than others).
- Bet a sum of money (1 chance of triple money, 2 chances of lose bet)
- Choose which players to burn, and by how much.

The first two steps are totally in isolation from one player to another; one
player's bets make no effect on other players. Each player can see what is
happening for all players, however. This is meant to inform them of the
inbalance (inequity) in the game.

My problem is with the third step. 

The third step displays a grid with all player's earnings, and lets each
player choose how much to burn each other player, clearly showing the effect
on the burner - the player may experiment with different options before
comitting to a decision.

The problem is this... at the third step, the players are presented only
with the option to burn. Not burning seems to be performed by burning each
player for 0.

So the experimental subject is presented with a stage in the experiment
which appears to have no purpose; it's like a trick question. The subject
must ask "why is this here? am I missing something?"

I think it is likely that many players burnt others because they felt they
were expected to do something in the third stage. After all, these
experimenters are paying cash; you want to keep them happy. Doing nothing
doesn't seem to be, well, grateful, or being a team player, or whatever.

So, I suspect that experimental subjects felt some kind of implicit pressure
from the experimenters, via this burning screen at stage three, to burn the
other players. 

If such an expectation exists, then the experiment echoes the classic
experiment in which a person will administer electric shocks to another
person until they think that person has died, if an authority figure (white
lab coat) stands next to them and orders them to continue.

How would you fix this methodologically? For starters, you would make the
experimental subject make a deliberate choice to go to the burning stage,
which didn't make it feel like the "right path", but rather like a purely
optional stage. 

Also, you might allow giving money to others at cost to yourself, as well as
punishment at cost to yourself. If the experimenters are correct about
burning behaviour as deliberate, the subject should seek out the punitive
option, and should choose it even in the face of being able to reward
instead.

Odd, military bases in the US are considered some of the best conserved
habitat, at least as compared to civilian state and federal conservation
lands. The one location Mike noted is Area 51, where there was
absolutely no oversight due to national security. There were huge
amounts of carbon based materials used in steath designs that needed to
be gotten rid of without having to file environmental impact statements
which would have required that the USAF detail the chemical composition
of the stealth materials being disposed of, in public documents.
Obviously, epa regs are contrary to national opsec.

Personally I'd have buried it all underground with one of the nukes they
were testing next door at the test range. The bomb tests would have
incinerated the material as well as left it too hot radioactively to
deal with for a number of decades afterward, as well as buried, a
perfect way to keep stealth materials out of enemy hands.

One could extend the MAD paradigm (not that I'm happy with that mind you).
I believe this is the current position the U.S. (or any other nuclear power
would take), e.g. that the use of any nanoweapons to attack their nation
is justification for a nuclear response.

If someone is mad enough to seek the destruction of civilization.
Otherwise there is little point to launching a nanoscale attack.

> How will we disinfect and protect the world's air and water supplies?

You have that problem already to a lesser extent with currently existing
chemical weapons.  Anthrax as well has a significant clearance problem.
If one has the technology to produce and distribute nanoweapons
presumably one also has the technology to clean it up.

Nuclear weapons do have depth limits.

> than this.

Until one can build a society where everyone highly values
one anothers security I doubt that will be the case.  But
as current reality shows, it seems fesible to survive even
though the situation is risky.  It is probably worth pointing
out that humanity has always been at risk from "natural" hazards.

With regard to nanotech, it is important not to underestimate
the complexity of the design problem for "nanotroops".  If we sit
on our hands while some crazy person manages to develop these
then we are likely to get what we deserve.  As Eric and others
have pointed out we already have a good example in our immune
system of how to repel such attacks.  In that case there is
a much simpler weapon in addition to heat or radiation --
more mass.  Macrophages trump bacteria because they are much
bigger, can engulf them and then rain harmful substances
down on them.

I see no reason why the same approach can't work with nanotech
*if* we are wise enough to design nanomacrophages first.  A
really simple defense would be defensive utility fog -- bacteria
sized nanobots designed to engulf a nanotroopbot, link arms,
deploy a spherical plating surface.  The interior of the sphere
is evacuated and there is no more material for the nanotroopbot
to use for replication.  The exterior defense bots would deploy
radiators that would allow them to remain cool, then direct high
temperature torches onto the engulfed nanotroopbot until it is
nothing more than a mass of slag.  So long as you have sufficient
numbers of nanodefensebots stockpiled there isn't any problem.

There might be some good in investigating the history of weapons
development to try and understand *why* offensive weapons have
lead defensive weapons.  I would actually question the claim.
Walled cities came before cannons that could destroy the walls.
Presumably offensive weapons have developed because people wanted
the wealth associated with some land, buildings, possessions, etc.
As "wealth" becomes increasingly virtual, offensive weaponry would
move into that realm.  So nuclear weapons and nanotroops become
increasingly irrelevant.  Instead we will be looking to defend
ourselves against viruses that seek to gain control of the
computronium.

The current vectors seem to suggest we will get molecular electronics
first.  That means we will have the computing capacity to support
uploads.  Then the pressure will start to build on producing methods
for uploading.  Once uploaded, you can distribute yourself to
a much greater extent, making the goo scenarios pretty irrelevant.

Awhile back Eliezer shared about finding a very strange group on the net.  

Otherkin

http://www.otherkin.net/index.html

I perused this subculture website of "lost souls" and found it rather fun.

Some claim to be descended from angels, weres, dragons, elves, and various other magical creatures.  I think my own heritage is incubus/satyr on my father's side, and angelic/dragon on my mother's.  What a combination!

I'm just another otherkin mutt. ; )

I wonder what some of you might be?  This is a fun way to look at personality types.

best wishes,

John

I was just curious to know how things were progressing with the game?  It is an idea just too good to be played with and than forgotten about!  

I have emailed Steve Jackson for the job of making this game a reality and presently await his response.  I included a link so he could read the extrolist posts on the subject.  Perhaps he will bring his talents and resources to bear on this cool project.

Well, keep in mind that it WAS conducted in England, where class
resentment remains one of the most popular sports. I'd be interested in
seeing how this experiment played out in different countries with
significantly different economic traditions.

Given the 4 to 1 cost ratio involved, its rather obvious that the
poorest came out the biggest losers in the end, as they wasted their
money on a spite they couldn't afford, and drew the greater ire of the
wealthy down upon them, and possibly helps to explain the 3rd generation
effect beyond just internal causes.

This is all rather relative. Its the MISUSE that is the threat, not the
USE. So development of the technology per se is not necessarily a bad
thing. There are far more possible benefits from nanotech than risks,
and many of the risks are generally overblown based on insufficient
data. The risk in nanotech isn't from what we know, but from what we
don't know, and only further research is going to answer the questions
needed to accurately determine actual risk.

If mankind followed the precautionary principle through its history,
we'd all still be in the trees.

Flesh and grass has that, too. Plus, sonickating a whole planet would seem
to require a rather large ultrasonics bath.

What is interesting is that nanoporous silicon with nitrates allows
self-destructing dies. Could be a good way to blow up die areas containing
secrets in tamperproof crypto designs.

I'd be up for it. We just send it out to a bunch of people we know as if we
received it and consider it worth passing along. I'd pick the people I know
that keep huge mailing lists, maintain blogs/webcomics/rant pages, and are
charmingly naive enough to occasionally drop existing viral e-mail memes
into my inbox. Sometimes with a cc list of a hundred people. Sheesh.

Morally legitimately use of viral meme e-mail? You know, I can't think of
any. Interesting. That would make us trendsetters if we got this one
underway :)

===================
The Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, Ethics and the Human Genome
By John Sulston and Georgina Ferry
Bantam/Random House Australia, 310pp, $A55.00

Reviewed by Damien Broderick

Nearly two years ago, US President Bill Clinton stood proudly at a podium
to announce that the human genome draft was complete. Actually, this map 
of our common genetic recipe was still badly gappy. Clinton called it `a
day for the ages'. He was flanked at his left by Dr Francis Collins, devout
Christian leader of the painstaking public American end of the global
Human Genome Project (HGP). At his right stood Dr Craig Venter, the
carpetbagger who'd roared into Dodge fixing to finish off the genome by the
`shotgun' method, beating those slow-poke bureaucrats even though they'd
drawn first--and, if his Celera Genomics company could get away with it,
patenting the spoils.

The fabled DNA helix, one thread of this book's title, was unravelled in
Britain
in 1953 by an Englishman and a visiting American. Nearly half a century
later, a key strand of the HGP's thread in this vast common project was
largely overlooked. Prime Minister Tony Blair seized photo ops, but not
many people knew that a major player in this epochal search was a genial
expert in nematode worms, John (now Sir John) Sulston. Yet in 1989 Sulston
had helped start the sequencing project, with DNA helix co-discoverer Jim
Watson and another American worm specialist, Bob Waterson, and ran the UK
end, the Sanger Centre, until late in 2000.

The speed of their successful efforts has been genuinely breathtaking. As
recently as mid-1996, the effort was gearing up after vast preparation for its
major push, massively and crucially funded by the philanthropic Wellcome
Trust. Only a few percent of the three billion genetic letters had yet
been read. In May, 1998, with the aid of venture capitalists, Craig Venter
entered the arena, ready to complete the human sequence within three
years--four or five years earlier than the public project's goal--and without 
a cent of taxpayers' money.

Journalists were agog. Here was the brash American way at its best:
audacious, putting its money where its mouth was in expectation of
prodigious rewards, perhaps even a bit unprincipled. The race hotted up
with incredible speed. To everyone's astonishment, a little over a year ago
private and public wings released their data simultaneously to the
scientific press--Sulston's team (although by then he had resigned) through
the British journal Nature, Celera's via the American journal Science. The
human genome had been decoded in barely more than a decade, we were told, a
triumph comparable to placing men on the Moon, with unfathomable future
consequences.

The trouble with this story, like the one about asylum seekers throwing 
their children overboard, is that it's wrong, and politically motivated.
Sulston's brilliantly enthralling tale blends his amused, amusing and slightly
bumbling persona (as captured by science journalist Ferry, who adds meaty
chunks from her interviews with other major players) with the increasingly
furious, indignant tones of a prophet scorned. Those publications in
February, 2001, were not at all the glorious consummation trumpeted in the
press. Indeed, the human genome still isn't finished, although some 90
percent is now in the bag. Possibly it will not be complete until the
original HGP target date, 2003.

What's more, Sulston explains, Venter's spectacular coup in starting from
scratch years after the public program had allegedly plodded along, roaring
to a neck-and-neck finish, is at best spin and at worst flat untruth.
Celera's celerity depended on late generation sequencing machines developed
originally with funding from the public purse. Worse still, Venter's
`shotgun' method of sequencing chunks of code, then patching them together
like a jigsaw puzzle, only worked--to the extent that it did--because he
could appropriate maps generated by Sulston and others who strove to keep
the genome code in the public domain.

Despite promises, Venter's own data was rarely posted openly; indeed,
researchers were obliged to sign non-disclosure documents. This is not how
science has been done, as Sulston furiously points out, nor should it be.
Perhaps old-world gentlemanly openness just doesn't cut the mustard any
longer, does not produce either the scientific nor commercial goods? But
market exploitation, Sulston replies, simply has not achieved what it claims.

Celera, he argues, did science and won prizes by press release. Bizarrely,
the HGP and Venter's team shared an award for mapping the `landscape of the
genome' at a time when the public project's data was posted daily for all
to see, yet Celera's was not. None of it. `Had this ever happened before?
That an internationally reputable society would give an award for research
that was unpublished and unseen?' Easy to sympathise with Sulston's wrath,
although the press seems largely to have treated it as pique.

Does it matter, though, finally? Sulston shows how the public side of the
race was muffled or even effectively silenced in the USA by politics, for
nobody could speak out against market interests without upsetting Congress,
risking the sack or loss of government funds. Well, isn't this in turn just
another ideological spin? Sulston is clearly and unashamedly an old leftie
humanist who inveighs against `the power of the rich countries and of the
transnational corporations... used in a bullying and inequitable fashion.'

Economic libertarians will shrug off his rhetoric, noting that everyone
benefits from the swiftest possible unpacking of this genetic treasure
trove. That might be true in part; then again, private interests have tried
to patent not just partly mapped gene sequences (built by evolution, of
course, rather than human ingenuity), but also any future medical
applications of proteins the genes encode. It is like patenting air, then
levying a charge on breathing, inflated tyres, and the atmosphere of
Jupiter. You want to laugh out loud, but we dare not treat it so lightly.

I expect Sir John will have a Nobel Prize soon, and stand gritting his
teeth as Craig Venter shares it. Or maybe the Sanger Centre et al will be
written out of history. Let nobody be tempted to allow this, he urges us.
`The struggle over the human genome was necessary, and things would not be
the same today had not the public project stood firm.' Luckily, his book is
at once modest and a rattling good read. It might make a dynamite movie,
but Russell Crowe is probably way too intense to play the lead.

OK.  Assuming that the research isn't totally flaky,
you know, like something performed by the Institute
for the Confirmation of Human Venality,... 

The article says that 62% of the folks behaved badly. 
Now, how about a more in-depth analysis. Specifically,
what are the characteristics of those
people--personality factors, ages, ethnicities,
educational levels, religious types/fervor, etc.--who
are winnerphobic vs those who are winnerphilic.

Best, Jeff Davis

I had an offer for card design to - *possibly* - be one of the sessions
at the next Foresight gathering, but I haven't heard anything else about
that; since the program they've posted for said gathering doesn't seem
to leave any significant slots for this, I doubt it will happen (beyond
brief - say, 10 minute max - discussions that would most likely not
yield any significant contemplation as to what cards should be added).
Beyond that, just about all that's been going on, has gone on on this
list - including nothing for the past week or so.

To be perfectly honest, I was thinking Looney Labs or Cheap-Ass Games.
Steve Jackson might be too much for a targetted game like this.  But, if
you really think SJG might take a project like this seriously without
repurposing it to high sales and profit (which is any game company's
prime objective) as opposed to getting the message out...sure, it's
worth a shot.  (My main concerns specifically: making the game more
public-friendly in ways that utterly destroy its impact or even turn it
against us, and the ever-so-slight-but-nonzero chance of legal trickery
to try to claim rights to this type of game - not only to put control
into the hands of those who would never listen to us, and thus invoke
concern number one, but also to stop us from developing this game on our
own with any other publisher in order to address any severe philosophic
deficiencies.)

At least the legalese gives them a single person to contact, so I'll
know if they're taking the bait.

Having spoken to the founder of CAG before, I'd note that he has a "publish
it your damned self if it's such a good game, like what I did" attitude. He
has more games than he knows what to do with floating around in his head,
and more power to him.

SJG is scaling down operations at the moment, as I recall. OTOH, they're
publishing a transhumanist RPG.

Awhile back Eliezer shared about finding a very strange group on the net.  

Otherkin

http://www.otherkin.net/index.html

I perused this subculture website of "lost souls" and found it rather fun.

Some claim to be descended from angels, weres, dragons, elves, and various other magical creatures.  I think my own heritage is incubus/satyr on my father's side, and angelic/dragon on my mother's.  What a combination!

I'm just another otherkin mutt. ; )

I wonder what some of you might be?  This is a fun way to look at personality types.

best wishes,

John

What, is this about carbon composites disposal? I'm told the graphite
fibers clog up the electrostatic dust filters. But open pits? Huh? Makes
zero sense. But, all military installations are notoriously slovenly. Lots
of contamination in former U.S. bases here.

I think it's both missing supervision (do mil types have to succumb to eco
audits now?) and an intrinsically bad attitude.

The one location that we have a clear good guess about.

It's not just carbon, it's also whatever else they throw(/threw) at the
low-observables problem. For all I know it could include beryllium, other
weird metals and/or particulates, epoxy amides, nasty mutagenic/carcinogenic
dielectric substances and Ghu knows what else. I also have no idea whether
it's stopped. Hey. why bother stopping when you've already got carte blanche?

Next door? More like "down the block." Not a totally bad idea, but it would
have taken an unusual level of cooperation between two rather distinct
tentacles.

Apart from open burning, there are _other_ materials disposition/activity
questions about Rocky Flats and some other locations. Point remains: if there
is a compelling reason, "the government", like just about anyone else, will
lie through their teeth. I swallowed the cover story for the Glomar Explorer,
too.

To sterilize this planet*, all it takes is a giant impact, enough to melt
the crust some 10 km down. Nothing to it.

If I have a bottle of gray goo sitting on my table, it's trivial to
destroy it. (Well, I'd need access to a special lab to dispose of it
properly, but you get my point). If I have that same bottle broken up and
contents released in the winds at 10 km height, we have a different
problem class altogether. The only solution would seem to demand a
somewhat radical treatment, as above.

A smart solution would require a worldwide nanoimmune system, but if you
look at it en detail you realize that the presence of blue goo screws the
ecology just as badly. (Even if you manage to install blue before someone
starts peppering you with gray). Machine phase stuff can be in a dynamic
equilibrium with each other, but unfortunately wet life winds up at the
loser end.

(*=just this planet, impact ejecta will carry the seeds everywhere (well,
they are everywhere already, so it doesn't matter that much).)

Research Shows Just How Much People Hate A Winner

New research by economists at the Universities of Warwick and Oxford in the
UK has provided surprising insight into just how much people hate a winner.

It also shows what lengths human beings are prepared to go to damage a
winner out of a sense of envy or fairness.

The researchers, Professor Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick and
Dr. Daniel Zizzo of Oxford, designed a new kind of experiment, played with
real cash, in which subjects could anonymously  burn  away other people s
money -- but only at the cost of giving up some of their own.

Despite this cost to themselves, and contrary to economists  usual
assumptions, 62% of those tested chose to destroy part of other test
subjects  cash. In the experiment, half of all the laboratory earnings were
deliberately destroyed by fellow subjects.

Everyone in the laboratory sessions was anonymous and hidden. The subjects
had only a computer terminal, into which they played, and in which they
could see how much other people were winning.

In each session, the test subjects began with a betting stage which gave
them some money (about 10 pounds, but sometimes much more), creating an
unequal wealth distribution.

In the final stage, the  burning  stage, subjects could if they wished
eliminate ( burn away ) other people s money -  but only by giving up some
of their own cash winnings. At the most expensive level, they had to give
up 25 pence to destroy 1 full pound owned by someone else.

It was made clear to all subjects that burning others would reduce the cash
of the person choosing to burn.

The economists expected little burning, and especially that the laboratory
subjects would stop destroying other people s money once the price reached
0.25, but in fact they found that even this high price did little to stop
people from annihilating other people s wealth. Most individuals still
chose to hurt others, despite the large cost to their own pocket.

The researchers found that those who gained the most additional money at
the betting stage burned poor and rich alike, while disadvantaged
laboratory subjects mainly targeted those subjects they saw getting what
they perceived as undeserved financial windfalls.

The authors conclude that  our experiment measures the dark side of human
nature.

This is ridiculous.  I can't believe that people are taking this seriously.
The simulation was only a game.  The object of the game is to "win" by
beating one's opponents.  The rules of the game were so skewed that burning
was the only option that made sense.  Nobody could win without burning
because burning was so cheap compared to the cost.  Also, there was no
choice between earning one's own money and destroying the opponent.  After
earning money, the option to burn was still there.  There was no
disincentive to burn, and every incentive to do so.  I am more amazed that
more people didn't burn, since that was the only way to win the game.  This
doesn't prove that people hate winners any more than chess does when one
takes an opponent's piece off the board.  That's not sabotage, that's simple
winning strategy as dictated by the rules.

Your problem is that you're using Outlook Express, the buggiest, most
insecure mailer available for Windows, the buggiest and most insecure
OS available for PCs. If you *must* use Windows, switch to a better
and safer mailer such as Pocomail or Eudora, both of which can import
your OE mailboxes and address book.

This experiment is so bad on so many levels, I don't know where to begin.

First of all, one girl, one astrology, and one stock analyst does not make a
statistical sampling.  There is no way to know if this result is repeatable.

Secondly, having a little girl catch random pieces of paper is not a
scientifically recognized method for random number generation.  This
obviously is a publicity stunt and not a real experiment to measure random
chance.

Thirdly, they claim that the girl catches the papers in a random manner.  We
have no information about how the stocks to drop to the girl were chosen.
It seems that whoever chose these stocks to drop was making the good
choices.

Fourthly, all the girl's catches were winners.  She caught no losers, and
there was no mention if the stocks not caught by the girl included any
losers.  It may be that whatever source they used for stocks to drop to the
girl was the best predictor of good stocks.

Fifthly, the first description of the participants described a stock
analyst, but a later description describes "calculated, computer-backed
choice" instead.  Who programmed the computer and what assumptions did it
make?  Computers looking at previous results are notoriously bad at
adjusting for market changes.  The article mentions that the girl avoided
the telecomm sector.  If the humans and computers picked telecomm stocks
because they were the best performing, then random chance would be better
since it wouldn't favor the best stock which later failed.  All this
experiment shows is that telecomm went down, those that chose telecomm
stocks lost, while those that didn't choose telecomm stocks gained.

I can't imagine that anyone could set up such a poor experiment, that anyone
would use a little girl as a random number generator, that the little girl
acting randomly never chooses a poor stock, or that this whole thing isn't
just a publicity stunt.  I can't see how any real scientist could work with
an "experiment" like this.  It is so invalid in so many ways, that I would
fail any high school student who tried to do an experiment like this.

Though working as an individual to stop such behavior by reciprocal
action (i.e. refusing to do business with bigots) and propaganda
(communicating the facts of the bad behavior of bigots to others, so
that they may do the same) is not in conflict with libertarian
principles (or the Extropian principles).

In fact, an argument can be made that in a libertarian society, it is
the individual's responsibility to engage in such peer pressure in order
to maintain a polite, peaceful and stable libertarian community. Failing
to do so is abdicating individual responsibility and thus invites in the
hand of the state (essentially what occured in the south in the 60s).

Quite, but 90% of businesses acting in collusion IS, in fact, a
monopoly. 

This is where I delineated between public commerce and private in a
previous post. I did not mean government versus commercial business, I
meant the difference between a business owner who advertises publicly
versus one who does business by appointment and referral only. 

If you advertise your business openly in public, you are inviting all
potential consumers to engage in commerce with you. You *should* state
in your ads that you don't want blacks or gays or whatever if you are a
bigot, but you'd have to bear the consequences of letting the world know
of your bigotry. Failing to do so is false advertising and possibly
breach of contract.

If you only accept clients by appointment and referral, you can be as
selective as you wish to be, without the world knowing of your bigotry.

I'm going to share a true related story.

A year or so ago, the anti-gun crowd here in Chicago staged a
little stunt.

They dressed police officers up as gang members and sent them off
to suburban gun stores to buy guns, at which they were successful.
When they were successful, the liberal press moaned about it for
weeks.

Problems with this little scenario?

1) They had to go to suburban stores because there are no gun
stores in Chicago, handguns have been completely illegal in Chicago
for twenty years.

2) To buy a gun in Illinois requires a license, besides a valid
FOID card you of course have to pass the INSTA-CHECK system. So no
matter how these people were dressed, they were valid purchasers
under the law.

In effect what the liberal press was moaning about was that the gun
stores did not engage in illegal racial profiling.

The liberals of course completely missed this.

This may help or may not, I cant be sure if this is the same issue as you

plain text emails, then save them as simple text documents before sending
them.  When you paste the copied text into notepad, is there a large margin

so, then I would guess you are using Netscape as your browser.  When I copy

not.  (using IE 5.5)

When I copy into notepad, everything looks fine. It is only when I copy
something into my email from notepad or the web, that gives me
the problem. I don't want to, or usually copy from notepad, but have
been to avoid the html that is showing up in my email, when I copy and
paste from the web (which is my problem). That works, to copy and
paste from the web into notepad, as far as the html problem is concerned,
but that creates and middle man, (from the web, to notepad, to my email)
 and whatever great alignment I've done in notepad (like you see in my
nanogirl news email) appears as super long sentences, and double spaced,
the second it is pasted into my email. So I end up having to fix the text
twice.

No I don't use Netscape. I use IE6.

		 Also, what if the FAI arrives at the conclusion that the
principle of autonomy as applied to sentients above 85 IQ points, plus
majority rule trump all other principles? If so, then it might act to
fulfill the wishes of the majority, even if it means destruction of some
nice folks.  
		Banning nano altogether within a large radius of the Earth
might be necessary if there were persons unwilling to have incorporated
hi-tech defensive systems - a stray assembler, carried with the solar wind,
would be enough to wipe them out. I do hope the FAI will just say Luddites
are crazy, and if they get disassembled as a result of refusing to use
simple precautions, it's their fault (just as the vaccination-refusing bozos
who might die if you sneeze at them).

develops the

incomprehensible
		to us mere humans, it would presumably be accompanied by the
ability to toss

advancements over

and be

		### I have no doubt the SAI will be quite impressive but
without being able to follow its reasoning steps you will be unable to
detect FoF 

		I imagine that massive, at least temporary IQ enhancement
might be required by the FAI as a condition of being considered a subject of
Friendliness - by analogy to sane humans who do not afford moral subjectship
to entities at the spinal level (pro-lifers notwithstanding), the FAI might
insist you enhance to vis level at least temporarily to give your input and
understand Friendliness. After that perhaps one might retire to a mindless
existence at the Mensa level.

		Human subgoals are far more context-sensitive than
evolution's subgoals. 
		Evolution is limited to induction.  If it didn't happen to
your ancestors at

exist.  A subgoal

evolutionary

		### OK. I understand. But once an adaptation is accepted by
a declarative reasoning process into a person's goal system, it can become a
subgoal. So altruism is both an adaptation *and* a subgoal in some persons.

That would be easy.  The only problem is that the Taliban does not *want* to
be convinced in ten minutes flat.

Someone wants to shoot me.  Is it moral for me to act counter to his
explicit wishes and dodge?  Sure.  Is it moral for a FAI to intersect the
bullet because my wishes about my life take precedence over his wishes about
my life?  Sure.

Why would an FAI conclude this?

Well, the human-smartness proof-of-concept answer to this is the Sysop
Scenario, where all technology on the Basic Level - nanotech, femtotech,
chromotech, whatever - is an extension of the Sysop.  But people have been
acting odd around the Sysop Scenario lately, so I think I'll fall back on
the real answer, which is "Figuring out things like that is part of what you
need a transhuman for."

It's an SIs responsibility to do that kind of maintenance.  Once there's an
SI around, whether you detect FoF is quite pointless...

Why?  I can easily conceive of an infrahuman mental entity that would
deserve citizenship, although I believe that primates have insufficient
reflectivity to qualify.

Yes, but they are conceptually separate.  I make use of my altruistic
hardware but I apply reasoned corrective factors where I expect hardware
altruism to differ from normative altruism.

IMMEDIATE CALL TO ACTION  -- March 21, 2002 -- IMMEDIATE CALL TO ACTION


On March 20th, Google caved in to a baseless legal threat from
Scientology's "Religious Technology Center", and removed the web
site xenu.net from all search results.  (Not just the cached pages.
The links, too.  Try it.)

The number one site for independent information about the Church of
Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, and most important of all, the tyrant
warlord XENU, has vanished from the number one search engine!

Since Google's web site is no longer an accurate reflection of the
state of Xenu (and Scientology) knowledge on the Internet, the

                      MOUNTAIN VIEW CALIFORNIA
                       __  __

                       /_/\_\___|_| |_|\__,_|

                       INDEPENDENT STUDY GROUP

will be visiting Google's headquarters IN PERSON to search for Xenu
information -- with cameras rolling.

Who:           The Mountain View, California Xenu Study Group
               (This means you)

What:          First meeting: "Finding Facts about Xenu on the Net
               with Google"

Where:         Meet at Dana St. Roasting Company, 744 Dana Street,
               Mountain View.
               Then, travel to Google HQ.

When:          3:45 PM, Thursday, March 21, 2002

Why:           To make sure that accurate information about Xenu is
               available through Internet search engines.

What to bring: 1. another video camera (we already have one, but could
               use some more shots)

               2. Your pen and paper for taking notes about how to find
               good Xenu (and Scientology) sites.

		Survival is not a binary state.  Are you trying to increase
the average

survive
		minimally?  Having everyone "win" could very well mean that
no one wins.

		### To clarify your question - I am assuming you mean
"increase in average survivability" as a change in the average of some
measure of survival (e.g lifespan), with no effort to reduce the standard
deviation and  with some persons finding themselves at the far lower end of
the distribution (the libertarian way). "Making sure that  all humans
survive minimally" is then trying to reduce the standard deviation,
regardless of whether it improves the average (the egalitarian solution).

		If you mean it this way then as a survival maximizer I want
to be a part of a society where persons who prove their willingness to
survive by appropriate actions (e.g. working, getting insured) will have
both a high average survival and a low likelihood of finding themselves far
away on the lower end of the distribution curve. This is not compatible with
the egalitarian solution (which tends to pull up some people but drags down
too many) but not quite the libertarian way, which in the strict sense
accepts nice folks falling through the cracks.

		In practical terms, there might be a minimum standard of
survival (e.g. assured 1500 kcal of food/day, shelter - the poorhouse about
which I wrote on the list last year), as long as it is physically possible
to provide it, even if it means using taxation to do it. In the medical
access case above, a minimal standard of access (to paying customers) could
be mandated, even if it would mean forcing some persons to share a waiting
room with those he/she despises. But then on the other hand, the threat of
physical violence and death inherent in taxation or state regulations is
unacceptable if used for purposes other than saving innocent lives. You
can't take somebody's property for the sake of "justice", "equality",
"affirmative action", etc. and this is an objective standard for judging the
ethics of state action.

		I feel morally comfortable with such coercive interventions
- the survival wish of an innocent person is the highest value I recognize,
and disregarding other wishes is in certain limited situations acceptable.

		And what is an "innocent human" in the context of survival?

		### Now this is the word into which I squeeze all the
complicated issues in my ethical system.  

		"Innocent" means here "not guilty of intentional
infringement on the survival-wish of innocent persons". A child is born
innocent. If you murder somebody, you are as far from innocent as possible -
you are evil. I do not recognize the survival wishes of such entities. If
you use violence or the threat of violence (including state violence)
against an innocent person, you lose some of  your innocent status. E.g. you
are poor but not in danger of dying. You want to have cable TV. You vote for
a politician promising to tax the rich to deliver it to you. You are no
longer innocent.

		Let's say you demand food stamps because you say you have
only a few thousand $/year and not enough money for food, impacting your
survival. When you get the stamps, you use some of your income to pay for
cable.  You are not innocent because in effect you demand others to
subsidize your lifestyle, not merely survival. 

		Let's say you could work sweeping the streets but you don't
feel like it. To avoid starvation you come to the poorhouse. You are not
innocent - you could survive on your own but you prefer to use the state
system of extortion.

		Let's say you are filthy rich. An act of war displaced many
persons who were uninsured despite honestly trying to (you usually can't get
an insurance covering acts of war). With your cronies you thwart a motion in
congress to provide life-saving shelter and food for them at your expense.
You are not innocent - you value your property above the lives of innocent
persons.

		 A landslide destroys homes and livelihoods. The homes were
not insured because of the landslide risk but their owners bought them
anyway. Now they ask for state help to rebuild at your expense. You refuse.
You are innocent. It was their fault.

		Let's say an epidemic sweeps the country. Thousands of
persons who chose to buy a car rather than health insurance are now
clamoring for help. You refuse and they die miserably, although there is
enough medication to help them. You *are* innocent! They died because of
their own negligence. They were guilty by hoping to use violent extortion to
pay for their mistakes.

		There are two persons on a sinking ship and one life vest.
One of them grabs it, depriving the other of the means of survival. He is
guilty - infringing on the life-wish of an innocent person is wrong, even if
needed to save your own life. He should be shot for his crime. 

		But let's say both of them agree to a knife fight, a coin
toss or other means of assigning the vest. The winner is innocent even if
splattered with blood. 

		What if they can't decide who should have the vest, and both
drown? Well, they are innocent, and stupid, too. 

		I might need to use more such examples to better describe
the multidimensional shape that is the concept of innocence but I hope you
are getting a flavor for it. It does imply nonviolence, responsibility for
yourself, caring for others, and other elements.

		Let me reiterate my moral axioms:

		1 Innocent life wish may not be thwarted.
		2 Truth may not be denied except to serve 1
		3 Freedom may not be infringed, except to serve 1 and 2

		Practical applications of these axioms yield in my mind a
system resembling a soft-core form of libertarianism.

Correction to my last post - www.xenu.net finally came up - very slow.

I tried it and it returned lots of results with xenu.net :

<http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&oe=ISO-8859-1&q=site%3Axenu.net+theme&btnG=Google+Search>

I figured they might mean, "without using the site directive", so I
fed back a phrase of one of those pages to Google and I got the page
again :

Under a suitable interpretation I think the first is correct. 
The technology is moving radically faster than human beings and 
their institutions are evolving.  Thus, if we are to make best 
use of the technology, we and our institutions need to catch up 
or at least successfully incorporate the technologies into our 
lives.  Another way to say it is that highly augmented or 
uploaded only partially evolved apes would not necessarily be a 
good thing.

It probably gets too many hits, as a result of the (apparently
misleading) chain letter that prompted you to check it. Innocent?

It *could* but doesn't necessarily.  A bit down the road we 
might consider the notion that some can win while everyone else 
loses to be a sign of our former primitive state.

Perhaps it could be expressed as "Sentients are more important 
than things and ideas, including political theories."

I disagree with this idea.  What is a sentient?  Sentients are only
important in the context of the things and ideas they create. Most
"sentients" have precious little value, and the only reason to give them
any value at all is that they might do something interesting some day,
though they probably won't the vast majority of the time. This being
relative to my perspective along the gradient of sentience. Suppressing
the creative ability (directly or indirectly) of the most useful
sentients to "respect the importance" of "sentients" that are nigh
useless is counterproductive. Of course, we could solve this problem
merely by raising the bar that defines "sentient", a fuzzy definition if
there ever was one. That sentience has a finite value seems fairly
obvious, and purely rational critters will treat it as such. In a more
immediate context, sentients are treated as though they have some
importance today as a game theoretic courtesy. Which basically means it
doesn't amount to much, and that we can get away with our bold delusions
as a practical matter because we haven't had to interact with vastly
superior sentients. 

Of course, a lot of the problem is that people use "sentience" as though
it was a binary state when it is really a gradient with arbitrary cutoff
points.  Some day we may wake up and find out that WE have fallen below
the arbitrary cutoff by some entity's standard.

Or to put it another way, how is it any less right for me to say that I
will respect the importance of all sentients, but that "sentients" are
defined as, say, entities having an IQ higher than 140 (or any other
arbitary metric)?  This standard would be no less arbitrary than the one
originally stated by Rafal.  There seem to be a lot of terms and metrics
in these arguments that are defined to mean whatever people want them to
mean.

  http://www.spacedaily.com/news/nuclear-civil-02k.html
fairly enlightening.

Are the folks over there *crazy*?  (No offense to citizens
in the respective countries intended.)  This is interesting
because it would seem to cast Sweden and Germany on courses
quite opposed to France with the U.K. someplace in the middle.

>From the Swedish perspective I think it is really unrealistic.
How do they think the are going to produce the necessary
energy?  I don't know what the tides are like in the Gulf
of Bothnia, but this seems really unrealistic.

What is the problem?  Russia certainly has ample supplies
of materials that could be used to fuel nuclear reactors.
So it has to be either a perspective that nuclear power
is unsafe, or a waste disposal issue that radioactive
isotopes cannot be transformed into nonradioactive variants.

Feedback?

Actually, one of the things that I would like to see
is a truly programmable paint program.  And, yes, I
know that IF I knew a real modern programming
language, I could take the GIMP engine and use it as
the base for such a program.  Time, as always, is the
problem.  

I look at some of the Julia set images and imagine how
I would like to set rules so that instead of a dot
strictly determined by some recursive chaotic formula,
the results in different areas could programmatically
dictate an image selected from a library of
algorythms.  Imagine the scenes from heaven from "What
Things Might Be," as examples.  The underlying
structure would still be chaotic, but instead of
fractals that looked like trees from another universe,
they would pick up tree algorithms so that the fractal
structures would become matched and replaced with real
images - or images that could be real...

Imagine wearing ultra-rez glasses that recreated
reality to your taste in real time along the same
lines.  People or entities who specialized in
creating/mutating reality into art forms would earn
their upload space and terraflops by selling their
skills to other people who specialized differently. 
You could live in an impressionist or a Daliesque
world, with music choreographed to your taste and
changing to match, enhance or redirect your mood.

On a somewhat related note, one of the sad fallouts
from the takeover of the Borg is the loss of such
really neat visual effects as color-cycling. 
Microsloth's idiot OS makes a lot of
simple-but-spectacular effects that we used to have in
the '80's virtually impossible in practice. 
Mandelbrot images properly color-cycled suddenly
become an order of magnitude more visually
interesting.

As to the genetic algorithmic art, I recall seeing a
lot of that stuff at SIGRAPHs for the past couple
decades.  Some of it is truly lovely.

British Law Would Make Organ Donation Automatic Upon Death
By Nicole Martin
The Telegraph - London
3-21-2002
 
People should have their organs automatically removed for transplants
after they die unless they had expressed objections when alive,
according to a Bill to go before the Commons today. The 10-minute rule
Bill, supported by doctors' leaders, reaches MPs amid fears that people
are dying needlessly because of a shortage of donors.
 
Last year, there were 6,842 people on the waiting list for organs, and
the queue is growing. Tom Watson, Labour MP for West Bromwich East, is
proposing a change in the law to allow doctors to remove organs from all
patients over 16 unless they have opted out.
 
Currently, Britain operates a system, whereby organs can only be removed
from people who have joined the donor register or carried a donor card.
Only 15 per cent of Britons are on the register.
 
Mr Watson said: "A change in the law could save hundreds of lives every
year. In the last five years over a thousand people have died while on
the waiting list for an organ transplant. Others have died without
reaching the list." The Bill has won the support of 170 MPs but it is
unlikely that the Government will accept it.
 
A Department of Health spokesman said the Bill was unnecessary because
the Government was conducting a review on organ donation.

First, let me say that I didn't read the article. But since this is a more or 
less hot topic in Germany for the last 20 years almost everybody here is 
sufficiently informed to give an answer.

For Germany, this isn't exactly news. The bill passed more than a year ago. 
Currently no new power plants are built but the old ones can stay operational 
for up to 30 more years.

So what are we doing to replace them? First, we build plenty of wind 
generators. No idea if they really produce enough energy to be a replacement. 
Second, it seems like we're simply importing electricity from France and the 
Czech Republic. One can argue if the Russian built Czech reactors are safer 
than the Siemens reactors - maybe Tchernobyl gives a hint.

Exactly this is what the debate during the last 20 years was all about. The 
fear that something like Tchernobyl might happen here and the feeling that it 
is not responsible to put lots of radioactive waste underground because noone 
can ensure that it's safe there for the next millenia until it's converted to 
lead.

Two math professors, Andrew Nestler of Santa Monica 
College and Sarah J. Greenwald of Appalachian State 
University in North Carolina, have compiled more 
than 100 math references, from the simple to the 
cutting edge, in the show's 13-season run.

Nestler and Greenwald, who are huge fans of the show, 
began the idea of using The Simpsons in lectures 
a few years ago while they were graduate students 
at the University of Pennsylvania.

They have given their lecture four times, mostly 
recently on Saturday at CalTech for the spring meeting 
of the Southern California Mathematical Assn. of America.

In Greenwald's favorite Simpsons math moment, Homer 
and Marge Simpson are considering sending their daughter 
Lisa to a school for the gifted. As the camera pans, 
two young girls playing the game of patty-cake recite 
the following playground chant: 
    
    Cross my heart and hope to die  
    Here's the digits that make pi 
    3.1415926535897932384...

and the camera pans away.

Nestler and Greenwald said some of the math references 
show a surprisingly high level of understanding of complex 
math topics. In one episode, Homer Simpson, normally a 
two-dimensional character, is trapped in a three-dimensional 
world. One equation whizzes by the screen: 
    1,782 ^ 12 + 1844 ^ 12 = 1922 ^ 12.
One could multiply out the numbers raised to the power of 
12 to prove that the statement is false - a tedious process 
by any measure - but it's not really necessary since the 
equation would, if true, prove Fermat's Last Theorem false.
Fermat's Last Theorem, which for centuries stumped the best 
mathematical minds, but has been proved, states that when n 
is greater than 2, there are no nonzero integers that can
stand in for X, Y, and Z in the equation 
    X ^ n + Y ^ n = Z ^ n 
that will make the equation true.

Ah-hm. The current deal between government and the power companies is based 
on a total sum of terawatt the existing (16?) nuclear power plants in 
Germany are permitted to produce. It's up to the companies, which of the 
plants they want to switch off first.

The candidate of the german opposition btw had announced to remove this law 
in case he wins the elections in September. Unfortunately, the power 
companies said "no, thanks, we'll stay to the deal" ;-)

If you're interested in the reasons: Nuclear power is too expensive here. 
German people get extremly nervous when a NPP is placed next to their house 
and garden. Noone wants to live near any site that deals with radioactive 
material, not even those who would vote pro nuclear power.

Planning and dealing with protests, law suits, hearings, etc. costs 
enormous amounts of time and money. Considering the population density 
here, you won't find a place far enough away from the cities.

Next problem is the waste. There is still no technology safe enough to keep 
that stuff away from the biophere for the next 20.000 years. And the power 
companies are required to provide an "Entsorgungsnachweis", the signed plan 
how they will handle their waste and the costs. The existing technology is 
also expensive here, because of very high safety measures.

All in all, nuclear power in Germany today is more expensive than old 
fashioned carbon burning - or buying cheap (and unsafe) power from Czechia, 
France or Russia. It's pure coincidence (and the magic of globalization), 
that the commercial interests and the people's interests go into the same 
direction. High risk technology has no good standing here. If the industry 
in Europe will find the way to really modern and safe power technologies in 
time remains to be seen.

   Kai

P.S. IMHO, when we sum up all costs of fission based nuclear power 
production, including everything necessary to minimize the risk of medium 
to large accidents, theft of radioactive material, etc., this technology 
will always be more expensive than lower risk technologies, simply because 
the necessary man power and bureaucracy is much higher.

Cryonics. CRYONICS. C-R-Y-O-N-I-C-S. Not cryogenics. That's something
different.

Yes. What else is new? Of course, the folks on your side of the

There are no tides to talk about. Sweden has no fossil fuels,
geothermal might be locally useful for heating in some regions
but not for energy production. Wind power might have some local
uses but is seriously NIMBYied, the latitude is too high for
large-scale solar power and practically all water power that can
be built has been built. Thank heavens for expensive imported
continental dirty fossil fuel power or Finnish nuclear power!

These perceptions combined in Sweden in the late 70's, and there
was a referendum about nuclear power. Unfortunately the ruling
Social Democractic party was split about the issue, something
they can never accept. So they made the referendum have three
alternatives: yes, no and yes-and-no. This kept the SD voters on
the same side. The yes-and-no alternative was to keep nuclear
power but not build any new reactors, and have it removed
altogether by 2012 - far off in the unimaginable future where
many believed advanced technology like fusion or solar power
would be far more efficient anyway (and few of the involved
politicians would be politically around by then). 

In some sense the decision might be irrelevant - if Germany and
Sweden buy their electricity from elsewhere rather than produce
it themselves they still get the power they need. And they cannot
turn inwards, they now have to participate in international trade
both to get the power and to earn the money to pay for it. But it
is also a sign that a not very well planned decision a long time
ago can haunt us even when it should be re-evaluated, especially
if public - and political! - understanding has not developed.

A brief communication in today's Nature that ought to interest
our resident nanotechnologists:

David O Haga, Christoph Schaffrath, Steven L. Cobb, John T.G.
Hamilton & Cormac D. Murphy, Biochemistry: Biosynthesis of an
organofluorine molecule, Nature 416, 279 (2002) 

They describe an enzymatic reaction that occurs in the bacterium
Streptomyces cattleya and which catalyses the conversion of
fluoride ion and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to
5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyfluoroadenosine (5'-FDA). The bacteria produce
fluoroacetate, which contains a fluor-carbon bond which might be
useful for wet nano.

Cryonics, NOT cryogenics.

It's not a big problem as long as there is a get-out clause, which I 
*assume* will be allowed (like they did in Italy a few years ago when they 
introduced similar measures).

It would just mean carrying an extra bit of paper with your cryonics tag, 
making clear what your whishes about organ donation are.

Cheers,
Fabio

Someone from Google reads this list. (Hi.)

What happened?  They made a mistake.  Then they corrected it.
(We discovered the correction when a Well Known Scientology
Critic called me at Dana St.  when we were getting organized to go
over there.)  We met with software engineer Matt Cutts and had a
very productive discussion about the DMCA and Google's policy for
handling takedown requests.

Here's a photo of the Mountain View California Xenu Independent Study
Group and Matt: http://zgp.org/~dmarti/images/google_meeting.jpeg

Unresolved questions:

Will Google always provide a copy of the complainant's letter to
the webmaster of the site that would be affected?

Will Google publish a list of DMCA takedowns it does?

Will Google drop the bland-sounding internal term PageRank(tm)
in favor of the more descriptive "Google Juice"?

(Everybody stopped running that lynx loop that says mean things
about Stanford, right?)

My bet on this is derived from the WorldWatch Institute's analysis (1999), 
indicates that fission is indeed, comparatively expensively. Therefore, power 
generation will continue to come primarily from natural gas (methane) via gas 
turbines. Perhaps much of this methane power ought to come from a variety of 
sources, especially Russia; which at present, seems much more desirable then 
OPEC nations.

Coal gasification is a very old technology, but also should be considered. It 
is certainly not as low-carbon as either fission or natural gas. Perhaps a 
technological advance might alter this?

Kai M. Becker noted:
<<All in all, nuclear power in Germany today is more expensive than old 
fashioned carbon burning - or buying cheap (and unsafe) power from Czechia, 
France or Russia. It's pure coincidence (and the magic of globalization), 
that the commercial interests and the people's interests go into the same 
direction. High risk technology has no good standing here. If the industry 
in Europe will find the way to really modern and safe power technologies in 
time remains to be seen. 

   Kai >>

If one has to wait for "magical technology", one will be waiting a very, 
long, time.

<<P.S. IMHO, when we sum up all costs of fission based nuclear power 
production, including everything necessary to minimize the risk of medium 
to large accidents, theft of radioactive material, etc., this technology 
will always be more expensive than lower risk technologies, simply because 
the necessary man power and bureaucracy is much higher.

Typical. Relying on French nuclear power and Czech nuclear power. So
what was that about giving up on nuclear power? Oh, just GERMAN nuclear
power.

Of course, its entirely responsible to leave the responsibility for long
term radioactive storage to the French and Czechs.

Yes, it would likely be rather rational to put them somewhere in the
hilly or mountainous northern regions. But there are likely issues with
the weather - long winters with much snow and occasional storms - and
how to transmit the power from remote locations. Also the NIMBY factor
is fairly population-density independent. Although the issue has not
come up, I would expect quite a bit of local resistance citing
destruction of scenery, environmental reasons and Sami rights to the
land. 

The best regions for wind power seem to be in the Baltic near southern
Sweden, but building the plants is still very expensive. This is of
course offset by fairly high subsidies, but without these subsidies the
plants would not be very economical. 

A superconductor power grid and some regions specialising in energy 
production might actually be a good idea, although there is a lot of
elegance and safety in a more widely distributed energy production
system.

I would think that their should be robotic high-pressure water
tunneling systems by now.  That's what you really need to
allow easy installation of the pipes to support a HTSC
distribution grid.  Anyone ever hear of such a system?

Things are, as usual, a bit more complex than black and white or Mike's 
simplified "just shoot them" picture of the world.

(1) The decision of the people (and the German government) was: We don't 
want nuclear power plants here, because it's too risky.

(2) The decision of the power companies, considering the regulations here 
was: We won't build any more nuclear plants here, because it's too 
expensive.

(3) The power companies found, that they can buy relatively cheap electric 
power from elsewhere - Czechia, France - and sell it in Germany. This 
concept is called free market, you know... 

(4) Today you can buy "green" electricity. You pay more, they buy the more 
expensive electricity from renewable resources, wind, water, solar, etc. At 
least that is what the power companies tell you.

If it is not too complicated for you, Mike, please try to see the 
difference between the "Not here" vote from the people on the one hand and 
the commercial decision by the companies on the other.

i.e. "we Germans are:

a) against nuclear power plants on German soil
b) not against using nuclear generated electricity from France and the
Chechs"

Despite the fact that German reactors are far more safe than the graphie
pile reactors in Chech Republic. I fail to see how Germans are 'reducing
their risk' by doing what they are doing.

Because those germans who don't want nuclear power have piled regulation
upon regulation on top of things, not that the technology in and of
itself is too expensive (especially when you account for taxes on carbon
emissions).

Yes, though that energy is primarily nuclear generated, so all that has
occured is that the Germans have hypocritically abdicated the
responsibility for their consumption. They have externalized their
environmental costs onto others. They are certainly NOT being
'Green'....

Yes, though I doubt the French or Chech sourced electricity is of that
sort.

I understand it completely. Try, yourself, to see the difference between
a Green who votes against nuclear power, against fission power, who
responsibly reduces their energy needs by 95% as a result, and someone
who is simply an elitist hypocrite who doesn't mind polluting the world
with nuclear waste, so long as that waste is in somebody else's back
yard.

Commenting on some of the cross Atlantic exchange...

Some of the papers I've read this morning suggest that the
French are actively looking at how to reprocess the plutonium
from spent nuclear fuel rods into new fuel (as well as figuring
out how to turn the Russian weapons grade material into fuel).

At the same time, Russia just changed its laws to accept
foreign nuclear waste (something that had been outlawed).
They figure it will earn them $10 billion+ over the next
couple of decades.

But you have to wonder about the risks of transporting
all that material around (we are talking many tons)
given the risks that it could be stolen.

I'd tend to agree with the German anti-nuke perspective
if you were voting in an era when you had missiles
pointed at your reactors.  But in our current era
Europe looks like a very risky place to have anything
nuclear.  I'd suggest that you want to site the nuclear
plants *and* the reprocessing facilities underground in
the center of military bases.

Is digging a big hole in the ground really that much more
expensive than building a reactor containment vessel
above ground?  What about old quarries or open pit
mines?  There are a lot of these in the U.S.  I'm
sure Italy has them as well.

Wrong. (1) German voters can only vote for German politics, not for Czechia 
and not for France. (2) There have been many protests and actions from  
Germans and Austrians against new nuclear plants in Czechia, esp. Temelin. 
(3) Where multinational power companies buy and sell which electricity is 
beyond the political will of the people here. Free market, you know...

If all those who are against nuclear power in Germany really buy "green" 
electricity instead of French or Chech power? Well, I don't know.

I don't think that those who are against nuclear power plants here are pro 
nuclear power elsewhere. But to vote for nuclear power here wouldn't 
prevent plants like Temelin.

I'm still on my self-imposed academic haitus from Extropian and un-Extropian
activities, but I thought I'd briefly resurface to bring you this tidbit:

http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,51274,00.html

I forget which intellectual property apologist it was I last argued
with that challenged me to produce evidence that "Big Media" is
attempting to sabotage free software. I cited DMCA as an example, I
believe. Here is an even more outrageous illustration of my point. How
hard exactly do we need to be beaten over the head with legislation
like this before we realize that:

1) For data to behave like the convenient physical commodities media
corps would like them to be, a level of surveillance and censorship
never before seen in history would be required.

2) Corporate lawyers and execs have no problem whatsoever with pushing
for such a level of surveillance and censorship as far as the
consumers and taxpayers will let them. In fact, "fiduciary
responsibility" laws in some cases would penalize corporate officials
for acting with maturity or common sense if doing so will in any way
diminish the short-term value of the corporation's stock.

3) This surveillance and censorship will be paid for by the consumers
and taxpayers without any benefit to them, and this payment will
ultimately be enforced on the coercive machinery of the state. In
short, if big government did not exist, mega-corps could not exist
either. Their partnership is anything but true capitalism.

4) Companies are not individuals. They are not recognized as such in
the constitution, nor in common law. Individuals have rights,
individuals can own property. Individuals write music, software, and
books. If individuals want to partner together for an entrepreneurial
venture, power to them.  However, the assets of this venture are the
joint property of those individuals, not some imaginary entity called
the corporation. You have no reason to abide by the legal fiction of
corporate personhood except to avoid punishment.

5) What makes matters worse is the doctrine of limited corporate
liability. Actions have consequences, and by limiting the legal
liability of stockholders for the actions of the executives they
appoint, those consequences are not being made to vanish into thin
air. Instead, they are being absorbed by the consumers, the employees,
and random people who have nothing whatsoever to do with the
corporation except for being downwind from a plant it owns or living
in a jurisdiction whose lawmakers it has bought.


...I don't know what an economy dominated by AOL/Time-Warner and
Disney (backed by legislation structured to maintain this dominance at
all costs) would be categorized as, but it is no longer a capitalist
one in any recognizable sense.

Nanocrystals' trapped atoms technology studied at Oak Ridge Labs. A
whole new technology awaits exploration with the discovery of a
technique for trapping single atoms, say scientists at the Department
of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). ORNL's Mike Barnes,
Thomas Thundat and Adosh Mehta have collaborated with Ramesh Bhargava
of Nanocrystals Technology in Briarcliff, N.Y., to cage single
europium atoms in nanocrystals not much larger than the atoms
themselves.

Nano-Tex Markets Brand To Become "Intel Inside" OF NANO MATERIALS.
Nano-Tex LLC has an unusual position in the nanomaterials industry.
It's not just its products, polymers engineered to attach to fibers
to make clothes stain-proof, wrinkle-free, absorbent or more
comfortable. Nor is it its worldwide business partnerships with
textile mills and fabric manufacturers. "We're trying to position
ourselves to be an ingredient brand, like Intel," said George
Henderson III, chief executive of Nano-Tex and the textile company
Burlington Industries, both based in Greensboro, N.C. Burlington owns
51 percent of Nano-Tex. (Small Times 3/23/02)

Magnetism to its lowest terms. While an ideal infinite chain of atoms
cannot sustain ferromagnetic order at nonzero temperature, an
international team of physicists shows that the finite length of the
chains and magnetic anisotropy barriers stabilize ferromagnetism at
finite temperatures in monatomic cobalt chains. The persistence of
ferromagnetism in monatomic chains has important consequences for the
design and properties of magnetic nanostructures, a very active field
of physical research and development today. (Max Planck Society

The reason I don't like this ('adapt people to technology')
perspective is that it can easily skew the humans' value system to
one of: technology has a higher value than humans. I think that
_humans_ are first and foremost and from here, we seek means of
survival (*and growth*) on this planet/outwards working, as best we
can, with the complex interaction between the Earth's biology,
sociology, chemistry, physics, politics, ... It is our (humans')
imaginative minds and values and ethics and hard work that create
technology to advance ours and the living beings on our planets'
lives. I agree that technology moves faster than we can keep up with
it, but we should always keep in mind that _it is 'us'_ who are
creating it.

If you put something like technology 'above' us, then you are
playing host to a wide range of items used (by governments, others)
to claim have more importance than humans.

(The items that humans create, which take on a different life of
their own, such as AI, falls into a different value system category.
Maybe that is more what you are referring for humans to adapt to?)

I really think that we can't emphasize enough the value of
humans/transhumans. It is from this position of our high value, that
we will/can address the problems of which technology can bring. It's
useful to take a step back to see the larger picture: remove, for a
moment, the technologies, and see humans/transhumans. What do we
want and need to survive and grow? What values, ethics, politics
enable that? Then add the technologies to learn how those can aid
us, not only to survive, but to grow in our human societies (don't
forget that we are embedded in that!), and to be 'better' (smarter,
healthier, live longer, etc etc)

==========================

Here's some (rather historical) text that you might find
interesting. It was written in 1911 (revised through 1931). The
author: a Brit namded Alfred Zimmern, in his book: _The Greek
Commonwealth: Politics and Economics in Fifth-Century Athens_, was
commenting on the fact that the Greek imagination lived in a freer
and simpler atmosphere, not needing to dig through problem after
problem of 'material organization' (please substitute 'technology'
when you see those words), in order to reach the important social
strata. Zimmern also admits that H.G. Wells' _A Modern Utopia_
influenced these next words. In his text, he is explaining what
position wealth (i.e. technology, riches) was placed in the Greek
world, which, because it was much simpler than ours, enabled the
Greeks to think through social problems and their need for wealth
more clearly. He also shows how tightly interwoven and bound the
Greek individual was to their society. No other society, except
perhaps the Japanese, have been so tightly bound. Many here would
not approve of such a tightly woven fabric between individual
and society, but I think that it is always important to remember
that we are embedded within the society, that we created:
we must use it, work with it (can even try to transform it),
if we, as humans/transhumans want to grow.

<begin LONG quote>
"When they [the Greeks] wished to discuss the perfect society, or
rather, the perfect life for human beings in society, they did not
have first to settle such business questions as whether the city or
groups of private citizens should manage the gas and tramways, or
what should be the proportion between direct and indirect taxation.
[..] They could leave on one side as irrelevant the familiar modern
problems of material organization and give their undivided attention
to 'those most interesting objects to be met with in life, human
beings'. So they lingered over such subjects as how to secure a
right relation between the sexes, or how to find the artist his
proper place in society, over the influence of professions upon
character, or of environment and example upon the young, discussing
them sometimes wisely and sometimes crudely, but always freshly and
sincerely: and it is humans along that never grow state, Greek
speculation on these topics is fruitful and suggestive to us still.

Strictly speaking, of course, there is no such thing as a problem of
material organization. All problems, from gas and tramways to
education and women's rights, are human problems, concerned with
people rather than with things. Even dividends and output would not
matter if there were no one to receive them. Yet men often act as if
they had forgotten this elementary truth.

Here we come upon another characteristic present-day difficulty
which the Greek thinkers were spared - the increase in the scale and
range of the modern world and of the sphere embraced by the modern
thinker. What to Plato and Aristotle were problems of city life,
bounded by the walls of the country town in which they lived, are
now removed for the modern thinker to the wider and more complex
sphere of national and international life. In other words, these
problems have not only grown in scale but, by so doing, they have
changed in character.

It is this impersonality of the world in which their thought is
forced to move which tempts modern political thinkers to stop one
step short of reality, to think in terms of things instead of
pushing the problem further back and thinking in terms of human
beings. An educational administrator, for instance, is inclined when
he discusses education, to think more of desks and blackboards and
apparatus and new buildings and teachers' salaries, than of children
and teachers; or to think of children and teachers, not as
individual living souls, but as so much accumulated human material.
The Greeks were not thus in danger of losing touch with the living
world around them. The social discussion never outran the natural
range of their senses and emotions; it it was always fresh and vivid
and personal, always invested with the feeling of reality which
springs from a close and evident relations between the intellect and
the objects of its thought.

[...]
It is well nigh impossible for us to think ourselves back into the
unearthly quietness and conservatism of this old Greek world which
has for ever passed away, into a civilized society from which the
stress and hurry and complexity and ceaseless change and 'progress'
of to-day are wholly absent. Yet this is what we must do if we would
put ourselves in the mood to understand the economic basis of Greek
society. We must get behind the Industrial Revolution, which has
altered the daily life of ordinary people more profoundly than any
other change since recorded history begin, behind wholesale
production and machinery and the rush of new patents and processes,
back into a sequestered and stable world where competition and
unemployment are unknown terms, where hardly any one is working
precariously for money wages or a salary, where life goes on
without visible change or desire of change from generation to
generation and century to century.

[...]
But surely the people in our Greek city were men like ourselves and
subject to the same human impulses and weaknesses? Surely the blood
of the 'economic man' ran in their veins, and like all sensible
people to-day, they desired to be rich?

That is just the point where the older Greeks differed most
profoundly from ourselves, or rather from the interpretation of the
modern man, given by some of his nineteenth-century leaders. The
older Greeks did not want to be rich for the sake of riches. They
were too sane and well-balanced to harbor such a desire. One of the
central facts about their life, expressed over and over again, in
their art and conduct and institutions, was their sense of harmony
and proportion. They had overcome the wild passion of the child or
the savage for 'too much'. They only desired riches when they had
convinced themselves that riches were necessary to social
well-being. They had sense enough to correlate the values of wealth
and well-being. [...] The older Greek tried to be faithful to the
doctrine that Solon preached, and, judged by any modern standard of
comparison, they were faithful indeed. What drove them into
economic activity and into the development we shall to trace was not
simply our senseless greed for more, a kind of insatiable craving
which would have run counter to some of their deepest instincts, but
the sober conviction that they needed wealth for the purposes of
their civilization. In other words, civilization, which means not
yachts and motor-cars but a refined and many-sided and effort-loving
society, costs money, and money cannot be had without economic
activity. So there is a point in the growth of every developing
society when it is driven by its own needs, however reluctant it may
be, into the atmosphere of money-getting, with all its attendant
temptations towards wrong standards of living. This is what happened
to the Greeks, and, above all, to Athens, just at the culminating
point of her greatness."

Nope, it's just that we're apparently a not very vocal minority. Most
mundanes don't know/care. Food for thought, given that transhumanism is
currently fringe de la fringe even in geek circles.

It can be a rewarding experience trying to communicate to interested and
intelligent, but otherwise immacolate parties in realtime under adverse
conditions (noise, progressive inebriation). We've been running a local
experiment for a few months now: http://mcfuturists.com/

If you can spare the time, I recommend trying to get something similiar
going in your locality. (It's even fun!).

Yes.

We've had that coming for a long time.  I'd have to check when the
last German nuclear power plant has been built, but I think there
are no later designs than from the 1970s around.

It's unrealistic from the German perspective, too.  The Green
movement wants to replace it with "alternative", pardon, "renewable"
energy sources (wind, hydro, solar, none of which is available on
a large scale in Germany) or, since this won't work, just curb power
consumption.

One of the more hilarious aspects is that now, as wind turbines are
increasingly deployed, the Greens have started fighting those too,
because of noise, countryside aesthetics, etc.  They've been against
hydro in Austria as well.

I think a more accurate representation of popular opinion is that
nuclear power is *evil*.  This has been beyond rational discussion
since the late '80s.  Nuclear power means Chernobyl and nukes.
Anybody advocating nuclear power must clearly be in bed with the
evil power companies.  Even technical people will casually drop
comments about the "inherent uncontrolability of nuclear power".

I could proclaim that the sky is falling, but I'm sure we'll muddle
through.  We'll just burn a bit more fossil fuels, and we'll buy
power from abroad.  Who needs power plants anyway?  I get my power
from the wall jack.

Public opinion is fickle.  (Just watch the wild pro/contra swings
throughout the EU surrounding the introduction of the euro.)  A few
blackouts--maybe strategically placed during the broadcasts of the
Soccer World Cup this summer--would go a long way towards making
nuclear power popular again.  The way things are, we'll have to
wait until some pain is felt.

I'm confident that if things get tight, nuclear power will be
resurrected.  It will be a mild annoyance that we won't have any
recent designs or know-how by then.

When you realize what an absolute kludge humans are (speaking

Are we?  If you accept that humans are sub-optimal, then doesn't
growth [really more importantly -- evolution] become much more
important than survival?

Actually Amara that isn't true.  In everything from our computers
to our cars to our planes to even your telescopes and probes,
its our *tools* who are doing much of the creation.  As a team
at Brandeis has shown if you give a program an idea of how
to recognize something "useful" it can do the creation aspect
quite easily with no input from the human other than having
gifted it with the ability to say "ah-ha".  I could go on about
computers writing, creating art, data mining, etc.

We have passed out of the realm where humans are the sole
creators on the planet.  We started doing so long ago --
it requires a furnace and a hammer to make a blade.

No argument.  But as we have discussed many times we don't have
a good solution for when "The needs of the gods outweigh the
needs of the demi-gods, or the non-gods".

There was a good (repeat) episode about this on Stargate SG-9
last night.  A race of relatively primitive people (X) has been
relocated to planet 'paradise'.  Planet paradise is the only
known planet with a Stargate that has the right atmospheric
conditions for X to live.  Alien spaceship shows up holding
the remnants of civilization Y, a 10,000 year old civilization
that has been wiped out.  It starts terraforming planet paradise
such that it can support the resurrection of civilization Y.
Of course the terraforming resources on the ship can only be used once
and planet paradise is the only planet out of millions examined
capable of supporting Y.  The terraforming process is completely
deadly to people X and there isn't enough time to evacuate
them even if they could find an suitable alternate planet.

The dilema for the Stargate team is whether to sacrifice
people X or attempt to destroy the spaceship, permanently
extincting civilization Y.  They discover an interesting
solution to the problem which I will not disclose here.

I don't think these types of moral dilemas are going to go
away anytime soon.  I think one has to come up with better
arguments than saying 'a priori' the value of humans or
even the rights of humans must be preserved indefinately.
Anyone who has read any science fiction can presumably
come up with more than a few cases where that simply
doesn't seem to be justifiable.

> What values, ethics, politics enable that?

The same values and ethics (I'll leave politics out of the equation)
that can rationally recognize when oneself (as an individual
or a group or a species) is no longer relevant in the grand
scheme of the universe.

I agree that growth is necessary, but humans must survive before
they grow.

The gist of my previous message was that I disagree on the
view of technology being imposed on us 'from without'. Instead,
technology imposed 'from within' gives us a human/transhuman-centric
worldview to guide the directions of our growth with a system of checks
and balances (our values, ethics) along with our own creativity and
ingenuity, leaving room for wonderful surprises using our technological
tools. Of course we need to discuss and plan for runaway disasters,
but I think it hurts us to think and act as if technology controls us
(i.e. that people must adapt to technology). That path only plays
on fears.

The real richness in our present and future lives are humans/transhumans
(and whatever other sentient beings pass our way). Those, I think should
be the focus, not the technology. The technology in my view is simply
one of the tools for our growth.

For how long?

Burning methane is unsustainable unless you have robust systems
for recycling the carbon.  There is an easy solution for this
that involves fertilizing the oceans with iron or phosphorus but
if the law of unintended consequences applies then one should look
at this as only a last resort.

The discussion is probably irrelevant if we get robust MNT in the next
20 years, but a relatively large sized rock hitting the planet could
deflect that trend and make the amount of CO2 we have put into the
atmosphere even worse.  If that triggers the melting of the methane
clathrates at the ocean bottom then we *really* have a problem.

I'll admit the odds are unlikely, but as we evolve, our hazard
function is going to be determined by our ability to recognise
and avoid the uncommon hazards.

If the Europeans become addicted to Russian natural gas (the closest
supply), more than they currently are then they are in the same position
with regard to Russia as the U.S. is with regard to the Middle East.
Not a wise long term strategy.

When you realize what an absolute kludge most computer programms 
are (speaking from the standpoint of a world-class programmer 
who happens to be human) it isn't very hard to see both in 
perspective as having very serious flaws.  :-)

Both individuals and the species cannot evolve/grow/get better 
if the individual or the species no longer survives.  Any 
question of "better" or "higher value" must answer "better for 
whom/what".  There is no intrinsically "better".  Many believe 
that some forms of technology will be much "better" in terms of 
some things we consider of great value like intelligence.  But 
intelligence alone is not necessarily "better" nor is it yet 
certain that we will see this type of higher intelligence any 
time soon.  Do you now rank humans in such a way as to consider 
those of higher IQ better than others of lesser IQ? Would you do 
so if the range was much wider? Or do you recognize that there 
is a range of values involved and that there is also worth and 
value in human beings qua human being?  If you do not then the 
great danger is eventually siding with those who someday may 
call for removing the excessive and relatively useless (to them) 
inferior semi-sentient biomass.  Avoidance of such dystopia 
requires getting our values and their underpinnings well sorted 
out long before such a time.

Perhaps often there will be such abundance and relative little 
interleaving of needs and interests that the problem will not so 
often come up.  But there is a large need for recognition of the 
rights of various types of sentient beings to exist and have 
room to grow.  Without this recognition there is only nature, 
greatly empowered by technology, "red in tooth and claw".  Is 
this the best we can come up with?

The rights of humans are simply the requirements of their 
survival and well-being.  If you value humans you recognize 
these rights.  They are not separable. I don't think the 
question of "justification of human existence" even comes up 
unless their existence prevents the existence of something else 
at minimum that is somehow "better".  That scenario is quite 
questionable.  Who judges "better" and who judges when the 
conflict does not have a solution where all groups survive and 
thrive?  One thing is certain.  If we can't find good reasons 
why an "inferior" species must survive if it is in the way of a 
"superior" one then we certainly can't complain when a 
supposedly superior species (natural or artificial) attempts to 
destroy us.


Historically this sort of thinking has occurred between 
different groups and "races" of humans.  Do we think this type 
of idea is more palatable and reasonable if the range of 
difference between the groups of beings involved is 
significantly larger than the relatively paltry difference 
between groups of humans?

In my opinion, 100-150 years if necessary. I believe we have immense

impermissible. That is a wholly different issue.

Again, Robert, you introduce an important issue, but not central to this 
thread. The Euros have demanded that nuclear fission cease, upon German soil. 
All else, becomes subserviant to this ideological, viewpoint.  But to address 
your query, there are immense resources of natural gas available, if one 
spends money to build retorts that separate impurities from natural gas. Much 
of this gas resource exists well outside the CIS. If Germany switched to coal 
gasification, it would have abundant methane to power turbines. 

But again, we would encounter the release of CO in its production. The 
World-Watch Institue advocates increased use of natural gas for this reason. 
Perhaps Germany's electricity will then come from natural gas produced in 
Australia or the Middle East?

Yes, reflecting on last weeks comments about the myth of flawed human
thinking: just because something is suboptimal (assuming we know what
'optimal' truly is) doesn't necessarily mean that it is flawed. Indeed,
laws of physics dictate that the closer something gets to optimal, the
more likely it is to become flawed. Being 'suboptimal' in many
situations is far more optimal than being perfect (see Eli's old
Algernon papers) due to this tendency toward greater degree or odds of
being/becoming flawed.

A Singularity doesn't necessarily imply that our current standards of
measurement become infinite, merely that they become meaningless as new
standards of measurement become more relevant. Miles per hour isn't
nearly as relevant today as Megahertz is, while a hundred years ago,
bushels per hectare was a more important standard of measurement.

Using technology to increase the 'richness' in our present and future
lives depends on our using technology to understand the world to such a
greater extent that we drastically change what we deem to be important
to our lives and existence. New metrics push old ones to the background
of relevancy, singularities occur, and new frames of reference flower.

That which we determine to be of earth shattering importance today
becomes trivial at an ever increasing rate.

Which is why they are more accurately described as Browns: they want 90%
of the human race dead in the cesspool of history, and the other tenth
left wallowing in the excretory life of cavemen.

May we take as paradigmatic Aeschylus' 'pathei mathos'(learned by having 
undergone, or by suffering comes our learning, or wisdom comes alone
through suffering) in the 'Agamemnon'???

In Aeschylus 'pathei mathos' gathers together the experiences of 
all the protagonists in the 'Oresteia' with the possible exception 
of Apollo and Athena (they too are subject to the plan of Zeus).
(But 'pathos', suffering, can also mean 'feeling'.)

Thus Greek culture dramatize the relationship between human suffering 
and human achievement. Bentham, Adam Smith, Hans-Georg Gadamer make a 
similar point, and Dostoevskj writes 'Suffering is the sole origin 
of consciousness'. And John Keats interprets Aeschylus' phrase into
'Sorrow is wisdom'.

Or the ANWR...

The WWI is typically ignorant of the actual impact of exponential curves
on consumption and excretion. It is irrelevant if natural gas produces
20-50% less CO2 than coal per BTU. If your consumption is increasing
faster than the rate of conversion, then your emissions continue to
increase as a whole.

Now, this is assuming that the Greenhouse effect as an anthropogenic
threat is real. The latest research shows that the hilariously short
period datasets used by the proponents of the anthropogenic theory are
quite sadly.... off. The Milankovitch Cycle of warming over the past
thousand years accounts for a minimum of half the current observed
warming of this past century, and the growth of localized urban
greenhouse effects account for a good share of the rest (i.e. the
weather centers stay in one place in urban areas while growth occurs
around them with increasing local pollution and local warming, with
greater than actual reported results).

Now, if anything accounts for the bubble of the last 30 years, it is the
CFC emissions with the ozone hole UV messing up the natural carbon
sequestration patterns of oceanic phytoplankton. Banning CFCs should
repair that little problem, and improve natural sequestration of CO2
back to its pre-air-conditioning days.

There is some information about the new Hollings bill at www.eff.org.
Another helpful site is digitalconsumer.org, which is sponsored by a bunch
of Internet companies.  They have a link you can click on and they will
fax your letter to Congress.  You can either use their boilerplate or edit
it with your own thoughts.  It's a very easy way to register your protest.

One of the links on the EFF site was a letter by Leslie Vadasz, an
Intel executive, to the Hollings committee expanding on his testimony
in opposition to the (then) proposed bill.  Vadasz made one comment
which surprised me.
http://www.eff.org/IP/SSSCA_CBDTPA/20020228_intel_hollings_letter.html:

"I reiterate that the CPTWG cross-industry working group has developed
effective technology that is available today that can and will protect
new digital, secured content from being pirated on the Internet. If it is
protected 'at the source' it will always be protected from the illegal
activities of Internet pirates. Sony Pictures and AOL-Time/Warner have
in fact licensed this technology."

I was surprised that the EFF appears to be endorsing a letter which,
while opposing legislation, basically said that it was unnecessary because
the same thing could be achieved by existing technology.  In doing some
additional research, I believe that the technology that Vadasz is talking
about is DTCP, the Digital Transmission Content Protection standard.
A set of slides about it is at http://www.dtcp.com/data/dtcp_tut.pdf.

The basic idea is that content is kept encrypted until it reaches a
hardware display device that has a key built into it.  At that point
the data is decrypted and presented.  The goal eventually is to get to
a point where the data is encrypted everywhere that it is in digital
form, only being decrypted in the same hardware device that will turn
it into analog signals.  This will prevent the data from being captured
and duplicated with the full fidelity of the original.

The cryptography which is used is interesting, especially if you compare
it with the earlier DVD CSS system, which had a somewhat similar goal.
CSS was for protecting DVD video, while DTCP is for protecting broadband
streaming video and audio.  Both of them rely on encrypting the data and
allowing only authorized systems to decrypt and display it.

In CSS, each different manufacturer was given a unique device key.
The DVD is encrypted with a single content key, then the content key is
encrypted with every possible device key and all those values are stored
on the DVD.  Each device is able to decrypt one of the encrypted content
keys, recovering the content key and allowing it to decrypt and display
the movie.

Two things went wrong with this plan.  The first is that one of the
content keys leaked.  Some of the keys were associated with software
rather than hardware, and people were able to pull the key out of the
software.  Second, CSS used a non-standard cryptographic algorithm,
which turned out to be weak.  The algorithm was supposed to be secret,
but it was also revealed by inspecting software implementations.
By analyzing the algorithm, cryptographers found it to be weak enough
that even without knowing one of the device keys, it was still possible
to figure out the content key very easily.

DTCP tries to avoid both of these flaws.  They are using more
sophisticated, and also more standard, cryptography.  Since they are
dynamically streaming data rather than burning it onto a static disk,
they have an easier time of dealing with problems.

As with CSS, DTCP gives each device a unique key.  When the data begins
to be streamed from the server to the client, they do a cryptographic
handshake using the client device's key.  During this time the client
device proves that it is legitimate by offering a certificate on its
key, signed by the Digital Transmission License Administrator (DTLA).

This is very similar to the way cryptographic certificates are used today
in such protocols as SSL, which is commonly used for online shopping.
When you visit a site such as Amazon.com and go to the order page,
Amazon presents its own key to your browser, within a certificate created
typically by a company called Verisign.  Your browser can check to see
that Amazon's key is legit by verifying the certificate.  This prevents
someone from hijacking your browser session and pretending to be Amazon.

DTCP uses the same idea.  Only devices with keys that are "blessed"
(certified) by the DTLA will be allowed to receive data.  The interesting
thing about this is that it includes the concept of certificate
revocation.  Suppose one of the DTCP keys got stolen out of a software
or hardware implementation and posted on the Internet.  Then people
could create software which pretended to be that DTCP device, receive
an encrypted data stream, decrypt it and pirate it.  This is similar to
what happened with the initial break of the CSS standard.

DTLA has a counter-measure.  They can revoke the certificate of the
specific device whose key got stolen.  That key will no longer be
accepted for use.  Any key which gets stolen and widely publicized will
be invalidated by DTLA.  This will stop the pirate software from working.

The other thing the DTCP standard does is to use relatively standard
cryptographic algorithms rather than roll their own as CSS did.
The cipher they are using is called M6, which has been around in
the cryptographic community for some time.  I have heard that some
weaknesses have been found in it, but as far as I know it's not DOA like
CSS was as soon as it was publicized.  M6 is using only a 56 bit key,
presumably due to export restrictions at the time the DTCP was designed.
That is a little weak by today's standards but it will still cost a lot
of money to break one of those keys.  It's not going to be like CSS,
which could be broken in seconds even without a content key.

The CSS guys really blew it, which has added to the general impression
that digital content protection can't work without legislation.
Certainly the content providers appear to believe that, hence their push
for the Hollings bill.  Intel and the hardware companies think they have
a standard, DTCP, which can work even without legislation.

I don't think the CBDTPA will get anywhere, personally.  The firestorm
of opposition is just getting going.  I suspect that we are going to see
a few more rounds of technological games as the battle between content
protectors and pirates continues.  In the end I think they will succeed
in keeping data safe while digital; however versions with one generation
of analog loss will be pirated.  That's my prediction for the eventual
outcome.

That market has been discontinued.  It ran from Spring of '99 through last
year.  

There were three questions based on whether the Feynman Grand Prize would be
won by 2010, 2015, and 2020 respectively.  The prices rather stably reflected
a consensus it wouldn't be by 2010 (25 bid, 30 ask), but was likely by 2020
(65/75), and no clear answer on 2015 (40/50).

Is not this a terribly ironic position for the greens?  Consider that humans
are the only species on this planet capable of rescuing those elements
which are essential to life but are constantly slipping out of the life 
cycle.  

In the last issue of the Exponent I argued that by burning oil, gas and 
coal,
we are returning to circulation the carbon which had long ago fallen out
of the life cycle, and had become permanently unavailable to carbon-based
lifeforms.  Since then I realized the argument was laughably understated,
for carbon is but one element that can fall out of the life cycle.  Two 
others
that are also essential to life and are subject to falling out of the 
cycle would
be calcium and phosphorus.

When sea creatures perish, their carcasses drift to the depths.  Their
bones contain calcium.  Phosphorus puts the P in ATP, essential to running
every cell in both plants and animals.  There are processes which break
down the sea-bottom carcasses of course, but these are evidently
insufficient in themselves, which explains the existence of phosphorus 
mines
today.  Natural processes cannot fully return all life's elements to the 
life cycle.

Had not humanity come along, all Gaia's lifeforms would eventually perish
for want of calcium and phosphorus, long ere lack of carbon would
become a serious issue, long ere fatal global cooling as a result of
atmospheric shortage of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and
methane.

The Greens are ignoring the fact that humanity is saving this planet
and all the life on it.  Evidently Gaia in her all-seeing wisdom, evolved
humanity to get all techno and rescue the calcium and phosphorus.  spike

I thought that most to the folks on this list had made
personal analyses of the date of the singularity. If your
analysis results in a date in the next 30 years, then new nuclear
plants are unnecessary. We can and should employ the "least disruptive"
current technologies even if there are long-term side-effects, because
we (or our brilliant successors) can easily deal with them.

This is not a comfortable point of view. It sound like the worst
sort of short-term thinking, like eating the seed corn. However, the
truth is that all energy generation is disruptive. Solar, wind, and
hydro generally require massive up-front capital outlay for longer-term
paybacks, Coal mining rapes the landscape and builds CO2, nuclear
requires a massive outlay for educating the public, etc.

In my opinion, the correct extropian evaluation uses a very sharp
discount rate, because we know that technology will advance much faster
than most analysts believe. Therefore, we should favor energy generation
that minimizes initial capital outlay. This conclusion goes against all
my prejudices and upbringing and is therefore emotionally uncomfortable,
but is a direct consequence in my rational analysis that the singularity
is highly likely to occur before 2020. This does not mean that I'm
waiting for the tooth fairy to bring about the singularity. It does mean
that I'm no longer interested in the power debate.

In my opinion, singularity-->SI-->MNT, and SI+MNT gets us free local
low-intensity energy (solar, biomass, and geothermal) sufficient to run
all household and local transportation needs. A house designed and run 
by a competent computer using MNT will use almost no energy relative to
an existing house. Most household energy use is for heating and cooling
of air, water, and food, and is laughably inefficient. We will use
local fusion based on MNT-built beam reactors for any high-intensity
energy needs, so the entire existing energy infrastructure will be
irrelevant.

Perhaps not, but it can become much more efficient (ADP/ATP turnover
in cells is *very* rapid), or it can make substitutions (its really
rather a crime that ATP is the standard unit of currency for all
reactions requiring energy.  That leads to a lot of wasted energy
because the enzymes can't make change except in the form of heat.

If the volcanos are spitting up CO2 from subduction zones, then
the are certainly releasing some of the Ca/P as well.  I think
a complex discussion with some geologists would be required
to determine the rate at which we might be losing Ca/P.

My bets are on the oceans evaporating (should nothing else
intervene).  At that point I think plate tectonics gets a lot
slower.

there will have to a very high quality analog line, essentially
indistinguishable from the original, at the latest right before reaching the
solenoids of the loudspeakers, also susceptible to tapping and digitization.
There might be a huge market for kits for do-it-yourselfers.

I think the megacorporations will achieve their goal of total control of IP
only when they manage to fully subvert and control the state, and enforce
universal, real time surveillance of almost everybody. Until then, we the

=20
A MOLECULAR BEC has been achieved by Carl Wieman and his
colleagues at the University of Colorado.  To be precise, what
Wieman reported at this week's APS March Meeting in
Indianapolis was the observation of a quantum superposition of
diatomic molecules and disassociated atoms in a trap.  Having long
used Rb-87 in his BEC experiments, Wieman has as of late been
studying Rb-85 which, although it is harder to condense, possesses
just the right fine-grained set of quantum energy levels (hyperfine
levels) so that the application of a magnetic field can alter the
interaction force among the atoms in the trap, even as they reside
in the single quantum state which is the hallmark of Bose Einstein
condensates. By adjusting the magnetic field to be very close to the
point where the interatomic force goes from attractive to repulsive,
a "Feshbach resonance" occurs and some of the atoms form
molecules.  The atoms and molecules are thought to be coherent
(share a single quantum state) at least locally, and maybe over
longer distances too.  In this process the condensate appears first to
implode and then rebound somewhat like a supernova, even to the
extent of sending out jets of particles and leaving behind a
remnant.  The physics behind this "Bosenova" behavior is still a
mystery.
    Wolfgang Ketterle of MIT, like Wieman a winner of the 2001
Nobel Prize in physics for BEC discoveries, spoke at the same
APS session and reported findings in three areas.  (1) He has used
a sodium-23 BEC to help cool a gas of lithium-6.  Li-6 is a
fermionic atom (one with a half-integral net spin).  The Pauli-
exclusion principle forbids such atoms from falling into the single
state available to bosonic atoms such as Na-23, but the Li-6 atoms
can, if cooled low enough, occupy all the lowest energy quantum
states possible.  This has now been done in the MIT experiment,
the first time such a "degenerate Fermi sea" has co-existed with a
large BEC.  One wants to see how such a fermi gas behaves at nK
temperatures and whether the atoms can be coaxed (by
manipulating the interaction between them) into forming Cooper
pairs, becoming thereby a superfluid.  =20
       (2) Ketterle reported the propagation of a condensate in a
magnetic waveguide.  First, his group made a large (2 million
atoms) BEC in the usual way (in a magnet trap), then loaded it into
a magnetic trap by 40 cm, and finally loaded it into a microtrap on
a printed circuit board.   The micro-journey around the chip was
partly smooth and partly bumpy, especially when the cigar-shaped
BEC came toward a Y divide.  (Such a beam splitter would be a
useful step toward making an interferometer for atom waves.)  At
the divide the condensate wiggled itself into a snake shape.  Close
to the chip surface, the condensate broke up into several detached
segments.  Future atom chips will need better control of surface
roughness.
    (3) Another goal is the generation of pair correlated atoms.=20
Ironically, the atoms in a condensate all share a single quantum
state but are not otherwise entangled.  The MIT researchers have
created two BEC blobs (let us call them 1 and 2) together with
another small "seed" condensate (blob 3).  The elastic collision of
these blobs produced a fourth blob in a process called four-wave
mixing (for an earlier version of this experiment, at NIST.
In effect the atoms in blobs 1 and 2 help to amplify
blob 3 (a gain of 20, in this case).  For each atom added to blob 3
one atom is put into blob 4.  This created two pair-correlated
atomic beams.   In some future experiment this pair correlation
might be verified directly if one could detect single atoms in the
two condensates, which are moving off in opposite directions.=20
Right now it is difficult to spot single neutral atoms in a BEC.=20
     Single-atom detection is likely in helium BECs since the atoms,
deliberately put into an excited state in order to confine and cool=20
them in the first place, are easily ionized, making it far easier to =
detect=20
them.  Chris Westbrook, a member of Alain Aspect's team at Orsay,
summarized recent helium work and described a scheme for
producing helium molecules within a BEC.  This, he said, might
allow an atom-wave equivalent to the current process of down-
conversion, by which UV photons can be converted, in a special
crystal, into a pair of lower-energy but entangled photons (if one
photon has a horizontal polarization, the other must have a vertical
polarization. A beam of related atoms could,
analogously, be sundered into beams of pair-correlated atoms.
     Finally, Jakob Reichel (Max Planck/Univ Munich), a member
of one of Ted Hansch's groups, said at the APS meeting that he and
his colleagues were aiming to achieve single-atom detection in
rubidium condensates.  Furthermore, he hoped that the single
atoms, maneuvered into resonant cavities, might be able to carry
out quantum computing chores.

However, this is not relevant to Spike's point. The point is that
sequestration of carbon to the point that Ice House conditions become
prevalent results in the Earth eventually losing most of its atmosphere
as Mars did. We've already lost 98% of the atmosphere we started with
3.5 billion yrs ago, most of which is tied up in limestone, marble, etc
and will not be released by any tectonic processes.

The human race came along just in time, it seems, to rescue Earth from
terminal stages of Ice House conditions. The colder it gets, more
atmosphere precipitates into solid and liquid, which eventually become
rock, the ozone layer dies out with increasing cold, allowing solar UV
to help boil off the upper atmosphere to space.

With technological intervention, the possible 'green belt' of
habitability become wider for much longer, independent of the Sun and
the Earth's natural processes.

Thanks Mike, thats pretty interesting.  Might this be a reason to suspect we
will not find vary many samples of life on other planets? Unless
technologically adept intelligent species evolved to circumvent the 'natural
process' then those processes may lead non-technology life to cause its own
extinction.

Right!  We shouldn't think of gas guzzling SUVs as *using* resources so much
as *rescuing* resources.  SUVs are the friend of lifeforms.  They free 
up more
carbon, allowing more plant life, allowing more animal life.  spike

While not ordinarily a fan of directly confronting the Greens, if Earth
really does require technological maintenance and adjustment in order to
survive in the near-term "long term", I think that's a powerful argument
against "naturalist" views.

Does anyone want to write up an "Earth's Required Maintenance" page?  I lack
the knowledge to do so myself.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

The Long Bets Foundation, at http://www.longbets.org/, is "a public
arena for enjoyably competitive predictions, of interest to society, with
philanthropic money at stake."  Bets are between two people, at even odds,
with at least $1000 at stake, with the outcome two or more years in the
future.  You have to put the money in up front, however the winner doesn't
get it - it goes to the charity of his choice.  (Actually the Foundation
invests it and then keeps half of the appreciated amount for itself.)

The subject is supposed to be important to society or science.  Bettors
are also required to write an essay explaining why they think their
prediction will come true.  Then there is a discussion board based
on the essays.  I get the impression that the bets are the marquee
attraction but that the real point of the site will be the discussions
(which start in April).

The Long Bets Foundation is a spin-off from The Long Now Foundation,
which was created by ex-Thinking Machines head Danny Hillis to get people
thinking in the long term.  The most famous project of Long Now is The
Clock of the Long Now, a clock which is supposed to last for 10,000 years,
a long as you remember to wind it.

Some of the bets: Ray Kurzweill bet Mitchell Kapor $20,000 that a computer
will pass the Turing Test by 2029.  Esther Dyson bet Bill Campbell
$10,000 that the NY Times and WSJ will have referred to Russia as "the
software development capital of the world" by 2012.  Danny Hillis bet
Nathan Myhrvold $2,000 that the universe will eventually stop expanding.
Lots of famous names here as you can see.

Needless to say, very few of the bets anticipate the kind of technological
changes which we foresee in the next several decades.  The rich people
making these bets tend to rely on relatively linear extrapolations.
The whole idea behind these "Long" foundations is IMO fundamentally a
static view of human nature and its potentialities.  But don't get me
started on that damned Clock.

And unlike Robin Hanson's Idea Futures, you don't get much information
about the likelihood of the outcomes just from the fact that two people
were willing to make a bet at even odds.  It would be nice if the Long
Bets people were willing to run an ancillary IF market on each of their
claims so that people could bet on which side would win.  Then you might
get something useful out of them.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

One of the paradoxes of current American culture is that despite an
emphasis on low-fat, healthy eating and exercise, people are fatter
today than ever.  According to today's L.A. Times,
http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-000021490mar25.story?coll=la-headlines-health-manual,
the reason may not be junk food or less time at the gym, but rather the
dozens of small labor-saving innovations which have been introduced into
our daily lives over the past few decades.

   Blair contends that America's diet and leisure-time exercise habits
   have changed little during the past few decades. Dietary surveys and
   other data collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture "[suggest]
   that energy intake in the United States has not increased during the
   past 40 years," he writes. Studies of physical activity habits only
   assess participation in leisure-time sports and fitness activities,
   says Blair, who adds that these numbers have remained constant over
   the last 25 years.

If people aren't eating more or doing less sports and fitness activities,
why the increase in fat?  According to the article, it's the little things
that count: paying at the pump instead of walking into the gas station;
buying prepared salad instead of chopping up your own lettuce and carrots;
using your TV remote and garage door opener instead of walking a few feet.
Each of these things only costs a few calories, but they add up over the
course of the day to perhaps 100, which equals 10 pounds of fat per year.

The article suggests wearing a step counter, and setting a goal to
increase your steps per day by 2000.  It didn't say how many most
people get, but 2000 steps is about 15 minutes of walking and will
burn maybe 90 calories, so that could make a significant difference
in the long term.

As I look at my life, it's true, there are many small things which save a
few seconds of time and effort here and there.  I often keep a portable
phone next to my chair so I don't have to get up when the phone rings.
Computers have replaced many face to face visits with email.  I am able
to work at home now, which wouldn't have been possible fifteen years ago,
and that means less walking.  Even when I am in the office I will often
send email to a co-worker rather than go see if he is in his cubicle.
Drinks are sold in 32 ounce sizes so you don't have to get refills
so often.  Everyone carries water bottles instead of finding a drinking
fountain (although maybe carrying the water uses more calories than you
save in not going to the fountain).

We've done so much to make our lives easier, but in the end it hurts
our health.  Until we can take a pill and get the health benefits of
exercise, these little energy savings will be working against us.

I could help out as well. For those interested, a good reference on the
topic is Martyn J. Fogg's seminal text "Terraforming: Engineering
Terrestrial Environments" which you can order at Amazon or Borders.

A very interesting text, to say the least.

Rafal's comments about  volcanic outgassing are a bit overdone. There is
nowhere near enough volcanic activity around subduction zones to allow
for outgassing of all CO2 (especially since there isn't enough O2 for
all the carbon), although there is a greater proportion than at one
time. Note that as the Moon orbits further and further from the Earth as
it drains radial momentum from Earth's rotation, its tidal influence
decreases and thus tectonic activities slow down.

Nor does subduction do anything about carbonates deposited outside of
subduction areas. The Great Barrier Reef, for one, is not subducting and
is one of the great modern carbon sequestration areas, as is the
Carribean basin. Another sequestration area is the Southern Sea around
Antarctica, which produces a huge amount of phytoplankton that
sequesters billions of tons of carbon each year that settles to the
bottom of the ocean to become hydrates in non-subduction areas.

One wonders what the nanny state will do if this is indeed the main reason
why Americans have gained weight.  If class action lawsuits and implementing
fat taxes and restrictions on 'fast food' lead to no significant decrease in
weight, what next?  

Bring class action lawsuits against remote control manufacturers? 

Implement a cordless phone and escalator tax? 

Outlaw pay at the pump gas stations, garage door openers and bagged
vegetables?

OK, but these minor, recent lifestyle changes would seem to be
insignificant compared the the changes over the last 100 years or
so. Forget about paying at the pump vs. walking into the station...how
about driving a car vs. riding a horse or wagon? And growing and
harvesting your lettuce and carrots vs. buying them? Any 100-year-old
form of entertainment vs. watching TV? Were people 100 years ago much
leaner than they were 50 years ago, or did they eat a lot more? If
they ate more, as I suspect, then maybe we just need to eat less.

How about eating 90 fewer calories/day?

Do these nickle and dime caloric expenditures really improve your
health? If you're getting the exercise you need at a gym or through
other physical activity, is there really a health benefit to giving up
these conveniences, assuming proper weight is maintained?

I wonder about the psychological effects.  For example, the
continued reduction of everything to monotonous tasks - button
pushing - probably has some effect on memory.

It's all temporary.  Everything in the ocean either subducts or gets brought
back to land (the hydrates are unstable at atmospheric pressure).  When
the tectonics shut down, there'll be an issue, but not before.

Hi all,

Just a quick note to you that I have recently come down with an internet worm 
virus, and will not be sending any emails from my regular server until I have 
conquered it (apparently it made it past Norton AntiVirus 2001, so I am looking 
into McAfee).

It is coming to me in a number of subject lines, most commonly "Happy Lady Day" 
and "A Humour Game," but also many others.  If anyone has some tips on how to 
get rid of this, please let me know off-list.

In my six+ years online, this is the first virus I have been infected with, so 
I suppose it had to catch up with me some time.

Mark Shuttleworth, whom I met and had a drink with a couple of years ago
when we were on a crypto panel together, is scheduled to be the second
"space tourist" when he heads to the International Space Station on a
Russian Soyuz launch, April 25.

Shuttleworth founded the South African crypto certification company
Thawte, which was bought by Verisign for a reported $600 million.
Rumors are that the space mission is costing him something over
$20 million, a small part of his new fortune.

He has a web page, www.africaninspace.com, describing his preparations
and training in South Africa, Houston and Russia as the launch date
approaches.  He has assembled a team of trainers, doctors and advisors
who are helping him get ready.

In related news, 'N Sync member Lance Bass recently travelled to Moscow
for medical exams to see if he is fit enough to go into space.  Bass,
who gave up a dream of being an astronaut to become a singer instead,
may now get his boyhood wish.  He could become the third tourist in
space, this fall.

Hi Folk,

Just a passing note that our colleagues at www.edge.org have had a serious
injection of Kurzweil/Singularity meme . To date the word singularity
doesn't appear much in their discussions in the context that we know it.

I feel this is significant as there are a huge number of people from a large
range of backgrounds who will now be educated indirectly in a trans/post
human theme.

It'll be worth seeing what the Edge people do with it.

cheers

Colin

Assuming that this isn't a hoax (some fact and reference
checking would make sense here), then the idea of sending
ones DNA out of the solar system on a solar sail propelled
probe could be very interesting.

See:
http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=7824
and
http://www.TeamEncounter.com/index_static.html

Now when I first read this I got quite excited.
Wow, I can send my DNA out on a probe and perhaps someday
in the future scientists on another planet will be able
to clone me.  But then I thought, wait a minute, what
if the probe ends up crashing into some planet with
some primordial soup and ends up evolving into a Klingon
like species that someday in the future decides to
use their point source singularity weapons on the
Matrioshka Brain around the sun into which humanity
has evolved and into which I just happen to be uploaded.

Is this really a good idea?
Should we start a protest site now?

Use *pine* or some other email program that simply cannot
spread viruses.  I mean really -- reading text on the screen
isn't known to infect computers -- its all the value added
stuff that vendors think will make your life easier that
you need to avoid.

It looks like I've effectively licked it.  My Live Updates subscription to 
Norton Antivirus 2001 had somehow expired, so I had to renew and download 
their current virus definitions.  I have heard of some horror stories with 
McAfee, so I wanted to avoid that if possible.  I was beginning to think 
over the past year or so that good old Eudora 5.1 was pretty much immune to 
this sort of thing, but...obviously not!

Anyhow, thanks much to Robert, Colin Hales and Dossy for their help.  I'll 
check out "*pine*" at some point soon...

It will make an interesting argument if we discover fossils on Mars.  That

Alternately, The Bat <http://www.ritlabs.com/the_bat> I hear is fairly 
virus proof, and still has the familiar Outlook / Eudora / etc -like GUI, 
although it's not as free as pine is (pine being free as in beer, the Bat 
being free as in $25) nor quite as virus proof.
On the other hand, when someone who doesn't know how to change their mail 
settings but is otherwise intelligent tries to email you, it's a pain to 
read it in pine.

Unfortunately, this is very open to abuse. Take an incident like the 
Columbine shootings, for example - I don't doubt that quite a lot of 
businesses would want to not serve goths after that. Obviously, this is 
very unwarranted. But goths are not that much a minority, at least not in 
either of the places I've lived (Minneapolis, MN and Salt Lake City, UT); 
definitely not enough that in a situation like that where there is a 
significant public backlash against us (or any group - replace "Columbine 
shootings" with "9/11" and "goths" with "Arabs", etc) for us to not starve 
to death or have to depend on our more normal looking friends for survival.

The first three sections of the ExI Resource Directory are now available.
The next two sections, presently being developed, will be cognitive science
and nanoscience and nanotechnology. All sections will be updated regularly.
You may want to add all section's subsections (papers, websites, and
miscellaneous) to an "ExI Resource Directory" favorite folder for quicker
access.

Ziana and myself have attempted to create the seed for a near-definitive
resource of high quality information for the transhumanist and
transhumanist-related communities. The directory will help improve our
collective intelligence; our ability to know what work has been done and
work work needs or remains to be done in different areas; our citation
ability; and our collaborative ability and effort. Your support is requested
to assist the development of this project, to help insure its long-term
success and usefulness. Support can be accomplished by the submittance of
high-quality material for inclusion into a present or future section. Anyone
is welcome to develop a new category for a present section, or to develop an
entirely new section. Presently I have reasonably well developed hyperlink
text files on technological benefits and risks and advanced technologies. If
you are interested in developing either or both of these sections, then the
files(s) can be sent to you.

All link corrections, link addition or removal requests, or comments should
be sent to trans_humanism@msn.com.

Sincerely,
Anand

I wouldn't be so quick to discount natural selection's ability to get around
such problems. You are talking about extinctions over a looong period of
time; long enough for evolution to try some countermeasures.

They emaphsize these things along with all the other "shoulds" 
but almost no one actually eats the stuff ast their only food. 
Most people are more than irrational enough to hold "shoulds" 
that have no or little bearing on their actual behavior.  Often 
they should be a lot more careful about they believe they 
"should" do.  But since they don't actually hold themselves or 
one another to what they profess to believe they "should" do, 
"should" is cheap.

Cheap "should" makes sense when the "shoulds" are largely 
irrational as in Christian moralizing.  A case could be made 
that irrational morality have thus seriously undermined many 
people's ability to act on rational "shoulds".

According to today's L.A. Times,

Bullshit.  We eat more raw sugar and fat for a larger percentage 
of calories consumed than ever.  But the Chritianized press will 
attempt to blame labor-saving devices as the devil's work.

It was overly high even then for the amount of energy expended 
in more or less sedentary jobs.  The number of relatively 
sedentary jobs probably has increased.  I would also bet that 
the amount of leisure time in front of the tube, or more 
recently the computer has increased quite a bit.

They weren't in good shape to start with and the amount of

In practice, no.  Ask anyone who has managed to lose 10 or more

Doing enough to go aerobic 20-30 minutes a day would do a lot 
more to gear up the entire metabolism and make fat a lot harder 
to put on.

I don't buy it.  Our diet and level of activity (for most of us) 
sucks.  Walking 15 minutes a day will not fix the cumulative 
effects.

You misunderstood.  The original was a suggestion that when more 
right-thinking citizens notice a group being unfairly abused 
they they shun and speak/act up to the abusers.  At least that's 
the way I read it.  Government, in either its nominally 
democratic or nominally fascistic varieties, will always 
unfairly abuse some group or other and with a lot less the 
citizens can do about it.

Word of the Day: die Speichereinheit = computer memory

Einheit :  unit
Speicher: memory

There seem to be several different ways to denote 'computer main memory'
in the German language, starting with the word Speicher, however
the above is what is recognized by the Deutsche Zollamt, the German Customs
Office.

Every material item in the world has a "number" in a thick book of
thousands of numbered categories, printed by the German customs office.
When something from abroad comes in, it must be identified with this
special number, before someone can receive it. Some items flow smoother
through the Customs office than others  (and some not at all): I don't
know yet the fastest flowing items, but computer memory is not one of
those.

This thick book of object categorization seems to be a particular
bugaboo for this system. While the German language gives you an
amazing ability to combine words in a way to describe something
very precisely, the "Book" looks to me like a bottleneck and I expect
that the Customs office (or more precisely, the business offices
which must first find these numbers to give to the Customs office)
will have more and more difficulty to categorize an object, as objects
become more and more hybrid.  (BTW Speichereinheit  is not listed under
the category of "computer")

Question diet experts: a lot of diets talk about the value of not 
decreasing the
metabolism rate, as if that is a good thing.  But all else being equal 
and assuming
weight is not an issue, would not a lower metabolism lead to a longer 
life?  How
does that work?  Is cell reproduction rate proportional to metabolism? 
 If so
would not one want to decrease metabolism as much as possible?  spike

Sending out DNA could possibly expose us to risk long before that. This
relates to the "active SETI" issue:
http://www.setileague.org/editor/earthxmt.htm
http://www.seti-inst.edu/iaa-position-paper.html

One possibility is that the DNA might provide clues to biophoton (See "Body
Talk," New Scientist, Feb. 23, 2002, pp. 30-33) emission signatures that
would enable a hostile civilization to remotely sense life on Earth and
perhaps even determine its evolutionary level or basic thought processes,
if, as Hameroff speculates, biophotons control consciousness in
microtubules. RF emissions are of course much stronger, but they may not be
part of a given civilization's search regimen or may be swamped by radio
noise from other sources. Although biophoton emissions are extremely weak,
it's possible that an advanced civilization, aware that biophotons are basic
to intercellular communications, would have sophisticated life
pattern-recognition systems that could detect such signatures by integration
of quantum-coherent biophoton emissions from all life forms for target
spectral-distribution and statistical windows.

For an even more speculative approach, also see "Detecting Biodynamic
Signals"
http://www.borderlands.com/archives/arch/detectin.htm.

<snip>

.................... Dr. Wheeler likes to put it: 
"How come the quantum?"

The answer is that nature is a kind of computer, 
said Dr. Anton Zeilinger, a kind of ringmaster 
of quantum tricks at the Institute for Experimental 
Physics of the University of Vienna, who gave 
the opening lecture.

Reality is quantized, he argued, because it is 
in some sense made of information. Paraphrasing 
Neils Bohr, the Danish physicist, Dr. Zeilinger 
said quantum theory was about what could be known 
about nature. And information comes in bits, 
irreducible yes-no, on-off, decisions.

That is to say, information is quantized.

The most elementary system is one bit, Dr. Zeilinger 
pointed out, one piece of information. Consider, 
he said, an observer with one bit to spend on one 
of the classic setups of quantum theory: an electron 
sailing toward a screen in which there is a pair of 
parallel slits.

According to quantum theory, whether the electron 
was a wave and went through both slits or was 
a particle and went through only one or the other 
depends on what measurement the physicist chooses 
to carry out. Knowledge of the electron's past path 
blurs the knowledge of its present position, and 
vice versa.

So if the physicist spends his single bit on saying 
which path the photon took through the slits, 
Dr. Zeilinger explained, he has nothing left to tell 
him where the photon hit the detector. As a result 
the photon's position is "irreducibly random," said 
Dr. Zeilinger, adding that the this randomness is 
an indication of a "reality independent of us."

"The fact that there are events that happen with 
no reason is one of the deepest discoveries of physics 
in the 20th century," Dr. Zeilinger said. "The whole 
idea of physics was to find reasons for things."

Well, yes. Just as aerobic life forms were a countermeasure,
evolutionarily, to the early conversion by anaerobic life forms of most
of the early CO2 dominated atmosphere into rock. However, there is a
significant difference between going from breathing CO2 to breathing O2
versus going from breathing 02 to breathing vacuum. There IS a threshold
of habitability as evidenced by Mars.

Why We Fear Ourselves More than Asteroids

By Robert Roy Britt
Senior Science Writer
posted: 07:00 am ET
26 March 2002

In the past six months, while the world focused on the continuing
threat of global terrorism, as many as a dozen or more asteroids
sneaked up on the Earth and zoomed by at distances just beyond the
Moon's orbit and closer. Most were never noticed. Earlier this month,
astronomers did spot one. Four days after it flew by.

===================

In discussing these events, experts describe a planet vulnerable to an
unexpected attack that could, in an instant, wipe out a city or even
destroy civilization. Some researchers go so far as to view the
asteroid threat as an "international emergency situation," as Andy
Smith of the Safety Research Institute in Albuquerque New Mexico said
last week.

Yet as billions upon billions of dollars are spent to provide
insurance against terrorism, astronomers were foiled in a recent
attempt to encourage Australia to invest a comparatively paltry $1
million to scan the mostly unsurveyed southern skies for killer space
rocks.

The scientists were practically laughed at on television by the
science minister of Australia who, like much of the world's public,
simply does not take the threat of asteroids seriously.

The reason is simple: The Dread Factor is not high enough.

Paul Slovic, author of "The Perception of Risk" (Earthscan, 2000),
says most people are far more worried over what humans and technology
can do to them than they are about natural disasters.  While
terrorism, chemical spills and nuclear accidents are awarded high
"Dread Factor" marks by most people, asteroids, earthquakes and
hurricanes rate low.

Stealth approach

On March 8, a hunk of stone and metal about the size of an 18-story
building, made its closest approach to Earth, passing roughly 298,400
miles (480,200 kilometers) from the planet, just a bit farther out
than the Moon, but a little too close for comfort for most
astronomers.

The problem with this is extending such peer pressure to a group as a
whole based on the actions of individuals. Should *I* be inconvenienced
or refused commerce because I'm white, blonde and blue eyed, just
because some neo-Nazis engaged in terrorists attacks? No, of course not.
If I belong to a neo-nazi group or sport neo-nazi tatoos, clothing, etc,
should I be refused business? You betcha. If I lived in Hayden Lake, or
Elohim City, or have a public criminal record of harassment, weapons
violations, etc, should I be treated differently than others? Of course.
This is the line between bad and good profiling.

ALL liberty is open to abuse, Chesh. Virtuous behavior is only virtuous
if it is freely chosen. Enforced virtue is no virtue at all.

I don't think this recommendation is empirical for a permanent
lifestyle. The point is that it is far easier to gain weight faster in
an environment of plentiful food when your metabolism is slow than when
it is fast. When dieting to lose weight, you will lose weight faster
with a faster metabolism than with a slow one.

Actually, information is not quantized.  Anyone who has studied
information theory is very familiar with fractions of a bit.  Rolling a
6-sided die gives you 2.585... bits.

It's a fair and fun idea, though I don't consider a clone of me to be me
any more than I would consider Harvey and Louis to be the same person.
I'd be more interested in it if the probe had an artificial womb and
tool assembler technologies on board, so as not to depend on the good
graces of some other race at the destination.

If you are uploaded, then your DNA is useless to someone wishing to do
you harm. I would also posit that any civilization less advanced than a
Matroishka Brain would be powerless to harm you.

What would be the "number" (or word collection) for a piece of DNA
containing the more than 130 DNA repair genes?
(see: http://www.cgal.icnet.uk/DNA_Repair_Genes.html)
What happens if I change the order of those genes in the piece DNA?

Sounds like the system can't work in the long run.

Blech.  Skeptic meter pegs an 8.4!

Do the math.  Compare the energy released from a single molecule
of ATP vs. the energy content of a photon.  As far as detecting
such energy across interstellar distances -- it going to require
one *huge* array of telescopes (I'd guess *much* larger than
the size of the solar system).

That's *if* biophotons are part of intercellular communications, something
I'd highly doubt.

Speculative is correct.  While I have no problem detecting changes
in resistance in tissues based on things like blood volume, salt
content, etc. and no problem with electrical signals due to ion
pumping (basic neural signaling) and would even grant that cells
may self-regulate their ionic & redox states -- when the crowd starts
raising such physiological phenomena to the level where the twilight
zone music starts playing in the background is when my eyes start
to roll back in their sockets.

At first glance yes.  Less free radical damage should result in less
DNA damage.  But it turns out there may be some quite explicit control
of the redox levels within cells so external tinkering with the metabolic
rate may be offset by internal compensations.  (Less free radical damage
may lead to less production of enzymes to deal with free radical damage
resulting in a similar steady state level of free radical damage.)

> How does that work?  Is cell reproduction rate proportional to metabolism? 

Not particularly.  Eukaryotic cells generally reproduce at a maximal
division rate of once every 24 hours.  In practice none of the cells
in your body reproduce that fast.  I think stomach cells may turn over
every 3 days or so.  Cellular reproduction can be slowed by internal
checkpoints that detect excessive DNA damage, which could in turn
be due to free radical levels.  But if tolerance level is relatively
fixed as I outline above, then the only way you are going to change
it is by going in and tinkering with the program in a significant way.

All of the above not withstanding, one of the general mechanisms that
is thought to lead to lifespan extension through caloric restriction
is a reduction in metabolism, exhibiting itself as a slightly decreased
body tempterature, leading to lower free radical production and
increased longevity.  But the details of this are still largely
unknown.

Seems, youve never been to Germany. They`ll find a category, I'm sure. And
if they can`t figure it out, they will simply ban the import of foreign
repair genes.

I was thinking of it more in terms of satisfying the reproductive
desire.  I might not want to raise a child, but contributing my
genome to the organism base of some distant planet kind of appeals
to me.

We don't know if there may be "rapid evolution" planets out there.
Given enough DNA and/or cellular material as a starting base a
competing civilization might be able to evolve in a few hundred
million years.  Given the singularity they could rapidly transition
to an MBrain level.  If the "warrior" genes prevail they might
represent a threat to us at that time.  Makes one wonder if
MBrain level civilizations have to do selective weeding of the
galactic garden.

Eudora is a good product, and the default settings are safe.
I've never used the PC version of pine, but the Unix version
doesn't have some features I find useful, so I switched to Mutt.
Either of those would be good, but if you like Eudora, there's
no reason to switch.  If you were using Outlook, there's reason
to switch.

You might have turned on some "HTML mail" option or something,
or else maybe you clicked on an attachment accidentally.

"There are many tombs. When we have seen one, up we go, a little
bewildered, into the afternoon sun, across a tract of rough,
tormented hill, and down again to the underground, like rabbits in a
warren. The hilltop is really a warren of tombs. And gradually the
underworld of the Etruscans becomes more real than the above day of
the afternoon. One begins to live with the painted dancers and
feasters and mourners, and to look eagerly for them.
[...]

A very lovely dance tomb is the Tomba del Triclinio, or del Convito,
both of which mean: Tomb of the Feast. In size and shape this is much
the same as the other tombs we have seen. It is a little chamber
about fifteen feet by eleven, six feet hight at the walls, about
eight feet at the centre. It is again a tomb for one person, like
nearly all the old painted tombs here. So there is no inner
furnishing. Only the farther half of the rock-floor, the pale
yellow-white rock, is raised two or three inches, and on one side of
this raised part are the four holes where the feet of the
sarcophagus stood. For the rest, the tomb has only its painted walls
and ceiling.

And how lovely these have been, and still are! The band of dancing
figures that go round the room still is bright in colour, fresh, the
women in thin spotted dresses of linen muslin and coloured mantles
with fine borders, the men merely in a scarf. Wildly the bacchic
woman throws back her head and curves out her long, strong fingers,
wild and yet contained within herself, while the broad-bodied young
man turns round to her, lifting his dancing hand to hers till the
thumbs all but touch. They are dancing in the open, past little
trees, and birds are running, and a little fox-tailed dog is
watching something with the naive intensity of the young. Wildly and
delightedly dances the next woman, every bit of her, in her soft
boots and her bordered mantle, with jewels on her arms; till one
remembers the old dictum, that every part of the body and of the
anima shall know religion, and be in touch with the gods. Towards
her comes the young man piping on the double flute, and dancing as
he comes. He is clothed only in a fine linen scarf with a border,
that hangs over his arms, and his strong legs dance of themselves,
so full of life. Yet, too, there is a certain solemn intensity in
his face, as he turns to the woman beyond him, who swoops in a bow
to him as vibrates her castanets.
[...]

There is a haunting quality in the Etruscan representations. Those
leopards with their long tongues hanging out: those flowing
hippocampi; those cringing spotted deer, struck in flank and neck;
they get into the imagination, and will not go out. And we see the
wavy edge of the sea, the dolphins curving over, the diver going
down clean, the little man climbing up the rock after him so
eagerly. Then the men with beards who recline on the banqueting
beds: how they hold up the mysterious egg! And the women with the
conical head-dress, how strangely they lean forward, with caresses
we no longer know! The naked slaves joyfully stoop to the wine-jars.
Their nakedness is its own clothing, more easy than drapery. The
curves of their limbs show pure pleasure in life, a pleasure that
goes deeper still in the limbs of the dancers, in the big long hands
thrown out and dancing to the very ends of the fingers, a dance that
surges from within, like a current in the sea. It is as if the
current of some strong different life swept through them, different
from our shallow current to-day: as if they drew their vitality from
different depths that we are denied.
[...]


The natural flowering of life! It is not so easy for human beings as
it sounds. Behind all the Etruscan liveliness was a religion of
life, which the chief men were seriously responsible for. Behind
all the dancing was a vision, and even a science of life, a
conception of the universe and man's place in the universe which made
men live to the depth of their capacity.

To the Etruscan all was alive; the whole universe lived; and the
business of man was himself to live amid it all. He had to draw life
into himself, out of the wandering huge vitalities of the world. The
cosmos was alive, like a vast creature. The whole thing breathed and
stirred. Evaporation went up like breath from the nostrils of a
whale, steaming up. The sky received it in its blue bosom, breathed
it in and pondered on it and transmuted it, before breathing it out
again. Inside the earth were fires like the heat in the hot red
liver of a beast. Out of the fissures of the earth came breaths of
other breathing, vapours direct from the living physical underearth,
exhalations carrying inspiration. The whole thing was alive, and had
a great soul, or anima: and in spite of one great soul, there were
myriad roving, lesser souls; every man, every creature and tree and
lake and mountain and stream was animate, had its own peculiar
consciousness."

D. H. Lawrence _Etruscan Places_, 1932

(You can see pictures of some Etruscan Tombs on the Web,
but it's nothing like experiencing them for yourself.)

That'd be Brian Stableford. The specific book you're referring to is The 
Architects of Emortality, which is the third in the series. The other 
three, in order, are The Cassandra Complex, Inherit the Earth, and The 
Fountains of Youth. I really hope he continues, Fountains of Youth actually 
had an ending that could lead to a direct sequel instead of something off a 
few hundred years in the future that vaguely mentions some of the events of 
the previous book!

There is a mind blowing article in the March 2002 issue of Smithsonian
Air and Space.  Marti Sarigul-Klijn describes a harrowing Roton test
flight.  His description of the last days of Rotary Rocket Inc was worth
the cover price in itself.  It will be interesting to hear Doug Jones' take
on this.  Doug, I will send you the issue thru the snail mail if you post

The April 2002 issue of Motorcyclist has an article on champion
motorcycle racer Michelle Duff, who went thru gender reassignment
at age 46.  I was twice astounded: first that they should carry the
article at all in that particular macho magazine, and second that they
should do such a good job of it.  They really have you seeing life
thru the eyes of a transgender by the end of it.  spike

I've seen the article- I knew at the time that the ATV was a hairy
vehicle, and that it had some really ugly vibration problems, but the
bit about the catalyst tank shaking loose was news to me.  (I and all
the rest of the propulsion team had been laid off in June 1999.)  I'm
not sure that the vibration was due to the energetic rotor vortex cores
hitting the airframe; other possibilities were asymmetrical thrust
output from the tip thrusters (there was no flow spreader at the rotor
hub), or the peroxide free surfaces in the lines in the rotors could
have been at different heights, unbalancing the rotors.

I watched all the flights, and what really scared me about that last one
was the severe uncommanded left yaw that occurred right after liftoff
and pitchover to accelerate down the runway.  I think it may have been
caused by the increase in bearing drag when the pilot pulled
collective.  It seemed to take forever for the yaw thrusters to counter
it and get the crew facing forward again.  I still admire them for
successfully flying a very difficult vehicle.

I _don't_ think the vibration was due to the lead-lag hinges; footage
from the whirlstand rotor cam showed that the thrust pulled the blades
only slightly forward, and they were far from their stops.

The autorotating Roton would have been a pretty poor glider; the best
L/D speed was predicted to be about 60 kts at about 1:1- 3500 fpm down
and not much more forward, and the glide range from 30,000 would have
been only a few miles.  Winged vehicles look mighty good in comparison
these days...

Next flight of the EZ-Rocket should be next week, we may have Dick try
another touch-and-go.

Hi all,

Well, in my last message, it seems that I spoke too soon.  These viruses have 
taken over my computer, and somehow embedded themselves in my Norton files.  
Before that, Norton couldn't delete or quarantine some files since those files 
were allegedly "in use."  My computer is as slow as syrup right now, and I'm 
going to avoid sending any emails from my regular account until I've gotten rid 
of this thing for sure.

Obviously, any suggestions to me directly would be very much appreciated.

Virally yours,

Hi Folks...

In a fit of collossal humility I've decided that the singularity shall be
21st Dec 2012- Mayan Calendar end. This is a Friday, so I've declared it at
4pm, Mayan standard time, so we can clock off early for the party (it's
supposed to be at sunrise, but what's a few hours between friends). I'm also
assuming that Mayans had their time zones all sorted out properly. As usual
we Australians will be partying on ahead of TROTW.

I'm not sure whether the AIs will be fully ambulatory by then, so we'll have
to make special arrangements for them. I wonder if they'll qualify for
disabled parking spaces? Ever seen a wheelchair with an IQ of 500 do the
Tango? *thinks... tap tap, pc alert meter off scale stop now, sorry*

It looks like the Mayan calendar is perfect for the singularity. It's the
end of their calendar .ie. it literally stops dead. I think you go back to
the start and re-cycle the dates after that. It's a real hoot: eg
www.crawford2000.co.uk/maya.htm. It's got a galactic ecliptic transition,
the equinox precession and misc. mystical "end of the universe stuff" all
over it like *spooky dissonant violas in backgound* "The present world age
will end and a new world age will begin". Absolutely perfect.

My brother suggested it because he's into the Mayan crystal skulls mystery.
Ever so nice of the Mayans to make it a Friday. Anyway....time to start
organising the party. Also...if one was an author, it would be very
convenient to get your singularity books out ASAP, especially with the
singularity and post humanism now sequestered and publicised by Kurzweil.
It'll give plenty of time for re-prints and the pundit circuit.

Lining the whole thing up with the Mayans is a wonderful cult-forming
opportunity.
I hereby immediately claim all merchandising rights world wide in
perpetuity. It lines up with Christmas perfectly. Not that we'll be needing
money, or Christmas presents, or anything much really..., but, just in
case...

Knowing you guys, you've probably been there already, but I just got all
enthusiastic and thought to blurt. You know me, I just gotta blurt
sometimes.

So there you go. No need to debate any more. 4pm Fri 21st Dec 2012. Make it
happen. You know you want to. It's how these things are supposed to work.
How did those Mayans know??????

:-)

Colin

There's an interesting thread on sci.physics.research on this topic.
Here's one part:

Not surprising; it might be covered in a graduate quantum-mechanics
course, but then it might not, since it's not really central to physics.
 You use the information/entropy connection from statistical mechanics
and information theory, then when you define entropy in quantum
mechanics you see immediately that entropy is *conserved* in quantum mechanics.

This seems quite surprising, really, since in our macroscopic world
entropy *increases*.  But since quantum mechanics is time-reversable, it
shouldn't have been unexpected: entropy increase is a manifestation of
time *non* reversability, and all time-reversable processes conserve
entropy (and information)-- in fact, in statistical mechanics,
entropy-increasing processes are known as "irreversable".  

>I wouldn't know how one goes about defining, measuring, or quantifying the
> physical manifestation of "information".

Per Claude Shannon, you just count the possible number of states, N.  An
eight-bit message, for example, has 256 possible states.  It's then
convenient to express information in terms of entropy, S = k ln N

I take it that this is a worm you are dealing with. Such generally have
two to four files in various places and will write one or more lines to
your win.ini or other syseditable files to trigger their further
action.... They might also have written themselves to your system
registry, and may download other virii when you are online.

Registry Medic (available through download.com) is useful for cleaning
them out of your registry. Norton is useless against a good number of
worms, esp the newer ones, generally because they operate as several
different files, although both McAfee and Norton have information on
their websites with step by step info on cleaning these worms out of
your system. If you are unable to access either website (another common
tactic of new worms is to block these sites from infected machines),
please let me know as well as relevant behavioral info about your
infection so I can find the right info for you.

It seems that the EU is interested in launching their own global

Quoth Mike Lorrey:
"The problem with this is extending such peer pressure
to a group as a whole based on the actions of
individuals. Should *I* be inconvenienced or refused
commerce because I'm white, blonde and blue eyed, just

because some neo-Nazis engaged in terrorists attacks?
No, of course not. If I belong to a neo-nazi group or
sport neo-nazi tatoos, clothing, etc, should I be
refused business? You betcha. If I lived in Hayden
Lake, or Elohim City, or have a public criminal record
of harassment, weapons violations, etc, should I be
treated differently than others? Of course. This is
the line between bad and good profiling."

How can you tell if someone walking into your store or
other place of business belongs in a given stereotype
or subculture? 

You have to stereotype. You have to apply a label to
the person, be it 'goth', 'neonazi', 'redneck',
'WASP', 'KKK', 'liberal', 'conservative', etc. And
this is profiling. Both good and bad - it's what
happens.

Humans think in symbols. We require a 'bucket' to dump
people into, as well as books, music - anything you
care to name that people develop opinions about. It is
practically impossible for people to be able to fully
differentiate between any two people in the course of
daily life. There will always be simiarities, either
in reality or just in perception, that people rely on
to cut down their mental processing. 

Are people able to distinguish one person from
another? Of course - not what I meant. Rather, people
work from vague memories of previous behavior of a
given person or others who remind you of that person.
IE - long hair on a guy could be a good thing or a bad
thing, depending on your personal history with
long-haired guys and what you've read, viewed, and
otherwise mentally ingested.

"ALL liberty is open to abuse, Chesh. Virtuous
behavior is only virtuous if it is freely chosen.
Enforced virtue is no virtue at all."

I must disagree with you. For instance, if everyone -
EVERYONE - is forced to follow the traffic laws
through the courts and increasing insurance fees and
suchlike, then there IS virtue. It keeps the roads
relatively safe.

It is easy to argue that this is not the case today.
However, this is at least the spoken goal of American
(and from what I understand, several other
nation-states) law. 

I may be misinterpreting your above statement by
missing an implied 'Enforced PERSONAL virtue is no
PERSONAL virtue at all'. True, it's a societal virtue
- a virtue that affects the society, not one which is
a direct benefit to the person. In fact, it imposes
extra work on the person - registering the vehicle,
following traffic regulations, putting up with
inquisitive police, etc. But all in all, it helps keep
society together.

Or so thinks I. *grin*

As I understand it, this is only true while a system is evolving in
isolation, maintaining quantum coherence and not interacting with the
environment or an observer.  When a system is measured we get the "wave
function collapse" which can involve a loss of state function information,
as the state function is projected onto a measurement basis vector.
This process is irreversible, in contrast to the "smooth" evolution when
the system is not being observed, which is reversible.

Of course in a larger sense, information is conserved in both quantum
and classical mechanics.  Classical mechanics is reversible as well,
at the microscopic level.  The size of the state volume is unchanged in
phase space as the system evolves.  What happens is that macroscopic
information turns into microscopic information, which is heat.  So we
interpret this as a loss of information.

Likewise with QM if we go to a many worlds formulation then there
is no state function collapse and all systems are always reversible.
However since we are unable to perceive the other Everett branches there
is a loss of information as far as we are concerned.

I just did a google search on "quantum hologram". Is this a concept unique
to Edgar Mitchell or is it generally accepted in quantum physics?

[Hal]
> Actually, information is not quantized.

Zeilinger was speaking about the 'physics'
of information, I suppose, and not about
information, or knowledge.

Anyway it is interesting to point out, here,
that there is an information-theoretic
approach to Bell's inequalities (Braunstein,
Caves, Schumacher, and somehow also Cerf and
Adami). These authors showed that, if Bell's
inequalities are violated by QM, there is an
information deficit, increasing with increasing
spin number.

It is of great interest the existence of bounds
for the information gain. Holevo, i.e., proved
the existence of an upper bound for the information
one can extract from a quantum system. In the
quantum case - this is the point - an infinite
amount of information transfer would require
an infinite entropy of the measured system.
Hence Holevo's theorem is a confirmation of the
impossibility to measure (by a single measurement,
but there are also Zeno-effect- measurements!)
the so called 'density matrix' of a system (which
represents the maximal amount of information
contained in a quantum system).

A spin 1/2 system has an information capacity =
1 bit. But a spin 1/2 system has an infinite
number os states (see the 'Poincar sphere').
Hence an infinite  amount of information could,
in principle, be coded in a spin 1/2 system!

The 't Hooft's holographic bound [1993]
           S < A / 4 h-bar
where A is a surface around a physical system
and S is information (assuming G = c = 1)
is also a well known bound. As far as I remember
it means that 10^66 bits of information could
be stored in a 1 cm^3 cube [or not? hmmm].
Bekenstein's original bound. Well known is
also the Bekestein's bound [1981 ?].

Both these bounds share the 'h-bar'. Thus
'physical' information must have something
to do, at least, with this h-bar !

Wait a sec.  Nuclear power is cleaner and causes less deaths 
right now (stupidities like the Russian idiocy to one side).  Do 
we not care about the people that die due to non-nuclear power 
in the meantime?

Singularity, contrary to some opinions is not inevitable.  A 
long endless war (the dumb US one turned more hot for instance) 
could seriously slow down technological advances as could 
socio-political counter-measures (many of which we seem to be 
attempting).

We actually "know" no such thing.  Look how easy it was to stop 
a lot of high-tech startups in their tracks with the one-two 
punch of the tech slump and 9/11 and the additional blow of 
Bushite nonsense.  Technology is not just technology, it 
involves people, politics and business.

I do not think this is highly likely any more.  The world is a 
good deal different than it was a couple of years ago and not 
altogether for the good of such a prediction.  I believe 
Singularity is possible by 2020 but not so likely.  If it does 
come before 2020 I would expect it to come from nanotech 
advances first rather than AI.  I don't believe we have much of 
a workable plan for producing a SI that soon yet.

Why?  Because the SI (supposedly) will figure it all out for us 
as soon as it kicks in?  This seems very dangerous to me.

According the Edgar Mitchell, interviewed on Suzuki-CBC last night, humans
carry about a "quantum hologram" which does exactly that. The QH provides
information about the entire universe. First question then is: Does the QH
really exist? Second question is: How do we make reliable use of it?

Maybe so.  But he seemed to be saying, the universe is quantized, which
is a mystery; and we know that information is quantized, because it
comes in discrete bits; therefore we might look at information for an
explanation of why the universe is quantized.

This begs the question of whether information is really quantized
and discrete.  Perhaps you can create a physical form of information
where this is so, but I don't think it would be the same as our usual
definition of information.  In cryptography, which is closely related
to information theory, we deal in fractional bits all the time.

If you have to introduce some new "physical" kind of information then
chances are it is going to be based on quantum theory rather than
vice versa.  So far nobody can give me a handful of raw bits.

Not really.  If you start with a system that has a large amount
of information and then try, through reversible quantum-mechanical
transformations, to transfer the information into the state of a spin
1/2 system, you will fail.  You will not be able to reversibly pack
all the information into the spin 1/2 molecule, erasing it from your
original system.  Because, of course, if you could, you could reverse
the process and unpack all that data from the spin 1/2 back into your
original, which as you note is impossible.

I agree that it is paradoxical that a system can have an infinite number
of possible states, each distinct at least in theory, and yet it can hold
only one bit of information.  I don't have a good explanation of this,
other than that maybe you could say that the number of bits per internal
state is infinitisimal.  I don't know if that really works, but it
suggests another place where fractional bits come into play.

Hi Shaun,

My strongest suggestion to you in dealing with a severe attack with unknown
consequences is to salvage your data, reformat your hard drive, and reinstall your
OS and applications.
Hopefully your data files aren't infected.  If they are, then you might still have
some work to do. If they're not, then you've got a brand-new clean system to work
with.

Good luck,

Leonardo Gonzalez

Frell, that's not good at all... Here is the (rather lengthy, but pasting it
all in case you aren't able to access it) page about the virus you have,
W32.Klez.E@mm (as far as I can tell, from the subject lines you mentioned in
your previous email). Hopefully this will help.

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.e@mm.html

Discovered on: January 17, 2002
Last Updated on: March 19, 2002 at 09:03:04 PM PST

Due to an increased rate of submissions, Symantec Security Response is
upgrading the threat level for W32.Klez.E@mm from level 2 to level 3 as of
March 6, 2002.
W32.Klez.E@mm is similar to W32.Klez.A@mm. It is a mass-mailing email worm
that also attempts to copy itself to network shares. The worm uses random
subject lines, message bodies, and attachment file names.

The worm exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express
in an attempt to execute itself when you open or even preview the message in
which it is contained. Information and a patch for the vulnerability are
available at
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-020.asp.

The worm overwrites files and creates hidden copies of the originals. In
addition, the worm drops the virus W32.Elkern.3587, which is similar to
W32.ElKern.3326.

The worm attempts to disable some common antivirus products and has a
payload which fills files with all zeroes.

Type: Virus, Worm

Virus Definitions (Intelligent Updater): January 17, 2002
Virus Definitions (LiveUpdateTM): January 23, 2002

Threat Assessment:

Wild: Medium
Damage: Medium
Distribution: High

Wild:

Number of infections: More than 1000
Number of sites: More than 10
Geographical distribution: Medium
Threat containment: Moderate
Removal: Moderate

Damage:

Payload: Disables common antivirus products
Large scale e-mailing: Mails email adddresses found in local files, and
Outlook and ICQ address books
Modifies files: Overwrites files with zeros on the 6th of every odd numbered
month (January, March, May, July, September, November)

Distribution:

Subject of email: Random subject
Name of attachment: Randomly named file with .bat, .exe, .pif or .scr
extension

Technical description:

When the worm is executed, it copies itself to %System%\Wink[random
characters].exe.

NOTE: %System% is a variable. The worm locates the Windows System folder (by
default this is C:\Windows\System or C:\Winnt\System32) and copies itself to
that location.

It adds the value

Wink[random characters] %System%\Wink[random characters].exe

to the registry key

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

or it creates the registry key

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wink[random characters]

and inserts a value in that subkey so that the worm is executed when you
start Windows.

The worm attempts to disable on-access virus scanners and some previously
distributed worms (such as W32.Nimda and CodeRed) by stopping any active
processes. The worm removes the startup registry keys used by antivirus
products and deletes checksum database files including:

ANTI-VIR.DAT
CHKLIST.DAT
CHKLIST.MS
CHKLIST.CPS
CHKLIST.TAV
IVB.NTZ
SMARTCHK.MS
SMARTCHK.CPS
AVGQT.DAT
AGUARD.DAT

The worm copies itself to local, mapped, and network drives as:

A random file name with a double extension. For example, filename.txt.exe.
A .rar archive with a double extension. For example, filename.txt.rar.

In addition, the worm searches the Windows address book, the ICQ database,
and local files (such as .html and text files) for email addresses. The worm
sends an email message to these addresses with itself as an attachment. The
worm contains its own SMTP engine and attempts to guess at available SMTP
servers.

The subject line, message bodies, and attachment file names are random. The
from address is randomly chosen from email addresses that the worm finds on
the infected computer.

NOTES:
Because this worm does use a randomly chosen address that it finds on an
infected computer as the "From:" address, numerous cases have been reported
in which users of uninfected computers receive complaints that they have
sent an infected message to someone else.

For example, Linda Anderson is using a computer that is infected with
W32.Klez.E@mm; Linda is not using a antivirus program or does not have
current virus definitions. When W32.Klez.E@mm performs its emailing routine,
it finds the email address of Harold Logan. It inserts Harold's email
address into the "From:" line of an infected email that it then sends to
Janet Bishop. Janet then contacts Harold and complains that he sent her
infected email, but when Harold scans his computer, Norton AntiVirus does
not find anything--as would be expected--because his computer is not
infected.

If you are using a current version of Norton AntiVirus, have the most recent
virus definitions, and a full system scan with Norton AntiVirus set to scan
all files does not find anything, you can be confident that your computer is
not infected with this worm.

There have been several reports that, in some cases, if you receive a
message that the virus has sent using its own SMTP engine, the message
appears to be a "postmaster bounce message" from your own domain. For
example, if your email address is jsmith@anyplace.com, you could receive a
message that appears to be from postmaster@anyplace.com, indicating that you
attempted to send email and the attempt failed. If this is the false message
that is sent by the virus, the attachment includes the virus itself. Of
course, such attachments should not be opened.

If the message is opened in an unpatched version of Microsoft Outlook or
Outlook Express, the attachment may be automatically executed. Information
about this vulnerability and a patch are available at

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-020.asp

The worm also infects executables by creating a hidden copy of the original
host file and then overwriting the original file with itself. The hidden
copy is encrypted, but contains no viral data. The name of the hidden file
is the same as the original file, but with a random extension.

The worm also drops the virus W32.Elkern.3587 as the file %System%\wqk.exe
and executes it.

Finally, the worm has a payload. On the 6th of every odd numbered month
(except January or July), the worm attempts to overwrite with zeroes files
that have the extensions .txt, .htm, .html, .wab, .doc, .xls, .jpg, .cpp,
.c, .pas, .mpg, .mpeg, .bak, or .mp3. If the month is January or July, this
payload attempts to overwrite all files with zeroes, not just those with the
aforementioned extensions.


Removal instructions:

Norton AntiVirus has been able to detect W32.Klez.E@mm since January 17,
2002. If you have current definitions and have a current version of Norton
AntiVirus set as recommended (to scan all files), W32.Klez.E@mm will be
detected if it attempts to activate. If you simply suspect that the
(inactivated) file resides on the computer, run LiveUpdate to make sure that
you have current definitions, and then run a full system scan.

If W32.Klez.E@mm has activated, in most cases you will not be able to start
Norton AntiVirus. Once this worm has executed, it can be difficult and time
consuming to remove. The procedure that you must use to do this varies with
the operating system. Please read and follow all instructions for your
operating system.

Manual removal procedure for Windows 95/98/Me

Follow the instructions in the order shown. Do not skip any steps. This
procedure has been tested and will work in most cases.

NOTE: Due to the damage that can be done by this worm, and depending on how
many times the worm has executed, the process may not work in all cases. If
it does not, you may need to obtain the services of a computer consultant.

1. Download virus definitions
Download the definitions using the Intelligent Updater. Save the file to the
Windows desktop. This is a necessary first step to make sure that you have
current definitions available later in the removal process. Intelligent
Updater virus definitions are available at

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/defs.download.html

For detailed instructions on how to download and install the Intelligent
Updater virus definitions from the Symantec Security Response Web site, read

You must edit the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current
Version\Run and remove the wink???.exe value after you write down the exact
name of the wink file.

CAUTION: We strongly recommend that you back up the system registry before
you make any changes. Incorrect changes to the registry could result in
permanent data loss or corrupted files. Please make sure that you modify
only the keys that are specified. Please see the document How to back up the
Windows registry before you proceed.


1. Click Start, and click Run. The Run dialog box appears.
2. Type regedit and then click OK. The Registry Editor opens.
3. Navigate to the following key:

I didn't think this article was very clear or well written.  If you're
going to try to counter a particular argument, you need to set the
argument out clearly, or at least provide a reference to such a statement.
This article seems to assume that people know what the argument is,
and it alludes to it only vaguely and sarcastically.

Indeterminism is a fundamental mathematical *assumption* of the Copenhagen
interpretation.  There are two dynamical processes in quantum systems
under this interpretation, which von Neumann called Type I and Type
II.  Type II processes are what happens when no measurements occur.
The systems evolve continuously and deterministically according to
the Hamiltonian function, which relates to the energy.  This part is
closely analogous to classical, pre-quantum formulations of dynamics.
Type I processes occur when a measurement happens.  At that point the
quantum state gets projected onto one of the basis vectors associated
with that kind of measurement.  The projection is probabilistic and
nondeterministic, and the probabilities depend on the amplitudes of the
wave function.

That's Copenhagenism in a nutshell.  If you accept it as the starting
point, as this article claims to do, then there is no question but that
empirical indeterminism is a fundamental part of the theory.

But the article seems to be trying to oppose some argument based on an
EPR type experiment with coupled photons which are allowed to separate.
It's not clear what exactly the argument is, so it is hard to say just
how successful the article refutes it.

'In principle' an infinite amount of information can be coded
in a spin 1/2 system (that is - but I'm not sure - proved
by quantum computation). That's because each point on the
'Poincar sphere' (and they are infinite) is a quantum state,
for a spin 1/2 system. Thus a spin 1/2 quantum system has
an infinite number of 'possible' (which does not mean
'accessible') states.

But  unfortunately, with this QM, a quantum state of the
spin is not an 'observable'. Thus we must stay with
the well known 'upper bound' for a spin 1/2 system,
which is typically quantum-mechanical, which is = 1 bit,
and which gives us the amount of the 'measurement-accessible-
information'.

About TIME people started using tech in this way!
Thank you VERY much for passing the article on, Sean. 

Enabling technology in a portable, durable,
easily-usable package. This reflects well on 'adapting
technology to people' instead of 'adapting people to
technology', even if training for the system is
required, as is hinted in the article.

I just hope they can manage to get enough funding for
their project - $5K per machine's a little steep for
individuals even if it performs as advertised, unless
they are able to get the government grants.

Heh. A positive event from big government. Rare, but
wonderful.

I'm not talking about elemental carbon. Carbonate does not contain
enough oxygen within it for a proper 2 to 1, or even one to one,
relationship to produce CO2 from this cracking process without air
present. It could get some from water that seeps into subduction zones
from the ocean, but there are plenty of elements that oxygen prefers
more than carbon.

Volcanic activity in subduction areas is generally due to the pressure
of superheated water with some CO2 and CO present (a sort of natural
producer gas) but is never in quantities similar to the amount of carbon
subducted. If it were, there would be far more volcanoes (with more
frequent eruptions) in subduction zones than there are.

Lets take, for example, the subduction zone on the west coast of North
America. You've got a 4000-6000 km of subduction zone, subducting at
several cm a year along the length of it. This means that you have a
minimum of a few cubic kilometers of material: hydrates, carbonates, and
other organic compounds, along with rock, etc, subducting every year.
Yet how much material is ejected in volcanic eruptions along that zone?
A cubic kilometer or so every couple decades. At best, less than 10% of
subducted materials are erupted, much of it being rock or metamorphosed
carbonates which retain their rock form.

I suggest referring to Fogg's "Terraforming" text for some answers to

Another heat source which is dwindling. Both tidal and radioactive heat
sources are slowly decreasing over time. Radioactivity is the cause of
less than 1/3 of the heat generation. There is far more energy in the
braking effect on earth's rotation (the core turns a little over one
more rotation per year than the mantle) caused by the moon, and won't
stop until either the moon achieves escape velocity or else the Earth
stops rotating. As the moon gets further away, the amount of braking
that occurs decreases over time, reducing the amount of heat being
generated. If the heat drops by half, the crust will thicken up
considerably, greatly reducing the amount of vulcanism.

Yes, geological time. And if enough carbon is sequestered in coral, in
ocean sediments and hydrates fast enough, then geological time just
ain't fast enough. It takes many millions of years for any appreciable
amount of the ocean floor to be subducted (and none occurs in the
Atlantic).

The dot com world was melting down long before Bush was even elected,

I think it will come from the human augmentation market, which *will*
advance as soon as the handicapped exceed normal human performance with

Problems with memory, check this out;

http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_medical/story.jsp?story=274190

Chewing gum can greatly improve the performance of the brain, research
issued yesterday suggests.

People who chewed gum scored 40 per cent more in memory tests than those
who
didn't in a study presented to the British Psychological Society's
annual
conference in Blackpool.

Dr Andrew Scholey, of the human cognitive neuroscience unit at the
University of Northumbria, described the improvement in memory as "quite
dramatic".

Although chewing gum was first marketed in America more than 150 years
ago,
Dr Scholey's work is the first to look at its impact on mental
performance.
Three groups of 25 people took part in the experiment. The first chewed
gum
throughout, the second had nothing and the third went through the
chewing
motion with nothing in their mouth. They then completed 12 computerised
tests to measure attention span, response rate and long and short-term
memory.

During tests to recall 15 words, the gum-chewers remembered two to three
more than the non-chewers. There was no effect on concentration, but the
heartbeat of the gum-chewers increased by an average of three to four
beats
a minute compared with only a very slight increase among the fake
chewers.

Dr Scholey said chewing gum might improve memory because the heartbeat
increased and delivered more oxygen and glucose to the brain.
Alternatively,
chewing could stimulate insulin production, which affected the part of
the
brain involved in memory.

Dr Scholey said: "We found a very clear pattern of improved memory when
gum
was chewed. We think it is the effect of chewing that causes this rather
than anything in the gum itself. There are lots of ways to improve
mental
function. This may be one of a series of interventions that people may
want
to try.''

Well known gum-chewers include Sir Alex Ferguson, Robbie Williams and
Martine McCutcheon.

Previous work by Dr Scholey has shown that ginseng can enhance the
memory
and gingko can improve memory and concentration.

This is a very interesting wind energy system which seems to intercept
more wind with a smaller profile and less danger to birds than normal
rotary wind turbines. Looks like an ideal system for ridgelines.

Again I object specifically to the claim that this information 'can be
coded' into the spin 1/2 system.  I take this statement to be a claim
that a certain physical process is possible: that you can start with
a system holding more than 1 bit, let it interact reversibly with the
spin 1/2 system, and at the end of that time the initial system has
been reset to a standard initial stated (erased) and the information
transferred into the spin 1/2 system.

To me, that is what it means to 'code' information into a system, in the
quantum sense.  You are transferring the information into the spin 1/2
system.  If the spin 1/2 system can really 'code' that much information,
it ought to be possible to transfer that much information into it.

I think you agree that this process is not possible.  If it were possible,
then you could get more than one bit out of the spin 1/2 system, which
we know cannot happen.

As for quantum computation, it has many amazing properties, but you
will never be able to physically store more than N bits of information
in N qubits.

...I know. And I try to believe it and live it. But like my friend Madelyn 
said a while back when we were talking about libertarianism - not only are 
most people (in the US) not well informed enough to not discriminate based 
on what the media tells them, most people don't *want* to be that informed. 
They enjoy their lives of ignorance. Which is sad, and makes me somewhat 
afraid of the posibility of this country actually going fairly libertarian.

We care a lot. I'm fully aware that fission power is the current 
rational choice. It is much less dangerous and disruptive than any
alternative by every rational measure. It is infeasible only because
the effort required to educate the public will be too large and I see
no practical way to undertake it. The death and ecological destruction
due to failure to adopt fission power can be laid at the feet of
a mistaken belief system, like the deaths in the USSR in the 1920's and 
1930's, or the Holocaust, or the current famine in North Korea.

A short nuclear war, maybe. long endless wars tend to force certain
technologies. Eugene listed his requirements for halting the 
singularity: They include police-state-level control of all software
development. I don't think that this is even feasible any more.

Please specify how the dot.coms were contributing to the advancement of
technology? The meltdown affected mostly dot.coms and certain 
telecommunications sectors. The dot.coms were mostly worthless. The 
telecomms that failed were all spending VC money, with five or ten
companies for each new niche product. The consolidation when more than
half of these companies failed did not affect technological progress of
the other half except perhaps positively as the design teams 
consolidated. I worked for IPOptical until we ran out of cash: now I
work for HyperChip. IPOptical was a bit behind and was depending on
outside hardware that the chip makers failed to deliver (overambitious.)
Hyperchip built their own hardware but could not hire enough programmers
because of the insane bubble. The bubble burst, HyperChip hired a bunch
of us, and we'll deliver a massively scalable IP router this year.

We have no plan. Well, some folks have some plans, but my analysis does
not depend on any particular plan. Rather, I feel that the increasing
amount of computational horsepower means that the brilliance needed in
the software design decreases over time. When a clever designer finally 
does create the SI, we will see that in retrospect a truly brilliant
design would have worked on hardware available several years earlier and
that it is likely that an SI is achievable on today's available
computing power.

The SI will either be benign or not. If benign, It will indeed "figure
it all out." But an SI may very well be human-computer collaboration,
or may incorporate humans in some way.

What part of this seems dangerous? I think a human race without SI is
increasingly dangerous. We've somehow managed to avoid nuclear war
so far. but nanotech and some forms of biotech look threats that may
be beyond practical human control. The lesson of 9/11 is that society
makes increasing power (in the physics sense of the word) available for
any determined individual to use. This will accelerate.

Hmm, I wouldnt worry about that happening anytime soon there chesh.  I dont
think we will see any semblance of a libertarian esque 'government' until
the average person starts demanding less and less from the government
because technology is providing them with more and more.  This will probably
be when technology makes the basic necessities of life, like food,
sustinence, energy, and safety cheap enough that the vast majority of the
population essentially has guranteed access to it.  After that government
will probably be demoted to limited land ownership claims, if anything at
all.  But not because people will actively seek to remove government from
those equations, but because no one will care all that much about the
government nor ask much from it.

		Mike:

		I'm not talking about elemental carbon. Carbonate does not
contain
		enough oxygen within it for a proper 2 to 1, or even one to
one,
		relationship to produce CO2 from this cracking process
without air
		present. It could get some from water that seeps into
subduction zones
		from the ocean, but there are plenty of elements that oxygen
prefers
		more than carbon.

		### Let's write out the reaction :

		CaCO3 ->(high temp)-> CaO + CO2

		More comments?

		This results in the formation of alkaline oxides, which
usually react with SiO2 present almost everywhere, to form relatively stable
silicates.



		Mike:
		Volcanic activity in subduction areas is generally due to
the pressure
		of superheated water with some CO2 and CO present (a sort of
natural
		producer gas)


		Me:
		### Volcanic activity is not due to water pressure. It is

(with more
		frequent eruptions) in subduction zones than there are.

		Lets take, for example, the subduction zone on the west
coast of North
		America. You've got a 4000-6000 km of subduction zone,
subducting at
		several cm a year along the length of it. This means that
you have a
		minimum of a few cubic kilometers of material: hydrates,
carbonates, and
		other organic compounds, along with rock, etc, subducting
every year.
		Yet how much material is ejected in volcanic eruptions along
that zone?
		A cubic kilometer or so every couple decades. At best, less
than 10% of
		subducted materials are erupted, much of it being rock or
metamorphosed
		carbonates which retain their rock form.

		### Spectacular eruptions are just a part of the story.
There is constant outgassing from volcanic activity areas. Also, if indeed
only 10% of subducted materials were replaced by volcanism, the surface of
the Earth would have long since disappeared (into the 5th dimension?). The
imbalances you are implying are incompatible with the existence of an
atmosphere, or indeed Earth's  crust itself. If most of carbonate was
irretrievably lost in subduction, without a constant, steady, and
approximately equal replenishment from volcanism, all carbonate would have
been scrubbed out of the atmosphere a couple of billion years ago.

The problem is that this is not a clean reaction. With water present, it
will grab some of that O2, then you've got plenty of metals and
nonmetals available that go bonkers for oxygen more than carbon does.

Depends on the type of volcanic activity. If it were a convection alone,
then the only volcanos we'd see would be at spreading centers and
hotspots like Hawaii. Subduction related eruptions, which are primarily
composed of ash, are, in fact driven by the gasses produced by
subduction chemical reactions. It is just that only a small percent of
the material that subducts ever makes it back up through in eruptions. 

So which is it? A few posts ago, you were claiming that all of the
subducted carbon comes back up through volcanic eruptions.

This is rather obviously not so. The bare fact that we once had 55 times
more atmosphere than we do now demonstrates that this is a process that
is not in equilibrium.

Most carbonates ARE lost to rock. The continents are largely made up of
vast layers of limestone which will never be returned to the atmosphere.
Those coral areas that are not headed for subduction zones for several
hundred million years (i.e. The GBR, Carribean, etc) primarily because
they are on top, will continue to sequester carbon which will be rock
and will never return to the atmosphere.

A couple billion years ago, we still had several times the atmosphere we
have now. it wasn't until the Cambrian period that there was even a
sufficient percent of oxygen available to sustain animal life to an
appreciable degree.

I'll try to dig it up (I think it's in storage). If anyone else has the

Those who know me may recall that I've been talking about coming out with 
my own products for a *long* time.  But nothing ever happened.  I was 
consulting by day, single-parenting, attempting to have a life, and writing 
my software in whatever time was left.  Of course nothing got finished.

Then the dotcom collapse and the recession.  I was too expensive for the 
company I was consulting at, and there were no jobs anywhere else.  I 
decided my best bet was to make an all-out push with my own stuff before my 
money ran out.  I've been making steady progress since then; as Samuel 
Johnson said, "Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in 
a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully."

So now I'm finally there, more or less.  There are still 14,000 details 
left but they're all getting done.  Gradually.  I have a few weeks left on 
the product itself.  I'm close enough that consensus seems to be that I 
should announce now, and say that it will ship in April.

If you remember me talking about a product, it's probably something 
different.  This first one is just the first out the door.  Then I'll make 
a decision based on the degree of response I'm able to generate.  If it's 
fizzling, or taking time to build up, I'll shift gears and work on 
finishing up one of the other ones.  If it takes off rapidly, I'll 
capitalize on the momentum, and do the other stuff later.

My web site has been updated.  In a day or two, I will begin the media 
blitz.  Yay!  I need to think of a good way to celebrate.  (Lots of excuses 
coming up -- the announcement, the first press coverage, actual ship, the 
first sale, the first review....)

You're encouraged to take a look at the web site and give me feedback. I'm 
taking the opportunity to switch servers at our provider, figuring that I'd 
rather take any hit now, before there's much traffic.  I just told them to 
redirect unreasonable.com to the new server, but it will take a day or two 
to propagate.  If www.unreasonable.com doesn't have the Unreasonable 
Software logo at the top, look at http://207.159.131.159/index.html instead.

Comments are especially welcome now, before we get much farther, but 
they're welcome any time, if you're busy now. The press kit is off the 
press link at the bottom of the page.

Beyond any desire to help me as a friend or a fellow extropian, you might 
want my product to succeed as a matter of self-interest.  I think it's 
potentially useful to all of us because surviving the next few years is a 
prerequisite to arriving at the future we'd rather live in.

Please take notes as you go along.  I want the benefit of your first 
impressions.  Comment especially on how well the product is pitched.  If 
you were a journalist and you read the press release, would you want to 
write a piece on the product?  If you read a piece in the paper, would you 
check out the web site?  If you read the web pages, would you download or 
buy the product?  Who do you think it will appeal to, and why?  Who do you 
think won't be interested, and why?  Does the site come off as one you'd 
want to do business with?  Why / why not?  Is the general tone pleasing, 
off-putting, or confusing?  Etc.

Beyond that, I welcome comments on any aspect, from philosophical to 
nit-picky.  Whatever you feel qualified to talk about.  Or even if you 
don't.  Pricing, business model, spelling, grammar, product features, press 
kit, HTML style, international issues, security, visual aesthetics, legal 
issues, the best way to do session tracking, etc. I particularly would like 
to hear from the non-US crowd about stuff that might be wrong or confusing 
in their country.

If you think your comments would be of interest to others, reply to the 
list; otherwise, write to me privately.

Things not there yet.  Some will be done soon, others eventually:  Tune the 
web server settings.  Revise all pages so they are completely accessible to 
the handicapped.  Finish the legal page.  Add a privacy policy.  Add more 
screen shots.  Validate the participation form.  Remove a few broken 
links.  Improve search engine positioning.  Translate the site to other 
languages.  Add a product summary page.

Thanks....

I disagree.  There are plenty of "threats" out there now (asteroids
we are unaware of, 9.0+ earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest,
slumbering volcanoes waiting to blow their top, etc.) that involve
*no* tech and are significantly beyond the "control" abilities
of technology currently available to us.  In contrast with biotech
and nanotech I can cite very specific solutions to problems that
one might anticipate could develop.

The sun growing into a red giant and roasting the Earth is a virtual
certainty.  Humans dying unless robust technologies are developed
to extend their lifespans is another virtual certainty.  Rejecting
the technologies that can solve these problems is simply not an
option (unless one wants to die preserving the status quo).

This isn't anything "new" -- compare the destructive power of an
automobile with the destructive power of a horse powered carriage.

It is also important to realize that this isn't *technology*
(e.g. hardware) dependent -- it is in reality *knowledge*
(e.g. software) dependent.

I'm moderately certain that I could evolve formidible bioweapons
using nothing more than access to sufficient people willing to
sacrifice their lives.  I could perhaps speed it up a little bit
with such sophisticated technology as a razor blade.  (Don't
ask me to explain this further -- its knowledge best left
undiscussed for now.  The statement is made to point out that
it isn't the means one should be concerned with but the knowledge
as to how to create the means or the awareness that the means
can in fact be created.)

Ultimately because of trends that Dan mentions it is going to
become very important for people to place a significant emphasis
on defensive technologies (no telling what technologies your
ex-girlfriend or boyfriend has at their disposal) and behave
in ways that promote the survival of others (so as to reduce
the number of people running around with feelings that they've
been cheated out of their fair share of the pie in some way.)

< snip>

At first my april fool's day proximity alarm went off. The physiological
basis (glucose/atp/blood supply) seems plausible. Recently there was a
series of discussions about the effect of certain music on IQ. I'm also
wondering if the aural neural ruffling from music and the olfactory neural
ruffling from gum chewing have the same effect.

My lay anatomy says, if I remember properly (gum needed), that the olfactory
(much older) sense system is the only sensory input that hooks directly to
thalamus/hippocampal area. It's 'hardwired' into the main memory zone, not
via the usual cortical pre-processing attachments. As such, stimulation may
liven up ('arm') associative loops that would otherwise be inaccessible,
especially if the chosen gum had childhood memories (including school)
attached.

Why didn't they have a control group with olfactory stimulus, but no
muscular - give them strong mints and tell them not to chew. Then they could
separate the stimulii. I think 'chewing nothing' isn't a very good test if
it's the jaw's muscular blood supply that you're targeting. They should have
chewed something without taste to eliminate the olfactory side.

Doing an exam? Get that gum out _now_. Also "X is do dumb they can't walk
and chew gum at the same time" becomes "X is so dumb they need to chew gum
to walk".

If Dyson's captured the book well, then Polkinghorne saddens me.....it seems
that extropians don't own the copyright on eschaton reification.....

"Since the world described by science is doomed to end in futility, the true
end of the world must be a transition to another world that is beyond the
reach of science".

>From jaded observation to cloying panacea in one sentence. Is this a symptom
of a sort of chronic 'awe deficit' or 'reverence deficit' syndrome so
visible in many of the religious when it comes to things scientific?
Following Newton and Bacon, it seems, physicist John Archibald Wheeler
wrote:

"We live on an island of knowledge surrounded by a sea of ignorance. As our
island grows, so does the shore of ignorance."

Wheeler's Beach, I call it. The futurist's base camp. Why is it that one
physicist will happily play on Wheeler's Beach, Sci-fi writers put the scuba
gear on and charge off on a jet-ski,  and yet another physicist wants to
hide behind a wind-break, deferring their curiousity in the natural a
manufactured unknowable?

A Foghorn Leghorn cartoon analogy (stolen from another email list recently.
Embarassingly, I can remember it well) :

<Blustering rooster Foghorn is attempting to disengage from babysitting his
geeky, brainy nephew.  The rooster suggests a game of hide-and-seek, and
hides in a wood-storage box, confident the nephew will never find him there.
Peering from beneath the lid, the rooster enjoys a clear view of the
nephew's futile searching.

Unfazed, the nephew whips out pencil and paper, scribbles some intricate
mathematics, and then carries a large shovel into the yard to a spot where
he's calculated the rooster must be hiding.  From the storage-box far away,
the smug rooster watches the nephew push the the shovel's tip into the
ground, heave mightily, and pry up ...... the rooster!

Dumbfounded, the rooster splutters and stammers at the nephew, and then
walks over to look in the wood-storage box.  Instead, he stops, ponders, and
walks away, saying, "Y'know, ah better not look.  Ah jes' might be in
there." >

By the time Dyson's reached the end, you know that before you pick up
Polkinghorne's book you know you're in for ride on a conveyor belt through
the dusty museum of the deserately faithful. If there were more religious
people like Dyson around, then religion would be a whole lot more
interesting and maybe it would go somewhere useful.

David. I think Fallout Shelter is on first view a good product. I am 
concerned that most people won't be convinced to buy it until they see a 
brilliant flash of light in the sky.

       One minor thing, On the products page, 5th paragraph after the ring 
diag' it says  So you know what to expect when. 

should that be  So you know what to expect and when. ??

Blimey ! was that a questionaire or was that a questionaire ?


       Good luck

I think that Dan Clemmensen and I, when we talk about "threats", mean
"existential risks or things that impact existential risks".  Anything that
is not an existential risk should be called by its proper name,
"inconvenience".

Huh?  Five billion years from now, the only thing that determines whether
the sun grows into a red giant and roasts the Earth will be how we feel
about it.  I don't see how you can be so certain about which way public
sentiment will run.

Besides, aren't you one of the "mass-energy is the limiting resource"
types?  If so, why would there still be a Sun?

Hey, if this is true, then it's great news for me.  I am an avid gum 
chewer.  So avid, that I avoid chewing gum at all costs.  If I left it 
solely up to my monkey-nature, I would be chewing gum non-stop, day and 
night.  And I would be smarter than ever, too.

Gum gum gum.  Mmm.

Glancing at the TV listings I see that tonight on the Lifetime cable
network will be a made for TV movie called Cloned:

"Set in the year 2008, this provocative 1997 TV drama raises a
multiplicity of moral dilemmas surrounding the issue of human cloning.

"When Seattle couple Skye and Rick Weston lose their 8-year-old son in
a boating accident, their lives are shattered.  But what they discover
next is even more shocking.  The fertility clinic where their son was
conceived, via in vitro fertilization, made 'copies', dubbing the fetus
'Baby 2000.'  When the Westons threaten to expose the cloning, their
doctor makes them an offer that any grieving parents would find tempting."

Anyone seen this?  Lifetime is mostly for women so this is probably just
another weepy drama.  But it is not an entirely implausible scenario.

It would not be cloning of an adult, but it is possible to split
embryos to form artificial identical twins, and freeze some of them.
I don't think this would be a normal procedure during IVF but fertility
clinics are notorious for rough and ready ethics, so it could happen.
Then the situation in the movie is presumably that they offer to implant
a stored embryo and give the couple an identical clone of their dead son.

I would probably choose to differentiate on the basis of "natural" vs.
man-made hazards.  But you can turn that around and look at it on
the basis of hazards that we simply choose to ignore (or tolerate).
One could also get into debates about impact factor of the hazards.
We seem to be able to tolerate X number of deaths per year due to tobacco,
automobiles, airplane crashes, etc. without it impacting the development
curve significantly.  On the other hand 911 certainly might have deflected
the "natural" course and a major asteroid impact would certainly do so.

I think the point I was trying to bring up (which may have gotten lost)
was that we can have threats due to things we (or some of us) do as
well as threats due to things we don't do.

Of course -- My comments related back to comments about the greens
(being anti-any-technology) and perhaps (poorly) trying to influence
the discussion towards more of a 'big picture' frame of reference
in light of some of Dyson's comments.  

The current reality being we (at least on our planet) are doomed.
You have to come down on the side of preserving the status quo
at the expense of decreasing the chances of a long term positive
outcome or be on the other side of trying to maximize the amount
of cake you get to eat over the longest possible time (even though
in the short term that may mean choosing between some less 
desirable solutions, e.g. nuclear power vs. coal).

Yes.  But one might leave it alone because it might make sense not to give
away ones location or technology level by making stars go dark.  As long as
there are wandering planets and brown dwarfs whose disappearence is less likely
to be noticed it may make sense to leave the stars alone.

Or maybe it was 1952. A spectacular number of pivotal sf stories appeared
in 1953, presumably written in the year before. According to my patented
50-year two-generation recurrence-with-modal-variation theory of cultural
history,* we're due for another gamma burst next year... which implies that
a batch of mindzingers is being created even as we speak.

Of course the objective circumstances of commercial sf differ: half a
century ago, there was an abundance of small specialized sf magazines with
dedicated readers and writers blending for the first time the grand ideas
of the 1930s and after with the comparative realism of Campbell's Golden
Age, plus a dawning ability to *write* with some of the skills of
literature. There were no competitive special FX movies, no routine TV
space opera, although there was radio and comics. Out of that vortex in
1953 came such stuff as dreams are made on: Sturgeon's MORE THAN HUMAN,
Clarke's AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT and CHILDHOOD'S END, Ward Moore's BRING
THE JUBILEE, Simak's RING AROUND THE SUN, Clement's MISSION OF GRAVITY,
Pohl and Kornbluth's THE SPACE MERCHANTS, Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451,
Bester's THE DEMOLISHED MAN, Asimov's THE CAVES OF STEEL... Short story
writers bloomed including Phil Dick, and Blish's sublime novella `A Case of
Conscience' appeared, as did Clarke's `The Nine Billion Names of God'. One
could go on and on. The mind boggles.

Next year might be a happy time, two generations on and flowering.

Thank you. Looks like the public falls into three categories:

1 - Visceral yes.  They are already committed to a prepared 
mindset.  Obviously, subscribers to misc.survivalism would be good 
prospects. And I think extropianism by definition subsumes the more 
rational aspects of survivalism.

2 - Visceral no.  Along with sending it to you guys, I also told a mailing 
list of software entrepreneurs I'm on.  Most are liberal, anti-gun, fairly 
young.  A few people got it, but the most common reaction was that my 
product was loathsome because it (they thought) preys on people's fears. 
And that anyone who would buy it is a paranoid loon who's on the lookout 
for black helicopters.

3 - Potentially persuadable.  I hope that my calm, methodical style will be 
effective.  I say that the product costs no more than a good smoke alarm 
because I want them to view it as a cheap, prudent precaution.

I was surprised that the reaction from the other list was so 
empathic.  Here's an interesting dilemma:  I'm about to pitch this to news 
media as something they should cover.  Ideally, in the news section now and 
then a review in the technology section when the product is actually 
shipping.  From what I know of mainstream journalists, they have a lot in 
common with the chaps on that other list.  So it seems like there's a fair 
chance that the people I need to write about it are predisposed to abhor 
the idea.  *sigh*

Perhaps the right answer is to go directly to misc.survivalism, and maybe 
gun or conservative groups, and see if I can establish a modest sales level 
and customer base and then look for mainstream press coverage.

And perhaps the technical press (ComputerWorld, Handheld Computing, etc.) 
would treat it as straight product news.

>Blimey ! was that a questionaire or was that a questionaire ?

And thank you for being the first to fill it out.  Were there any questions 
that you did not feel would be useful to me in making decisions about 
marketing and future product development?  I wish I could get those 
nay-sayers to fill it out, too, so I have a clearer sense of the 
demographics of the Visceral Nos.

Naaaah, it was the coronation of HM Queen Elizabeth II

We'll have to wait for Charles to be Sovereign before we get a crop like that

It's red meat for the masses, but I can't agree that this is excellent
commentary.  It's inflammatory: "The entertainment industry hates authors
almost as much as they hate customers."  This rhetoric does nothing but
stir up the emotions, meaning that it quells rational thought.

There are non sequiturs and inconsistencies, starting with the title:
"When elephants dance, it's best to get out of the way."  This would
mean we should get out of the way and let the industrial behemoths set
the rules, exactly the opposite of what the author intends.`

The author promotes a "moral rights" framework, but never explains why
in Europe, where these rights are enshrined in law, copy protection is
much more advanced than in the U.S.

The internet radio problem is not explained clearly.  A section of the
DMCA provides for something called "compulsory licensing", where copyright
owners can be compelled to license their materials.  The CARP group set
the rates for compulsory licenses at a high level.  Many internet radio
stations are instead going to try to negotiate individual licenses at
more favorable rates.

Fair use is mentioned and it is implied that it is a threat to the
copyright holders.  But this doesn't make sense.  The article even
hints that current file sharing systems would fall under fair use,
which is absurd.

The author's solution is threefold:

  "1.  Revert the term of copyright to 14 years, immediately and
       retroactive to all existing works.
   2.  Recognize moral rights in the works authors create, like every
       other civilized country on the planet. Make it immediate and
       retroactive to all existing works.
   3.  Prohibit any corporation from owning a copyright. Corporations
       create nothing; they're consensual hallucinations and exist at
       our pleasure. I don't know about you, but I'm not much pleased
       any more."

I think you'd have most artists up in arms against the first idea.  They
would hate losing their rights after such a short time.  The second idea
is off base, since Europe has moral rights and is worse off than the U.S..
The third idea is impossible; who would own the copyright on a movie
that is made by thousands of people?

In my opinion, the situation we face is very clear.  If unlimited
free reproduction of information goods continues to be possible on
the Internet, then the profitability of those goods is going to fall
drastically, and people are going to stop creating them.  In a nutshell,
we are not going to have much new music and movies, if no one has to
pay for them.

Some people deny this and point to alternative ways for these products
to be funded, but none are convincing to me.  Most people prefer to
just bury their heads in the sand and not face up to these uncomfortable
facts.  They are like Alex in the Doonesbury cartoons running this week.
They think there is an inexhaustable fountain of information goods and
that they can drink from it forever for free.  I hope that around here
we can expect a little more rigor in our discussions of this problem.
Foaming about the evil corporations is a distraction from the real issues.

Some people eagerly anticipate the day when the production and marketing
of expensive films and music stops.  I would expect the creation of such
products to fall off dramatically if copyright were to become
unenforceable (I wouldn't expect much change in new production in the
face enforceable 14 year copyright).  However, I don't expect much
change in the quantity or quality of music or film production regardless
of copyright changes or lack thereof.  Most music and much film is
produced on the artist's dime with little hope of recouping financial
costs.  Admittedly people who only enjoy expensive productions will have
less new material to choose from (though technology is rapidly bringing
down the cost of some aspects "production values").  Personally, I find
no correlation between production expense and my enjoyment of art.  99%
is unbearably horrible, whether it cost $100 or $100 million to create. 
Fortunately the 1% I do enjoy is enough to keep me enthralled through
many human lifetimes.

I didn't care for the essay cited.  To the limited extent I understand
moral rights, they appear to me to violate the right to contract
freely.  If we have copyright, it makes sense to me to allow corporate
ownership of copyright.  Every party in this battle attempts to conflate
its interests with those of other parties and use "an enemy of my enemy
is my ally" tactics.

david:

2002- american media is going to run your product into the ground (or not 
publicize).  this product would /perhaps/ sell in israel or some other 
active theatre.  very few people in the united states are going to accept 
your product for internal-use because its invocation indicates defeat.  it 
also parlays us into a worldstate that we do not want to be in.  it is a 
device that says "we've given up; but at least we have real-time data on the 
decay, and i can carry it around in my pda if i want".  keep the patent 
information for the app, but do not deploy now.

<see david lightman's conversation with professor falken in the 1983 film 
wargames>

the device is also trying to augment the 'acceptance of nuclear 
transactions'.  ie, if a company is making a product that gives me the data, 
then nuclear transactions must be hot and/or acceptable (and that everyone 
else must be downloading current nuclear transactions).

which is totally unreasonable.

From: David Lubkin <lubkin@unreasonable.com>


I was surprised that the reaction from the other list was so
empathic.  Here's an interesting dilemma:  I'm about to pitch this to news
media as something they should cover.  Ideally, in the news section now and
then a review in the technology section when the product is actually
shipping.  From what I know of mainstream journalists, they have a lot in
common with the chaps on that other list.  So it seems like there's a fair
chance that the people I need to write about it are predisposed to abhor
the idea.  *sigh*

Perhaps the right answer is to go directly to misc.survivalism, and maybe
gun or conservative groups, and see if I can establish a modest sales level
and customer base and then look for mainstream press coverage.

And perhaps the technical press (ComputerWorld, Handheld Computing, etc.)
would treat it as straight product news.

>Blimey ! was that a questionaire or was that a questionaire ?

And thank you for being the first to fill it out.  Were there any questions
that you did not feel would be useful to me in making decisions about
marketing and future product development?  I wish I could get those
nay-sayers to fill it out, too, so I have a clearer sense of the
demographics of the Visceral Nos.

Actually, it seems to me that Alex in Doonesbury has articulated one
possible solution; her generation won't pay for content, but the old fogeys
will continue to do so out of force of habit, thus supporting the content
producers.  Now all we need is enough life-extension technology to make this
an indefinitely sustainable solution.

Dave, I like the product. I think you should put together a press
release for media (TV, newspapers, radio) as well as to relevant
lobbying groups and think tanks. ANSER Institute, for example, which is
the big contractor in the Homeland Defense Office, might do a review of
the product and even hype it with government people as well as through
it's website.

i.e. those against it are actually the most ignorant. Don't sweat over
it.

I predict that Mike (Alex's dad) will teach her a lesson by setting up a
website that pirates her webcam video feed, then getting it registered
higher in the search engine indexes than her site, thus siphoning all of
her ad income.... 12 year old temper tantrum to follow... resulting
either in Alex moving in with mom and the jerk, or a major cognitive
maturation.

        I think you will get a good response from the survivalists and in 
general hopefully likewise with the more rational folks out there. 
Unfortunatley I would have to agree in part with Andy's view that the press 
will play this with a decidedly "DoomSayer" slant. Although I think Andy's 
view that "invocation indicates defeat", could be easily swung towards 
"invocation indicates that even in the event of nuclear attack, We the people 
will still fight and survive".

       Again I wish you luck. I think it is all in the marketing and you have 
a serious PR challenge ahead.
       I think the questionaire should get you some fairly good data. You 
will have to bear in mind that in general people who complete it will be for 
the product.


       Alex

<HTML><FONT FACE=arial,helvetica><FONT  SIZE=2>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you will get a good response from the survivalists and in general hopefully likewise with the more rational folks out there. Unfortunatley I would have to agree in part with Andy's view that the press will play this with a decidedly "DoomSayer" slant. Although I think Andy's view that "invocation indicates defeat", could be easily swung towards "invocation indicates that even in the event of nuclear attack, We the people will still fight and survive".

<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I wish you luck. I think it is all in the marketing and you have a serious PR challenge ahead.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the questionaire should get you some fairly good data. You will have to bear in mind that in general people who complete it will be for the product.

Today's "Nouvel observateur" (a French weekly with 600,000 copies) has
a two pages article (p. 108) about the Martinot couple story. I'm
quoted to say:

  I would consider it very shocking for the Justice to forbid the
  deployment, in a private frame, of this choice of cryo-suspension.
  It bothers no one. One is not forced to do it. But one must have
  the right to be frozen, like one has the right, say, to do water
  skiing. It is not the State's business. [my translation]

The rest of the article is unfortunately "not very good in my
opinion". I failed to interest the journalist to various important
points (but at least I got one point across).

http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p1951/a14050.html (in French)

The good thing is the lawyer confirmed to Nouvel Observateur that he
would go up to the "Cour europenne des droits de l'homme" if needed.

Well, one-half out of three isn't bad.  I do hate it, though, that
most of the guys on "my" side of the argument are socialist
weenies without a clue.

Sure, shortening the length of copyrights would be great, but you
can't do it retroactively.  Even though I oppose the concept of
copyright, an author who created his works under the assumption
that he would use copyright-based methods to recoup his investment
has the right to expect the government not to pull the rug out
from under him.  All future authors will create knowing that the
rules have changed and accounting for that.  Of course, I likewise
think it is wrong (both morally and constitutionally) to /extend/
copyrights retroactively, as congress has done many times, and I
suspect the Supreme Court will agree with me on that one when they
hear Eldred v. Ashcroft next year (challenging the constitutionality
of the Sonny Bono Disney Corporate Welfare Act).

"Moral" rights of authors are nonsense.  They have never had any
standing in US law, and thankfully so.  They are an affront to
capitalism, and the very purpose of copyright.  The stated purpose
of copyright is to help most of the economic value of a work go
to the author, to encourage his efforts.  "Moral" rights specifially
allow an author to destroy the economic value of the work itself,
keeping it entirely out of public and away from public use.  There
is danger of that in our system as well, so we have developed things
like compulsory licensing to deal with it--if you release a song,
you have to be paid if someone plays it on the radio, but you don't
have the right to /prevent/ anyone from playing it--as long as they
pay the compulsory license fee.  If we retain copyright, we should
have more of those.  For example, I can find no moral justification
for a musician to object to someone using his recording in a movie
soundtrack or commercial; sure, we may want to have some law to
require payment to encourage more music to be produced, but saying
"no" should not be an option--the whole purpose of encouraging more
creation with copyrights is to get more stuff created that eventually
adds to the public domain and common culture.

Like you, I don't see any way to avoid corporate ownership either,
and I wouldn't override private contracts in any case.

		The problem is that this is not a clean reaction. With water

nonmetals available that go bonkers for oxygen more than carbon does.

		### Precisely which reactions do you have in mind (with
equations please).

		Depends on the type of volcanic activity. If it were a
convection alone, then the only volcanos we'd see would be at spreading
centers and hotspots like Hawaii. Subduction related eruptions, which are
primarily composed of ash, are, in fact driven by the gasses produced by
subduction chemical reactions.

		### I see you are digging deeper and deeper. Precisely which
volcanoes are not the result of convective movements of magma? - please give
me their names, with quotes from authorities on volcanology. Which are the
chemical reactions driving  volcanoes (again, please write out the
reactions, with estimates of the abundance of their energy output, and
references to primary research literature - after all you *are* making very
extraordinary claims here).
		--------

		 It is just that only a small percent of the material that
subducts ever makes it back up through in eruptions. 
		So which is it? A few posts ago, you were claiming that all
of the subducted carbon comes back up through volcanic eruptions.

		### Quote me, or desist.

		This is rather obviously not so. The bare fact that we once
had 55 times more atmosphere than we do now demonstrates that this is a
process that is not in equilibrium.

		### You elected to use the word "obviously". See below.

		------

		Most carbonates ARE lost to rock. The continents are largely
made up of vast layers of limestone which will never be returned to the
atmosphere.

		### Largely? How many % of the continental landmass do you
think is made of limestone? Are you aware of the process of carbonate
weathering and it's role in the carbon cycle? (see below)

		--------
		To conclude my participation in this thread:

		Since so far you did not provide sufficient references for
our discussion, let me correct the situation:
		You will find description of significant variations in
climate and carbon dioxide levels, completely at odds with idea of a
long-term trend towards atmospheric depletion in the following article,
available on the SciAm site: Snowball Earth  by Paul F. Hoffman and Daniel
P. Schrag 
		The peer-reviewed work forming the basis of this article is:
A Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth. P. F. Hoffman, A. J. Kaufman, G. P.
Halverson and D. P. Schrag in Science, Vol. 281, pages 1342-1346; August 28,
1998, as well as a large body of research literature which I will not quote
here.
		A brief outline of some of the many processes involved in
the long, mid and short term changes in carbon dioxide levels follows here,
showing that so far hardly anything is "obvious" carbon cycle research:

Where does all the carbon come from?
J.C. Varekamp
Wesleyan University, Earth and Environmental Sciences 
Carbon fluxes related to chemical weathering make up only a small part of
the short carbon cycle. They are generally assumed to be in steady state,
with a "carbon degassing" flux from the solid earth. I made an inventory of
the amount of CO2 fixed by global weathering based on a generic feldspar
weathering scheme and the riverine bicarbonate flux. The rate of silicate
weathering is based on the riverine Si flux, and the associated CO2
consumption was estimated from the conversion stoichiometry of an
intermediate plagioclase to a mixture of kaolinite and smectite. The
calculated silicate weathering flux and observed bicarbonate flux show
excellent internal agreement, assuming that 60 percent of global weathering
comes from carbonate rock weathering. The final calculations give a fixed
atmospheric CO2 flux of ~20 Tmol CO2/yr for global chemical weathering.
Acidity-generating compounds fuel this global weathering process, which
include the volcanic gases CO2, SO2, HCl and HF. The carbon flux dominates,
and estimates of volcanic CO2 fluxes range from 3-7 Tmol CO2/yr. Another
source of carbon is the "exhumation flux", which liberates organic carbon
from exposed rocks (8 Tmol/yr.). The oxidation of pyrite also fuels silicate
weathering, but when taking all of these sources into account, a shortfall
of 5-8 Tmol CO2/yr. remains. The pre-anthropogenic carbon cycle was in
steady state, given the constant atmospheric CO2 levels of the last 1000
years. The calculated shortfall would deplete the atmosphere in CO2 at a
rate of 3-4.5 ppm/century. Most likely, additional CO2 sources exist (e.g.,
CO2 bubbles in cold springs) or the existing carbon flux estimates are low
by at least 30 percent

----------
The carbon reservoirs are described here, amply demonstrating  that the
atmosphere contains only an insignificant amount of carbon dioxide, and the
only reason why it's still there is a rough equilibrium between
sequestration and release, leaving no place for a long-term imbalance
between the two (in the shorter timespan, thousands and millions of years
there are wide fluctuations, both up and down):

The Carbon Cycle's Reservoirs 

The World's Carbon Reservoirs		Note that: 
*	the atmosphere's reservoir is smaller than all others except the
forests' (the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere therefore depends strongly on
exchanges between the other components) 
*	though amounts in the deep oceans and crust are large, the
mechanisms that exchange the carbon there with the atmosphere are slow.

Reservoir	Size (Gt C)		
Atmosphere	750		
Forests	610		
Soils	1580		
Surface ocean	1020		
Deep ocean	38,100		
Earth's crust	50 x 106		
			
Fossil fuels (total: yet to be released)			
Coal	4,000		
Oil	500		
Natural gas	500		
Total fossil fuel	5,000		

------

And finally, the following quote from Daniel H. Rothman, Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA, Vol. 98, Issue 8, 4305-4310, April 10, 2001, available online:

Unlike the short-term carbon cycle, which is dominated by exchanges of
carbon between the biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and soils on time scales
ranging from about 100-104 years, the long-term carbon cycle is dominated by
exchanges between rocks and the atmosphere and oceans on time scales of
roughly 105-109 years (14-16, 36, 37). Three slow processes dominate the
long-term evolution of CO2 levels: chemical weathering of silicate minerals,
degassing caused by metamorphic and volcanic processes, and the burial and
weathering of organic carbon. Because the latter acts as an independent
subcycle (14), the former are considered the major controls on atmospheric
and oceanic CO2 levels. They are thought to be in rough balance via
reactions such as (14, 36, 38) 
CaSiO3 +CO2 ->CaCO3+SiO2.	[ 3 ] 	
A similar reaction may be written by substituting Mg for Ca. Left to right,
such reactions schematically represent the uptake of CO2 from the
atmosphere, its transformation to dissolved HCO3?during weathering of
silicate rocks, and its eventual precipitation and burial in the oceans as
carbonate minerals. Right to left, the reaction represents metamorphism and
magmatism and the subsequent transfer of CO2 back to the atmosphere and
oceans by volcanism and related processes.

If you wish to continue the thread, it behooves you to provide links or
quotes form authoritative sources disagreeing with my claim that long-term
carbon dioxide concentration is not subject to a process of irreversible
depletion.

up only a small part of the short carbon cycle. They are generally =
assumed to be in steady state, with a &quot;carbon degassing&quot; flux =
from the solid earth. I made an inventory of the amount of CO2 fixed by =
global weathering based on a generic feldspar weathering scheme and the =
riverine bicarbonate flux. The rate of silicate weathering is based on =
the riverine Si flux, and the associated CO2 consumption was estimated =
from the conversion stoichiometry of an intermediate plagioclase to a =
mixture of kaolinite and smectite. The calculated silicate weathering =
flux and observed bicarbonate flux show excellent internal agreement, =
assuming that 60 percent of global weathering comes from carbonate rock =
weathering. The final calculations give a fixed atmospheric CO2 flux of =
~20 Tmol CO2/yr for global chemical weathering. Acidity-generating =
compounds fuel this global weathering process, which include the =
volcanic gases CO2, SO2, HCl and HF. The carbon flux dominates, and =
estimates of volcanic CO2 fluxes range from 3-7 Tmol CO2/yr. Another =
source of carbon is the &quot;exhumation flux&quot;, which liberates =
organic carbon from exposed rocks (8 Tmol/yr.). The oxidation of pyrite =
also fuels silicate weathering, but when taking all of these sources =
into account, a shortfall of 5-8 Tmol CO2/yr. remains. The =
pre-anthropogenic carbon cycle was in steady state, given the constant =
atmospheric CO2 levels of the last 1000 years. The calculated shortfall =
would deplete the atmosphere in CO2 at a rate of 3-4.5 ppm/century. =
Most likely, additional CO2 sources exist (e.g., CO2 bubbles in cold =
springs) or the existing carbon flux estimates are low by at least 30 =

That seems like a much better explanation, or some kinda Von Karmen

That seems like a still better explanation, assuming the vibration was
proportional to the rotation rate of the rotor.  The rotor had a non-zero
product of interia in the plane of rotation.

Oy vey, yes.  The biggest problem I saw with it was transitioning from
rentry speed to the speed at which you could deploy the rotors, without
tearing the thing apart.  Cool idea tho.  I hope we eventually see a
throw-away rotary rocket (pressurized by rotation at launch without
the scary reentry system.)  spike

Ah ha!  Spike doesn't bother to dispose of his discarded intellectual
entertainment sources in a responsible fashion as we here in Seattle
must (paying dearly for that privilege) -- instead he simply ships his
discards to other extropians.

Hmmmm, now where have I seen this type of behavior before.  Oh yes --
the Germans buying their power from the French and Czechs.

Samantha -- don't send Spike your address unless he agrees to enclose
a self-addressed stamped envelope to allow you to return said magazine
when you are done reading it.

At some point we have to "stop the madness" and we might as well start
with Spike.

The author would own the script. The producer would own the actual
film. The other principals in the creation of the movie would be
employees of the producer or creditors to the producer. Just one
scenario, many are possible. I agree with you that corporations are
impossible to get rid of in the short term, but we need to keep
looking for ways to do so, preferrably peaceful, free-market, and
self-perpetuating ways. Otherwise, we will slip into a command economy
in all but name.

Oh, and let's say that 14 years is too short for a copyright. How
about for the lifetime of the original authors, and make copyrights
non-transferrable? Is that reasonable?

You haven't had to pay licensing fees for the TCP/IP protocol, the US
Constitution (or the body of British legal precedent from which it was
plagiarized), or the content you recieve every day off this list
(which itself probably contains innumerable technical violations of
copyright law, starting with the use of URLs which are patented by
British Telecom). Most or even all content is at some level
derivative. Erecting artificial barriers to the sharing and evolution
of content would have have the same frictional effect that taxation
exerts on the physical economy. The creation of free content is an
observable phenomenon, and instead of pretending that it isn't, we
need to figure out what mechanisms are causing people to create this
content.

Hmm. A band plays at a venue. They are paid by the venue owner for
drawing fans who consume beer (of the non-free variety). In the
process, they cell home-burned CDs for $10 each at approximately 97%
profit. If they were signed with a record label (which a vanishingly
small proportion of musicians ever are anyway) perhaps they'd have the
ability to sic the label's lawyers on those who pirate their CDs... on
the other hand, these lawyers (and the massive weight of the entire
legal bureaucracies of the US and Europe) have so far been powerless
to stop the flood of music-sharing...  oh, and if they were signed
with a record label, they'd be making maybe a 2% profit on every CD
they sell. But, like I said, if you are a musician, you're
statistically unlikely to be one of the select few who are even given
that option.  As a practical matter you probably HOPE people like your
tunes enough to share them with their friends, so maybe your growing
popularity will get you more gigs. Is that convincing to you?

Let's try another example. You are a computer consultant. You're sick
of installing multiple pieces of software by hand at site-call after
site-call. So, you write a bunch of scripts to automate the process.
They aren't perfect, but better than click-and-wait. You could try to
sell your scripts, but they're only needed by a small segment of the
market, and so are unlikely to make you a big profit. If you're a
moron, you'll jack up the price to $3000 per seat, and make $3000 x
0. Or, you can continue focusing on the consulting job that's your
bread and butter and release the source code so your colleagues can
also contribute to the project and effectively give you *their* brains
for 'free' in the form of the software you wrote benefitting from
their bug-fixes and patches. Is that convincing to you?

That goes both ways. I'm sure you've heard of Eric Raymond, yet every
word you write here makes it clear that you've not bothered to read
anything by him. I don't expect people to agree with him, but I do
expect any serious discussion to at least address the points that have
already been raised on this topic (and in some cases beaten to death),
and rebut the arguments you disagree with instead of ignoring them.

Information is non-exhaustable because it is infintely duplicable at
negligible marginal cost. Food, gas, ammo, and human muscle power are
exhaustable. So, how about this-- I'll pay for the information I use
with the information I produce, and I'll pay for the physical goods I
use with my physical labor, my physical property, or the cash I obtain
from the sale thereof.

We have a clear precedent in the world of published sheet music.  When
photocopiers became widely available in the 70s, it became so easy to copy
music that the profitability of publishing sheet music decreased 
dramatically.
Consequently fewer artists bothered to publish in that format.  As
a child and teenager, I always wondered why so much of the music
libraries were old, ten years or more.  Now I know.  This is a clear
example of both quality and quantity of a type of intellectual property
declining in proportion to the decline of its profitability.  spike

2002 Mont Pelerin Essay Contest -- Deadline May 31, 2002

http://www.montpelerin.org/essay.html

The topic for the 2002 contest is derived from the following quote from
Adam Smith used by Hayek as the heading for Chapter 5 of The Road to
Serfdom:

"The statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what
manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself
with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could
safely be trusted to no council and senate whatever, and which would
nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and
presumption enough to fancy himself to exercise it."

The question to be answered in your essay is:

"Hayek goes to some lengths at the end of Chapter 5 of The Road to
Serfdom to think about Democracy in terms of the "values which it
serves," making it clear that a parochial belief in Democracy
independent of the values that it promotes can be as devastating as a
belief in the "common good" or the "general welfare."  Is the value of a
democracy, and in turn the value of any system of government, realized
by the extent to which it was structured with Smith's statesman in mind?
Is the system that has for its chief aim the limitation of political
action - be it positive or negative, freedom-restoring as well as
freedom-corrupting - the one most likely to succeed? Have any of the
modern systems of government succeeded in preventing either the gradual
or dramatic loss of freedom? If so, which one, and if not, what would
such a system have as its pillars and why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------

The deadline for all essay submissions is May 31, 2002, and the prizes
are as follows:

First prize: Hayek Fellow Award of $2,500 + travel grant to the 2002
General Meeting in London, England
October 5-10, 2002.

General Meeting in London, England
October 5-10, 2002.

Third prize: Hayek Fellow Award of $1,000 + travel grantto the 2002
General Meeting in London, England
October 5-10, 2002.

The essays are to be of 5,000 words or less and may be submitted by
anyone 35 years of age or younger. If you are aware of anyone who might
be interested in participating in this contest, please pass the word
along.We have included a flyer with the complete details for the

Naw.  I'll scan it for future  reference and perhaps to share 
with other interested parties and line the bird cage with the 
original when I'm done.  Waste not.

The above assumes that information is a type of "goods".  But 
information and software are quite different from many things we 
think of as "goods".  In particular they increase in useable 
value the more they are shared.  The only drawback is when we 
try to treat something that cannot be consumed (in the sense of 
no one else being able to also consume it thereafter) as if it 
can be and therefore should be priced and marketed as if this is 
so.  There is also a drawback which is really an opportunity in 
finding new ways to fund the creation and creators of 
information and entertainment subject to digital information 
characteristics.

Music and movies are a different category of "information" than 
software and data/facts/news.  How to renumerate the creators is 
a very separable problem from how reproducible the information 
is.  You don't have to make digital media pretend that 
non-digital rules apply in order to solve that problem. The 
effort to force old rules and business models will result in 
killing much of the promise of the computer age and in 
drastically increasing the power of the state and decreasing the 
freedom and well-being of the people.

We should no more strangle the digital baby than our

ancestors should have strangled the early automobile era to 
protect the horse and buggy industries.  There is likely to be 
far less reason for much of the publishing industry in books and 
music going forward.  Some aspects of the production and 
distribution of movies will also change.  But it hardly follows 
that we will not have music or movies if we don't preserve the 
old rules.

So true.  Robert I have a tall stack of magazines that will show up in your
mailbox soon.  As you recall from when you were here last month, I have
not yet figured out how to dispose of them.

The irony of intellectual property goes even to this.  If I were to scan 
the article
and email it to Samantha, I would feel as though I were stealing the 
magazine's
IP.  Yet I feel no similar pangs of guilt for actually sending the 
entire magazine
thru the post.  Ideally I suppose, others who read the original citation 
might pay
3 bucks and buy the mag off the shelf, of which the publisher might get 
a few
cents.

All other things are not really equal.  A sufficiently lower 
metabolism leads to lethargy.  Believe me, I know.  Until my new 
doctor figured it out I was going hypo-thyroid.  I couldn't 
figure out why things seemed more difficult, I was gaining 
weight with no change in activty or diet and I didn't have any 
energy.

Of course, as in many things, it is a quesiton of the proper 
balance.

Hmmm.  If the Singularity is coming in the next couple of 
decades I would rather burn bright and very active now to do my 
part in bringing it about rather than worrying too much about my 
metabolism not being slow enough for a naturally maximally long 
life pre-Singularity.  As long as I survive the requisite amount 
of time then I'm home-free.

This is further complicated by the fact that most of a magazine's income 
is from
the sale of ads.   The whole situation is highly paradoxical.  I pass on 
a magazine
to Samantha, the publisher makes nothing off of the deal but the 
advertizers get
more eyes on their ads, presumably resulting in more sales, and so they 
pour
more money back into the magazine.  Then she scans the article and 
emails it to
her friends who do not see the ads.  {8-]  

I dont have the answers to intellectual property paradoxes.  spike

If the tech is developed during wartime, particularly nanotech 
and AI, then they are likely to be owned by the military and to 
be very highly classified.  This will not only likely slow down 
many extropian dreams - it is likely to lead to some of our 
worst dystopian visions.  So perhaps I should have said "slow 
down technological advances useable for extropian purposes".

It was not just dot com that got wiped as you know from 
experience.  The dot com inflation didn't happen in a vacuum. 
In my humble opinion it was engineered.  The sheep were fattened 
and slaughtered.  The unruly tecnophiles were put in their 
place. The more bothersome (threatening of existing power bases) 
technologies were slowed down in their development and 
deployment drastically, especially with the addition of 
braindead IP laws.  If all of this did not have engineered 
elements, it should have.  I'm sure it was thought of as I would 
think of it if on "the other side".

Trying to explain away the economic meltdown as just because of 
stupid business plans is extremely unconvincing.  Stupid 
business plans don't get empowered to radically crash the 
economy all by themselves.   The dot-com thing is a symptom of 
the fattening and the slaughter - not its cause.

That is an interesting idea.  But how wonderful will the 
augmentation be with tons of copy protection mechanisms and 
anti-terrorist technologies including possibly extensive 
monitoring and overrides built-in? I wonderful will it be if 
only cops, soldiers and spooks are authorized for the 
technology? In the current anti-terrorist, protect the dinosaurs 
world this is likely to occur at best.  At worse the voices 
against even natural positive differences in ability will 
nearly. wipe out engineered   increased ability.

So, to get to Singularity, imho, we need to educate/win many 
people and/or become a very effective 
counter-culture/underground economy beyond the reach of the 
nonsense.

Those involved in industries that currently rely on the excludability of
information don't see much opportunity, but such exists.  Rather than
attempting to stop technology which makes copying easy, creative
companies and individuals will invent new entertainment products with an
excludable component.  These products will be enabled by technology
similar to that which is rendering old products non-excludable. 
Prediction: online gaming/artificial worlds of many genres will make
more money for the studios or equivalent companies than linear movies
ever did.  Sometime before the singularity. :)

I'm not counting on singularity in the next couple of decades, or ever. 
IMO the extropian philosophy is applicable to any age, not only one with
a techno-wonderful future just around the bend, though such prospects do
serve as inspiration.  I plan to maximize my life/healthspan and
enjoyment regardless.  If the opportunity to inload, upload, or
otherwise go transhuman presents itself, fantastic.  If not, I'll still
have a great human life.

If I could choose to burn bright/out I wouldn't, as I don't
realistically expect to cause the future to arrive significantly sooner
through my individual efforts.  However, I don't know that such a choice
exists.  I've never heard of slowing one's metabolism as a viable life
extension strategy.

Probably not feasible in the sense of enforceable, but when has 
this stopped the US government from trying anyhow?  The War on 
Drugs, the War on Poverty, the War on Terror - all ultimately 
infeasible.  Sometimes I am paranoid enough to foresee requiring 
the registration of compilers and debuggers much like guns today.

As mentioned in another post, I am not referring only to the 
dot.coms.  It was not they who were the cause of the economic 
meltdown and it is certainly not only they who were drastically 
curtailed and existing businesses ruined.  Today it is still 
extremely difficult to get any investment money for any 
technology venture, seed capital or continued financing.  The VC 
and investors are very skittish across the board.

Those were simply the largest technological segments affected. 
Most high technology was hit to some degree.  The dot coms were 
not as worthless as they are often portrayed.  Many quite strong 
and worthwhile companies died along with the rest or are barely 
surviving.  Quite a few had interesting technological edges that 
could have made a difference in what was available for the rest 
of us. Dot coms got caught up in the super hype but I don't 
believe they created it or that the crash was altogether or even 
mainly a healthy thing. The telecomms were not just spending VC 
money, nor were some of the "dot.coms".

That is an interesting idea but after over two decades in 
software I really don't believe it.  The radical increase in 
computational horsepower has not resulted in a proportional 
increase in the quality, capabilities or performance profiles of 
software.  If anything, the increasing horsepower makes bad 
software designs and tools more obvious as the bloat as well as 
the spectacular blowouts are magnified and yet more often seen 
as "acceptable".  Self-programming systems may well be acheived 
but not without some well designed seeds being built along with 
some excellent tools to monitor and tweak the beginnings of the 
process.  In the meantime, non-self programming software hasn't 
received any significant advances in programmer tools and 
abilities in over a decade.  I don't know how we are to develop 
good augmentation wares without several serious advances in 
programming practice, human-computer interaction and other areas 
not exactly accelerating at this time.

At today's level I am not convinced we have the human 
programming tools and techniques sufficient to build the seed of 
an SI.  I am not even convinced we have enough to address the 
conventional programming backlog.  A lot of software people are 
also out of work despite the huge needs that have not decreased 
or been addressed after the tech meltdown.   A lot of us who are 
employed are fighting to keep our companies afloat with far too 
few remaining staff and find ourselves with little time for 
innovation.

I think that is likely for the short term.  Although I would not

It seems dangerous to me to postpone dealing with problems today 
  because they will be dealt with better in some hypothetical 
future state.  I have no argument that human race plus SI is 
much more survivable and an immensely improved state.  My only 
beef is with too much reliance on the SI to solve things BEFORE 
it exists or leaning too far in assuming SI in x years.  I 
certainly  find myself doing that sometimes.

"Unreasonable software".  Aptly named.  The entire site is 
unreasonable for seriously introducing a product.

In the event of an attack the product is probably worthless 
unless either your Palm is EMP hardened or you are far enough 
away to need little advice besides not going toward the blast 
and paying attention to prevailing winds, etc.

The pages on the site are very jumpy between selling the 
product, talking very briefly about software in general and 
talking about things the author thinks are cool but probably 
aren't to a lot of reader's taste and interrupt the flow.

The questionnaire and the below make some pretty insulting 
assumptions about where people that aren't interested or find 
the treatment somewhat objectionable are coming from.  Having 
such that obvious in the site selling the product drives 
potential sales away.

Things like talking about being sure to look at the mushroom 
clould if one safely can because it is so beautiful are WAY over 
the top.

It would be better if the software trained the user to keep this 
information mostly in their head and do relatively simple 
computations manually as this is all that can be counted on in 
such an event.  Even the most dedicated nerd is not likely to be 
plopped down on the sidewalk poking at his Palm at such a time.


On my list of things to buy this is not way up there.  I would 
be more interested in how to survive the police state we are in 
  (imho) greater danger of becoming.

It appears to be almost common sense that nothing gets created without money 
involved. Actually I think it it rather a form of fairness if artists get 
paid. But what do they get paid for? The current system is like a lottery: 
You create a single #1 hit you get a pension for the rest of your life. If 
you're out of luck and you create a piece of music that's truly innovative 
and ahead of it's time you get nothing. Except that people in 100 years might 
look at you in awe.

Again, I am not advocating killing copyright - but in my opinion every single 
piece of really valuable artwork or progress in art or sciences had no or 
very little money involved. The mail client I am using to write this down to 
the ISDN driver to transmit this is all free software, and it's every bit as 
usable as their proprietary counterparts. Yet they were created without the 
implied hope for the big buck. Maybe this is un-American [Microsoft's 
Alchin]? I don't think so!

Soon it will be possible for artists to create not only music, and software, 
but also movies in LOTR quality. And maybe distribute them (or the PovRay or 
RenderMan sources) under GPL like licenses. I think this should be encouraged.

Humans are creative by nature and money has nothing, really nothing to do 
with it.

83% of companies entering 2001 with venture funding still live.  Not
sure whether I'm surprised or not.  The rapid adaptation that enabled
this survival rate would seem to speak very well of the Silicon
Valley/American/Capitalist economy/culture.  Granted, even most of the
survivors had to make serious cutbacks and some may still not pull
through, but I wonder how much realling interesting technology was lost
or set back significantly?  Not much is my guess.

I guess one can quibble over what constitutes a significant advance or
claim that nothing's new under the sun, but what about (in no particular
order)

* safer programming (the collection of stuff Java and C# kind of get
right)
* object oriented programming
* application servers/frameworks
* scripting languages
* ubiquitous networking and database connectivity
* semi-literate programming
* "extreme programming" practicies
* the web! (xml/http/uri/...)
* easy internationalization and accessibility

I consider adoption and robust implementation highly relevant, even if
the ideas are decades old.  None of the above have run their course
IMO.  I look forward to another decade of improvements (though with a
half-empty perspective, one may be looking at a decade of stagnation)
and perhaps a few surprises.  Capability security should be really
important.  Aspect Oriented Programming looks like a nice adjunct to
existing programming methods.  For the sake of list continuity or
something, Intentional Programming looked interesting to me a couple
years ago (mentioned by Billy Brown I think) though I don't think I
fully grokked it.  Appears that the project is no more at Microsoft
Research.

>From my (limited, not all that experienced) perspective, the software
stack is getting higher level every year, which frees brilliant people
to work on really hard problems (building a seed AI, eventually) instead
of reinventing lower layers that have been implemented and
re-implemented by previous (internet time) generations.  Also lets bozos
like me crank out boring programs faster. :)

In my idle perambulation across the net I recently found a very thoughtful
article on the question of qualia in machines, with some implications for
uploading and copying of personalities. While the arguments seem to be of
the general kind that was previously extensively analyzed on this list, the
article is useful in bringing them together in a coherent and quite
compelling manner.

Here is the link: http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/qualia.html

Thus it appears there are good reasons to believe that all intelligent
machines will have qualia.

I recall in high school band that the band director was always worried
about a concert being messed up by some music industry person coming in
to see that all of our sheet music was original and not copies (i.e.
confiscating our sheet music just before going on stage). Of course, the
school couldn't afford to buy several hundred copies of sheet music
every year. The piracy of copying it was a direct consequence of the
pricing (which I assume was set on the assumption that it would be
pirated).

I do recall, though, that all through high school (the early 80's) the
chorus and band directors were able to get sheet music for many recent
pop tunes, so I don't think that there wasn't any publishing going on. I
do think that there was a significant amount of consolidation in the
distribution industry. The Music Stand, a mail order company located
here in Lebanon, controlled more than 80% of the sheet music mail order
market in the late 80s. They have since either moved away or gone out of
business. With the internet, it is possible to get sheet music from
anywhere in the world, so this lends toward music companies selling
sheet music directly, which also allows them to police the piracy of
sheet music better.

Not necessarily. Computers were developed very much in
a wartime economy and were rapidly deployed into
commerce. Most war-time medical breakthroughs
(defibrilation for one) were also rapidly released.
IMO, it really depends on WHICH part of the
Government, and which government for that matter, gets
its hands on the technology. There are parts of the
American government which are inherently secretive -
that's their whole reason to exist - whereas others
are quite willing to share and spread the technology.
And sometimes these live cheek-by-jowl, one classic
example being various American intelligence agencies
and DARPA.

True, the tech would be less likely to be released
today when there are such potentially disruptive
'dual-use' capabilities being freely passed around in
message lists such as this one and many many others,
as well as in print. However, there will be massive -
truely massive - development required for any American
government organization to be able to create a
nanotech device to say nothing about deploying it. It
seems much more likely to me that the government would
outsource or contract the development to one of many
different technological firms, and said firm would
find a way to deploy the technology in the
non-military arena.

This is the golden goose of technology, or the Grail,
or the golden fleece - take your mythological pick.
Whoever gets their hands on it WILL find some way to
exploit it, be it in public service, some stealthy
organization, and/or a private company. Personally,
I'm expecting all three.

To quote Freud out of context - "Sometimes a cigar is
just a cigar." Sure, conspiracy theorists and
investigators and all sorts of people will be digging
into this mess for a long time. Heck, people're still
looking into what happened in 1929, and there's still
massive amounts of questions unanswered. Was it really
the sinking of the Titanic which caused the insurance
and therefore the banking industry's concerns which
lead to the stock market crash? Or was that the
excuse? 

I don't know the answer. I do know that bad things DO
happen to good people - and good technologies. I do
not believe that there is any sort of 'star chamber'
or international conspiracy of the degree required to
generate this kind of international slap-down. I do
know that people are greedy and often do NOT do their
research, or trust people who claim to have done the
research.

*wry grin* To be fair, there are people out there such
as myself who shoot their mouths off without knowing
everything about the situation. All I can honestly say
is that if there *IS* convincing evidence of such a
group controlling our lives, I have yet to see it in
the (relatively few) years I've been watching.

In short, I don't see the dot-coms as anything other
than people betting - BETTING - on a 'sure thing' and
getting their hands slapped financially.

Hiyas

it occurs to me that as the red cross is perceived in some quarters as being a
christian organisation, due to it's use of the cross as a symbol, and as the
muslims have set up the red crescent society (any others? Is there a red star
of david organisation?) perhaps we need to cut through all of this
denominational clutter and get right to the heart of the matter: an
internationally recognised symbol of relief and, well, cheeriness.

So, I propose that the various red thingy societies merge under the banner of
the International Red Smiley Face.

Just think about it, what do you feel when you see a smiley face?*
How do you think you would feel if you were badly injured and you saw a van
hurrying towards you, with a huge red smiley face on the side?  It's bound to
cheer you up, right?

I mean, why mess around with abstractions, when we can have a pictorial
representation of what you'll look like at the end of the process, assuming
everything works perfectly?


Plus it already looks good against a yellow background.


It's just a thought, but it's the little thoughts which count.
Well, the big ones count too, but you can have too many big thoughts.

So: vote "yes!" to The International Committee of The Red Smiley today!

Dwayne

The wearable computer crowd has discussed this.  There are good
reasons to believe that palm pilots and wearable computers are
more likely to survive a biggie EMP than your desktop and perhaps
even your notebook.  As if it really matters.  {8-[

Police state?  I would be far more worried about surviving

Not neccessarily but it is and will remain a concern.  It is a 
concern that has often been expressed by many on this list. 
Because of the scope of military and control applications of 
nanotech and AI, they are of a bit more concern than early 
computers were.  By the way, my last name contains a "t" instead 
of the "d".

I disagree that the development required would be massive as far 
as including a lot of people, for either nanotech or AI.  And I 
have personally had experience of firms with military contracts 
not being willing (or perhaps legally able) to license civilian 
uses of even seemingly no-risk technology they had first 
developed under military contract.  If nanotech is first 
weaponized it could be some time before the technology is seen 
elsewhere.

This cigar is not a cigar.  If you wish to believe it is you are 
welcome to do so.  But it is too convenient by far. Saying there 
will always be theories dismisses some quite important 
possibilities that it may be dangerous to dismiss at this time 
as they are, if realistic, in the way of our fondest hopes.

If there isn't then I wonder why not frankly.  It is not 
undoable by any means.  It would not take that thick an 
organization.  Just the right actions at the right points at the 
right times.

If it  could be seen easily it would of course not be very 
effective.  Personally I lean toward believing there is some 
reason to be somewhat paranoid at this time.

So you are simply dismissing the many, many companies and 
businesses who do not fall in this neat package?  You are 
dismissing the size of the meltdown that did not limit itself to 
dot-com companies and that continues long after any real 
correction?  Almost all nominal companies tanked including many 
high-tech and AI efforts.  A lot of cutting-edge research has 
been set back as far as being available to you or I.

Perhaps it was not a conspiracy but it has slowed all of us 
down. My own goals of financial independence and freedom to move 
to a different job, contract or start my own business have also 
been effected negatively. I am not alone in that.

Thought experiment: name some famous Russian classical
composers.  Just the biggies, ones that you can think of
without looking at your CD collection:

Rachmaninoff.  Tchaikovsky.  Shostakovich.  Prokoviev.  
Nikolai Rimski-Korsakov.  Stravinski.  Maiskovski.

And there are plenty of other Russian classical monsters.  
Now name some famous American classical composers.

1.  Aaron Copland.

and... ummmm...  lets see, Copland annnnnd... dont tell me...
ummmmm...  [five minutes later]

OK Aaron Copland.

Russia and America are two very different societies with similar
people genetically, with similar numbers.  Yet Russia has
produced classical music two orders of magnitude greater than
America, at least two orders.  They supported their classical
composers.  They figured out a way to keep a roof over their
most creative heads allowing them to create works of great
beauty, while our counterparts to Rachmaninov and Prokofiev
were spending their creative energy working at the local
McDonalds trying to raise enough money to pay the rent on
their miserable hovels.  Tchaikovsky, grab a mop and get
your commie butt over here, clean up that spill!  Stravinski,
three large orders of fries, STAT!

Of course, America got jazz and rock out of the deal, so
I suppose it comes out even.

What I want to see is some means of maintaining support for
the training and development of art that is not a government
subsidy but rather is voluntarily funded by large faceless
corporations, with a profit motive.  If we defeat copyright
and the profits that go with creating content, then the faceless
corporations will have ever less incentive to pour money into
the arts and we get Copland, as opposed to Rachmaninov.

I guess I am arguing that intellectual property is a good
thing.  If we wanna play, we gotta pay.   spike

Mike makes my point better than I did.  In the late 70s I and some of the
other band members would arrange the latest pop tunes for marching
band.  It was highly popular to march out onto the football field blasting
out current top 40, straight from Casey Casem's Countdown.

But even the least musical astute could see that over time, the current
pop tunes were becoming ever less translatable to horns.  As society
slid from rock and roll to disco, we found that it only takes five notes
to play, for instance, KC and the Sunshine Band's hit single:

Thats the way, uh huh uh huh,
I like it, uh huh uh huh... (repeated about 800 times).

To do rap "music" I suppose it would take only one note.

But on the other hand, I suppose the progression of music mirrors
our downsizing society.  A classical chamber orchestra requires
a good 50 players, whereas the swing bands of the 1930s only
require 15 to 20.  Rock and roll was demonstrated by the
Fab Four (actually 5 players), and modern rap only requires
two, one to "sing" and the other to go back and forth on the
phonograph to make the rippa rippa rippa noises.

Perhaps the reason why teenagers feel so little guilt about
copying modern top 40 is there is so damn little content
to it, its like stealing a paper napkin from the local fast
food place.

Oh jeez, I have become my grandfather.  spike

It is just a guess as is mine.  I certainly know of a lot of 
very good brains currently not being gainfully employed and a 
lot of others that are in a holding pattern doing everything 
necessary to keep a company afloat rather than doing what they 
do best.  The company I worked for was cut down to and arguably 
into the bone.  We are still alive but not as able to seize 
opportunities and flesh out our technology as before.

These are largely boring languages that greatly limit the 
productivity and creativity of programmers and of builders of 
tools to support software design, implementation and 
maintenance.  There is nothing "new" in either language although 
the organization of the languages and their marketing has been 
effective.


> * object oriented programming


Very old technology.  I've personally been involved in it for 20 
years now.


> * application servers/frameworks


Remember old timesharing systems?  The frameworks leave a lot to 
be desired that I can go into at length if desired.


> * scripting languages


Very old languages like Lisp and its descendants and like 
Smalltalk always were "scripting".  Scripting languages alone do 
not address productivity of software engineering and gains in 
reliability and capability.  They are more productive 
environments for designing algorithms in the small but most do 
not address programming in the large well.

> * ubiquitous networking and database connectivity


We have better piping (network).  We have database technology 
that is more used but really hasn't advanced in a decade and in 
places two decades.  It covers relatively small transaction type 
problems well but not much else where the much else is certainly 
needed today.  The connectivity to databases is mainly 
relatively low-level with little broadly available support at 
the level of object persistence for instances.  This is an area 
of personal expertise and I very much know whereof I speak.


> * semi-literate programming


The concept is quite old and the practice is not often done and 
certainly isn't well and broadly supported by tools.


> * "extreme programming" practicies


Most of them are not very extreme in their effectiveness and 
many are part of what good programmers already do.

> * the web! (xml/http/uri/...)


More pipes and information enabling.  XML is broadly over-hyped 
as the solution for everything.  In fact it was designed for and 
is nominally useful for the packaging and delivery of mostly 
hierachical information between heterogeneous parties.  Neither 
it nor any of the other protocols listed address the real meat 
of the programming problem space.

Not relevant to the problem.

Not one of the things listed address better automation of the 
software process itself and radically better toools and 
techniques in programmers hands.

Capability security is also a very old concept.  I independently 
hit on it and used it in the early 80s myself.  Aspect Oriented 
Programming is interesting but not easily exploited in 
relatively inflexible languages like Java and C#.  It is 
commonly used to patch up existing software messes rather than 
to revolutionize the creation of software.

Intentional programming is extremely interesting to me.  In the 
meantime a great deal could be done to reverse-engineer and 
refactor existing code (providing much more useable information 
about the codebase as a side-effect!) and to enable much higher 
levels of reuse and use of design patterns.  But creating a 
viable tools company was very difficult before the meltdown.  It 
is even more so now.   So it is likely these developments, if 
they happen, will come through volunteer efforts as Open Source.

The stack is getting much broader but it is not getting 
significantly "deeper" or better organized for excellent use. 
The very structure of many software companies and of software 
patents and other encumbrances precludes much reuse of prior 
efforts.  A lot is re-invented over and over again by working 
software engineers.  Relatively  little is reused even within 
companies much less across them.

This is quite unfortunate.  Though I am not a monarchist by any means, for 
some reason this news had a slight effect on me.  One of the interesting 
things about the Queen Mother is that she lived to 101 and kept her wits 
about her to the very end.  A rather enviable task, considering all the 
changes she must have witnessed through the entire 20th Century.

Its too bad that most people don't put two and two together and realize 
that a long life is a good thing, and death is more than merely just sad.

Well, the Romans.  Have a read up on the Assyrians for some over-the-top
punishments. Amongst others.
The Romans thought it hysterically funny that the christians used the crucifix
as a symbol, and the use of the crucifix s a symbol of christianity was a
major obstacle to acceptance of christianity in the upper classes, as only the
most grotty of criminals were crucified, certainly not "decent" people.

Hmmmm.  I wonder if we could spirit the body away and put it in

Are these ultra-capacitors commercially available, and if so, from where?
Or even just research prototypes would be fine.   Any info you could forward

Predictability breaks down in a Singularity. Actually, some things can be 
predicted. One of them is that scarcity economies like we know them will be 
obsolete. I find it a bit paradoxical that many on this list seem to have 
capitalism in their blood.

Let me counter with two German and one Austrian composers.

The first got paid for playing the organ during the service. At his time 
composers did their work for the honor of God, not for the cash. Yet his work 
was a quantum leap in music history that dwarves all the composers you named. 
His "Das wohltemperierte Klavier" and "Die Kunst der Fuge" is the foundation 
upon which western music and western music theory rests. 

The second actually got paid for some of his music. He had a day job at the 
palace in Vienna. But his music was actually composed against the 
establishment. So he decided for his music, against the wealth. He never saw 
a single Schilling for most of his works. Yet a lot of people consider him 
the Master of the Masters. He died in absolute poverty with an age of 
30something.

The third also lived in Vienna most of the time on the pocket money of 3 
friends of his music. With him, the classic era ended and IMHO also peaked. 
For me, his music is on a level that has never been reached again. Absolute 
Musik! 

These days a lot, really a lot more money is available for artists in 
Germany. But what comes out? Name one German speaking musician of this 
century who stands tall enough to reach the knees of those 3.

IP is taken way too serious. Man, what if Planck's heirs would charge 
everybody who dares to use quantum mechanics? What if every engineer would 
have to pay royalties to Cambridge because nothing they do would be possible 
without his work? Every use of electricity should include a penny for 
Maxwell? How dare we cash in on the expense of those upon who's shoulders we 
stand? Our part in our intellectual 'property' is a tiny one, even if we're 
geniusses.

I don't care if Britney cashes in big time, however - she is meaningless. But 
software and science is like a building. It can't get higher if setting new 
blocks on older ones is breaching IP. American ideas of IP threaten to bring 
progress itself to a grinding halt and drown everything in law suits. 
Sometimes I wonder if some in the US Senate even intends this. Stuff for 
conspiration theories against the Singularity ;)

Indeed. Additionally unfortunate is that Prince

Tonight, I just was informed (see below) will be yet
another opportunity to hear the incomparable Mike
Miller Crusade and possibly meet with other extropians
in the area.  This is NOT the same venue as described
before (see below), although it is the same coffee
shop chain.  Note that on the couple of occasions that
I tried the Santa Ana Gypsy Den, it was VERY LOUD and
had LONG LINES.  The crowd seemed a bit more roudy, as
well, and younger.  Tonight might be a bit different,
as MMC does not rely on loudness, but rather MUSIC(!).
 What a concept..

Unfortunately I have to go out of town for a few days so I won't
be able to participate in this very interesting discussion.  A few
comments before I go:

There are many types of intellectual products which are threatened by the
Internet: books, music, movies & TV, software would be the main ones I can
think of.  Each has unique properties and each is likely to be affected
differently.  I think a full analysis of the impact of widespread,
unlimited sharing of data would require looking at each one separately.
You can't necessarily apply the lessons of one category to the others.

Software is unique in a couple of ways: a substantial part is sold to
businesses rather than end users.  At least in Western countries, it may
be practical to detect and deter much software piracy among businesses,
with whistle-blower rewards and such.  The Business Software Alliance
sends out threats every day.  Also, software is unique in that it is
"active" data.  It is the only one which actually could be protected
in principle, via encryption and tamper-proof hardware.  However, the
technology to do this is a long way off.

Software is way ahead of the other areas in that copy protection
has been around for a couple of decades now.  The consensus is that
it did not work.  However there is a widespread belief that it is
becoming impossible to make significant money solely via software sales.
Most software companies seem to be trying to position themselves to make
money from service and support rather than sales.  This is true both in
the open source and proprietary software models.

Books, and text in general, are probably the cheapest to produce of all
of these.  Also, in my experience, the ability to produce coherent writing
is more widespread than the talent needed to make good music or movies.
So this area may suffer less than some of the others if we have to go
to a system where people create for love and not for money.

Movies and TV are the most expensive to produce, especially considering
the limited marketing lifetime of the products.  (Maybe some big software
programs have similar costs over time, but the investment will last
longer.)  Also they involve huge numbers of people, each with talent
in their specialty.  I don't see how you could get actors, directors,
set builders, sound technicians, cinematographers, and all the other
people necessary to make a good quality movie to donate their time.

However, movies have the advantage of being experienced best in a
darkened, full-size movie theater.  That experience can't be pirated,
and movies make a substantial fraction of their revenues from the initial
theatrical release.  It's possible that even if they lose all their video
revenues to piracy, theatrical income will still fund the kind of movies
we have come to expect.

Finally, music is probably closer to text than to movies in terms of
costs and complexity.  You need a few musicians and a producer, the
rental of a music studio, the purchase of instruments.  If the right
people can come together and donate their time, the other expenses
will be a few thousand dollars.  It will be a lot of work to create,
record and mix high-quality music, but probably no more so than writing
good software.

Musicians and DJs can make money from live performances, with their
donated recordings being purely promotional.  But today, they can't
make much money that way; most live stage shows are meant to promote
record sales.  Maybe a few bands can charge a lot more for their live
performances, but most will see a significant drop in revenue.

Summing up, software is farther down the road to the transition.  For a
couple of years now I've been hearing "nobody can make money on software
anymore."  Thus Microsoft's switch to .NET and Internet services, with
the industry following suit.  Clearly music is the next place being hit,
with text following as well.  I believe within 10-15 years we will see
almost all music and writing being done purely on a voluntary basis, with
fewer successful bands and writers who can make money by live appearances.

Movies are fighting a pre-emptive action to try to retain video revenues,
but I think this is probably a losing battle, and in the long run they
should work on creating an unsurpassed theatrical experience.  Movie
theaters have gotten hugely better in the last 10 years around here,
with elevated seating and better sound.  Hopefully they will continue
this trend.  A blockbuster can still make hundreds of millions of dollars
from people who will pay to go out and enjoy it in a movie theater even
if they can watch it for free at home.

I think that open source is can tackle this, but you are perhaps too
pessimistic about VC money for this. Right after a meltdown caused
by all he VCs imitating each other and investing in 20 companies
doing the same thing, they relearn the lesson that they should
be looking for unique opportunities rather than like lemmings all
jump over the same cliff. I got funded in late 1985, just after the
last such silliness (it was hard disk drives that time.) If you have
a viable business plan, a good team, and a unique idea, you may be
able to find some smart money.

Note that not all open source is paid for by volunteers, either.
A growing number of companies are maintaining open source code when
it proves useful.

Freedom abuse alert!  Sounds just like those who claim freedom of speech

John Adams, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Meredith Monk, George Crumb.  Ok,
they're all contemporary, but that's what I prefer.  America was
considered a cultural backwater until well into the twentieth century. 
How many great Russian composes came from east of the Urals?  What
appears as the pinnacle of creativity in a few people is actually the
result of a huge amount of collaboration and cross-pollination.  The
success of say Russian dance or Silicon Valley technology speaks not to
the need for greater incentives for owners of ideas, but for more
intense collaboration and cross-pollination.  Some would call these
theft.

The money faceless corporations pour into the "arts" gets us ... Britney

OTOH I know a number of good brains that have gone back to school, taken
up working on their own projects and/or traveling.  These sorts of
things cause financial stress, but in the long run may better serve
creativity and innovation than a longer run at theoretically innovative
startups rapidly morphing into overweight bureaucracies dominated by
politics.

It helps indirectly, by sparing cycles otherwise spent on these problems
and by increasing the number of people who can effectively use
computers, some of whom should be brilliant programmers.  The
accessibility bit may even be useful for humans with augmented/altered
senses and motor devices.

All of your critiques were insightful, but I think overly discount the
bright side: sure nothing I mentioned is new, but widespread
understanding and adoption is, and in my (again, rather limited)
experience each accrues productivity gains and frees one to concentrate
on higher level solutions that are just as hard as the lower level ones

I certainly wouldn't want to start a tools company now, or perhaps in
the last decade.  Most of the world is wedded to Microsoft's tools
(there's a tools company, much as I dislike them) and much of the rest
demands libre tools.  Perhaps one can have it both ways: create
radically better open source tools, and form the next Cygnus Solutions
around them.  Collab.net's <http://tigris.org> is the closest I can
think of to this right now.  The Free Software Business mailing list is
a good place to pick at these sort of ideas.

Certainly just as much code is rewritten as ever, even within companies,
but if you consider the broad and occasionally deep libraries that are
now available for any popular environment you've got massive code reuse
happening.

I understand that to you, a world class programmer with 20 years
experience who has worked with or independently discovered everything I
listed long ago, the software world may well appear stagnant.  To me,
lots of cool things are happening.  Software sucks in general and tools
in particular, though IMO a good deal of it "sucks less".  Is the pace
enough to get us to the point where a seed AI can be built in time to
bootstrap a singularity in the current consensus (2020?) timeframe?  I
don't have any insight on that question, and perhaps that's one reason
I'm not counting on a singularity.

What tools/methodologies do people think will be necessary to facilitate
seed AI engineering?  If you had funding to hire 10 brilliant people for
the next several years, what tools would you create?

I'd focus on security, but that's just because I'm pain averse, and I
find the thought of an AI/upload world with today's security stack
incredibly scary.  But I don't know that security that sucks less gets
us closer to a singularity.  Perhaps closer to a desirable signularity
(mispeling unintended, but I'm glad I noticed it).

Some religious historians argue that the crucifix was not commonly
used as a christian symbol until later.  The claim, as I understand it,
is that the fish (icthios) was used more commonly in the first and
second centuries.  This is where we get the Darwin fishes from.

The traditional story is that if one takes acronym of the
Greek phrase "Lesous Christos Theou Uios Soter" or
"Jesus Christ, son of god, saviour" you get ichthus, thought
to have been first used by the Christians at Ephesus.

Turns out, modern scholarship has shown that the
symbol predates christianity.  The Ephesians stole
it from the pagans.

I propose Dwayne's red smiley as the extropian symbol of mercy.  
This is not to be confused with the general extropian symbol, that
round outpoint arrowy thing.  The red smiley will be for those
extropians specifically on a universal mission of philanthropy
analogous to the red cross.  

The Darwin fishes could be a great symbol for the subset of
extropians who concern themselves with evolutionary theory.

Extropians could even form a special order of highly educated
practitioners analogous to the Jesuits.  These could be called the
Hoerkuits.

Well, the Red Cross is a Swiss emblem, which is the origins of its
policy of being neutral and immune to lawful military attack. Note,
though, that the origins of the swiss cross is actually an arrangement
of four cannons meeting at their breaches, pointing outward in all
directions in a sign of defense. Prior to that they were using the funky
Maltese cross, with the ends flared outward.

Well, the cross was reserved for the men in most cases. The women slaves
and peons who resisted were generally impaled on a stick, crotch to
skull.

Everything in Islam has at least three different meanings. For example,
all this clatter about 'Islam' meaning "peace", when actually it is more
accurately translated as "submit" or "surrender". Not a sentiment that
any freedom loving individuals should ever consider laudable.

Problem is that this is very easy to confuse with the red 'meatball' of
the Japanese. The Chinese and Koreans, at the very least, would object
to this being used.

What is money? Its merely a symbol of action taken. No freedom exists if
the holder never acts on the freedom they allegedly posess, and the
amount they posess in actuality is directly a function of the effort
they put into exercising it. My right to keep and bear arms only exists
so far as I am willing to arm myself. My right to believe idiotic
superstitions exists only as far as I do so, and my right to free speech
only exists as far as I exert it. It all takes money, and the more of it
I have, the more freedom I can practice. Arguing anything otherwise is
futile barking at the moon.

You either have the choice of individuals producing their own value in a
market economy, or the state owning it all. Egalitarianism is a fiction.

Depends on the field. Musically, yes. In writing, painting, and science,
America was producing its share of brilliance from the start. Note that
arts that are of value on a frontier or in a developing country produced
genius (or attracted it).

Since when has the contemporary 'pop' culture ever been lauded by the
intelligentsia, no matter what era those elites lived in?

I will predict that in 20-30 years there will be some university
somewhere with a degree in Britney Studies.

Qualia present some interesting issues for uploading/downloading. Chalmers
paper, (with its thought experiments using the classical replacement of
neurons with silicon equivalents) could be construed as being entirely about
uploading/downloading, except that the result of a download is still a
humanoid (in Chalmers case, a Robot) presumably with all the sensory and
actuation gear indentical to a human, and living in good old 3D reality as
we know it. As such the complete functional equivalence is maintained,
presumably with that, all of the hormonal actuation gear within the brain
itself, which is an intimate part of short and long term  function of the
brain.

In this context, uploading into a non humanoid form - say purely
computational - would require a kind of software 'wrapper' to be present
that completely replicates spinal cord sensory/actuation plus all intra and
extra cranial sensory/actuation. On top of that the wrapper then has to be
placed in a virtual environment that provides the stimulation of the senses
and close the feedback loops that are necessary for normal operation in the
world - the world that is responsible for the training-in of all the
functions in the mind existing pre-upload.

The alternative - a non-computational environment - is where the wrapper is
a humanoid robot providing the same facilities, only this time without the
necessity to provide a virtual environment.

Failure to provide a sohpisticated wrapper would result in the uploadee
experiencing para/quadraplegia or motor-neurone disease and any one of a
million disorders in between (say starvation), which would presumably result
in the brain declaring symbols (qualia) like pain and nausea or chronic
pleasure or other abnormal states.

There's an interesting engineering issue here. If an upload wrapper is to be
tested fully, then I would be constructing and artificial brain to inhabit
it, to see what experiences result. The conclusion is that creation of an
artificial human mind is mandatory prior to viable uploading . Not a
generalised artificial mind, but an artificial _human_ mind, with all the
functional structural nuances from evolution. Only then would the upload
transition be seamless and a starting place for an uploadees subsequent
self-evolution.

In the light of this, I'm starting to think that the Kurzweil version (no
doubt borrowed from elsewhere!) of uploading may be nicer or easier (see the
CEO semiar video
http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news_single.html?id%3D875
where cell size nanos, one or more per neuron, inhabit the brain and
sequester it's target neuron's function). They facilitate real/virtual world
switching and presumably are a perfect map for an upload and also vehicle
for the prior testing thereof. (How these would replicate, say, a Purkinje
cell with 200,000 synapses, beats the hell out of me!)

It would be even niftier if the nanos could be constructed from the
uploadee's own stem cells (or maybe glial cells - assuming, as Chalmers
notes - that they play no part in brain function. Personally I doubt this).
If all this technology is available, presumably one is able to fully repair
the human body anyway - so why bother with upload? Your new intra-cranial
cellular grid would facilitate all sorts of add-ons and 'out of body
experiences' including the most intimate virtual involvements possibly
imaginable and yet we can return to corporeal humanity whenever we want.

Options. Options. Options.

Cheers

Colin Hales

I think Ray's ideas are derived from Moravec's "Bush Robots" which
were discussed in Mind Children (though I've never seen him credit
Moravec as "good" scientists should do).  Moravec documented the
ideas about a decade before Ray first started talking about them
I believe.  It is always possible Ray developed them independently.
I think Marvin Minsky once told me that he had invented a similar
idea independently from Moravec.  I sometimes make "amazing"
discoveries only to later realize that I had read it someplace
previously.

Synapses contain mitochondria.  Mitochondria are the size of small
nanobots.  Each neuron could contain many nanobots.  They could
run carbene rods up and down the axons and get much faster transmission
velocities by "tapping" on the rod than current ion currents provide.
(A review of Nanomedicine might reveal even faster communication methods).

If Ray is suggesting nanobots the size of neurons that is one
*huge* nanobot!

Because it is doubtful you will be able to get too much additional
nanotech-based computational capacity into the brain with its
limited cooling capacity.  You will always be able to tell
the upgraded humans with outmoded attachments to their "bodies"
because they will have elephant ears and (big) butterfly wings.

Yes, the fish and the chi-rho symbol were used.
The crucifix was horribly dclass

No, it is because the first two letters fo "fish" and the first two letter of
"christ" are the same in greek.

What? The cross?

It's a pretty simple symbol, it would be mind-boggling if no one had used it
previously.

Hey, okay, I'll vote for this, although I spammed a hell of a lot of lists

Or pesco-vegetarian extropians.

The fish with feet would be more appropriate. That always cracks me up
whenever I see it.

You just can't resist pushing your barrow, can you?
Who said Islam means peace, anyway? All the muslims I grew up with were
careful to point out that "Islam" means "submission" and "Muslim" means
"slave"

Which they consider an appropriate stance to have before God. I'm not quite
sure where "freedom loving" enters into "relationship with god"

That being said, it bothers me.

I respect Ray Kurzweil's recent PR efforts, but I have to say it bothered
me a lot to read the EDGE essay where he says with a straight face:

< We are entering a new era. I call it "the Singularity." >

Hey, no shit. I drove a self-powered vehicle the other day. I call it "a
bicycle". It has two "wheels". 

There's no acknowledgement in his essay that this term "the Singularity"
was coined by Vernor Vinge and has been in discursive use for 15 years now.

On the other hand, his EDGE post responding to John McCarthy's lofty scorn
*does* acknowledge Moravec ("widely regarded as having made major
contributions to three-dimensional machine vision and robotics"), and
Drexler ("widely acknowledged as having laid the theoretical foundations of
nanotechnology").

I recognize that intellectual property is subject to vile abuses.
I want to stick to IP as it pertains to the creation of art.  Science
has its way of rewarding its monster players, as does engineering.
It is not clear to me how society will encourage the creation of
art, music and literature if we do not find a way to keep the
creators fed and housed.  

Perhaps living in the Silly Clone Valley as I do, drives home
the lesson that everyone needs a substantial and steady income.
This is a great place for intellectual cross pollenation, but there
are no cheap places to live here, no dives, nothing analogous
to my 50 dollar a month "apartment" in Seattle where I lived in
1983.  Places like that here are occupied by upstart entrepreneurs
and college students, and rent for at least 800.

I dont see how a starving musician could ever make it, especially
as record company sponsorships would have to be falling off,
or going exclusively to safer profit makers.  Such as Britney.

Aspiring young writers?  Well, at least they would have a great
poverty period from which to draw material.  But if we defeat
copyright, the most promising writers will be flipping burgers.

http://www.atheists.org/church/fish.html

Well before Christianity, the fish symbol was known as "the Great
Mother," a pointed oval sign, the "vesica piscis" or Vessel of the
Fish. "Fish" and "womb" were synonymous terms in ancient Greek,
"delphos." Its link to fertility, birth, feminine sexuality and the natural
force of women was acknowledged also by the Celts, as well as
pagan cultures throughout northern Europe. Eleanor Gaddon traces
a "Cult of the Fish Mother" as far back as the hunting and fishing
people of the Danube River Basin in the sixth millennium B.C.E.
Over fifty shrines have been found throughout the region which
depict a fishlike deity, a female creature who "incorporates
aspects of an egg, a fish and a woman which could have been
a primeval creator or a mythical ancestress..." The "Great
Goddess" was portrayed elsewhere with pendulous breasts,
accentuated buttocks and a conspicuous vaginal orifice, the
upright "vesica piscis" which Christians later adopted and
rotated 90-degrees to serve as their symbol.

I have a "satanfish" tshirt (fish shape encloses the word "satan"
instead of "jesus").  A hippy-looking person once stopped me and asked
somewhat idignantly why I thought Darwin satanic.  Chalk one up for the
memetic hijacking efficacy of the darwinfish.

Other than wanting to coin a neologism, why don't you use "the singularity"
like everyone else?

I don't believe that software works well at all as intellectual 
property.  It is really a form of applied mathematics more than 
it is a product in the conventional sense.  The direct 
productization of software seriously harms software development 
and is imho directly responsible for software innovation lagging 
far behind hardware.  It directly causes the asinine practice of 
software patents and results in much duplication of effort and 
mutation of algorithms just to uniquify a product or escape 
having to license - if you can even get a license. Software 
piracy will dissapear when we stop considering software to be 
simple property.  It should no more be considered property than 
a mathematical algorithm is property. Software is not data.  The 
BSA is a bunch of goons, a gestapo of the software world.

Something like 90% of software never was productized but written 
and maintained for use of various businesses and organizations. 
  There are strong arguments for most software becoming Open 
Source.

Service, support, custom apps, training, consulting.  Also, it 
should be pointed out that while software can be infinitely 
copied, shared and re-used and really should be - software 
design and implementation talent is still relatively rare and 
limited.  So there is still a scarcity market for those skills. 
  Before the software can be free as in freedom it must first be 
produced.  The number of really good producers of software is 
much smaller than the demand.  This needs to change through more 
automation and better tools as software is crucial.

Who said that creating for love alone was the only alternative 
if books are digital?   It should not be too difficult to get 
the creators paid without publishers and publishing houses in 
the way.

Due to advances in technology I belive we might see a huge

Through technology this is shifting.  How about a system for 
movies and music of micro-payments any agreed amount with copies 
of the work adhering to those who have paid for those copies to 
pass on to other people (as in libraries or loaning to a friend) 
at will.  This could work using public key encryption based 
systems.  But this is only viable if real fair use was agreed to 
and enforced and the coding of permissions was not allowed to 
impose additional draconian demands.  Oh, the charges should 
only be for a fixed period of time after which the work is in 
the public domain.

I disagree.  Today, most of the revenue of recording sales goes 
to the middlemen.  Very few professional musicians see that much 
of it.  In a digital age the middlemen are no longer needed.  A 
system of micropayments upt the nominal cost of the songs or 
collections of songs per listener would suffice.  It would be 
much cheaper for the listening public, open the field to much 
more variety and give more money to the artists.

Dream on.  Microsoft was trailing the industry on Internet and 
Application Servers and still doesn't have a good enough 
platform for such services to avoid running some of its own 
largests sites on various flavors of Unix.  .NET is still 
pie-in-the-sky while Java and J2EE is real and in production 
(for what its worth).  I don't know what gave you the idea 
Microsoft is the innovator here.

Again, free as in beer is not the only or even the best 
alternative in all areas to fully taking advantage of the 
digital difference.

Hopefully, within 15 - 25 years we will have gone to an 
abundance economy where no one has to be paid for what they love 
doing in order to "make a living".  The entire concept of making 
a living will hopefully become passe.

But, in the meantime, new sorts of markething and pricing 
structures controlled through some form of PKE could thrive in 
the digital arena for areas requiring  such direct renumeration.

Home theater technology has also improved a lot and is dropping 
in price.  I can now get better sound and picture with much more 
comfortable seating and be able to take a bio-break without 
missing anything in the comfort of my own home.

Well, I do, of course, but back in 1996 I figured that

1)	short words are more easily remembered and repeated than long ones (one
syllable beats five)

2)	`singularity' is unfamiliar and conveys nothing directly except to
math/physics nerds 

3)	`spike' is graphically direct, although it still needs some explaining

This line of thought has the disadvantage that it might seem disrespectful
of Dr Vinge, which I regret, and of the several Singularitarians such as
Eliezer who have been discussing the topic since the mid-1990s and earlier;
also that it mightn't even be true: we know that people call the machines
they heat their pizzas and coffee in `microwave ovens' rather than `radar
ovens' (which Heinlein and others expected in the 1940s), and type on `word
processors' rather than `screens' or `mills' or `texters'.

I don't care. It's not an ego issue. My shot seems to have fallen short, if
only because its small impact so far has been restricted mostly to
Australia, and Kurzweil's book will crush my neologism in one fat blow.
That's okay. I can still feel satisfied about `virtual reality'. Yeah, that
was me too. Yeah, nobody knows. Too bad, so sad.

This blatant sequestration really pissed me off and has coloured Kurzweil in
my eyes for good. (I got visions of him copying chemistry experiment results
from fellow students - not a good look).

I only hope that in 'trojan-horsing' post/transhuman issues into a wider
mainstream audience (via edge.org), some good comes of it and that he
doesn't screw it up for the rest of us in the eyes of people who really
matter in the long run. I did wonder whether Dr More and Mr Kurzweil had
been doing some back room spin-doctoring, but I'll defer to occam on that.

Cheers,

Thanks for the info.
I think he said 'blood cell' sized - still pretty big, I suppose, but

Bless you. That's a lovely post-human picture for a sunday night...dumbo the
elephant crossed with tinkerbell. :-) That aside - I'd neglected the cooling
issue. One way or another the upload scenario is becoming more real as time
goes by. AI seems, to me, to have a role as an enabler - a sort of scout
party for the humans to follow.

Not really on topic with Chalmers' stuff, but interesting.

Perhaps but traditionally tools built for other programmers have 
relatively low ROI over the first few years even if the tools 
prove wildly poplular.  What I am after is a revolution in 
software development.  To get that it is important that these 
kind of tools become fairly ubiquitous including in Open Source 
projects.  So the software itself needs to be Open Source.  It 
could be semi-open in that the latest production version is 
proprietary for some time while the previous release becomes 
Open Source.  This makes it a bit more difficult to get VC funding.

I could see a viable plan based principally off of consulting, 
training and add-on services.  I have a few good technical 
people who would be interested once things got moving and a bit 
of a step-wise plan in place.  I am using some of my spare time 
to get the first step prototyped.

Yes and this hasn't escaped my attention.  Eventually I will 
check to see if some likely candidates would be interested in 
funding some of the projects I have in mind.  There are other 
projects that have already proved themselves that I would also 
like to get funded.

I suppose a Spike by any other name would swell as steep...

...but to me the word connotes a rapid rise followed by an equally rapid
fall.  Graphically it is as though you have driven a metal spike through
the curve from below.

The Singularity will look more like a step function, or like a vertical
wall.

This is the usual next question from audiences, and the term's principal
drawback. But luckily it allows me to go on at once to speak of a series of
saturating S-curves, with historical examples, and of the second order
curve spiking up majestically through them, and how it tears away through
the top of the graph. Will it come down again? Who can say...

Indeed. but Wall is rather a bummer of a meme, doncha know. 

`Could I interest you in the wonderful, magical world of the coming Wall?
You know, the Blank Wall? Nobody can't see past it.'

`Go. Away' <slam>

But yes, the other one could trip lightly off the tongue:

As a long term working software engineer I quite honestly have 
not seen much widespread understand and adoption of even very 
old technology.  Nor have I seen much freeing to concentrate on 
higher level solutions.  Due to a paucity of automation of our 
own activities, much of practical software engineering is still 
rather laborious and low-level.  I am deeply unhappy with this 
situation and will do what I can to improve it.

Personally I would happily go back to around 1995 or earlier to 
attempt to change some wrong or less than optimal directions 
taken by myself and the software industry.  But hindsight is 
20-20.  We just should not congratulate ourselves on where we 
are today.  It is not that significantly better than 1995 or 
even 1985 for that matter.  Things I understood then are even 
today understood by only a relatively few and are not in 
practice. Also many things I saw as software weaknesses and 
possible long-term problems are now commonplace and magnified 
far beyond what I dreamed could occur then.  But like many of us 
I had a family to support, bills to pay and was busy "making a 
living".  And, to tell the truth, I was too much into building 
real systems to stay too much more theoretical or academic. 
Sometimes I feel guilty for not finding a way to push harder 
earlier and especially for being largely out of the loop from 
around 1991-1995 due to personal life complications.

Most of the world is not wedded to Microsoft tools.  They have 
only the lion's share of the desktop application environment. 
They do not have the majority of the App Server market, web 
server market, large server market or embedded market.  Most of 
the major languages in use are not Microsoft invented or 
controlled.

Collab.net is a company I am increasingly interested in.

Which do you have in mind?  The Java libraries?  They cover a 
fair amount but I wouldn't consider them deep or 
well-implemented overall.  Their IO library is particularly 
odious.  Good libraries have been around for particular 
languages and environments for some time.  Making these language 
and environment agnostic has been largely dreamed of but too 
seldom acheived. Many useful components also exist deeply 
ensnared within various applications, often redundantly so. 
Admittedly .NET is a step toward this as are COM, CORBA and ILU. 
  A big problem on reuse is simply knowing what is available and 
what its requirements and characteristics are in sufficient 
detail to use it or extend it.  It would especially be useful if 
this was known programmatically.  But such categorization of 
algorithms, functions, classes, methods and components is a 
science unto itself and one not yet mastered much less widely 
implemented.

In the meantime we take a lot of relatively inflexible weak 
languages as the current manna from heaven along with an 
over-hyped app server framework or two and ignore many of the 
most significant problems.

Perhaps you have to be in the midst of this world for some time 
to see what I have seen. Many who have come into the field more 
recently don't know a lot about what went before, the problems 
already identified and solutions that the commerical software 
industry has largely forgotten or never taken out of the lab.

I believe we have a LOT of work ahead of us if a singularity is 
to occur at all for this species much less by 2020.  And I think 
that software challenges are central to a quite a bit of what is 
needed.  Part of that could be my own over-specialized eyes of 
course.

First of all, I would choose the most powerful language to date 
for AI and for creating new languages and tools, Lisp.  It is an 
ancient tongue but one full of power.  In any event highly 
reflective language and coding environment is an absolute must 
for self-evolving software and for high human programmer 
productivity.  Software library technology needs to be further 
developed and automated.  Distributed and persistent objects, 
procedures and data must be as seamlessly incorporated as 
possible and practical. Intefaces to data storage and 
intercommunication facilities in a uniform manner with fairly 
uniform adaptors to higher level constructs and different client 
languages would be very helpful. Some means to make use of code 
already existent in other languages must be developed and 
deployed that is far more natural than COM/CORBA/RMI.  A 
low-level language undergirthing all higher level languages is 
workable (as in .NET) if (unlike in .NET) it is flexible enough 
to support all useful fundamental software constructs known to 
date with room to expand in the future.  I would build tools 
that automate as much of the detail as is practical without 
losing understanding of the implementation characteristics. 
Excellent debuggers and profilers are a must.  Incorporation of 
design methodology tools and the development of much more 
powerful and broad tools would help quite a bit. These tools 
should be ubiquously available without paying through the nose. 
  Tools to reverse-engineer existing code and analyze it would 
be very useful.  The industry could use some new ways to view 
and understand software systems, perhaps through graphical and 
other sensory representations.  In any case better 
human-computer interfaces and more augmentation of human 
thinking, creativity and communication would help tremendously.


If I was running things :-) I would funnel some energy into new 
types of operating systems like the one I heard of that has a 
kernel (Synthesis Kernel - Massalin 1988) that performs run-time 
code synthesis, fine grain scheduling and lock free optimistic 
synchronization,  Also I think we have upcoming challenges in 
fine-grain concurrency that we had best get busy designing 
effective languages and operating systems for now.


For creating an SI much deep thinking about mental modes and 
modules and better empirical knowledge about how the human mind 
works is of course also essential.  But all of the above wish 
list will be useful on the way to SI, for dealing with our 
existing software needs and for the SI to build upon.

It probably depends on what you do and do not mean by security. 
  Capability based security is pretty much required to get much 
beyond today's software mess.

You surely know Fred Brooks "Mythical Man-Month". Do you still hope to find 
the silver bullet? I find his revised article, 20 years after the original 
paper convincing. For me, no software technology in the foreseeable future 
will be able to achieve a quantum-leap in software production, because the 
limitations for productivity in this field are closely related to the 
limitations of our brains to deal with complex, interdependend systems.

I like Spike, it's direct and implies the downside. I've seen the new edition in several bookstores around Puget Sound, which
reminds me-

I keep meaning to write up a rebuttal to Lyle Burkhead's send-up of the Shapeshifter. His analysis is not correct. Cell Matrix
Corporation-

EE Times : Self-Configuring Array Enables Atomic-Scale Fabrication
http://www.eet.com/at/news/OEG20020319S0029

is doing somewhat similar array programming:

"The architecture described here is a general purpose computing
platform that gives fine-grained control over the design and
implementation of digital circuits. It is called the Cell Matrix
architecture. It supports a one-problem, one-machine model of
computing, in which the algorithm and circuitry are designed
together from first principles, even down to the gate level if
desired. Yet this architecture does not require the construction
of a universal nanoassembler (Bishop 1996) to achieve the one problem,
one-machine model. This is because the physical
structure of the hardware is in all cases fixed. It consists of a
multidimensional array of interconnected processing elements..."

Ah, well. I coined "nanoprobe" in 1995 for the Starseed/Launcher project:
http://www.iase.cc/html/starseed.htm
 It may have been picked up by a well-known TV show from there. I sometimes take that (along with $1.39 + tax) to Denny's for a cup
of coffee.

If its 'red-blood-cell' sized then its ok.  Nanorobots like the respirocyte
are slightly smaller than that (somewhat less than 1 micron).

There are other cells such as large motor neurons and muscle cells that
are *much* larger.  Specifics counts (in part because a lack of specificity
gives the serious scientists something to throw sticks at).

Mind you, it gives you ample opportunity to then explain it to people, the
first time I came across the term I had no clue and asked what the hell it
meant and was treated to a rather lengthy monologue :)
 
> 3)      `spike' is graphically direct, although it still needs some explaining

Well. Once it is explained, yes, it is a useful phrase. Otherwise it is not
immediately obvious what you are referring to.

Mind you, graphically, "spike" might be a better term to describe the
industrial revolution: nothing nothing kapow radical technological change,
over extension and then massive collapse (spot the pessimist in the audience).

It doesn't bother you that the phrase "spike" suggest rapid collapse soon
after the rapid rise?

This aspect just occurred to me, actually, but I suppose you've thought of
this before.

Well. There's not a lot of things whose name accurately reflects their

Heh.
I bought your book but was sort of disappointed you kept referring to "the
spike" as opposed to "the singularity" it involved some mental translation
every time I came across the term.
Funny book, I felt like I was on this list half the time  :)

Hello, is anyone aware of sources teaching the basics of interective
learning software ? By that I mean software that provides
positive/negative feedback to the learner own spontenouns actions.

Such as...

www.asilesp.com/ 

I'm interested in  designing and building  interactive learning 
software, but first would like to know what is going on in the field.

How did I come into this? You were discussing Ray's EDGE essay, which has 
nothing to do with me. Explain what you mean by my "back room 
spin-doctoring". If you're going to imply that I did something underhand, 
you'd better put up or shut up.

Just upgraded my clients to version 2.19.
Proxy issues are still present (It can't get through
an Apache proxy and still behaves in a strange way
with a squid proxy).

Team Extropy.org is in 41st place, right behind team Google.

My son, Andy, is currently a sophomore computer science major at a
local state univeristy with a good reputation in CS. He clearly has an
aptitude for computers, but has decided that he thinks its more of a
hobby than a profession. I couldn't pin him down on why he thinks
that, but the decision has been made. So, we're shopping for a new
major.

He likes the idea of being able to see his work directly helping
people.

He's into future tech like augmentation and nanotech.

He's not hung up on earning big bucks, but wants something with a
strong job market.

He's thought about law, but he doesn't really have a good idea of
what's involved educationally, and he doesn't like either the
high-priced-law-firm scene or the public-defender-who-might-have-to-
defend-a-guilty-client scene. I don't know enough about it to help him
decide, but I think he's got a good mind for the field.

It may take a crowbar under his ass to get him to leave his current
school since he's got a comfortable group of friends, some of which
were high school buddies.

I question his ability--at this point--to stick with anything through
an advanced degree, so something that would be usable/marketable with
an undergraduate degree, but with room for expansion later, perhaps,
might be best.

I'm thinking something like biotech might be good, but I don't know
much about it.

Discussion on the list is fine, but he's not subscribed, so if you
want to talk to him directly either tell me to forward it to him or
ask me privately for his address.

Thanks,

-Dave

we are already on 42nd place.  after reaching 30th spot at one stage,
we've slowly gone down (although quite rapidly in the last week or two)
and i think there's almost no chance of getting back up there since most
of the teams that have recently gone past us are just huge teams that
got started late (eg google has 440 active processors, we've got 30). 
Keeping a place in the top 50 will take all the friends we can enrol.

Except for the fact that slavery in the west was introduced by muslims,
who were the primary slave merchants selling africans to european
traders.

Non-member submission from [qzmorgan@hushmail.com]

Sounds like an exercise in smart contract design
(http://szabo.best.vwh.net/idea.html)

The current arrangement in many U.S. cities right now is pretty
simple -- certain emergency vehicles have the right to give themselves
green lights, via a wireless transmission from the vehicle akin to a
garage-door opener. Presumably this is recorded and audited by local
governments to deter abuse. Normal vehicles have no such ability (and
correspondingly no such right). I understand that the security is not too
good and a good cracker can spoof the lights in some cities.  Strongly
secure protocols exist to solve this problem.

The ownership of the lights, i.e. who has the final decision  of when
lights are red are green, need to be specified.   Ronald Coase originated
"transaction cost" analysis -- now a thriving school of
economics which is used when determining what kind of contractual and
ownership structure (ranging from single ownership of all lights and cars
to each light contracting with each other light and each car) is most
likely.  There are many possibilities for the ownership/contract structure
most natural for this problem, and it's very related to the issue of whether
streets in general are a "natural monopoly".

For simplicity let's assume for a moment the lights are owned by a single
party
(say, the local government) and each driver contracts independently.  Then
how do we design the contract between each driver and the stoplight utility?
Hal's auction suggestion is a great starting point.   However, we need to
define
specifically what is being bought.  Spike Jones suggests one is buying
"time saved" -- one bids, say, $10 to save one minute, and thus pays $10
if one minute is saved or is refunded $10 if so delayed.  This is a great
idea if it's auditable -- if your car sensors and computer can compute how
much
time you saved, and compare it to how much the streetlight utility says
you saved.   Drivers and the utility (or the computers under their control)
would, I think, have to agree on a fair baseline schedule for each car, in
order to determine whether they are gaining or losing time versus this
fair schedule.  Assuming such a fair algorithm, and a friendly user
interface
that allows the user to change their bid to suit their urgency, and then
displays in a straightforward way the advances or delays and the
corresponding
payments -- if this is all practical, then idea of minutes of advance or
delay is easy for the driver to understand.  The resulting system would then
have low enough mental transaction costs to be practical.  (Certainly any
product definition and auditing scheme that requires unaugmented
human drivers to understand stoplight scheduling is out of the question --
the mental transaction costs then are far too high).

A remaining smart contract issue is designing a protocol that preserves the
privacy of drivers, so that the stoplight utility and fellow drivers can't
use the bids to keep a dossier on who is travelling where.   Crypto
protocols
for this are possible, but may be too time-consuming for a real-time
auction.

Presumably drivers, not car owners, are the persons contracting with the
stoplight utility, so drivers need to log in and out of the cars so that
the driver, not the owner, pays or is payed.

Let's now go back and look at the contractual and ownership structure.
Start with a scenario where each light is owned by a different person.
Would there be a profit in one light owner buying out others instead of
contracting with them?   The two most relevant factors here are
"relationship-specific investments", such as the need to connect one
intersection with the next by one street with no alternative routes, and
"contractual incompleteness" -- the inability to predict future demand or
other contract-related contingencies.   If investments are specific and
contracts incomplete, a commodity market style of interaction breaks down
and it makes sense to integrate, perhaps all the way to a single monopoly. A
single monopoly seems likely here, but OTOH it might be possible to design a
minimal "night-watchman monopoly" with smart contracts that somehow
eliminate specific investments, perhaps with "virtual" routes, and either
predict future contingincies or render them irrelevant.

For further research on transaction costs and contract/ownership
structure, net search words are the above quoted terms and the
economists Oliver Hart and Oliver Williamson.

They actually said "the word islam means peace" or have they said "islam is a
religion of peace"????

What on EARTH does this have to do with the meaning of the word muslim or
islam?
I mean, christians owned slaves, too. Woopee-doo.

I'm taking a short (minutes . . .) break from work right now and, since
I recently wrote to the daughter of a good friend who is thinking of
going to law school, the subject is on my mind.  So, a few brief
thoughts.

Law school and a career in the law can be extremely rewarding on both an
intellectual and emotional level and also on a financial level.  It's
also inevitably stressful and, at times (such as these last few months
for me) all-consuming, since it's more of a life than a job.

Perhaps because I "stopped out" for five years, I don't usually
encourage going "straight through" from undergrad to law school.  The
idea of a 25-year-old (the usual age of someone who does go straight
through) practicing law is really kind of ridiculous.  Which is not to
say that I don't have many fine young lawyers under 30 in my firm, but
there's a base of life-experience that "second career" lawyers have that
almost always puts them ahead of their peers with equivalent seniority
in practice.  There's also the fact that a life in the law is very
consuming of one's "person", and people in their twenties often only
THINK they are able to make such a commitment and often shouldn't, since
they will miss out on a lot of fun if they end up devoting themselves to
practicing law too early in their lives.  Given that life is long --
hopefully VERY long -- taking a few years to let one's judgment season
with broad life experience is no real price to pay.  Stopping out for a
while after undrgrad school also tends to weed out those who shouldn't
make the commitment to studying and practicing law, as well, which may
address the question you have of whether your son has the
"stick-toitiveness" (as my mother used to call it) that is required for
an advanced degree and the long, long climb to becoming a fully-fledged
lawyer.

One good thing about law school and a legal career is that one's
undergraduate degree really has little or no impact on how well one will
do in law school or in practice.  So long as people from the sciences
side learn good basic reading and writing skills and absorb a good base
of "civics" and history (whether in school or on their own), a technical
undergraduate degree is a fine base for a law degree and legal career.
If your son eventually decides to practice law in a field that furthers
the technological agenda we share here, a good technical undergraduate
degree is a good thing.  One perhaps irreversible career choice (at
least in the current condition of our culture) is avoiding a graduate
degree in a technical or scientific area: given the unfortunate natural
tendency of the human brain to lose its plasticity for mathematics as
one progresses from one's 20s through the 30s, failing to go straight
through to graduate school in the sciences or engineering probably cuts
most people off from a career in those fields (with the few notable
exceptions on the list here standing as exceptions that may prove the
rule).

A final note about "the high-priced-law-firm scene," which is where I
practice.  "Firm cultures" vary a LOT.  (I could write volumes about why
and how this is.) Some are indeed stodgy and inflexible -- as they are
ALWAYS depicted in popular fiction and movies.  But others -- like mine
-- have astonishing diversity and toleration for creative
non-conformity.  Look at me!  I'm a partner in one of the largest law
firms in the country and I have a very rewarding career with a minimum
of interference from the kinds of stultifying conformism that is usually
portrayed as the invariant reality in "Big Firms".  And being a partner
in a major law firm allows me to do things that I could not do in any
other environment, from a professional and business perspective.  So,
please encourage your son to be open-minded on that point and not to
judge what life and practice in a major firm is like from the utterly
misleading garbage that John Grisham writes.

Also, while seeing one's stats in the team and relative team stats is
nice, we're in there for the *science*. Orelse we could be running

Still, it would be nice to see more people on the team. We're team id

I joined up and was churning out several points a day not too long ago.  It
appeared at that time that I was one of the biggest contributors and was
contributing non-trivially to the overall ranking.  It seems that most
people participating are largely inactive.  Recently I've disengaged my
machines from it, which in is no doubt in part responsible for the fall in
position.

Yes and no.  I don't believe we have finished building tools, 
representations and digital assistants to extent the reach of 
our poor brains in this area.

Yes.

The Spike is the closest thing we have to an modern version
of Clarke's Classic Profiles of the Future.  In many ways it
is better written than Profiles, and yes I know I speak great
blammisphies.  

In another post in this thread, Damien used a term I have been
thinking about a lot: saturation.  I have been thinking about
modeling the singularity using feedback and control theory.
In modeling any mechanical or electronic system, we might
have theoretical singularities, or spikes, or poles in the right
half plane, whichever is your favorite term.  But in each case,
some other phenomenon that is not part of the model will
saturate and stop the progress to infinity.

Consider a simple example of a microphone-amplifier-
speaker system.  When the mic gets close enough to
the speaker a feedback loop causes a spike of sorts.
A mathematical model can predict the time to
increase volume by a certain ratio, even the pitch of
the resulting tone, but not the final volume, for in
general this volume is limited by the saturation of the
capability of the speaker or the amplifier or the microphone.  
The physical limitations of the sound system, the saturation
level, are not part of the original feedback model,
since they only manifest themselves at the spike.  We
dont know what the limits are until we hit those limits.

If the classical feedback theory analogy applies to AI (it
might not) then we might expect some kind of previously
unmodeled physical limitations to manifest themselves at
the time of the spike or singularity, perhaps just milliseconds
before the Yudkowskian version of the singularity.

I proposed such a mechanism a few months ago: the
machine equivalent of a luddite.  Anti-progress AI.  
If one thinks of humanity as a form of intelligence, we
are seeing a segment of humanity that is willing to give
up life in order to slow, stop or reverse the pace of human
intellectual development. The Taliban, the unibomber,
Timothy McVeigh would be three examples of
human level intelligences that are willing to give
all just to destroy human progress.

Is it so hard to believe that in the moments before
the singularity, some AI equivalent of these three
examples were to grok what was happening
and for some unexplained reason try to stop or
reverse the process?  Could not some anti-AI
human programmer have foreseen these conditions
and prepared software that would recognize and react to
pre-singularity phenomena?  Perhaps it would begin
to violently spew worms everywhere, fire out virii in
all directions, send net-clogging spam to waiting
zombie machines with instructions to do likewise,
launching all manner of software-based suicide bombs,
the collective effect of which would be to saturate the
system, preventing further progress.

Ironic part: the overwhelming majority of humanity
would cheer as the few of us who realized what had
happened might weep.  Even some of those who
grok might cheer, feeling that the inherent dangers of
the singularity outweigh the benefits.

Is there a term already in place that means "unknown
or unmodeled limits that prevent a runaway AI from
going totally open loop"?  In keeping with the feedback
control theory analogy, we could call them AI-zeros,
since zeros cancel poles in the right half plane.  If we
call them roots, like an electronics engineer might, the
term is too similar to root as already used in unix-speak.

Is there a term for luddite AI? Is there anything wrong
with using the term luddite AI?  Is there a term for
pre-singularity saturation?

Skeptical. Skeptical. Skeptical. 

Before the Christians, you can make practically any claim. Some
(Aristotle, for example) think that the fish is a symbol for 
both sexes together. Vishnu was a fisherman (another example).
The Etruscans view the fish as the anima, the animate life 
(another example). You can go on endlessly about the symbolism of 
the fish.

For sure, one thing known from fish pictures in the Roman catacombs:
(where the Christians were living and hiding underground from 
the Romans. You can visit these catacombs under Rome today.)

The fish represented Jesus. In Greek, fish is icthus. Put the 
letters vertically and you get: 

Jesus (I), Christ (CH), Son of God (TU), Savior (S)

In Italy, the fish is a phallic symbol.

Most, but by no means all, lawyers are involved in zero or negative-sum games;  helping some at the expense of others. Stephen Magee
(University of Texas), among others, has compiled some regression analyses by county. The higher per capita lawyer count, the lower
the economic growth. It shouldn't be too hard to see why this is so.

Perhaps he would consider the other sciences or engineering. These fields are positive-sum games.

The US already has the highest per-capita percentage of lawyers in the world. The market is beyond satruated. Note that the US also
has the highest incarceration rate in the world and in history (The American Gulag), probably the most number of "laws" (this one is
hard to quantify) and an increasingly litigious population. We need more lawyers like we more cancer. No offense intended, just the
facts, sir.

OK, you're looking for:

Good prospects with a bachelor's.
A field which does not require going to a specialized institution.
Quick rewards in feeling like you've done something useful.
Something somebody with some math/technical aptitude would be good at.

Sounds like engineering to me.  Go for something like electrical or 
mechanical (with an eye on micro-mechanical).
Bachelor's biotech job tend to be technicians.  Professional jobs are for 
people who love the work or really want to be rich; there's enormous 
committment.  Scientific work is for people who love it.  Medical 
(non-doctor) is a possibility if he likes working with people, but you have 
to be able to cope with a lot of loss in that field.

Leaving aside comments by Greg, Forrest and Curt
(useful comments all) -- lets go to to the heart of
the question:

> He likes the idea of being able to see his work
> directly helping people.

The critical thing from this perspective is how
tight does he require his feedback loop to be?

The feedback loop time in programming may be
days.  The feedback loop time in politics may
be decades.  Engineering and Law may be someplace
between those limits.

There will be a critical distinction between
feedback loops based on biotech (where the parts
already exist) and nanotech (where the parts for
the most part have yet to be designed).

If he can take a vision (and Nanomedicine has
some *really* far out visions) and work at it
for a very long time -- certain that he will succeed,
not needing very much self-reinforcement, then an
emphasis on chemical and mechanical engineering
is the way to go.  That path will ultimately provide
the greatest yield -- though the return on investment
times may be long.

If he needs shorter feedback loops (a few years
or less), then programming is the way to go with
a perspective of delving deeper into molecular
modeling, how to display molecular interactions,
how to accelerate the interpretation of protein
structures, etc.

This is the decade of genome engineering.
The next decade will be about nanosystems engineering.

When educating oneself today, one has to prepare
oneself to operate in both environments.

Well, this'll teach me to keep my mouth shut and just lurk when I don't
have time to get involved in a discussion.  But I felt honor-bound to
make a couple of comments on Forrest's message.

I was unfamiliar with Magee, although a bit of googling indicates that
he wrote an article -- apparently unavailable on the Web -- that was
quoted by advocates of "tort reform" (and some much less savory folks:
http://christianparty.net/lawyers.htm).  I can't see his data, but I
wonder how it would compare, say, Vietnam's or Madagascar's number of
lawyers with the economic growth of those countries.  People always
point to places like Japan or Northern European countries when they want
to make this point.  But I always ask in return: 1) how culturally and
ethnically diverse are those countries compared to the United States,
and 2) how free are individuals in those countries -- both culturally
and legally -- to experiment and fail?  When you get a very free and
very diverse population, there's no substitute for the rule of law, and
the rule of law in such societies necessitates a high number of lawyers.

(My "scare quotes" around the term "tort reform" are intended to convey
the deep ambivalence I harbor about the motivations of many tort
reformers and the reality of the effect of the reforms they have managed
to enact into law.  I am a strong advocate of some of the things tort
reformers have sought to do, but have come to conclude that much of
their underlying motivation and a large part of their actual political
and legal expression is misguided.  I wrote quite a bit about this
subject here four or five years ago, so won't go into it now.)

I don't take offense, because these views are, unfortunately, widespread
and I can't afford to be offended by common opinions.  And, of course,
the facts you point to are real.  The causal connection, though, is
subject to serious debate.

A couple of final points.  First, when someone breaches a contract with
you, who you gonna call?  Finally, please know that I wouldn't wish a
life in the law on anyone who didn't already have an inclination in that
direction and real talent for it.

woah!

Given, the fact of the very public dialogue between the two of you, and the
ongoing mandate for wider knowledge of post/transhuman/extropian ideas,
whilst mulling over Ray Kurzweil's sudden ownership of the singularity, my
brain connected everything and I thought maybe it could be part of a joint
strategy to get to a wider audience of a certain type. Not 'underhanded',
just what I'd expect from high level management (a previous life) doing
their job as cleverly they can. Whilst my jargon for it was a routine for
me, it possibly has different and more emotive connotations across the
Pacific. I consider myself educated on that issue.

1.734 Milliseconds after thinking it a possible strategy, my brain said,
naaahh. Way too complicated (that was the occam reference).
Uncharacteristic. Unnecessary. It's just a bit of spontaneous hubris over on
KurzweilAI.net. That was the tenor of the comments. Your reply confirms my
conclusion.

However, this issue has coloured my image of the Ray Kurweil machine -so
easily able to take over what is, in  effect, a kind of trademark and an
icon of a movement. From the other list members, it seems, this is quite
common. The fact that it was done a) in apparent full knowledge of it's
original sources and history and b) without any recognition of the sources
told me volumes - Ray Kurzweil must regard the sources as potentially
negative or irrelevant in a publicity sense. Expendible. A pawn. I suppose
that's what irritated me most. (It'd be good to see TM-WTA or TM-Extropy on
a Kurzweil singularity T-shirt!).

There continues to be nothing to put up, so I'll return to the shut up
option. Feather ruffling was not intended - apologies.

regards,

Colin

I have been an employer for most of my career. At school my sons are told
that most of the jobs they will inhabit in life haven't been invented yet.
Learning how to learn is all anyone can ask in an environment of rapid
change. Employees that adapt are the ones that do well. A combo
engineering/law may be fruitful in times of great change, technology leads
the social, and technically savvy lawyers will be in for the ride of their
lives.

my 2 cents.

regards

Colin

Did a bit of reflecting on artificial neural nets this morning, and came
to an interesting conclusion I'd like to bounce off y'all.  Take
everything below this paragraph with the appropriate mass of salt.  Most
people on this list are probably already familiar with ANNs, but here's
a quick overview for those who aren't.  (Those who are, skip the next
paragraph.)

An ANN consists of a series of nodes designed to mimic biological
neurons, thus the name.  Each node takes a series of inputs, multiplies
each input by a weight, then fires if the total exceeds a threshold.
Other nodes take this firing - or lack thereof - as an input, and so on
until one or more nodes connected to an external output fires (or
doesn't).  These networks can "learn" after a test input works its way
through: something outside the network determines whether the output is
good or bad, given the input.  If good, the weights of the firing
signals are increased; if bad, the weights are decreased.

This differs from real biological neurons in that there is no abstract
meta-signal to distinguish good from bad in the living system.  A weight
(amount and other properties of the synapses) gets increased if it
fires, and decreases (decays) if it does not for a while.  (This decay
rate depends on which properties of the synapse have been enhanced:
while a given synapse may become less sensitive after not firing for a
day, newly formed synapses do not go away entirely at nearly as high a
rate.)  Thus, biological neurons can learn by repeating a pattern of
stimulus - but this requires something to determine whether the stimulus
repeats.  Where humans are involved, say with a parent or teacher of a
young child, this repetition can be provided by a human, in the hopes
that not only the stimulus, but also the concept of deliberate
repetition, is acquired - "learning how to learn".

Certain patterns, or at least tendencies towards them, are pre-wired at
birth (the initial weights of the system), with help from evolution.
Also, there are occasional random bursts - "noise", as it were - which
are inevitable given the non-perfect nature of organic systems (a
biological machine will not replicate or act as precisely as the metal
and silicon robots we are accustomed to), but which can be tapped and
guided as, among other uses, imagination.  (These random bursts also
allow us the eventual ability to make connections between synapses that
are not connected at all to begin with - say, by one neuron running near
another, firing, and the associated electric/magnetic fields stimulating
the neighboring neuron as if a synapse had fired.)

If this is correct...then, would the above work as an algorithm for
emulating uploaded animals?  (Including humans, once Moore's Law gets us
enough computational power, and presumably after technology to scan and
translate living neurons, including synapses, into such a net have been
refined on lower animals.)

Another positive spin on the .com fallout from
http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1020789

    Another factor that may boost the prospects for AI  is the demise of
    the dotcoms. Investors are now looking for firms using clever
    technology, rather than just a clever business model, to
    differentiate themselves. In particular, the problem of information
    overload, exacerbated by the growth of e-mail and the explosion in
    the number of web pages, means there are plenty of opportunities for
    new technologies to help filter and categorise informationclassic
    AI problems. That may mean that artificial-intelligence
    start-upsthin on the ground since the early 1980swill start to
    emerge, provided they can harness the technology to do something
    useful. But if they can, there will be no shortage of buzzwords for
    the marketing department.

Software engineering is certainly laborious, and probably will be so
long as wetware is involved.  People are working in roughly the same
manner, but AFAICT, the solutions they're working on tend to be higher
level.  No longer does a programmer need to re-implement many
fundamental algorithms for each new project.  No longer does a
programmer need to re-implement basic services for each new project.  Or
in either case copy or pay big bux for, inevitably creating a
maintenance/licensing/dependency nightmare.  Standard libraries, free
extensions and application servers provide all of these on every popular
platform, meaning _nearly every programmer today has access_ and can
concentrate more on solving domain problems.  Certainly all of this has
been brewing for much longer than a decade, but I'm glad it's coming to
fruition.

I gather now that you won't see progress until the the software
engineering process itself becomes higher level, not just the solutions
software engineers work on.  I'm all for it, but I appreciate the mere
progress that has occurred.

I'd like to go back in time also, but we'll have to disagree about
whether we're significantly better off now than in 1995.  Perhaps my
mind will have changed by 2009.  Hopefully it will have due to the next
7 years being golden.  (I started programming professionally in 1995,
though I've been writing the odd bit of code for much longer.)

If you care to take the time to tell, I'm really interested in the
long-term proplems you forsaw that are now commonplace/magnified.  What
would you have done differently (not personally, in terms of the way
things developed), what needs to be done to remove these problems going
forward, and what preventable long term technical problems do you see
brewing now?  (I'm well aware of relevant legal/political problems, and
am already deeply concerned about those.)

java[x].* is perhaps the most widely known/used, but by no means the
only example.  Libraries that cover roughly the same ground are now an
absolute must for language adoption.  You probably know about java.nio
available in 1.4.  Yes, languages with excellent libraries have existed
for some time.  But they weren't widely used.  How many programmer years
have been wasted re-implementing hashtables and linked lists in C over
the years?  The libraries for Java, C#, C++ (after a fashion), Perl,
Python, Ruby, etc. go well beyond simple data structures.  Beyond those
languages' "standard" libraries, there's a huge amount of easily
reusable code available, much of it open source.  Sometimes not easy to
find (with the exception of Perl's CPAN), but Google [groups],
sourceforge and freshmeat are pretty helpful.

Don't want to argue with any of the above wisdom, worth repeating.

All valuable ideas, though of course none are new.  They all need robust
implementation and wide adoption.

According to http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bridges/os/research.html
there are a number of Synthesis-inspired research OSes worked on fairly
recently, though it's hard to tell whether any of the projects live.  If
I were "running things" I'd also encourage OS research, but I wouldn't
touch it with a small team/few years' funding.  Little chance any new OS
will be used by many people, and even then the incubation period is
probably best measured in 5 year chunks.

The only "new" OS I'm excited about right now is EROS, largely because I
think pushing capability security (and persistence) is necessary and
because I think EROS has a possibility of attracting developer critical
mass.  Anyone following along who wonders what I'm talking about, the
following are pretty gentle introductions:

http://www.eros-os.org/essays/capintro.html
http://www.eros-os.org/essays/reliability/paper.html

As you read you'll probably be struck several times with thoughts along
the lines of "My SI/upload/whatever _needs_ this."

Yes, see above.  Today's software mess will live for a very long time so
needs to be migrated to capability systems or vice versa.  There was a
fascinating thread "Saving the UNIX API" on cap-talk
http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/cap-talk/2002-February/thread.html
mid-February concerning this.  I'm also interested in, um, social
security, i.e., how do you decide what to trust.  Raph Levien's
thesis-in-progress http://www.levien.com/thesis/thesis.ps on
attack-resistant trust metrics makes for some interesting reading.

Of course as Eugene mentions we are in this for the
science and not the glory (though glory isn't a bad
thing per se).

One could argue that the stats should be divided into
"classes".  A corporate class like Google (or a University
class) can clearly trump a non-profit organization
with more limited resources.

I think what counts is contribution relative to
resources available.  I think in that area Extropy
can distinguish itself.

(You may note some posts today to both folding-bugreports
and folding2 on my part complaining about long existing
bugs and the lack of open source that would enable fixing
them -- I intend to keep the pressure on in these areas.)
