You can't strive toward magic; it is in essence indefinable, and thus
untargetable. It contains the set of all (or some?) things that we cannot
comprehend. By definition, as we come to comprehend them, they cease to be
magical, and become part of the toolkit.

Off the top of my head, striving for "God" has a couple of interpretations.
It can mean striving for potence and control... I can agree with that (gee,
what a blokey definition!). But I would not label it God.

Or, it could mean striving to somehow become closer to that which is greater
than/beyond us, and on that score, who really gives a rat's? If this concept
even makes sense, I suspect that the closer we get to "god", the less
interesting it will become. It wont become any less pointless, of course,
having started at the maximum on that scale.

I wish you would. The issue is not trivial, and not just grumpy
conservatism. The protocols we use to read swiftly and accurately get
highly tuned to orthography and other modifiable parameters. Capitalization
saves me (and most people) from having to scan every goddam sequence of
letters for a small period at the end of the sentence. Like DNA, the
Hellenic Greeks, as I recall dimly from those days, didn't use spaces
between words either; that made reading even harder, and might explain why
everyone until quite recently mouthed every word they read. Your personal
aesthetic quirk imposes a real deficit on all the rest of us; it slows us
up, and worse than that it requires that a thoroughly automated process
gets dragged up several steps into consciousness, or near enough, which
damages your readers' concentration on what you're communicating.

I suggest a toast, with a _drink_ fit for *Kings*   ! !

(uh, well, this one is dead, but that's a minor nitpick ......)


      ---------------------------
     | King Midas' Golden Elixir |
      ---------------------------

* Ingredients: yellow muscat grapes,lightly toasted 2-row barley malt,
thyme honey.

* Fermented on a dry mead yeast to 7.5% alcohol by volume.

*It has a brilliant golden hue, with reddish highlights,

(from http://www.museum.upenn.edu/Midas/recipes.html)


When scientists at the University of Pennsylvania analyzed the residue
in dirty dishes and drinking cups from this tomb at Gordion, in central
Turkey, they announced that  these were leftovers from the feast
http://www.museum.upenn.edu/Midas/intro.html
consumed at King Midas' funeral.

(older story:
http://www.sciencenews.org/20001104/bob1.asp)

However new radiocarbon carbon dating (giving ~740 B.C.) of the
wooden furnishings in the tomb now place it older than King Midas,
so the tomb was presumably built to Midas' predecessor: perhaps
the grandfather or father of King Midas.
(Int'l Herald Tribune, Dec 27, 2001, pg. 8)


A Golden Elixir Toast, then, to *Any* Extropian on their BirthDay !

Sounds worth trying. Thanks Amara.

If my thank-you post sounded a bit overly effusive and sentimental for me, 
I blame it on the two vodkas I had consumed. (Medicine against heart 
disease and Alzheimer's of course.) But I mean every word.

Onward!

Excellent! I can see a wonderful spoof TV documentary right now. Seriously,
even when there was a mini-panic about global cooling in the early 1970s
(remember "The Weather Machine and the Threat of Ice" ?) it never got the
coverage of global warming. I think it's obvious why - global warming can be
used to argue for lots of government controls and getting rid of technology
but you can't do that with cooling, quite the opposite in fact. In fact as
people like Matt Ridley have pointed out global cooling is a much more
credible threat than global warming, given that the default setting for the
planet's climate right now is an ice age. Also, all the evidence suggests
that the end of an interglacial and the onset of an ice age happens *very*
quickly - less than ten years is the figure usually given. Steve Davies

 I agree that this is not a panacea. The problem is the assumption that
warlords (local elites)  will make these reforms and adopt the rule of law
out of self interest since such reforms will make everyone better off
(including the elite). This is true but the process will also undermine the
elites' power and their ability to use it. There are also big advantages
from being a rich, powerful person in a poor country. So it's frequently not
in the warlords interest to reform seriously. China and Japan show one
factor which can push elites in the direction of meaningful reform,
competition with other states in the international system. This doesn't
apply however in places like Latin America or Africa.

> So...what other solutions are there to this problem?

I think there are a number of things we can try. Some kinds of technology do
help to undermine concentrated power so you should encourage their
spread/adoption. Simply encouraging trade is also very useful. In many cases
however I think you need to develop a power which can face down the
"warlords". As you rightly say, traditional violent revolution is a classic
case of the cure being worse than the disease. The alternative is surely the
many forms of non-violent resistance, particularly developing a system of
parallel institutions. I'm not against the use of force defensively however,
as elites will often go to almost any length to protect their position.

(some random nude quotes)

     "On the fourth day of telecommuting, I realized that clothes are
     totally unnecessary."
     - Dilbert

     "To reduce the accumulation of static electricity, you must increase
     the humidity, change or get rid of the carpeting, or both. Although a
     small room-sized humidifier may help, these steps are often too
     expensive to be practical. A less expensive (and correspondingly less
     effective) step is to avoid wearing leather-soled shoes or clothes
     made of synthetic fibers. (If possible, compute in the nude.) Whether
     or not you take any of these steps, you should still touch metal to
     dissipate the static charge before you touch the computer or a disk."
     - From the book "Supercharging MS-Dos" by Microsoft Press, 3rd Ed.,
     pg. 393, under the section "Static Electricity Is A Killer"

     "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the
     middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current
     wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the
     water, and talked about all kinds of things -- we was always naked,
     day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us -- the new
     clothes Buck`s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and
     besides I didn`t go much on clothes, nohow."
     chapter 19 of Mark Twain`s Huckleberry Finn

     "The girl with dark hair was coming towards him across the field.
     With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung
     them disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it
     aroused no desire in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What
     overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with
     which she had thrown her clothes aside. With all its grace and
     carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole [oppressive] culture, a
     whole system of thought."
     - From a dream scene in George Orwell`s "1984"

     After it was found in practice to be better to strip than to cover up
     all those parts, then what was ridiculous to the eyes faded away in
     the face of what argument showed to be best.
     - Plato, Republic 452d

     The guardian women must strip for physical training, since they`ll
     wear virtue instead of clothes.
     - Plato, Republic 457a

     "The Church says: The body is a sin.
     Science says: The body is a machine.
     Advertising says: The body is a business.
     The body says: I am a fiesta."

The point being a reply to a specific statement. If he understood it so
well, he wouldn't need someone to tell him what it meant. Personally I
don't trust him, and just think he's a religious nut who's going to do what
he wants. This is the man who has made it policy to refuse every request
for information. The next few years are going to show who's right, you or
me, but we'll have to wait.
     And for the record, I NEVER said I trusted Clinton, Reno, or any of
his administration. Just because I don't trust this attorney general says
nothing about my response to any other.

Quite an interesting article, it argues that although the war in
Afghanistan killed more people than died in 911 it nevertheless
saved the lives of about one million Afghanis. Some will say that
you can't use arithmetic to measure morality so the moral thing
would be for those one million people to have the good manners
to just die, but some people will say anything.

 I meant that the effects on particular people are their main motivation.

 No, it is normal for people's opinions to be biased by their self-interest,
and the evidence for the positive effects is generally not compelling
enough to offset those biases. They see us as similarly biased.

 My main hope is that we can reduce the frequency with which the public
gets fooled into treating self-interested policies as altruistic policies.
Convincing the public that they don't know what the net effects are will
often be more practical than convincing them that the net effects are positive.

 I see signs that people who are relatively wealthy, or who have succeeded
at some other form of status competition, can opt out. I don't know how to
tell how hard it is for people with low status can opt out.
 I presume there are some important benefits to encouraging people to choose
to care about the kinds of status they are most likely to achieve, rather
than feeling pressure to use the most popular measures of status.

I don't think it matters much whether your cell phone is 1 or 3 years old.
The problem comes more when you are using the same technology for 5,
10, 20, 50 years without change.  This is stagnation and it's an easy
trap to fall into.

Consider two 70 year olds.  One is on the internet, talks to the grand
kids by email and communicates using chat and message boards with people
who have shared interests.  The other listens to old Jack Benny programs
on the radio.  Which one would you want to be?

The little decisions we make from day to day, our attitudes towards
technology adoption, put us on the path towards one of these two futures.
It is all too easy to fall into the path of stagnation, relying on the
safe and well-known technologies of the past rather than making the
effort to stretch the mind and keep up with changes.

I'm getting into middle age, as I think a considerable number of people
are here.  Mental flexibility doesn't come automatically.  You have to
adopt a conscious attitude of rejecting the old and accepting the new in
order to overcome ingrained habits.  It will always be easier to keep
what you know.  All those years of using a familiar technology drive
deep ruts in your brain, and hopping out of them takes effort.

I find that the way the brain works, it fools you into thinking that old
technologies are better, when in fact they are just more comfortable.
You have to adopt a conscious bias towards new technologies in order
to overcome this mental error.  Then you can have a balance between
pointless neophilia and hidebound stagnation.

I hope this attitude isn't common among those who wish to download
themselves into AIs.  Unless it was a joke, you're advocating
contemptuous genocide of those who decide to remain in flesh-and-blood
form.  Are you saying that you'll regard flesh-and-blood humans with
about the same empathy as you do insects or bacteria today?

Far be it from me to give a bona fide rocket scientist some technical advice

Why do we need new rockets? The space shuttles do the job well enough,
surely?

Rockets ... we don't need no stinking rockets ...

Imagine to be on a perfectly flat, perfectly frictionless surface, 
such as ice, or oil covered marble. You want to get away, but 
nobody is around. So the question is: How can you move away 
on perfect ice, i.e. on a perfectly frictionless surface?

Actually there is a very common use of the word god which is used often and 
increasingly and applies to ordinary people. Those of us who create virtual 
worlds are often referred to by people as gods. For instance when I was 
managing the Awaba world some time back it was not uncommon for kids to ask 
"Are you the god of this world?" as shorthand for "Are you 
owner/builder/manager of this world?"

I thought it a cute development. :-)

And in some aspects, moreso.  Particularly regarding things to do with 
genetics.  Probably a legacy of the Eugenics/Nazi era, or perhaps the 
Greens/Luddites have been getting faaaar more time than they deserve.

gods? 

And what does it mean?

Eskimos have forty-eight different names for snow 
in their language because they know snow intimately 
in its different variations, not because they are ignorant 
of the fact that all snow is only one.

The Hindus have 3 main gods, and many different deities. 
The Hindu trinity is of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. 
They are respectively the creator, preserver and destroyer. 
The different gods (and goddesses) of Hinduism represent 
various functions of the 'divinity', and are not separate gods.

This isn't necessarily evidence that global warming isn't happening. Climatic 
scientists are pretty much agreed that we are undergoing massive climate 
change all over the planet. The arguement seems to me to  be about whether 
this is down to human activity or whether this is the natural pattern of 
activity of the worlds climatic systems. In other words - the world is 
getting warmer, but this is normal and we better get used to it.

A Call For Papers:

Practical Cosmology



An Online Symposium Sponsored by the

 Journal of Evolution and Technology



  "I think I have shown that there are good scientific reasons for taking
seriously the possibility that life and intelligence can succeed in molding
this universe of ours to their own purposes."

  - Freeman Dyson



Papers are invited on Practical Cosmology: the field that investigates the
role of intelligence in the evolution of the universe. Examples of questions
covered by this young discipline are:



  1.. Can technologically advanced civilizations create engineering works on
a cosmological scale, e.g., the construction of Dyson spheres?
  2.. Is it possible for us (or intelligence in general) to live forever or
will entropy consume us all?
  3.. How many sentient beings can the universe support?
  4.. Why do we not now see the existence of intelligence and the molding of
the universe? (The Fermi Paradox)
  5.. How many technologically advanced civilizations should we expect to
find in the universe? (The Drake Equation)




The online symposium will be from June 1 to June 30, 2002. A moderated
e-list will be formed to allow panellists and audience to discuss the papers
presented.

Attendance is free and open to all. Prospective panellists should submit an
abstract of no more than 300 words as early as possible but not later than
May 1, 2002; to mail@markalanwalker.com Abstracts should clearly state the
nature and conclusions of the final paper.  Papers are due May 24. 2002.

Papers will be considered for possible inclusion in a special volume of The
Journal of Evolution and Technology.

Hmm...I'm surprised no one said: take off a large article of clothing (such 
as a jacket, shirt etc.), place it on the surface, walk on it for a step or 
two, pick it back up and do it again until you are free.  (Of course, no 
one knows if there *is* an end to the frictionless surface...it may just be 
an exercise in futility...)

Rocket engineer's answer: take your shirt off & throw it; reaction will
eventually get you to the edge.  There's also an old SF story about two
guys in spacesuits who slip onto a giant frictionless concave mirror.
Tether dynamics and conservation of angular momentum are key to their
escape...

Uh, no, we need many newer, better, and much cheaper rockets. We've
spent billions on the ones we have and they still have a projected
failure rate of 1/100 or 1/200 or so, at best, and still cost a fortune
just to carry monkey turds. What Doug is working on is airline service
quality rockets: one's you can fly several times a day, refuel with a
high school education, pilot with not much more than a standard
commercial pilots license, and buy a ticket on for only a few times more
than the cost of a Concorde ticket. Until this happens, space will not
be for everyone, it will be the domain of big governments and kooky
multimillionaires flying at a cost of $10k per lb.

XCOR's approach is one I've been advocating for years, and I think if
anyone gets there, it will be them.

Problem is, your solution assumes that there is friction between the clothing
and the frictionless surface, and by definition there isn't.  Most of the 
solutions proposed in the URI given, however, were essentially useless. :)

Uh, most emphatically NO, most scientists are not agreed, at least in
the way you mean. In fact, the majority do not agree that there is a
significant anthropogenic warming trend. ALL scientists do agree that
"we are undergoing climate change", but that is a semantically neutral
statement which only recognises that the world climate is not a stasis,
it is a dynamic system with a myriad of inputs and outputs that change
over time. Saying that "we are undergoing climate change" is true even
if that climate change is that we are going into an ice age. Even if
part of the world is getting cooler and part getting warmer, to sum out
to zero, this still means that "we are undergoing climate change".

The reason why there is so much doubt about warming, and anthropogenic
warming in particular, is that the period of data collection is so very
short for those claiming that there is catastrophic change happening,
generally only a 30-100 year period. Longer range studies, based on
things like tree rings and ice cores, show that climatic change does
not, in fact, happen, to the degree claimed by proponents of big
government taxes on energy and everything else, nor do ice ages start in
as little as a decade (or stop).

For example, the oceans rose approximately 400 feet over 1000 years
during the end of the last ice age, around 9000 BC, but it wasn't until
5600 BC that sea levels got high enough to breach the Bosporus and
Dardanelles to flood the Black Sea basin, whose freshwater surface was
some 135 feet below sea level.

The antarctic ice cap, for instance, has been completely stable, and
growing slowly over the long term, for the past 15 million years or so,
ever since Antarctica broke away from South America and the circum polar
ocean current became permanently established. This is a known fact that
the cataclysmists have had to recently concede in the scientific world,
but the media has refused to acknowledge this major setback for the
big-government/tax-everything-to-pay-for-climate-control agenda. The
human race will never be flooded with 90 meters of seawater worldwide
from an antarctic collapse. At worst, we may see a 3-9 meter change in
sea level IF the Greenland Ice Cap collapses, however doing things like
flooding the Caspian basin will mitigate this to a large degree, as will
the growth of the Antarctic Ice Cap created by increases in evaportion
at the equator.

The melting of the arctic ice sheet will not change ocean levels even
while the climate changes, since the ice is already floating. What will
happen is the increase in open ocean in the arctic will increase
evaporation and thus increase precipitation in Greenland, thus helping

Well, if the surface is perfectly flat and frictionless then you will just 
move the clothing one way and yourself the other, then when you pick up the 
clothing and move it in front of you again you will move yourself back to 
your starting point. Nothing gained. Your mistake was in getting mixed up 
between theoretical ice and real ice. :-)

Extropy Institute cordially invites you to join its new Community forum at
Yahoo.  <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ExI-Community>  This is a community
resource that is all about YOU!  It is a self-service environment for YOU to
use for YOUR purposes.  It is not merely intended to promote extropy,
Extropy Institute, or the memes of transhumanism.  It is intended to promote
YOU and what YOU care about in transhumanism.

Do you want to let other transhumanists know who you are and how to contact
you?  Fill out an entry in the Contact Database.

Do you want other transhumanists to know what you look like?  Upload your
face picture into the Photo Album.

Do you want to have some intelligent conversation for a change?  Go into the
chat room and talk in real-time to other transhumanists.

Are you looking for a job?  Offering a job?  Selling something?  Need
volunteers?  Need a roommate?  Need a ride?  Check out the want-ads, by
transhumanists for transhumanists.

Do you have recommendations for movies, books or events?  Give a brief
review of it, and read how other transhumans review it.

Did you ever want to promote your personal website or your business to other
transhumanists, but felt it might be off-topic?  Not anymore!  Bookmark your
personal page.  Bookmark your business offerings.  Bookmark your
organizations.

Promote yourself and your interests.  Put your resume online where everyone
can find it.  Put all your writings online and bookmark them here.  Promote
your projects and ideas.  Don't be shy.  This forum is for YOU!

Ever wonder what other transhumanists think?  Ever wonder if your ideas are
common among transhumanists or in the minority?  Ever wonder how many of us
there are, who we are, and what we are like?  Take a look at the community
polls!  It sure would be interesting to see our various ages, our genders,
our incomes, our orientations, our marital statuses, our religious beliefs,
our political beliefs, and other demographic data.  For the first time we
can get a picture of the community as a whole.

It also would be interested to compare notes.  How many are signed up for
cryonics?  How many take life-extending nutrients?  How many practice
calorie restriction?  When do we predict the singularity?  Where do we
expect the next major breakthrough?  Express your opinion and see what
everyone else thinks as well!

All polls will be anonymous, unscientific, and just for fun.  If you have
any other questions you would like the community to answer, send me a note
and I'll add a poll.  What's our favorite food?  What's our favorite
computer?  Our favorite TV show?  How many of us own guns?  How many used to
hold religious beliefs?  Anything goes.  Whatever you want to know, send me
a note and I'll add a poll.  I will propose the wording in the discussion
area, and work with all the suggestions to get the wording right, make it a
fair question, and make sure we list all the possibilities.  Then we'll poll
and find out what we always wanted to know.

We also have a calendar section.  Tired of hearing about all our activities
after they happened?  We are doing so much that nobody can keep up with it
all.  Schedule all your gatherings and events so that everyone can see them.
Look and see what other transhumanists have scheduled.  Don't let your
events go unnoticed anymore!

This will be the first forum that is actually about YOU and your community.
Online photos, files, links, databases, polls, calendars, and anything else
we can think up that we would like to have.  No single organization or
website can keep up with all of us.  Each of us need to contribute and
maintain our own information for the whole community to see.  Anything we
should be sharing or doing together as a community should be promoted
through this forum.  It won't replace any other forums, but will be a
stepping stone to help everybody meet everybody else.

If YOU aren't promoted at this site, don't blame me!  I'm just the doorman
and your host.  Once you get in, what you do in your community is up to you.
Please visit soon and participate whenever you can.  Send any questions,
comments and especially suggestions to me at <mail@HarveyNewstrom.com>.

...How to stop machines enslaving humans
Kevin Warwick, professor of cybernetics at Reading University and author of 
the book March of the Machines, introduced a brainstorming salon at the 
Institute for Social Inventions in London in April 1998. He explained how 
computers and robots are already as intelligent as ants and that within 20 
years they will have a computational power far greater than the human brain 
and will be evolving at a far faster rate than humans.

'Advanced machine beings likely to treat humans with as little consideration 
as we treat lower forms of life'. 
These advanced machine beings, with a consciousness of their own, are likely 
to treat humans with as little consideration as we treat lower forms of life, 
especially since the military are largely responsible for creating them. 


'Within the lifetime of our children, Warwick believes, humans will become 
slaves who are culled, farmed and genetically interfered with'
The race to develop artificial intelligence systems is very difficult to 
halt. Within the lifetime of our children, Warwick believes, humans will 
become powerless slaves who are ruthlessly culled, farmed and genetically 
interfered with. 


The brainstorming
The salon participants suspended any disbelief in this eventuality and 
brainstormed possible ways of preventing it happening. The normal 
brainstorming rules applied, with wild and crazy ideas all welcomed. Here is 
a sample of the suggestions: 

Make a peace treaty with the robots, giving them total control of a planet of 
their own to live on, perhaps the moon, if that's not too close; or even just 
all underground parts of the planet, since they may not require daylight.

Intensively train a James-Bond-style team capable of destroying robots at the 
first sign of hostile intent.

Develop gradually enlarging Computer Free Zones which are utterly free of 
dependence on computer systems.......

I just found at my local library LEFT AT EAST GATE, a fat 1997 book by
Larry Warren and Peter Robbins; in 1980 Warren was a very young Yank
security cop at the (UK) Bentwaters US airforce base now known to have been
a store for lots of field nuclear weapons; there was a celebrated
`incident' two decades ago in which something X-Filish was witnessed by
various officers and servicemen. Reading past the cultish claptrap (Robbins
works with Budd Hopkins of abduction fame, and is a big fan of Reichian
orgonomy, speculating on the involvement of, ahem, `cloud buster'
technology), it actually does seem possible that Warren and some of his
pals were subjected to a Manchurian candidate-style brainfuck experiment by
the NSA or CIA or other black op outfit.

Actually, there are quite a few organizations taking similar approaches,
though few of them have as yet actually flown hardware.  XCOR seems to
be the most advanced of the lot; they have a good chance of being the
first non-government organization to do manned orbital flight, but not
the only ones (within, say, 10 years of when they achieve that
milestone).

Unfortunately, merely shucking your clothes does not always remove the
potential for static electricity.  I've got enough fur on my arms that a
brief but vigorous rubbing can produce minor, but perceptible, static
electricity.  And when affectionate kitty cat, with a healthy and thick
coat of fur, rubs up demanding attention, well...

For what it's worth, Wayne, if we somehow wind up in a scenario where both
Eugene and I are around as uploads, and we both have the unrestricted
ability to affect Earth, and you're still around on Earth, then I'll
protect you from Eugene.  I can't make any realistic commitment on behalf
of a transhuman future self because my goals might change, but that's the
current output of my goal system.

Warwick in Wired? Was probably 
http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/warwick.html

But that's nothing much at all. Warwick has something 
of a reputation for being more about PR hype than 
actual tech developments. There have been / are real 
experiments involving humans, though, such as
http://augustachronicle.com/stories/102198/tec_124-5777.shtml

The new article refers to an improvement over what is 
described in that above, basing on thoughts of the 
specific motion desired instead of having to think 
about something unrelated, with the electrodes 
monitoring the actual "deciding to make this movement" 
patterns instead of working from signals (such as 
trying to pick up a glass) not directly related to the 
movement desired.

Aumentar!

Go to:

http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/shb/hayes_16_3.htm

or read below.

The title of this piece is itself a redundancy. All Muslim women are captives, if they live according to the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad. Muslim women are considered to be one-half of a human. "Honor killing" still exists and calls for the death of women who have lost their virginity before marriage-even if they were raped. Murder because of hymens. Unbelievable. 

One of the most touching, heart wrenching speakers I've ever been privileged to hear was Taslima Nasrin, at a May 2000 conference of the Council for Secular Humanism. Nasrin delivered a talk to a pin-drop quiet audience. She is eloquent; she is an M.D.; she is kind; and she is lovely. She is also living under a death sentence. She outgrew her Muslim upbringing, and began writing against its misogyny. Her novel, Shame, however, was the last straw. It criticized Muslims' cruel persecution of Hindus. Fundamentalists issued a fatwa, a literal death sentence, against her and she was forced to leave her native Bangladesh. She has bodyguards now. Allah be praised. 

How did Islam become so cruel and intolerant? Easy. It began that way. When the Prophet Muhammad uttered his first sura (similar to a biblical chapter) Muslim women were doomed. The introduction to my copy of the Koran is a whopping 58 pages of a defensive harangue about how bad the Koran isn't. Example: "In the matters of marriage, divorce and inheritance women are given the same rights as men." Oh, really? Koran 4:20 tells men that they may take one wife in place of another. They can trade in their wives like used cars. Of course there is no equivalent trade-in policy offered to women. Koran 4:3 says men should marry whichever women appeal to them, "two or three or four"-you know, shop around. Collect a whole set! Since male divorce is so easy (just say a few words like "Get outta here!" and you're divorced-true story) men can have innumerable wives in a lifetime. 

Further, in Koran 4:34 men are described as being superior to women because Allah made them to "excel over the other" and because men spend money supporting women. In Koran 2: 223 wives are described as "tilled fields" that men should, literally, plow through. You know, have a good time, get some kids going. The Prophet Muhammad had a baker's dozen wives, and countless concubines. His third bride was nine years old at the time of consummation. But little Aisha was at least allowed to keep her toys and dolls when she went to Muhammad's bed. I may throw up. Muslim paradise consists of males lounging on couches, being waited on by virgins who don't sleep, perspire, get pregnant, menstruate, or get sick, and intercourse goes on forever. No mention is made of how this could be considered "paradise" for the females.

When stoning men and women for adultery (adultery meaning another man's property, one of his wives, has been tampered with), the offending male is to stand in a clearing while people throw stones at him till he dies. If he runs away, escaping, he's safe. Death sentence over. But a woman to be stoned is put in a pit, waist/chest high, for "decency." Imagine a "decent" stoning. Wouldn't want to see any naughty bits of her body while you're bashing her bloody! Tsk, tsk! Of course escape for her is impossible, isn't it? These still take place, in some countries, as I write. 

Another wonderful writer who spoke at the May conference, Parvin Darabi, wrote a grim book describing fundamentalist Islam titled, Rage Against the Veil. It is about her sister, Homa Darabi, who was a child psychiatrist in Iran. She and others were hounded relentlessly about observing hijab (dress code) in their practices. Seems logical. "Push, Mrs. Ali, it's almost here, but I can't tell if it it's a girl or boy because my veil is in the way." Of course there is nothing funny about veiling, and its sole purpose is to eliminate any possible sense of female personal identity. Because of this nonsensical insistence on veiling, Homa Darabi was finally forced to give up her private practice and then her professorship at the University of Tehran. She never recovered from her despair. On February 21, 1994, in the middle of a square in Tehran, she poured gasoline on herself and set herself on fire to protest the tyranny of her native country. She died, as planned. Allah be praised.

As usual, there's probably less to this whole story than meets the eye. A
bit of subsequent scouting on the web took me to more skeptical probings;
for example,

http://www.rendlesham.com/

and a number of James Easton's other documents in his `Voyager Newsletter'.
My current guess is that Warren *was* indeed subjected to a Manchurian
candidate-style brainfuck--by the helpful UFO proponents who hypnotically
`regressed' his memories of those 1980 events and with little hints
contaminated them beyond all recognition. Oh, and of course he might have
been lying or confabulating under his own steam.

I'll toss my generosity into the ring.  I'll promise to keep an uploaded
version of Wayne around (no information loss, very extropic), however I
can't guarantee that I'll give you real-time CPU rights.  Being realistic
I think one can assume that the goals of near-gods probably trump the
goals of pre-post-humans.

Wayne, let us know what the worst moment of your life has been.  I'm sure
I can setup the VR such that I can arrange to have it endlessly replayed.

I can see two ways.  If the surface isn't really perfectly frictionless, 
like the ice or oil you mentioned, you just shift your weight back and 
forth, quickly in one direction, but in the other so slowly that you don't 
overcome the minute amount of static friction that exists for every real 
situation.  If you're unlucky enough to be on a purely imaginary, perfectly 
frictionless surface you have to try a different approach.  The best I can 
think of is to breath in in one direction and breath out in another.  Air 
resistance will keep your velocity down, but as long as you keep the 
breathing up you'll move.

Is it just me, or does the contrast between good guys and bad guys seem
unusually clear today?

I found it in the magazine 'Frontiers' way back in 1999.
I quote;
'A man left completely paralysed after a heart attack is once again
communicating with the outside world, thanks to a direct neural link with
his computer. Neurosurgeons at Emory university in Atlanta, Georgia, have
placed an electrode inside the paralysed man's brain that enables him to
control a computer cursor by thought alone. He has become capable of
clicking on icons to make the computer say words for him, send email or even
dim the light in his room....
Another paralysed patient...also had an electrode implanted at the same time
he did.
...But what makes the Atlanta achievement special is the way they have
directly connected man and computer. Nerve cells in the patient's brain have
actually been fused directly with the specially designed electrode.
The electrode ends with a hollow glass cone about the size of the end of a
ballpoint pen. This cone was dipped in chemicals extracted from the
patient's knees which induce nerve growth. Over a few months the nerve cells
grew into the cone and eventually linked up to the electrode. The electrode
interprets and transmits neural signals to a reciever outside of the scalp.
There are no wires going through the skin, and the electrode has no internal
power source; it is powered by an induction coil in his head.'
The leading neurosurgeon is Dr. Roy E. Bakay.

Has anybody heard any more about this since?

Also an article at TechTV: 
http://www.techtv.com/news/scitech/story/0,24195,3370398,00.html

The paper disgusses the feasibility of building a 22,000 mi wire to space out of carbon 
nanotubes. It would theoretically be able to lift 20 tons into space at a time without 
rockets.

(I just started it, so I can't give better details than that. Looks interesting, and it seems that 
it won't be overly technical, for those of us without phsyics or engineering degrees.)

I don't know how much more I read, but what they did was to have the person (might've

Man Who Would Be God: Giving Robots Life

By SARAH LYALL

HIPHAM, England - Steve Grand, maverick artificial-life expert and 
designer of the breathtakingly innovative computer game Creatures, is 
not one to shrink from brazen pronouncements. "I am an aspiring 
latter-day Baron Frankenstein," is how Mr. Grand describes himself in 
his recent book, "Creation: Life and How to Make It" (Harvard 
University Press, $26).

He makes an even bolder claim for Creatures, in which he created a 
new race of cyberanimals who can learn, adapt and evolve in ways that 
have proved surprising even to him.

"A game it might have been, but if you'll forgive the staggering lack 
of modesty this implies, Creatures was probably the closest thing 
there has been to a new form of life on this planet in four billion 
years," Mr. Grand writes. "These creatures probably still represent 
the state of the art in synthetic life forms."

He is now trying to surpass himself by searching for the Holy Grail 
of artificial intelligence, a way to build a robot that thinks, feels 
and learns. He has stiff competition from other labs around the 
world, but among those who are rooting for him is the biologist 
Richard Dawkins.

"Steve Grand is the creator of what I think is the nearest approach 
to artificial life so far," Mr. Dawkins has said. Speaking of Mr. 
Grand's latest endeavor, what is known as the Lucy project, he told 
The Sunday Times: "With his record, if anyone could pull off such a 
spectacular coup, it would be him."

Looks like freezing techniques are gradually improving. Alcor might be in

Organ transplant breakthrough

Embryos successfully conceived from the frozen ovaries.
"We have demonstrated that whole organ transplantation is feasible".
Professor Roger Gosden.

Scientists have successfully frozen whole organs without destroying their
function. The breakthrough raises the possibility that doctors will
eventually be able to keep donor organs in deep freeze until they are needed
for transplant operations. It might also allow women who have to undergo
cancer treatment to store healthy organs, and have children when they would
otherwise have been infertile.

Scientists have previously been able to store and freeze tissue samples. But
until now it has not proved possible to freeze and store whole organs
because the freezing and thawing process does too much damage.

The researchers carried out their research on rats. They removed and stored
the creatures' ovaries in liquid nitrogen, then successfully transplanted
them into rats that were genetically identical. Although the transplanted
ovaries were less efficient after freezing, more than half ovulated normally
and one recipient became pregnant.

Lead researcher Professor Roger Gosden, of the Eastern Virginia Medical
School, US, said that if the technique could one day be applied to humans,
it would offer an option to women and children who would otherwise be
sterilized by chemotherapy. It might also be used to reduce the risk of
premature sterility in women with other medical conditions.

Advances in freezing techniques could also make it possible to store and
successfully transplant other organs. At present, freezing tends to cause
irreparable damage to the blood vessels.

Professor Gosden told BBC News Online: "The take-home message is that we
have demonstrated that whole organ transplantation is feasible. The frozen
ones were not all successful, but that is not surprising because 50 years
after the first successful sperm freezing results are still not perfect."

Professor Gosden said it would be more difficult to freeze human organs
successfully because they were larger. However, the blood vessels, being
larger, would potentially present less problems during surgery.

The research is published in the magazine Nature.

I see three flaws with this scenario.

1)

The first is the assumption that your uploaded self will be faster.  People
always quote the speed of electricity vs. the speed of neurons, but they
fail to take into account the paralell processing that goes on in the human
brain.  Just as a far-fetched example, if I uploaded a person into an Excel
spreadsheet, each variable change would take seconds (minutes? hours?) to
recalculate the entire spreadsheet.  Such an upload would be horribly SLOW
compared to flesh and blood.

Eventually, they will fix this.  They will make processors and
multiprocessor systems faster.  They question is will people use them?  Once
you are speeded up to normal, would you want to speed up faster?  Before
everyone jumps in to say yes, ask yourself why?  If you can already
communicate to the uploaded people quite fine, who would be the first to
want to go faster?  All that would happen is that everyone else (uploaded
and not) would be boringly slow to you.  You, yourself would not feel any
difference.  So, who would spend time and effort to do it?

2)

The second flaw is sheer boredom.  Even if the technology makes you faster,
how many people have the focus to think about something for a  month at a
time?  I see no reason to believe that the uploaded month of thinking would
be much more productive than the flesh and blood month of thinking.

3)

The third flaw is economics.  Even if you have a fast upload, and a mind
focused enough to think about something for a month at a time, why would
they?  Today, companies pay people money.  Without money people can't get
food.  How many people, if they didn't need food or shelter, would work for
someone else instread of on their own ideas?  I don't think uploaded people
would care enough.  (They might care about cancer, or something, but those
issues have been thought out enough that just sitting and thinking won't
help those issues.)

> >You do not interact meaningfully with a statue-littered landscape. By
> >means other than bulldozering it, I mean.

Luckily, I don't think uploads would spend the effort to bulldoze the
statues.  Even if this situation comes about, the statues wouldn't have any
affect to the uploaded so why would they bother to bulldoze them?

Or he was fabricating an excuse why he slept overnight in the woods (or
spent it stoning out) when he was supposed to be on duty. If the brass
decides there is a real security threat, then you were simply a victim
of enemy action. If they decide you are just mental, they go easier on
you than if you were just being derilict. Claiming a UFO encounter would
trigger either a paranoid security response, or a section 8 evaluation
before charges of dereliction.

whitehouse.org is not the real whitehouse, www.whitehouse.gov is the
proper address (and whitehouse.com is a porn site).

Saw an entertaining cartoon in today's paper: two al Qaeda are freezing
their butts off in an Afghan cave and reading the newspaper with the
headline: "Guantanamo Conditions: 'Too breezy, no pillow mints'", with
the turbaned readers replying "Barbarians!"......

Gee, how clever.  Feh.  How is it that anyone not a flaming liberal is a
money grubbing, heartless, thieving, bigoted right-wing fanatic? 
Ashcroft underwhelms me, but the "loyal" opposition is even less
impressive.

One of the "win" criteria in our business plan is if there are several
vehicle makers (possibly including us) who use our propulsion.  This is
part of the reason why we haven't entered the X-prize competition- we
want to sell engines to all comers (subject to State Department
paranoia, of course).  We're negotiating contracts/making proposals to a
whole bunch of prospective customers.  Future's so bright, I gotta wear
sunglasses.

Highlights of yesterday's flight-

* Mike Melvill putting the "chase" into chase pilot, passing 20 feet
over my head at 160 kts 15 seconds after Dick lit the engines, the warm
exhaust still washing around me...

* Hightailing it off the runway after I realized, "Oops, it's a touch
and go flight, he's not gonna be eight minutes coming down," as the
planes turned onto final...

* Dick showing impeccable glideslope management, setting it down just 80
feet past the numbers...

* Frustration at the *&^%$ ignition interlock switches being too cold
and operating sluggishly, forcing an unnecessary engine relight abort
and preventing the "go" part of the touch and go. (We'll have two fixes
built and tested before the next flight- this has only been a problem
during the recent cold weather.  Next month we'll have our own custom
design switches built & installed; smaller, lighter, and more reliable.)

All in all, I really enjoy my job.

I'll be hanging out on ExI-Community's chat area some of today. It would be 
fun to chat with some of you.

I won't be available all the time, but will drop in several times.

I'm open to chat generally, but especially interested in hearing what you 
think about ExI's current endeavors, plans for Extro-6 and other 
gatherings, and so on.

A kidney is part of the mind/brain/body in humans, therefore does not operate "outside".
Its 'goal' or purpose is to maintain its 'kidneyhood', which requires 'offering' support to the external 'kidney carrier' (the rest
of the body) in exchange for survival and kidney reproduction. From the selfish kidney's perspective the purpose of life is to
create kidneys.

Perhaps, which enables him to more effectively rip its

belong in such a position in other than a crypto-Fascist country.

You're probably right, initially uploads will be slow and probably
have other deficiencies as well.  However I think the proposed scenario
applies to a later phase.

There would be tremendous economic advantages to being able to go faster.
Imagine if you had a lawyer or a researcher who could think 10 times
faster than the other guy.  Imagine if you were at a meeting and a
problem came up, and you could "freeze time" and figure out an answer
in a couple of hours, then deliver it seemingly instantaneously.  There
are any number of fields where speed of human information processing is
the bottleneck.  Imagine if you could keep up with all the technical
or medical research relevant to your job.

There are so many advantages that Robin Hanson predicts that uploads
would end up taking over essentially all information processing work,
which is a substantial and increasing part of human labor.  There is no
way a normal human can compete with someone who can think X times faster.
The real problem, then, is what non-uploads will do with such a handicap,
not what uploads will do with their advantages.

First, I don't think you would literally think for a month at a time,
any more than you do that today.  Rather, you would put in a month's
worth of work in a vastly smaller amount of time.  You would still
take breaks, sleep, watch TV etc.

As far as the problem of what kinds of breaks a sped-up person could
enjoy, there are several approaches.  One is to be able to slow down
sometimes.  Presumably a fast machine can be made to run slowly.
Then you can interact with the real world, although it will be an
expensive vacation (in terms of foregone income).  The other is to
interact with other high-speed uploads.  Another form of recreation is
to just surf the net, participate in chats, enjoy pre-recorded video
and music.  With hundreds of millions of people online, even a vastly
sped-up mentality can probably find enough novelty to keep him interested
during breaks.

There was a time when some people read EVERYTHING posted to usenet.
Maybe an upload could do the same thing again.

I'm not sure what you are saying here.  Is it that uploaded people don't
need food and shelter (just virtual food and shelter) and so they won't
have any expenses?  However you are neglecting the expense of the computer
which runs them.  Presumably the upload needs to make enough to pay for
that.  Then there are the tele-operated robot bodies he uses on vacation.
Those aren't cheap you know.  Plus he's going to run up quite a bill at
Blockbuster Video renting 1000 videos a week.  That's a quarter million
dollars a year right there.

Uploads will have expenses, and there will probably be advantages to being
rich even if you are an upload.  There is no particular reason to expect
them to be free from economic motivations.

This is not an accurate description of quantum teleportation.  There are
two forms of information involved, a classical measurement which is sent
the old-fashioned way, slower than light, and some quantum information
which seems to get there in a mysterious way.  Some people say the quantum
information goes FTL, some say it goes back in time and then forward.
David Deutsch showed that in a certain sense it could be thought of as
piggybacking invisibly on the classical information.

So while there is a mysterious component to quantum teleportation, the
description above where "position is beamed using the FTL ERP effect"
is not right.  Position is sent normally and then the remaining quantum
information gets there somehow.  The net result is that the entire
information transfer is never FTL.

Until other uploads begin posting to Usenet.  People will always be

We are involved in becoming trans- or post-human.  So to claim 
that is only becoming fully "human" seems to me to be a bit 
lacking.  We strive to become effectively immortal, effectively 
unlimited (except by the maximum acheivable to even what we may 
become) in our ability to grow in knowledge, in wisdom, in 
thinking ability and in ability to manipulate reality.  Our 
ability cannot be artificially limited.  It is not at all beyond 
the possible that we will create and destroy worlds, solar 
systems and so on.  It is quite likely that we will be able to 
create life out of raw matter and energy.  If these abilities 
don't qualify as "becoming as gods" then I do not know what is 
missing.  It is to be fervently hoped that we also develop 
wisdom as we attain such powers.  In any case, the resulting 
being[s] are not adequately described as simply "fully human".

I suggest we put some energy into considering what kind of gods 
and goddesses we will be.  I think the exercise is critical to 
attaining some of the needed wisdom, wisdom needed long before 
we transcend the bounds of the merely "human".

Extropy Institute cordially invites you to join its new Community forum at
Yahoo.  <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ExI-Community>  This is a community
resource that is all about YOU!  It is a self-service environment for YOU to
use for YOUR purposes.  It is not merely intended to promote extropy,
Extropy Institute, or the memes of transhumanism.  It is intended to promote
YOU and what YOU care about in transhumanism.

Do you want to let other transhumanists know who you are and how to contact
you?  Fill out an entry in the Contact Database.

Do you want other transhumanists to know what you look like?  Upload your
face picture into the Photo Album.

Do you want to have some intelligent conversation for a change?  Go into the
chat room and talk in real-time to other transhumanists.

Are you looking for a job?  Offering a job?  Selling something?  Need
volunteers?  Need a roommate?  Need a ride?  Check out the want-ads, by
transhumanists for transhumanists.

Do you have recommendations for movies, books or events?  Give a brief
review of it, and read how other transhumans review it.

Did you ever want to promote your personal website or your business to other
transhumanists, but felt it might be off-topic?  Not anymore!  Bookmark your
personal page.  Bookmark your business offerings.  Bookmark your
organizations.

Promote yourself and your interests.  Put your resume online where everyone
can find it.  Put all your writings online and bookmark them here.  Promote
your projects and ideas.  Don't be shy.  This forum is for YOU!

Ever wonder what other transhumanists think?  Ever wonder if your ideas are
common among transhumanists or in the minority?  Ever wonder how many of us
there are, who we are, and what we are like?  Take a look at the community
polls!  It sure would be interesting to see our various ages, our genders,
our incomes, our orientations, our marital statuses, our religious beliefs,
our political beliefs, and other demographic data.  For the first time we
can get a picture of the community as a whole.

It also would be interested to compare notes.  How many are signed up for
cryonics?  How many take life-extending nutrients?  How many practice
calorie restriction?  When do we predict the singularity?  Where do we
expect the next major breakthrough?  Express your opinion and see what
everyone else thinks as well!

All polls will be anonymous, unscientific, and just for fun.  If you have
any other questions you would like the community to answer, send me a note
and I'll add a poll.  What's our favorite food?  What's our favorite
computer?  Our favorite TV show?  How many of us own guns?  How many used to
hold religious beliefs?  Anything goes.  Whatever you want to know, send me
a note and I'll add a poll.  I will propose the wording in the discussion
area, and work with all the suggestions to get the wording right, make it a
fair question, and make sure we list all the possibilities.  Then we'll poll
and find out what we always wanted to know.

We also have a calendar section.  Tired of hearing about all our activities
after they happened?  We are doing so much that nobody can keep up with it
all.  Schedule all your gatherings and events so that everyone can see them.
Look and see what other transhumanists have scheduled.  Don't let your
events go unnoticed anymore!

This will be the first forum that is actually about YOU and your community.
Online photos, files, links, databases, polls, calendars, and anything else
we can think up that we would like to have.  No single organization or
website can keep up with all of us.  Each of us need to contribute and
maintain our own information for the whole community to see.  Anything we
should be sharing or doing together as a community should be promoted
through this forum.  It won't replace any other forums, but will be a
stepping stone to help everybody meet everybody else.

If YOU aren't promoted at this site, don't blame me!  I'm just the doorman
and your host.  Once you get in, what you do in your community is up to you.
Please visit soon and participate whenever you can.  Send any questions,
comments and especially suggestions to me at <mail@HarveyNewstrom.com>.

In *what* economy?  In a gift economy, any "advantages" of going
faster are entirely derived from a self-created feeling that you
like being appreciated by more people rather than fewer people.

The entire concept of an "economy" breaks down when the doubling time
for our ability to manufacture things humans want exceeds the doubling
time of humans that want them.

If I'm lying in the sun, soaking up a few thousand watts, using my 9G
wireless to immerse myself in the global matrix why should I care how
"fast" I go?  I just pick a world that is running at the speed I choose
to run at.

You *DON'T* HAVE JOBS!  You are trying to apply pre-singularity economic
concepts to a post-singularity reality.

If you want to discuss this you should state clearly that you are
talking about the brief period when one has the technologies for
uploading slightly before the time when the evolution to demi-god
status makes the concept of a job completely irrelevant.  Thats
going to be a brief period IMO.

Its very simple.  If uploads respect the "entity rights" of the non-uploads
then there isn't any problem.  Any technology that allows uploading seems
likely to allow non-uploads to live for "free".  There *isn't* any more
"economy" in the sense we currently understand it.

Why?  Uploaded demi-gods can completely eliminate the need for sleep.
Watching TV is a form of entertainment/relaxation.  Why not just tune
the upload's perspectives that working 60 seconds of each minute is
the best thing in the world (as Doug says -- He loves his job).

There isn't any *income* model!  You build yourself into a free-entity
solar satellite and orbit around the sun.  You don't *need* an income!

This assumes you cannot simply create the "feeling" of satisfaction
that one has from interacting with other high-speed uploads and/or
millions of non-uploads.  If you can create the feeling what is the
point of expending the time on either of those activities?

Since one can "tune" what you think you need, this is correct.  Since
you can choose to operate at greater or lesser energy consumption rates,
the amount of "food" required may vary.  You don't need "shelter" in
the general sense.  Instead, what you need is guaranteed self-preservation.
In a high-trust collective with low-level agents taking care of maintenance,
estimation of potential hazards, etc. your energy requirements may be very
low.  In a low-trust collective, your energy (and matter) requirements
may be very high.

> Presumably the upload needs to make enough to pay for that.

Not if the material harvesting costs have been prepaid.  The energy cost
issue comes down to a fundamental question of whether systems allow
themselves to grow to the point of energy shortages.  If the majority
collectively decides that your fraction of the energy resources
is divided equally between you and any copies/children then the
tradeoffs are clearly defined.

> Then there are the tele-operated robot bodies he uses on vacation.
> Those aren't cheap you know.

Huh?  Compared to the computer/energy cost of an uploaded demi-god,
the cost of tele-operated robot bodies is dust in the wind.

Ah, but you are assuming current barriers to entry.  In a VR world,
the "videos" are entirely virtual.  So creating them is simply a
question of the amount of time one is willing to spend pixel editing.
So whether it is "real" actors "gifting" their acting (remember, they
don't have to *pay* to live) or "virtual" actors generated by computer
software agents generated by open-source projects supported by programmers
(who also dont have to *pay* to live) -- in the world you are describing
it seems like much of the entertainment should be "free".  Writers, actors,
producers, etc. evaluate themselves not in terms of *income* but in terms
of "market" share.  The idea that you could create something that 200
million entities would take an interest in is reward enough.

> Uploads will have expenses, and there will probably be advantages to being

One trips over the "probably".  If your energy is "free" and "guaranteed"
what else do you care about?  There will clearly be a two-tier economy.  The
corporate "buzz" economy and the open-source "free" economy.  The open-source
economy will limit the margins that the buzz economy can achieve.  I might be
willing to pay 5x for a "corporate" Volvo over an "open source" Volkswagon but
I'd not be willing to pay 10x or 100x.

People with any sense will realize that the "buzz" economy is largely
an ego/self-promotion driven economy.  There is no survival requirement
to play in that economy.  Its entirely driven off of "Oh my god, like
I got to see Britney Spears live, in concert" mentality.  There will
be some people that buy into that but I doubt it will be the majority.

Ultimately it will devolve into a two-tier pricing system -- the
"buzz" level dictated by my desire to be able to "brag" about the
fact that I got to see the *real* Britney Spears live in concert
and the "pragmatic" level that is willing to settle for the VR
equivalent of the "real thing".  If people really do in-depth
studies, the market mark-up will be limited to the *real* benefit
(how much additional security does this software/hardware really
provide) rather than the preceptions generated by advertising and/or
peer pressure.

Suggestion. Try downloading netscape (older 4.7 is actually better). Use this 
browser to attach to Yahoo.com.  Use netscape to see if you can obtain the 
ExI chat. Once you get to the chat, be sure to save it as a favorite room, on 
My Yahoo (if this works). I would recommend using cheetachat, or YahElite as 
a way to attach, afterwards, to ExI chat. Never need to use Netscape again. I 
use YahElite or Cheeta, once my ISP is connected, then just click my desktop 
Icon and bypass theYahoo signon regimen.

A few people have noted this as well.  I can only get it working in one of
my nine browsers.  The chat is built into Yahoo, and I don't have much
insight into how it works inside.

> Why don't we start an IRC channel?

I used to be much more active on IRC.  The problem is that it doesn't spread
across all servers very well.  There are literally hundreds of different IRC
networks, and a channel on one can't see messages from a similarly named
channel on another.  I have tried to meet people on IRC, and have had to
search through dozens of channels with the same name until I found the
correct one.  I don't think anybody has chatting working really well yet.

We will have to find a better alternative if a lot of people can't use
Yahoo's chat.

I assumed that this wry reference to the formula used by the vile
inquisitorial House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the USA during the
1950s would do, but I see now that it needs a bit more work.

The background political assumptions of Australians appear to differ in
subtle and less subtle ways from those of Americans, and even more from
those of many Europeans. I found a quote today that helps position our
historic standpoint; it's from Alfred Deakin, an early Prime Minister of
the nation, who in 1906 (just five years after Federation) said this:

`The best thing that Australians could do was to make the country so
productive, so good a place to live, and bring about such just and fair
conditions, with such  fair opportunities for earning an honest living,
such protection against monopolies, that other people would also want to
become Australians.'

Federation was celebrated a week or so back, and occasioned an essay by
novelist and public intellectual Thomas Keneally, who wrote in part of:

`the more than 800,000 Australian children--more children than were living
in the whole of Australia at the time of Federation--both of whose parents
are on welfare.

`And whatever side of the welfare debate one takes, we are all united today
in seeing this as undesirable, in knowing that it is costly in all sorts of
ways, and brings misery and hostility into the lives of most of those
affected.

`Although... there may not be enough jobs to go around, and this may become
increasingly the case for the so-called less-skilled workers, the souls of
the poor, and the souls of those 800,000 children, are as skillfully
calibrated as anyone else's in the capacity to feel want, rejection and
despair... But the great thing is that most of us still believe our society
is flexible enough, and blessed with sufficient wealth and resources, to
amend whatever faults we see in it.' He cites Peter Botsman, a left
theoretician, who argues that `part of the achievable answer... consists
not of condemning people to hopelessness, but of "giving back control and
power to people and communities to solve their own problems". That, and
schemes of enlightened volunteerism, of creative programs that will give
dispossessed children access to a broader world, can rescue threatened
families.' He continues with appeals to the fraternal and typically
skeptical voluntarism of those who fight raging bush fires, which is akin
to the heroism of the men in New York during the terrorist attacks, except
that these people are not professionals.

This provides the flavor of Australian views; I would add (for what it's
worth, and because I was asked) that my own understanding of this sentiment
in theory and practice leans toward traditional anarchism, of a
communitarian kind--the sort of mutual support that only free men and women
can offer each other. 

Don't mistake that for socialism, or I'll have to order the Commissar to
take you off to the Gulag.

I believe that this was faked by the landoverbaptist.com site as part of the
joke.  When I visited earlier, it said something like "Uptight, bitter
Christians who bought this book also bought...."  When I checked the page,
it was not being loaded from Amazon as similar sections on other booksites
are.  The biggest clue was that the other books went to other sites and
didn't go to Amazon where they would get the money if a purchase was made.

Sorry, this speculation has zero correlation with the reported incidents
over two days, allegedly with radar contact, photographs, a Lt Col leading
the investigation team on the second night and allegedly seeing beams of
light blasted downward from a UFO, blah blah. James Easton and others have
now picked the entire story apart, and it seems to be a congeries of
confusion, misinterpretation of local light sources, group hysteria, maybe
some genuine oddity (an early model Stealth aircraft? were they trialling
such things in 1980? In Britain?), and lots of subsequent abduction
bullshit, hypnosis conflation, the delicious lure of TV and conference
appearances...

Which browser is it working in for you? I use Opera, and the message it gave me said to 
download a new version of Netscape if you see the error message.

That's true. But we could still set up a channel that would be the official ExI chan. List it 
on the Yahoo site and maybe even the ExI homepage, saying "This is where you go if 
you want to chat!"

Yeah. I wonder if I can get to it through Yahoo messenger....

Look at the domain more closely. *.org is for nonprofits, at least putatively. Whitehouse.ORG is not whitehouse.gov. And
whitehouse.com is a porn site (or was last time I looked).

In general, one may go to www.netsol.com and use the whois button (or just go directly to
http://www.netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois), then see what is revealed. 

In the case of whitehouse.org, I find:

Actually, lots of the radar systems have problems with bird returns,
when the radar first locks onto one bird, then another a few miles away,
thinking it's the same aircraft, it thinks then that the aircraft is
travelling at a terrific rate of speed with a very small (bird-like ;))
radar cross section. This is a matter of calibration. I do recall that
the triangular UFO stories out of Belgium were correlated with false
radar returns of this type that were so odd that at one point the
alleged UFO flew at a negative altitude, which is obviously impossible.

The results of the Christmas Quiz are out (http://www.guardian.co.uk/quiz/).  
I only got one answer right of the ones I hazarded on my own.  One of the ones 
I chimed in on (Lone Star's flower) was incorrect.  It should have been 
Bluebonnet.  I didn't notice any of our Texans correcting us on that.

The whole thing leaves me with almost as many questions as answers.  
Other than the sections that are obviously obvious only to Brits (and 
others who still have ties to the empire, Damien?) and the themes that 
were made apparent by the answers (blue, fish, Victoria), can anyone cast 
more light with the answers in hand?

Here's one we should have known, or at least should remember:

3.6  according to Swift, what every man desires to do is "live long".

And what is section 13 about?  

13 Uncover:

 1 Tate 
 2 Hero 
 3 Garbo 
 4 Cicero 
 5 Tramp 
 6 Tricycle 
 7 Sniper 
 8 Artist 
 9 Sonia

Scramble surname, you get Snow plus change, but maybe that's irrelevant.

This sort of parochial rubbish might be known to obsessed
British-Australians yearning for `Home', but not to me (aside from Mir):

                            Question 18: 1 New car licence numbers; 2 Mir
                             space station; 3 Des O'Connor (autobiography,

                             Bridge, The Eyelid); 5 Glenalmond; 6 brain (BSE

                             (slapped with flower in Riga). 

I did get 5 of the 10 Q. 6 options right, and should have done better.

Excellent. So a victim-disarming monopoly on the use of deadly force is prohibited, of course. Also, the monetary system shall not
be imposed by monopoly fiat: forcing nearly everyone to become bonded debt-slaves to the Statists/bankstas. These items, along with
income-tax slavery, monopoly public "education" (i.e. Statist indoctrination camps) and monopoly Social Security pyramid schemes are
some of the most demeaning, unjust, evils (meaning "to cause harm") perpetuated by the protection racket occasionally referred to as
the State. I've never been down under, but I'd move there in a heartbeat if the above organized-crime schemes were absent.

Yes, I agree, though different words might be selected.

Webster's 3rd-
communitarianism: n, a communal system of organization based on small (?) cooperative communities practicing some communist
principles.

Communitarian Platform:
http://www.gwu.edu/~ccps/RCPlatform.html

is a gold-mine of distilled evil- I copped some of the phrases from this document for the earlier spoof on Neo-Feudalistic world
government, such as
"...moral education and character formation..."; "...character formation and moral education...";
"...A good citizen ..."; "...encouraging others to pay their fair share [to Massah']..."; "...national particularism ...";

"...Our communitarian concern may begin with ourselves and our families, but it rises inexorably to the long-imagined community of
humankind..." code for "let's conquer the world and impose H.G. Well's socialist dictatorship". World conquest and domination is an
inexorable force of nature in some minds.

and my personal favorite-

"Those who neglect these duties, should be explicitly considered poor members of the community."

Interestingly and tellingly, there is little difference between this platform and that of the German National Socialists (colloq.
"Nazies") of the 1920's-1940's. Right and left-wings are two "fuzzy" faces of the same conceptual disfunction: Statism.

> Don't mistake that for socialism, or I'll have to order the Commissar to

Thanks for the offer, sport, but I already live on or about the socialist shithole of Plantation USA, picking my "fair share" of
cotton for the greater grandeur of Massah'. I use Karl Marx's definition of socialism: the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto,
abolition of private property (slaves don't own property), dissolution of the family, etc., which is a fairly accurate,
funtionalistic description of the contemporary US System.

Bless my ears and whiskers, my ignorance is a never-ceasing source of
appalled amazement. I'm reading a quite charming book, THE COMMON THREAD,
about the sequencing of the human genome, by Sir John Sulston (with pop sci
Georgina Ferry). Dr Sulston led the publicly funded British end of the HGP
until 2000, and I'm looking forward to learning the dirt on Francis Collins
vs Craig Venter and all. However, before I can get to that, I'm forced to
plough through a tutorial on how what DNA is and how it works--

And I find that I don't even know where genes are stored.

I'd thought they sat all jumbled up, protein-coding exon chunks jammed in
between the raving lunacy of 98+% of intron viral rubbish plus useful
non-coding control sequences, on what one might regard as the working
strand. Its complementary strand idled in neutral, waiting as a redundant
mirror image useful for proofreading purposes and corrections of chance
errors in the data strand. No. *Both* strands contain genes, running in
opposite directions. Did you know that? Am I the only idiot in the room?

`Some genes are on one strand of DNA and some on the other, read in
opposite directions... Some small genes on one strand can actually sit
inside the introns [the `junk' or non-coding regions] of the other.' (p. 40)

Of course we all knew about reading frames and how they can overlap in some
cases *on the same strand*. But this is entirely fresh to me.

>From all I had read, I think the post below best expresses my ideas with a qualifier:

I wish to state that I don't think anyone can live forever, and not even Type IV or above civilizations. One day, our universe will
end and with it us. Even if we travel to other universes, constantly hopping from one to another as each terminates, accidents can
happen that will stop our existence.


This does not even come close to asking why we would like to survive just for the sake of surviving. Should we live just for the
sake of living (as some transhumanists seem to imply)? Should we exist just because a bunch of genes pulls some levels in our brains
and commands: "Reproduce!"

Should we follow the convention of existing just because others had continually existed before us? Why do death and extinction sound
so bad if our genes, not our brains, does the answering of this question?" Should we think of us as mechanical clogs in the machine
of life just following our preprogrammed genes to continue existing?


Hitler would find it useful to say in court that he would only want to cleanse the human race of some lower life forms that ought
never to exist. If you have to play prosecutor, how would you rebut each of his assertions? If you play the judge, how do you arrive
at the decision of what to do with Hitler? If you have to play Hitler's defense attorney, what can you say in defense of him (other
than that he adopts a vegetarian lifestyle). Lastly, if you play Hitler, how do you verify the validity of your set of values in the
trial?

How do we arrive at all these assertions if we have no idea why we exist?


A number of us had probably not consider the possibility that Digital Physics and God can co-exist (with God as programmers outside
the simulation), though He/She/It/They would probably not have such egoistic desires that some others had believe (like requiring
absolute belief in Its existence or your entry into a computer simulation that will inflict pain on you for apparently forever).

I wonder if reading about Zen will help or not. It seems to me like saying: "Life has no purpose, but only suffering. However, you
should not crease to exist because you can help other beings realize this and reduce the amount of suffering."

Of course, the Zen master would probably knock my head and say "MU" if I ask him/her about the meaning of life (or existence).

http://www.easternreligions.com/zen.html

Hope this helps.


BTW, you can call me Eric Chen when referring to me. I know my middle name causes problems with non-Chinese speakers.

So goes the litany of evils that so many Americans seem to project upon the 
kind of mild, almost disinterested, social responsibility that seems to 
color Oz.

You know what is the strangest thing? The people who foam most strongly at 
the mouth when screeching about the evils of society are those who have 
benefitted most from it. Those who have been born into the richer classes, 
who have gained their wealth and knowledge from countless generations 
before them, demand that they alone be recognised as being the creators of 
their good fortune and that they are damned if they will share it with 
anybody else.

I'm sure you don't really know how lucky you are Mr Bishop. You have become 
insulated from the real world. Surely you don't really think that USA is 
anything approaching communist. This must surely be chest-beating, soapbox 
hyperbole... your favorite rant... not anything to do with the real world.

It started for me in Mozilla for Linux, but the layout is rather crammed
to the extent of having a zero-width input field. Also, I'm not quite sure
if it ever got connected, since the CS department has a rather picky
firewall. It actually seems from the chat documentation that they're not
really motivated to make it work anywhere except Windows, which kind of
makes it not an option for me.

Yes, just spesify an IRC network along with the channel. I could suggest
DALNet even though I don't use it myself currently, because it seems to
have servers with few access restrictions in the US and EU and some other
places. EFNet and IRCNet are generally more geographically confined,
though there are probably some servers that would allow cross-continent
participants. In case of using one of them it'd probably be nice to list
some of such generous servers as well.

Can you prove otherwise? Government has always operated more as a
hindrance to individuals attaining wealth than a help. How, in fact, did
government give Bill Gates $60 billion? How has it given Harvey, or
Brent, or any other successful extropian their wealth. Every one of them
will demonstrate how they worked their butts off for it.

While I don't deny that there are those who make a career of feeding at
the public trough, and some of the smart ones even get rich at it, but
the overwhelming majority do so just to avoid doing real work.

While Forrest's litany is certainly dead on accurate, the number one
thing wrong about Oz is that its residents are not sovereign citizens,
and never have been. In the treaty of independence, it explicitly states
that the parliament is the sovereign power and that it has obtained its
sovereignty from the just delegation of the Queen of England.

As such, the residents will never be more than serfs (and surfers)
living in a lotus eaters paradise (until the lotuses run out).

You apparently don't know much about the US. Its actually quite a
pastiche of systems from state to state, although the last half century
has imposed a federal blanket of socialist confiscation upon everyone.
It's tax system is rigged so that you either surrender any margin that
would serve to make you wealthy, or you have to become a tax criminal to
escape wage slavery.

Yes, Fredkin physics and Jurgen Schmiudhuber papers. At this pouint, unless a

cryonics, the question, as you have suggested, is pendantic. Of course, that 
has never stopped anyone on this list from addressing such an issue, 
including myself.  

You think of a 'raison d' etre' for survival, I would surmise the need for 
intellectual stimulation, and the need for even digital minds to obtain a 
temporary condition of satisfaction. Satisfaction can be 'inherently, 
engineered, into such uber beings to be self-contained, and self-satisfied, 
and thus when a particular cosmos or domain ceases, the minds that inhabit 
them would also. 

Back to the 'raison', think of dead universes, and the desire for enjoying 
watching them brought to life (digital or otherwise) and seeing evolving uber 
minds evolving is many of those. Kind of fun for the uber minds, especially 
if the results are difficult to predict.

I knew that... :-)  I wouldn't go so far as to call oneself an "idiot"
for not knowing it.  It isn't exactly obvious.

Actually having a small gene within a gene might occur but
having interleaved genes coding in the same direction on
the same strand is likely to be pretty rare.  The splice
joining signals have a pretty standard signature and separating
those for Gene A from Gene B would be pretty difficult if
they were interleaved.

The current mystery from my knowledge base is the degree of alternate
splicing that occurs and what regulates it.

I'll gently chide Max by asking him to read this essay by Richard Stallman
discussing how to discourage the use of closed source software:

http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/01/10/1711238&mode=thread

I'm sure Harvey could comment here as well.

I know of no greater risk to humanity than a breakout amoral AI
that piggybacks on closed source software.

Choose open source -- even if it means sacrificing functionality.
Your life may depend on it.

I believe that this is because they have the mistaken belief that life is a
zero-sum game.  They cannot conceive of the poor getting more money without
them losing theirs.

It's not just you, and it's not just genetics.  I find that in all my
different areas of expertise, the technical details discussed on this list
are wrong most the time.  I am really beginning to believe that for area of
study there is a large complex body of knowledge, and an incomplete
simplified model that is given to the public.

The two do not match up.  Things simply don't work the way we think they do.
There is too much information for us to understand it all.  Scientists, news
media, teachers, books all give us a simplified and incomplete view to give
us an idea about things, but so many details are left out that we really
could not make them work right if we tried.

I hope I'm not just being depressing, but there really is a difference
between common knowledge and real expertise.  It takes years to get a handle
on most areas, and reading Usenet for a few years is not the same thing.  I
think this is why most experts do not participate in these online
discussions.  They are so far removed from their real area of study that
there is no point in getting involved.

Unfortunately, Yahoo's own help says it only supports Internet Explorer 4.0
and above and Netscape 4.0.7 and above.  Earlier versions don't work and
other browsers don't work.  Even with those two supported browsers, some
people have problems.

Um, I won't say "don't bother", but don't bother - at least, not for that
particular reason.  Open-source security is hot stuff when you're
competing with other humans.  I'm not sure it'd make much of a difference
to an AI.  Worry about defending yourself from other humans, and keeping
the size of the petri dish small enough that we don't get evolving
(non-AI) computer viruses.

Yes, indeed. However, Extropians as a group are as cliquish as any other, and 
perhaps a small, char community/group on Yahoo, is just what is most, 
desired? So this seems not a problem unless one desires increased membership. 
Nope: increased membership is not necessarily, influential, membership. ;-)

Definitely.  Most security experts consider closed source software to be a
security threat.  It cannot be verified, contains more security flaws than
open source software, and requires giving the software vendor inside access
to your computer without being sure what they are doing.  The higher levels
of security control in most criteria systems actually require open source
and source code analysis.  Closed source software cannot be made as secure
as open source software according to these security ratings.

Steve Allen started out his book "Dumbth" by speculating why not-exactly
retarded adults would write fan letters to Morris the cat (of commercial
fame back in the 70s and 80s).  I've heard that soap opera stars routinely
get jeered or cheered by people (in supermarkets and the like) depending on
whether the character they play is a hero or villain.  And actors who've
played doctors on TV (Robert Young, for instance) used to run into people
asking them for medical advice.

I've never been able to understand this phenomenon (but then I've never been
able to understand the attractions of worshipping invisible, undetectable
and easily-pissed-off-though-sometimes-benevolent-because-they're-mysterious
superior beings).

I did not know that, but come to think of it, it does make sense.
Let's consider ourselves a little transcriptor machine, looking to read
some DNA and make RNA from it.  Here's some.  Now, which strand is which?
And which way is "forward"?  The DNA extends for thousands of miles in
each direction on our scale.  It's twisted around itself so there is no
way to distinguish one strand from a passive mirror.  And one direction
looks like the other.  So there is no reason we can't read genes in
either direction, and on either strand.

The only reason I could see for evolution to prefer using a single
strand and a single direction were if that created a more compact and/or
efficient way of packing all the genes into the DNA.  The real mystery
to me is why efficiency is seemingly not a factor and why junk DNA is
allowed to proliferate.  But given that efficiency is not an issue,
then in hindsight it is predictable that both directions and strands
could be used.

I think it's great for people to care about their neighbors, and to have
a sense of community.  I just don't think they should be forced to do it.
Can we agree to that?

I don't agree with this.  I have worked for many years on a security
program, PGP, with published source.  In my experience the degree of
review provided by the open source community is haphazard, random and
spotty.  Just publishing software as open source is no guarantee that
anyone will review its security flaws closely.

In my opinion and experience, a far more effective method is to pay
for an independent review by security experts.  I would rather trust a
closed source program which has been given a clean bill of health by a
review team I trust than one which has been published on sourceforge.net
for a couple of years with whatever degree of review and inspection the
public happened to give it.

Furthermore there is the risk that publishing software source code will
give more information to the bad guys to allow them to design exploits.
Sadly, this is often a greater motivation for identifying security
holes than an altruistic desire to improve the quality of someone else's
software.

The people for whom security is a life and death matter, like the military
and spy agencies, do not publish their internal software as open source.
I believe they share the belief that doing so is not the optimal way
to secure their software.  They rely on internal reviews, attack teams,
and closed source.

Does Bill really need $60 billion?  Sheesh, won't a paltry couple of billion
do anymore?

Granted, again, this is from my own personal experience ... but it is the
overwhelming majority of rich people I've known who have avoided doing real
work and it is the middle class or poorer people I've observed who have done
the most work, often to ease the life for the "poor" rich blokes.

Thats a highly sensible and commendable point of view. It's also the

That doesn't make sense to me. Genes can be read off both strands
because efficiency IS important.  It is important in bacteria (the
shorter it is, the quicker it can reproduce) and in viri (which has to
pack it into a protein) which is exactly where you are more likely to
see the tricks of genes on both strands and multiple reading frames on
each (and where junk DNA is non-existant).

Well, if the middle class folks wish to continue being the victim, whose

Envy is a piss-poor reason to push for changes. There are more useful reasons 
to honk for change, such as better, fairer, freer, technologies. Even, 
Freeman (the socialist) Dyson has advocated this. So lets focus on thangs

Why would anyone work if they already had enough money, and didn't have
some other goal such as the Singularity?  I mean, some rich blokes decide
to go on working even after they have enough money, and that's fine with
me, but I don't see any reason why the opposite case isn't acceptable
too.  As far as I'm concerned, yon rich blokes have simply made some tiny
increment of progress toward the reasonable standard of living that I
expect to someday be available to everyone.  And incidentally, who are
these rich blokes you know?

No envy here.  I just don't understand how some human beings (one not
essentially different from another) are worth billions and some are barely
valued at all (no matter how hard they work - and by "work" I mean doing
something that takes away from one's leisure and personal time).  That some
human beings are worth a BIT more than others I can understand.  But the
HUGE earnings gap by those at the top to those at the bottom - that I don't,
and looks like I never will - understand.  I've read the explanations
(written by the hunters, not the hunted), but they don't make sense to me.
Human beings are not that different one from another, and that's that.

To make it even harder -- answer the question -- When you make
an error copying DNA, such that you have base mispairings, how
does the repair machinery know *which* strand is wrong?

:-)

Copying it is relatively cheap compared to the cost of deleting
it and getting it wrong.  Since transposons allow easy duplication
of DNA that can subsequently evolved for extended uses retaining
them in the genome allows faster evolution and probably selects
for their retention.

Better questions are whether transposon activation is keyed to
stress as the SOS response is in bacteria and how pufferfish (Fugu)
have managed to keep the junk DNA so low (they only have a 400 MBP
genome which is very small for a vertebrate)?

Yes, but only in viruses and to a lesser extent bacteria do
you see examples of selective pressure to do *really* clever
things like overlapping genes.  Getting a piece of DNA
that does one useful thing when read one way and another
useful thing when read another way -- now *thats* real magic!

I agree.  But having closed source guarantees that interested parties cannot
review its security flaws closely.  It also prevents the customer from
verifying security, and they end up having to assume or trust the vendor
with no evidence of security.

You are exactly right.  I was sloppy in my statements.  By "open source", I
meant reviewed by third parties not involved with the development effort.
These independent experts do not have to be the public at large, but they
should not be the same company that developed the product.  You do get what
you pay for, and merely publishing source without ensuring that a proper
review is performed will not accomplish anything.

> Furthermore there is the risk that publishing software

I disagree here.  Security by obscurity does not work.  A closed source
application with many security holes will get abused more than an open
source application with few security holes.  If source code is published
(and actually reviewed, as you point out), it will have most security holes
fixed.  If a few slip by the experts, they will be fewer than the obvious
holes in some closed source applications.  Microsoft has closed-source
software, and its holes are well-known and often exploited.

I don't mind this.  Instead of relying on altruism to get security comments
back, we can trust that some people will selfishly scrutinize code to find
any minor flaw just to be able to brag about it.  This is a more dependable
motivation for free feedback.  They will work more diligently for their own
reward rather than for the code owner's benefit.

I have extensive experience in reviewing and testing such classified
software.  It is often riddled with obvious design flaws that were
overlooked because there was not enough peer review of the software.
Although the military will never go to the open-source model, they are
increasingly requiring independent review by experts not connected with the
development effort.  They are learning that too much closed-door development
actually reduces security.

Your main point about hiring security experts and not just expecting the
public to debug open-source code for free, is exactly right on.  Open source
by itself does not guarantee any security.  An independent security review
by experts is what is required.

If you look at anyone who is really wealthy, most of that wealth
was generated by capital appreciation and not from salary.  If you
look in detail at SEC reports, you will find that the "income"
that top executives get is heavily weighted as value from the
appreciation of stock options.  They get rich because they are
making other people richer.

I'll give you a first hand story.  As many of you know during the
1980's Oracle and Sun were very high growth companies.  After they
went public the "expectations" were that they would double in size
and profits every year.  Well it doesn't take a Doug Jones to figure
out at some point that has to be an unrealistic assumption.  But
when the "street" expects you to do it corporate executives are
on the hook to perform.  Around 1991 Oracle "hit-the-wall".  But
because the pressure was on the VP of sales, some corners were cut,
some sales were booked before they actually took place, etc.  When
the dust settled the earnings had to be restated and a near Enron-style
meltdown of the stock valuation took place.

If you go look at the chart, it appears as a minor "bump" in the
overall history of the company.  But at the time it wasn't at all!
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ORCL&d=c&k=c1&a=v&p=s&t=my&l=on&z=m&q=l

The repercussions were not insignificant.  There were a number
of shareholder lawsuits.  The company did make payouts to the
shareholders.  People were calling Larry and telling him he had
just cost them their entire retirement accounts, etc.

The reason executives receive high compensation is because they
are playing high stakes games.  And at times the pressure gets
to be too much as the recent ex-Enron executive suicide shows.

But human beings *are* different in the positions they hold, how
much "wealth" they are responsible for, how creative they can
be (for better or worse), etc.

Individuals who receive extraordinary compensation or who have
extraordinary net worth are those who have demonstrated they
can see the opportunities, steer the ship and return value to
the people who bet on them.

Ok. I am not saying this is fair, or how the world should be, However, it 
seems to be a part of randomness that serves,among other things evolution.  I 
believe that when intelligent life has a better fix on mannipulating matter

tthrow away your cares and concerns about inequality and unfairness and 
deprivation. Or as my paternal grandfather was quoted; "come the revolution,

How do we know we can fulfill all the following criteria:
1) live in a computer simulation
2) have sentient beings outside the simulation taking an interest in us
3) that sentient beings actually bringing us "alive"
4) that they will treat us with pleasant circumstances
5) that no accidents will occur to break this thread of events (like a computer crash)

-- and --

6) that we have a sufficient definition of what we call the "self"
[what do we mean by the self?]

7) that it still matters after we die (as our "original" consciousness had disappeared
[if someone made a copy of you and instantiate you at another place, does it matter to the original "you"?]

8) that our host universe will last forever, or it consists of a simulation that will fulfill the above creteria and this forever
(in a never-ending loop)


What if we have to die one day? How would we confront with the situation that, despite our technological powress and knowledge, we
will still have to die?

The purpose of existance I seek does not concern itself with absolute "right" and "wrong", or even a factual answer (like genes and
"preprogrammed" disires). It does not matter who and what preprogrammed, predisposed or did whatever to our universe, but why do we
even bother to continue subjecting ourselves to these assuming that we could break free of these and look at the question
objectively. The factual answers may give an apparent meaning, but that provides only an illusion (or a "sham", as Plato puts it).


This question concerns itself with every one of us, asking: "Why do you bother to live when you have to die eventually? You want to
achieve this or that, but do they really matter if everyone has to die eventually?"

Strangely, this being still does not understand the preceptions of others who thought this question has lesser importance or
relevance.

An optimistic neologism?  I thought it might be original, though
I did find a use of "Fear, Uncertainly, Doubt, Greed, Envy".

The new strand isn't yet properly methylated.  
Repair enyzmes can alter the unmethylated strand
before the methlation-copying enzymes get to it.

even humanity in general, at present)

Right; DNA is only about 2% of dry weight.
The extra energetic costs are small, and to
fix it requires millions of advantageous mutations
(one to ditch each piece of junk.)  So the per
fix advantage is very small - 1 x 10^-8 or so.

Transposons select for their own retention.
There's millions of them in your genome, 
probably hundred of active ones, all evolving
against control mechanisms, plus others dropping
in from time to time from other species or
from retroviruses.  It's like asking why we're
not immune to viruses, really.

Maybe.  Theory suggest they should only replicate
in germ-cell lines, which is rather different from
stress.  It's a plausible hypothesis of mine that
increased sexual activity will rev up accidental
non-germline transposon activity and this is a model
for the inverse relationship between sexual activity
and lifespan and possibly the CR effect.

Yes, that's a doozy!  And they did it by making
each stretch of junk smaller, but retaining (roughly)
the # of introns per gene.  There's a guy here in
UC Riverside working on that a little - but he says
it's very hard because aligning the introns with 
relatives is very ambiguous.

We are no longer slaves to evolution.  We have the power to ameliorate some
changes now, and need not simply sit around letting them eat cake (to
forestall allocating some truly important things, like ... national health
insurance).

Yes, if  it happens and when it happens ... but what about in the meantime?
We have the resources to effect good changes now (and just in case things
don't turn out as fast and as optimally as we would wish).

Hee hee.  Funny, my paternal grandfather cursed the revolution, but that was
a totally different revolution (Russian, 1917) ... when his strawberries and
cream were temporarily suspended.  (But seriously, I know which revolution
you're talking about.)

I understand completely what you are saying here. How can you make a
difference, when all you can really do is to be born, rearrange atoms for a
time, then die? 

It seems that, when we decide that we exist in a universe with no objective
"purpose" built in, we have no foundation for any choice of moral criteria.
There is no point to anything in such a scenario, by definition. 

People have been claiming that you can just draw a line in the sand...
choose your own axioms for systems of purpose, morality, etc. This had been
my position until recently too, and I guess it still defacto is, given that
I have nothing to replace it.

Unfortunately, that seems to be a house of cards. The problem is that you
can change your mind about your fundamental axioms, and are ignoring the
question "how do I choose my axioms? Why?". This underlines the fact that
these so called "chosen axioms" are not axiomatic after all, and are in fact
derived from somewhere else. Where? Probably an heterogenous mishmash of
prior social programming, lurking under the covers. Unsatisfactory. And when
we try to apply a structured system, like scientific inquiry, to the task,
no headway is made.

People dismiss this question in general, I think, because it is very very
hard, upsetting to contemplate, and has no real impact on day-to-day life
(or so they like to delude themselves).

I think I need to read a bit of philosophy to be able to make any progress
on this point.

(end)

I do agree with your sentiments that the world is a very unfair place!  But I do understand why it is that way(at least to an extent)!  Two human beings may not outwardly seem all that different, but can be worlds apart when it comes to intelligence, education to utilize that intellect, personality traits, ambition levels, family backgrounds, and whether they were born into a nation offering the right opportunities for them to have at least a fighting chance.  

So I can fully understand how some people are worth billions due to a combination of hard work, education, brilliance, and political connections, while another person is poor through a combination of not getting the lucky breaks of good birth to the right people(for the right nature and nurture), lacking ambition, not being able to get an education, etc.  

What DOES bother me is that people(in both the first and third world) can work hard to provide for themselves and their families, and yet still not have enough for adequate nutrition, shelter medical care, and education.  Some people may say that is just how life is, and that it's their own tough luck.  But I just can't look at it that way.  I think one reason for the transhumanist desire for a singularity, is to see every human being well cared for.   

you continue:
That some
human beings are worth a BIT more than others I can understand.  But the
HUGE earnings gap by those at the top to those at the bottom - that I don't,
and looks like I never will - understand.  I've read the explanations
(written by the hunters, not the hunted), but they don't make sense to me.
Human beings are not that different one from another, and that's 
that.
(end)

Our opportunities and abilities to gain and keep resources are often HUGELY varied.  The capitalist system generally rewards those who fulfill a need, even if to "fulfill" a market opening means sometimes to unfairly manipulate and dominate.    
 
Olga, I think you are using your emotions and good heart to traverse a topic which has a lot of harshness regarding it, and shows us how even the best systems so far to generate wealth and economic growth have a long way to go.

Again, I hope with technological growth combined with human competance, we will see the ancient plague of true poverty stamped out.  And I'm not talking about the relative poverty of a 22nd century person in a near-Utopia, but the grinding poverty of the present where people go to bed hungry, suffer malnutrition, don't get immunized, get only a few years of schooling, and suffer years of monotonous hard work for pay which does not even meet their basic necessities.  There are of course various degrees of poverty among the inhabitants of this world, and they all are something in need of overcoming. 

best wishes,

John

Plenty of envy here, I'm not proud. :)

But envy doesn't constitute an argument, nor a moral basis for changing the
way things are. Not by itself.

I gather that the best current explanation (which of course serves the
interests of the obscenely rich, and so is as suspect as proclamations by
the tobacco industry of the healthy effects of smoking) is that it's a side
consequence of the market system we all love for its unparalleled success:
a side effect due to the kind of power law that kicks in with all such
systems `on the edge of chaos', as they used to say at Santa Fe. 

A power law, of course, describes systems like avalanches and word usage
frequency, where some few words are used very, very often or some enormous
avalanches happen very, very rarely, and other instances following a power
curve up or down the scale (see Per Bak's HOW NATURE WORKS). If this is
validly applied to economics, then any market system will generate,
willy-nilly, a few owners tottering on billions (however unstably), say ten
times as many with hundreds of millions, 100 times as many with tens of
millions, 1000 times as many with millions, and lots and lots of us schmucks.

Now plainly people can *decide* to stop it happening that way, by
confiscation or voluntary potlatch or inventing new disjunctive technology,
but the argument is that doing so (except for the last case) yields a less
than optimal--even catastrophically munged--outcome. Might be so. Certainly
there *are* plenty of these power law phenomena in human affairs, as there

And the left says "why wait for a Singularity?  We can care for people
_now_."

Compared to most of agricultural history the Singularity has already
happened.  Used to be most people worked their butts off just to grow
food, and a small elite skimmed the surplus.  Now 3% or less of the US
population works directly producing food (although more may be building
tractors, obtaining fuel, driving trucks around) and a lot of the
population is doing weird abstract 'work' subsistence farmers wouldn't
think of.  The poor are obese instead of starving, clothing is cheap,
housing is cheap, life expectancies are at record highs...

You want a Singularity?  Wotcha waiting for?  Sure, there's more work to
be done.  But if you want to reduce pain and fight the unfairness of the
universe, there's plenty of slack to start now.

(Concrete example: we're about to spend $7 billion on missile defense.
That could buy lots of vaccines for Africa, or DDT-treated mosquito
netting to fight malaria, or clean water...)

Well, it depends if you mean millionaires or billionaires.  I know a few of
the former, not the latter.  One ex-husband.  Several friends whom I've

I think it might prove more helpful to frame the issue not in terms of worth, 
which risks confusing economic with moral issues, but rather in terms of 
wealth.  It may not seem too surprising that some individuals control 
billions in assets while others have almost no money, at least not when you 
think about how the ability to earn money varies widely from person to 
person.  But it does and should seem odd to think that a rich person "is 
worth" more than a poor one, at least in an ethical sense.  A fiancially poor 
father may have inestimable value in his child's eyes, after all.

Yes, I'm quite impressed with the chat so far.  I've popped in a few times 
each day and enjoyed it quite a bit, talking with John Grigg, Max, and 
getting to know some list-lurkers.  It's almost like a one-dimensional, 
unfocused Extro conference!  Perhaps we can arrange some weekly time that a 
number of us are on the system at once.

I don't know if we should want to exist or not but the fact remains
that we do. As for the purpose of life, I'll tell you exactly what that
is just as soon as you tell me what the purpose of purpose is.
In the meantime I'll quote Gertrude Stein:
"There ain't no answer. There ain't going to be any answer.
There never has been an answer. That's the answer."

Summer 1993.  Same e-mail, different names; same funny symbols in the

...I'd forgotten that old epithet.  Or epithets.  "The Low Willow" was a
play on Vinge's "Cricketsong under the High Willow".  "Low Golden
Willow"... oh, after Hodgell's ambulatory plants.

No Dr, just applying to grad school (cog sci) this spring.  Won't be Dr.
for some years.

Actually, I think it would be Dr. Twirlip, no?  (You have to be at least a 
four year list veteran to get that...)

But that's the thing.  Does the ability to earn money really vary by a
factor of a million from person to person, in their own right?  How much
of that variance is from the person, and how much from the position in
society they happen to occupy, which any non-moron could exploit?  If a
lot comes from the position (no one would say it all does, but a lot
might), then we could contemplate a society with fewer bottlenecks to be
occupied by lottery.  (Or more but less lucrative ones.)

This could cause the unbearable situation that change is taking
place and there is no one to sue.  And nothing to protest against.
Perfectly good activist energies could go to waste.

This is a global version of the perfect ice problem: the real challenge
is how to stay in one place.  Will we get to the point where we use
our technologies to try to keep the earth's climate exactly the same
as it is today?  Why?  spike

Many passwd entries have I had, in my youth.  Now I am old and dull.  :) Apart
from experimenting with my middle name as a last name.  (Too many Damien
Sullivans out there.)

I'm glad people remember me, though. :)

Wow!  That was a fun marathon session!  I never expected I would spend a

Who's talking about _waiting_ for a Singularity?  Waiting for a
Singularity is not compassion any more than waiting for someone else to
solve world hunger.  Actively working for a Singularity is just as
compassionate as working to distribute food packages, and currently
enormously more leveraged given the current disparity in investment
between these two alternate approaches.

I thought this article was rather interesting:

Birth dearth can turn Japan into nation of ancients

http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,644033,00.html

If societies don't reorient their perspectives on maintaining
the health (and work capacity) of individuals who are aging
and move away from pension systems that are really wealth
transfer systems (from the young workers to the older retirees)
the downward spiral may get very messy indeed.

You know what? I'm dont' want to be a slave to evolution, but I don't
see anybody rewriting human DNA yet, so your statement is a mite
premature.

However, you may recall that I have been unemployed for almost 10 months
now, yet I seem to be one of the most pro-capitalist voices here. If
capitalism were only about self interest, I should rationally be
plotting a socialist revolution right now, if I were serving my self
interest. 

As an unemployed person, the only thing that motivates me to get out of
bed in the day is the hope of finding a job that will lead to a highly
lucrative career. If only average wage, dead end, seniority restricted,
union rule dictated jobs were available to me, THAT is when I'd start
plotting a revolution, if I had any motivation to get out of bed.

Take away my hopes of captialist success, and you might as well just
shoot me.

THIS is why capitalism works, and why nobody "needs" to prove that they
have a "need" for enormous wealth. The fact that they have it is its own
proof that the economy needs people as savvy as them to handle the
responsibility of all that capital. Government certainly can't manage
capital worth spit.

How does this question pertain to the debate at hand? We were debating
whether government helps or hinders people getting rich. "Need" is
completely irrelevant when it comes to exercising ones natural human
rights. You don't "Need" to freely speak, or vote, or live free of
government searches, or own a home, or a car, or a toothbrush, do you?
Explain how you have a greater need of these things than any private
citizen does to make as much money as they are honestly capable of doing
through their own work and creativity.

Using "need" to rationalize away property rights is the hallmark of
socialist confiscatory-think.

You only see how rich people behave once they've gotten rich (and only
those who you KNOW are rich). The vast majority of the wealth in the US
is self-made. Far more millionaires earned it themselves than inherited
it. Are you then claiming that slavery is wrong, but only when applied
to a person's first $30,000 of income? Enslaving the labor of self made
rich people is okay?

study the behavior of any social/pack animal. and you will see many
instances of how those animals who are in power (high status) use
their power to squelch/keep down those who are without power (low
status).  Basically, our legal system is all about maintaining the
"status" quo.
Welcome to the wonderful world of the the social animal.

The Post article stated that Antarctica is the only continent that is
cooling.  As far as empirical data go the jury's in: in the last 100
years average land surface temperatures have increased by about 1 degree
Fahrenheit.  The most advanced climatic models indicate an anthropogenic
cause, but given the complexity of the subject it's always possible that
the current models are wrong. 

There's a good article in the current issue of Scientific American --
"Misleading Math about the Earth" -- that addresses global warming and
other environmental issues.  Check it out.

Today's climatic science has been so polluted by politically biased
science (on *both* sides, thank you very much) that I can no longer figure
out which side is lying and have given up.  Not even Google can determine

Agree we're animals, but we've come a long way, baby, in not necessarily
having to heed the call of our instincts 100%.  And that process of
civilization is ongoing and continuing as we speak ...

The trick of course is to exert any force perpendicular to the
frictionless surface.

Somersaults, crab-walking, even carefull hands-and-knees walking

Your statement includes inaccuracies. The majority of well to do
individuals in the U.S. earned it themselves in a single generation
as research on millionares by Thomas Stanley makes clear.

I'm guessing that you are refering to the specific group that
Miriam is refering to (greedy rich people) rather than those who
are financially well off.

Government policy in this country treats wealth as a zero sum game.

In this country it is the (social) democrats who argue over who
gets how big a slice of pie, and the republicians who say that what
we really need are more/bigger pies.

National Health Insurance is just another redistribute the wealth

Also now known by their latest buzz term "Economic Democrats".

There is a debate this morning on slashdot at
http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/04/1629246 about an article
claiming that Linux has more security holes than Windows.  Apparently
the methodology used for counting security problems is problematic in
this claim, but here is an example of how one person explained the
difference:

: Third: the study compares a kit of open-source software, which has
: received extensive peer review, to a closed-source product. It should
: surprise nobody that Linux has more documented problems than Windows:
: it's actually possible to go find vulnerabilities on Linux. Finding
: Windows vulnerabilities requires black-box reverse engineering.

This is just one guy's opinion, but it is one I have run into quite a bit
among security developers.  It seems very plausible that it is easier
to find bugs in open-source software than in closed-source software.
That is the primary reason offered to hope that it can be made more
secure.  But clearly this can come back and hurt you in that it also
makes it easier for the bad guys to find flaws as well.

Again the real issue is whether there is a well organized, active effort
to search out and fix bugs in the open source product.  Just publishing
the source will not automatically make that happen.  If you don't have
that, releasing source can actually hurt security.

After doing much research into the topic myself, I've basically come to the
conclusion that the 1 degree of movement in a century falls below the noise
floor and that nothing useful can be construed from it. Even if some of the
minor temperature increase is anthropogenic, it does not follow that people
are dramatically changing the climate.

What IS annoying is that even working under the assumption that the climate
is warming slightly, the vast majority of the people yammering on about it
have not the slightest clue as to what the consequences of that assumption
actually are.  The problem is that there is a very vocal group of people who
fall into this latter category who want the world to conform to their
"solution", which conveniently fulfills their political objectives but for
which their is a scientific disconnect with the assumption those solutions
are based upon.  Thanks, but no thanks; I don't feel like handing the reins
of the economy over to extreme ideologues with a demonstrated lack of
scientific integrity.  (Better the devil you know...)

I think a lot of the backlash against global warming, particularly in more
educated circles (where I've seen a lot of it), is less an argument against
the premise of global warming than it is an argument against those that have
hijacked the issue and are using it to construe all sorts of idiotic
conclusions that conveniently fit their political ideologies.  I think it is
arguable many of the groups that have hijacked the issue could potentially
be more harmful to the future of the human race than global warming will
ever be.

No, I don't think that is what Mike is saying, he is arguing that things are
much less certain than much of the reporting we get supposes. A lot of this
is being pumped up because it suits a particular political agenda (the same
is also true in the opposite direction). One problem is the lack of
historical perspective in much of this discussion. The historical evidence
(of the kind Mike Lorrey mentions) suggests that global temperatures are
back to where they were in the 11th/12th centuries. The Earth (outside
Antarctica) probably is getting warmer but not in a way that's without
historical precedent - which suggests it isn't anthropogenic. Steve Davies

Alas, my son, I see that you do not know the glorious power of Google. 
Google is one of the components of the Holy Trinity (with the others being
the Bayesian Probability Theorem and "Godel, Escher, Bach"); the power of
Google is not to be mocked by the unbeliever.  All things may be known to
those who know Google.

It is a complicated issue, how the economy will work in a future of
plenty.  I can't got into a lot of detail, but here are some reasons for
thinking that people will still engage in competitive economic behavior.

First, today the average middle class Westerner is so much wealthier
than our cave-dwelling ancestors of 10000 years ago that the difference
is almost unmeasurable.  By the standards of that time, we have reached
a pinnacle beyond any possible dreams of wealth and gratification.
Yet people still want more.  Even if the future is far richer in
material goods than today, chances are the same effects will exist.
Expectations will rise to match production.

Second, as you say the "feeling of being appreciated" is a significant
motivating factor.  I think that is what is underlying our quest for
advancement today.  We have an instinct for competition; we judge
ourselves by how well we are doing with respect to our neighbors.
We want to be admired and respected, to be accepted by those we admire.
All this motivates us to work and strive for success.

Most people today could quit work and live on welfare more comfortably
than even a reasonably wealthy person from hundreds of years ago.  Yet
few people are willing to drop out.  Lying in the sun and doing nothing
will be no more attractive in the future than it is today, if it means
that you live a miserable life compared to your peers.

Third, the "gift economy" is not a very well analyzed phenomenon.
It seems to me that even if we assume nanotech assemblers which produce
goods essentially for free (given matter and energy), you still have
the issue of designs.  Rich people will pay for designer originals
while the poor make do with generics.  Talented designers can get rich
creating one-off collectors' items which can be duplicated only crudely
by imitators.

Compare a designer gown with the imitation you can find at Sears.
It's not the same.  There are tremendous differences in human abilities,
and some people will be able to make far higher quality designs than
others.  Their work will look right, it will feel right, it will have
style and class.

You'll be able to get by on the freeware designs, but you won't feel proud
of them.  Again, your self esteem will depend on being successful, just
as is the case today.  Every time you have to download another piece of
crappy freeware you'll feel bad when you look at the catalog items you
have to pass by.

Fourth, there are still going to be expenses.  One is energy.  Another is
matter.  Many people will prefer authentic living space to a holodeck,
so land will be valuable.  Someone who has a beautiful home with an
attractive view will be much more admired than someone who lives in
a cardboard shack in an alley, even if the interior of the shack is
indistinguishable from a palace.

Energy isn't necessarily going to be cheap.  Whether it's solar or
anything else, supply and demand will set the price.  Rich people may
use far more energy than we can imagine today.  This could drive the
price out of reach of poor people.  Heat dissipation rights are another
potential cost where the rich could monopolize the resources, forcing
the poor to shut down their holodecks.

Fifth, another form of expense comes in the form of services.  The gift
economy is mostly going to work with designs which, once created, can
be replicated millions of times over.  Services are by their nature
customized and individual.  They are going to be at least as expensive
as today.  Necessary services will include legal advice, fire prevention,
health care, and protection (police/military).  The world is an uncertain
place, and things always go wrong.  Conflicts arise; there are bad
people out there who will do you harm if you can't defend yourself.
All this will cost money.

It's possible that the rich will be willing to subsidize some of these
costs for the poor, as they do today.  That's hard to predict.  But the
point is, people will still have expenses, and they will still be able
to improve the quality of their lives as well as their self esteem by
increasing their wealth.  Despite the astronomical increases in wealth
we have seen over the course of human history, at least in the West,
human motivations to work have not significantly decreased.  I don't
see a good reason for why this trend will change in the future.

Hal

Invisible hand. There is a demand for secure systems, therefore there are
companies that supply kits for making your open source OS secure. In the
case of the closed-source project, it doesn't matter what the demand is
doing if the owner doesn't want to spend money on making it secure. Google
"bastille linux" for example, and compare with similar efforts for Windows
(can't think of any? big surprise there...)

The greenhouse effect is real.  (See Venus, or basic planetary science
calculations about the temperature of the Earth.)
CO2 is a greenhouse gas.
We're pumping CO2, and other greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere.
Especially in the case of coal, the CO2 was sequestered hundreds of
millions of years ago when (1) the sun was dimmer than today and (2) the
Earth was warmer than today.

What's the basis for a default presumption that the Earth wouldn't be
getting warmer?

Someone else asked why we would want to keep the climate at a set point
even if we weren't responsible for changing it.  Well, I like the fact
that a good winter will kill a lot of insects and parasites.  Winter has
been called one of the larger contributions to northern public health.
I don't want to go home to Chicago some day and get malaria.

And with the 70 degree Decembers Chicago and Minneapolis have been
having for the past few years, that might not be so unlikely.  The cold
weather still breaks in by January, but the trend is rather alarming.

For a less alarmist view, there's all this coastal property to be
flooded...

Uh, NO again. While the majority of GOVERNMENT EMPLOYED climatologists
may agree, that embodies merely a fraction of all climatologists. Some
of the most respected and prolific climatologists, who have developed
much of the data that the UN's Climate Change reports are based on, have
protested that their data has been misinterpreted and abused by the
bureaucrats in NY and DC.

Nor are climatologists the only scientists who are involved in the
debate. Paleontologists, paleo-geologists and paleo-biologists, among
others, have made significant contributions to the debate, and the big
govt climatologists primarly disregard the long term data developed by
these people which covers thousands and millions of years because it
conflicts with their assumptions about extrapolating a mere generation
or century of data over geological time periods.

Astronomers and astrophysicists also contribute, with explainations like
the Malenkovich Cycles, which have a far greater impact on climate
change than any other single factor (somewhere between 1/4 to 1/2 of all
influence, in fact) but you'll rarely see one of these chicken little
climatologists admit even to the existence of such cycles, and when they
do they generally severely misrepresent them.

Out of curiosity...  if it _were_ proven beyond scientific doubt that
our emissions were warming up the planet, to dangerous levels, what
would the libertarian response be?  Note that "suing the polluter" isn't
obviously effective here, since the polluters are just about everyone.

Conversely, one Drextech scenario has been people sucking so much CO2
out of the atmosphere to build diamondoid structures with that a new Ice
Age gets triggered.  Same question applies.

The Banach-Tarski 'decomposition' states that it is possible to dissect a ball 
into (six) pieces which can be reassembled by rigid motions to form two 
balls of the same size as the original. At first glance this seems to contradict 
some of our intuition about physics. Consequently this decomposition is often 
called the Banach-Tarski 'paradox'. But, actually, it only yields some complication
to our knowledge of this word: ' volume ' .

Note the cycles, being astrophysically constant, explain only why the
individual ice ages come and go.  They don't do anything to explain why
we suddenly started having ice ages a few million years ago, or why the
overall trend for the last few tens of millions of years had been a
cooling trend.

The best explanation for _that_ which I've seen is the Himalaya
hypothesis: the continuous and large supply of uplifted fresh rock
has been scrubbing CO2 out of the atmosphere.   (CO2 and rain react with
rock in the natural weathering process.)

Hmm, that gives me an idea... if the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps
melted from warming, there might be a countereffect of CO2 reacting with
all that fresh rock.

This story is bogus.  SecurityFocus (specifically, ryan@securityfocus.com)
themselves denied the story and said that their stats were totally
misinterpreted or misrepresented.

1.  The numbers combined all different Linux systems together (Mandrake, Red
Hat, Debian, SuSe, etc.) but split all different Windows systems apart
(Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows 95, etc.)  For
example, Mandrake Linux had only 9 more bugs reported than Windows 2000.
Debian Linux had fewer bugs than either Windows OS.

2.  The Linux numbers include all applications that run under Linux.  The
Windows numbers do not include Outlook bugs, Internet Explorer bugs, IIS
bugs, etc.  Combining all thesee buggy apps with the Windows operating
system as they did with Linux gives Windows many more bug reports than
Linux.

3.  The article excluded the second half of 2001 when there was a dramatic
increase in bug reports for Windows.

When using the same criteria for both system, Linux clearly has many fewer
bugs than Windows.  The author of this article clearly was playing with the
numbers.  Even the source he is quoting is saying that he is misinterpreting
the statistics from their page.  Besides, Microsoft's own advertising claims
that they fixed 63,000 bugs in Windows 2000.

Not to mention copyright enforcement.  Intellectual property rights are
completely a government construct; the Appeal to Bill argument has thus
always struck me as utterly bizarre.  It's possible Gates would have
done well in an anarchy; it's also possible his particular business
skills would have been useless in that environment.  Or that he never
got the chance to try.  All we can say is that the first-order effect on
Microsoft of removing all government would be _horrible_.  Ask him if he
wants to live with totally legal software piracy.

So Bill Gates and Harvey and Brent are tax criminals?  They did become
wealthy, after all.

Tell me, without a central government, how would America have won the second
world war?  Retained it's position as a leader of global trade that has
allowed the massive economic growth of the 20th century?  Avoided a violent
revolution that could have displaced our elected government with a
repressive totalitarian regime?  No, Bill Gates did not get $60 Billion
handed to him by the US Government- it was the fact that we have a stable
social order and economy that allowed him to earn $60 Billion, which would
have been impossible under anarchy.

Huh?  Are we living in the same country, under the same tax system?
Although I pay little to nothing in taxes as a college student, I can tell
you that if the federal income tax was eliminated tomorrow, it wouldn't
change my family's lifestyle one bit (even though it would mean my father
would take home approximately $150,000 more per year).  Those of us with
little to no real income are unaffected by the government's "blanket of
socialist confiscation"- and those who complain the most vocally about it
typically have more income than they truly need.  Frankly, I don't mind it
one bit.

Saying that you can "dissect" a ball into six "pieces" is a bit
misleading.  What they would call a "piece", we would call "an arbitrary
set of real points that moves by translation and rotation".  In this case,
the term "arbitrary set" is to be taken literally; the sets can only be
constructed using the Axiom of Choice.

The term "dissect" is also misleading.  The pieces here cannot be created
by any number of cuts, no matter how large.  The sets of points do not
have analytic boundaries.  You can't create them by "cutting", even with a
curved knife.

Furthermore, you cannot cut up any object composed of a finite number of
atoms.  This isn't, as sometimes stated, because atoms are "too large". 
Even if the object were composed of an infinite but countable number of
atoms, it wouldn't be enough.

Just because you put more CO2 into the atmosphere doesn't mean you
will get warmer automatically.  You could (a) have a bloom in the
biosphere that can suck that CO2 right back down; (b) increased
temperature, increases evaporation, increases cloud cover, reflects
more sunlight back into space.  This is different from Venus where
things got started very early on, evaporating any oceans, allowing
the UV light to split off the hydrogen, which is then lost to space
leaving behind a waterless planet.  [I suppose this does raise
an interesting question -- what *are* the clouds on Venus made of?]

The climate modelers freely admit that their cloud models suck.

People tend to look at the down side of global warming -- the
up side is that there is a *lot* of land in Northern Russia
that suddenly becomes available for cultivation.

Sure, there are many effects, some countering.  But why believe that
they'll all balance out nicely once equilibrium is reached?  The very
variability of climatic history argues against that.  

And having a bunch of weird shit happen while waiting for things to
settle down isn't particularly attractive to me either.  (Or to the
insurance companies.  Aren't they getting more interested in climate
change, since they're the ones who pay for it upfront?)

Is it fertile land for our crops?  Does it get good rainfall and
sunlight?  Would it make up for extended droughts in the traditional
breadbaskets?

I'd support an increased energy/greenhouse tax in lieu of some of
our other taxes.  The only reason I'm not on that bandwagon now is
that I don't really believe other taxes would be decreased or
eliminated as a consequence of higher energy taxes.

Against the backdrop of full Drextech I suspect a new ice age would
be a relatively insignificant change.

Hm... my Holy Trinity represents Knowledge, Truth, and Beauty, in that

It should always be a red flag when your ideological preferences are in
alignment with your beliefs about an objective but controversial issue
like global warming.  An ideology is a useful tool but a terrible master.
In the interests of constructing an accurate view of the world, you must
be suspicious of easy and comfortable beliefs which conform with your
preferences.  In the long run, basing your life on falsehoods about the
world is dangerous.  Better to expend the mental energy to objectively
study issues even when they contradict your pet beliefs.

For a quick overview of the scientific consensus, I recommend last
year's report on Climate Change Science by the National Research Council.
It is available online at http://search.nap.edu/books/0309075742/html/.
The report is only 29 pages and begins with a 5 page summary.  Appendix B
includes biographies of the contributors which should put to rest any
contention that these are brainwashed government flunkies.  They are in
fact respected scientists with strong credentials, many of them members
of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences.

Here is an excerpt from the summary, reviewing the earlier report by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):

"The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50
years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas
concentration accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific
community on this issue.  The stated degree of confidence in the IPCC
assesesment is higher today than it was 10, or even 5 years ago, but
uncertainty remains because of (1) the level of natural variability
inherent in the climate system on time scales of decades to centuries,
(2) the questionable ability of models to accurately simulate natural
variability on those long time scales, and (3) the degree of confidence
that can be placed on reconstructions of global mean temperature over the
past millennium based on proxy evidence."

In my opinion, denying that human-caused global warming is the
consensus of the scientific community is putting our heads in the sand.
It represents the worst case of letting oneself be ruled by an ideology
rather than vice versa.  The reason we have scientists is so that
people can spend their entire lives becoming expert on questions such
as these.  Refusing to accept their conclusions because they contradict
our ideological beliefs is irrational.  No Extropian should allow his
mind to mislead him in this way.

For reference, a critical analysis of the NRC report by
the libertarian Reason Public Policy Institute is online at
http://www.rppi.org/rr103.html.  IMO this simply excerpts the caveats
and uncertainties listed in the NRC report, hoping to present bait which
will attract sympathetic ideologies.  A careful reading of the NRC report
reveals that strong statements like the above are made in the context
of the uncertainties which the report describes.  In other words, even
though the impact of human actions on warming "cannot be unequivocally
established", nevertheless the consensus of the scientific community is
that there is a link.  All the cautions and concerns that the Reason
people highlight do nothing to change the stated conclusions of the
report.  Science is never certain, but the Reason people wave around the
report's cautionary language as though that invalidated its conclusions.

In a "pure" anarchocapitalist state, "sue the polluter" is indeed the
solution, which you rightly point out is difficult, but not impossible.
Especially since plaintiffs are still likely to outnumber defendants.

In a mixed libertarian-leaning democracy-compromise government, the
government would set an overall total limit on the allowable amount
of some certain emission (or extraction), and issue trading rights.
Companies would buy and sell pollution rights on the free market; the
total level of pollution would be fixed (hopefully at roughly the
sustainable level), but who did the pollution would end up being
whoever produced the greatest benefit from it and was therefore able
to offer the highest price.  Higher prices would encourage research
into alternatives, and lower prices would encourage some people to
buy up the rights and bury them, reducing the overall levels.

If pollution rights are deemed to be evenly split among all the humans in
the world, then the market in environmental credits (go ahead, just try
and sell "pollution credits") may provide a small amount of income for
developing countries and low-income individuals.  Hopefully, this would
not have the usual problems attendant with wealth-redistribution schemes
and totally unearned income.

I don't think it would take much longer than five minutes before people
started complaining about too many credits, not enough credits, prices
being manipulated, and even antipoverty activists complaining about
low-pollution environmentalist technologies driving down market prices,
but hopefully the effect would remain positive despite the inevitable
bickering.

you continue: 
And the left says "why wait for a Singularity?  We can care for people
_now_."
(end)

And I bet people in the moderate middle and even dare I say, the right, would say "why wait for a Singularity? We can care people NOW."  

To me your comment goes without saying.  We all know there are some fantastic programs out there, like the Microloan project, or various agencies which allow a "rich" American or European to adopt a disadvantaged child from the third-world.

I liked Eliezer's response to this.  Doing serious work to speed up the coming of the Singularity(and I know some people don't see a hard takeoff Singularity coming) could save and also greatly enrich many billions of lives.

you continue:
Compared to most of agricultural history the Singularity has already
happened.  Used to be most people worked their butts off just to grow
food, and a small elite skimmed the surplus.  Now 3% or less of the US
population works directly producing food (although more may be building
tractors, obtaining fuel, driving trucks around) and a lot of the
population is doing weird abstract 'work' subsistence farmers wouldn't
think of.  The poor are obese instead of starving, clothing is cheap,
housing is cheap, life expectancies are at record highs...
(end)

A very good point about the "agricultural singularity" which has already happened.  I would disagree with you that life for the poor is now so great.  Often the poor are obese from imbalanced diets which result in at least mild malnutrition.  They can afford to buy a lot of starches, but not other really healthy foods to balance that out.  Clothing is cheap?  I would have to disagree on that one! lol  For the poor even Wal-Mart could be expensive.  Of course, there are Salvation Army's to visit for cheap clothes.  Housing is cheap?  Only when a bunch of roommates are crammed into a small apartment or house.  And that is not so fun.  Life expectancies are at record highs, but still we see many in in first-world nations lacking adequate health care.  

I have so far been thinking of the poor in DEVELOPED nations, you will find the status of the third-world poor in the areas of food, shelter, clothes, and life expectancies to be vastly worse than what I described for most American and Western European poor.   

I do realize advancing technology and gov't benevolence has made the world a better place for the poor.  But we still have a LONG way to go.

you continue:
You want a Singularity?  Wotcha waiting for?  Sure, there's more work to
be done.  But if you want to reduce pain and fight the unfairness of the
universe, there's plenty of slack to start now.
(end)

I totally agree.

you continue:
(Concrete example: we're about to spend $7 billion on missile defense.
That could buy lots of vaccines for Africa, or DDT-treated mosquito
netting to fight malaria, or clean water...)
(end)

I often think how just a sliver of the world's military defense budgets could make the world such a better place.  If only human beings could learn to really trust each other! lol And let us not forget the many grasping tentacles of the hungry military-industrial complex.  

I am for missle defense, if we can get it to work.  Though most likely a terrorist would simply sneak a small nuke into one of our cities, the scenario of an insane dictator launching an ICBM at us with a nuke on board is within the realm of possibility.  I don't want the day of several million Americans to be ruined by being nuked.

best wishes,

John : )

Since when did "infinite" become "countable"?

No envy here.  I just don't understand how some human beings (one not
essentially different from another) are worth billions and some are barely
valued at all (no matter how hard they work - and by "work" I mean doing
something that takes away from one's leisure and personal time).  That some
human beings are worth a BIT more than others I can understand.  But the
HUGE earnings gap by those at the top to those at the bottom - that I don't,
and looks like I never will - understand.  I've read the explanations
(written by the hunters, not the hunted), but they don't make sense to me.
Human beings are not that different one from another, and that's that.

O.>>
  Olga,
   Cherish the gap. A few tens of thousands of years everyone was
destitute. Even the local shaman's main "form of excessive wealth"
was a job with plenty of slack time.
  These days things are different. That big huge gap is something
that makes me feel good about being a monkey.  I know that
the top drags the bottom, the gap gets wider, but where the
gaps boundaries are at the top AND the bottom are in everdynamic
motion.
  Human beings are very different from one another. There is infinite
variety amongst us, and there's plenty of room at the top.
Oh that's right..it's about socialization yielding all major differences
in outcomes and fuzzy words like dignity and equality backed up
with a court date.  Thanks but no thanks.
  And stay out of MY yard.  (in a figurative way of course :)

Blessed be the Gap, and all it's Work!
Brian

Does anyone (?) have a file or files that lists keywords from any of the
following fields: computer science, cognitive science, ethics, evolutionary
biology, nanoscience, philosophy, programming, humanism, transhumanism,
information technology, or the singularity (or related fields).

I'm not asking for dictionary or terminology URLs/documents, just
URLs/documents on keywords.

Would anyone use a document/webpage that lists keywords in the field of
transhumanism? (Personally, I would use one as a writing resource.)

If you have any keyword URLs/documents for the above fields, or would be
interested in seeing a keyword index document/webpage created for one or
more of the above fields, please email me at trans_humanism@yahoo.com.

Cheers
Anand

"Countably infinite" means aleph-null, sets like the even numbers and the
rationals.  As opposed to "uncountable" sets such as the reals. 
"Countable" means a one-to-one correspondence with the infinite set "one,
two, three"...

He's the only person I'm aware of who has proposed a "real" computer
that consumes significantly more power than a Matrioshka Brain and has
slighly greater processing capacity.  (See Pg. 12 of his Reversibility

If I recall correctly, you are correct that the strands are locally 
indistinguishable, but incorrect about the directions. Each strand has
a forward direction and a backward direction. The transcriber thingee
(DNA transcriptase?) runs only in the forward direction along whichever
strand it is on. The forward directions of the two strands are in
opposite directions. One end of a strand is called 3' (three-prime) and
the other is 5', but I've forgotten which is which.

Just Googled
     dna transcription direction
I was almost right :-)
    http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/3250_DNA_transcription.htm
  RNA polymerase (not DNA transcriptase) runs down the "wrong"
(i.e. antisense) DNA strand toward its 5' end, to build its
RNA complement (i.e. the RNA analogue of the "correct" DNA strand.)

You misunderstood me. The current me would of course want to prevent that
fate (broken statues do look ugly). However, that's the *current* me, and
future-I of course have very little power on actions of *others*. There's
clearly rather nasty things relatively to mankind written in game theory
and evolutionary pressure of postbiological beings. A great motivation to
not stay behind, and to proceed slowly, and cautiosly, imo.

Right, a fine solution, probably.  But one incompatible with the

"government is a tool".

...as exacerbated by the transfer of young workers from countries
which fail to make this adjustment, to countries that do.

I recall seeing an article in Wired, some time ago, about robots
automating away all need for human work.  But what about the reverse:
what if whatever little work remains, gets divided up among all humans
(and other sentient intelligences, for instance uploads) such that the
concept of permanent retirement is itself retired to history?
(Supporting evidence for this idea: medical research is finding that, in
general, to become senescent and sleep all your days away is to start
shutting down your body.  I.e., non-active retirement is, medically
speaking, a cause of death.  Not to mention, it's boring.)

This is not in doubt. What is in doubt is that anthropogenic inputs are
increasing it outside the range typical of the last few million years.
In fact, ice core data from Antarctica directly contradicts the claims
of the chicken littles.

The problem is that CO2 based warming is not a linear progression.
Warming from CO2 follows a diminishing returns curve at our atmospheric
pressure (note that Venus has over 90 Earth atmospheres, not to mention
is half the distance to the sun). As concentrations rise, the added
warming continues to decrease. CO2 is a very weak greenhouse gas
compared to others like methane and water, as well as sulfur oxides.

Well, it doesn't really, they just hybernate. Winter is also a detriment
to public health: it contributes to reductions in exercise and therefore
obesity, while it also contributes to seasonal affective disorders,
which cause increases in suicides and homicides. It increases vehicular
accident deaths and injuries as well as hypothermia induced deaths of
senior citizens on slim heating budgets (or manipulative offspring).

Malaria itself is only symptomatic of unhealthy ecosystems. Properly
operating wetlands do not harbor malarial mosquitos, and with the recent
discovery of an effective remedy dating back to ancient egyptian texts,
I'm not too worried about it.

Primarly flooded by gulf stream currents that would be more severe if
the poles were colder than they currently are. The fact is that alleged
warming in the northern hemisphere has greately reduced the number and
severity of cyclonic storms, reducing death tolls, property damage, and
coastal property losses. Three quarters of the most damaging hurricanes
to hit the US in the last century occured in the first half of that
century, NOT in the second half when all of the alleged warming occured.

As a libertarian, I am fully in support of mechanisms to cause energy
prices to accurately reflect the externalized costs of the particular
energy source they were generated from. The problem is, though, that
only a fraction of a percent of energy tax revinues, wherever they are
imposed, are ever spent on mitigating these externalized costs. The vast
majority go to supporting welfare state bureaucracies that subsidize
unproductivity. Furthermore, energy taxes are almost never imposed to
accurately reflect the true externalized costs, such as basing them on
carbon emissions. If they were, any nation that did so would rapidly
shift to a nuclear power based infrastructure.

Drextech can construct diamondoid off of limestone instead, which is
where the other 52 Bars of earth's proto-atmosphere went. The other
choice is to only develop Drextech on Venus as part of a terraforming
project, building nanolaunchers whose purpose is to take carbon and
oxygen from Venus and ship it to Mars.

Actually, coupling Milankovitch cycles with plate tectonic evolution of
oceanic currents, one can explain it all. 16 million years ago,
Antarctica broke away from South America, and the circumpolar current
began forming, isolating the continent from the rest of the world's
weather and operating a thermal vortex as a natural refrigeration system
whose function is to ventilate greater quantities of heat from the
southern ocean to space. This current stabilized about 14 million years
ago, and since then the southern ice cap has been stable ever since. At
this point in time, the 'ice line', which is the altitude at which ice
forms, is generally about 200 meters below the bedrock under the ice cap
around Antarctica.

Variations in the Milankovich cycles can, in fact, also explain the
cooling and warming trend that has stretched from the middle ages to the
present. The peak of the 'little ice age' was around 1300 or so, when
Norse colonies in Greenland were wiped out, and things have warmed a bit
since then, not just in the past century, entirely in keeping with
Milankovitch's predictions.

But Antarctica will require a warming of around 15 degrees at a minimum
before it melts.

Hi all,

For those of you in the PST region, I'll be in the new chat forum on 
ExI-Community from 10:30 PM on tonight.  For those of you who may not yet 
know, you can access the ExI-Community forum at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ExI-Community/.  An unbelievable 120 members 
have joined since the list was announced publicly three days ago.  I've 
poked my head into the chat forum a few times since then and have seen 
Eliezer Yudkowsky talking about the singularity, seen Max More questioning 
John Grigg's religious beliefs, and seen many other interesting (and fun) 
topics.  Sometimes it feels guilty to have so much fun!

Hope to see some of you there...

At one point, it was Phil Mahre, Steve Mahre, and Bill Johnson.

Then it was F-15, F-16, and F-14

These days it is George, Benjamin, and Andrew

Yes I agree the jury is still out.  I do not consider the global warming
theory a conspiracy, but I see it as a theory with a political agenda.  The
evidence suggesting global cooling has no such political power behind
it.  Actual evidence of cooling seldom makes a ripple, even though the
consequences of global cooling would be far more difficult for humanity
to deal with, since it would likely happen far more quickly.

Consider the notions from our mass media, such as the AI movie
showing the New York skyline protruding above the waves.  Such
images have great power over the imagination of the proletariat, even
though the actual science suggests any such transition would take
tens of thousands of years, if it were to happen at all.

With global cooling, however, it is easy to imagine a positive
feedback loop that could easily close:  a far greater snowfall than
average fails to melt on year, greatly increasing the earth's albedo.
I could imagine such a mini-ice age transition occurring over a
period of a century or perhaps less.

Finally, this planet is not goldilocks-just-right, it isnt perfect for
the lifeforms that evolved here, it is somewhat colder than ideal.
Much perfectly good land is covered with ice, whereas there is
very little land on this planet that is too hot for life.  The equator
teems with life, the poles are nearly barren.  spike

Notice the Commodore 64 and joystick used as a prop in the video? I wonder 
if this is the expected input device for the control of the robots?

Good luck with the bandwidth required for real-time video for several

Google and the Encyclopedia Britannica say Milankovitch, as do both of
my geology texts.

I note that even if I had been wrong about the correct spelling (he was
Serbian.  Do they use Cyrillic?  _Is_ there a single transliteration for
the 'ich'?)  I would still have been right about it being the best term
for websearching, because that's how I checked the spelling the first
time: respective Google counts.

Given that lifeforms evolved for different climates, how do you define
'perfect'?

Personally, hot and humid climate just sucks.  Great for rainforests,
yeah.  But civilization has consisted of getting the hell away from the
jungle.  What's good for life in general may not be what's great for
cities...

Some of that has to do with the geometrical facts of insolation.  The
equator gets a lot more sunlight than the poles.

And if there are really big ice caps sucking up ocean water, more
continental shelf gets exposed.  I saw an idea once that Eden/Flood
stories might stem from "we used to gather our food, and then the water
came in and it sucked", along with the Eden in the Bible (convergence of
four rivers) being currently several miles offshore in the Persian Gulf.

On a *theoretical frictionless* surface, neither somersaults nor
hands and knees will get you anywhere.  Think in terms of
conservation of momentum.  On a theoretical frictionless
surface, one cannot transfer momentum into the earth.  So
you need to get it from elsewhere.  spike

Magic is useless if you don't understand it. The understanding has to be suppresed at the 
time of the working, but saying that something happens for some arbitrary reason like an 
unmeasurable spiritual power is pointless, and usually means that someone is talking out 
of their ass.

I beg to differ. I may not be able to describe a sigil as a concrete equation, but i 
understand how it works, and know that it works. Nevertheless, I think most people 
would describe making something happen by having sex while thinking about a weird 
mass of squiggles that once made up a coherent sentance is magic.

Well, no, not even then. Technology indistinguishable from magic is
definitely distinguishable by those that make it, excepting maybe catalogue
engineers. For example, ask Doug if he thinks a rocket engine is magic.

Only because of ignorance or a lack of ability on the part of the
inhabitants, neither of which is their fault. The posthuman is then a god to
the inhabitants through choice; is that likely? Or at all ok?

I'd describe it as BS, but maybe I'm not suppressing my understanding
carefully enough :-)

More seriously, it is either bollocks, which isn't magic, or it really does
work, which just means it is something we don't properly understand. The
extropian position might be "Take that bonking off to the lab for
examination..."

In that case, God is synonymous with most of human endeavour. Maybe that's
true, but the term becomes useless, and is problematic because of it's
connotational loading.

No, it isn't, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, "the posthuman" isn't... it
is merely speculation. One day there may be posthumans, and then they will
be us, so hardly greater than us. Secondly, by the time we can be
posthumans, we will understand the technology, or will come to as we become
posthuman. That surely would be an amazing journey of discovery, but it
doesn't involve magic or gods of any kind. Just good 'ole us. 

Please don't deify or mystify the concepts of transhumanism; they cease to
make any real sense in such a context. The human that recreates itself into
something new, using only the power of its wits, the material around it, and
the insights of its dead ancestors, is an incredible vision. Visit a
library, jump on the net, walk down a crowded city street and experience
what we do. Hold something plastic in your hand. Then tell me why we would
need to worship a god.

Maybe most people would, because most people, sadly, don't know their arse
from their elbow. But most rational and scientifically informed people
would describe this claim as delusional (or playful).

But we needn't argue about this. Just make it so. Here's a challenge that I
usually offer to self-proclaimed psychics and precognitive `remote
viewers': cool, win Lotto next week, using your mojo. Never happens. Funny,
that.

Evenly split among people is one possible solution.  Given where political
power lies, a more common proposal is to allocate shares according to current
(or recent average) pollution.  The economists say it doesn't matter in the
end to how much pollution will result, only in how the money gets from here to
there.

There are currently markets in Sulfur Dioxide and other negative goods.  I
think the Chicago Board of Trade manages them.  Some people need them to keep
operating their business, other people would like to buy them off the market. 
Both sides understand what they're buying.

But everyone naturally would like to live on a lake.  They are
good for both fishing and water skiing.  So the drextech needs
to dig a moderately large number of ponds, canals between all
of them and we all then get waterfront property.  Consider the
Sahara as a Venice waiting for its time.

After genome engineering becomes a no brainer Damien & I can play

...... thinking about the 'tesselation' of the quantum field. The introduction of cellular 
automata in theoretical physics (Wolfram et al.) initiated several speculations
concerning their applicability to field theory (atomization of a continuous field 
function into some discrete lattice of locally - or even nonlocally - connected array
elements, evolving in a discrete time). The amount of information per unit volume of 
this discrete space-time lattice would be finite. The field function takes on a 
countable number of states. The lattice representation is equivalent to a cellular
automaton. But I do not know if this has something to do with Banach & Tarski.

Quite so, and the underlying assumptions should be questioned and re-examined always.

Science is not at all democratic. The notion of 'scientific consensus' (which I often see associated with global warming claims)

Each of the individuals listed in this picture-perfect display of influence-

Credentials are 'authorized' testimonies of some past performance, whether in intellectual achievements, brown-nosing, plagarizing,
backstabbing, ladder-climbing, or any of the other common behaviors found in state-run universities. They do not provide any
guarrantee of current and future performance.

The National Academy of Sciences does not exist- it is quite strictly a figment of the imagination. Therefore, its prestige is
precisely zero.

> Here is an excerpt from the summary, reviewing the earlier report by
> the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):

The  January 2002 issue of *Scientific American* has a most illuminating article [pp 62-65] by claimed IPCC (which also does not
exist) "senior fellow" Stephen Schneider. Mr. Schneider also makes the claim within his article "Even the most credible
international assessment body, the [IPCC]...": an excellent illustration of the necessarily self-referential nature of such notions.
The author then asks "Will temperatures in 2100 increase by 1.4 degrees Celsius or by 5.8? *without any consideration* of global
cooling, stability, technological advances, etc., etc. The conclusion is placed before the assumption. Later, a claim that Bayesian
probability is objective is entertained, as if risk assessment could be done external to the risk assessor- a thought absent the
body of a thinker. It gets worse.

Didn't something like 20,000 "members of the scientific community" sign a petition arguing that global warming is a hoax? It could
just as easily turn out, ****one hundred years from now****, that the tiny additions humans made to the atmosphere had staved off an
ice age.

Is it at all possible? Do people on CR necessarily have to get SOOO skinny?

With CR, I understand, the body becomes more efficient in the way
it uses the calories it receives. If this is correct, then the following 
might make sense to you.

If I was to lower my present daily caloric intake (estimated at 2,200-2,400) 
to CR-level (i.e.~1,800) I would, of course, lose weight. Given that my 
body-fat levels are low, that would also mean losing muscle mass (not quite 
a plus, as far as Im concerned!)

At some point, however, the above-mentioned better efficiency should 
kick-in, right? Doesnt that improved efficiency mean that I could then be 
able to maintain a pre-CR bodyweight (or similar) while staying on 1,800 
calories/day?

or am I just trying to have it both ways?

Cheers,
Fabio

I might try, if we had a lotto here.

The trick would be to not be unreasonable. Anyone can win $1, that's too easy. 
$1000000 is a bit harder. I would go for $50 or $100.

But this is a debate that no one will win. So why bother?

You're trying to have it both ways.

For a given caloric intake you can achieve a specific mass, no
more.

By the way muscle is the first thing to go when you adopt CR, (or
diet) which is why I never have.

I thought putting the surface on the earth was the loophole.

In the absense of gravity of course the trick wouldn't work at all,
but once it was on the earth I had the earth's mass and therefore
gravity to work with, and of course the surface was no longer
purely theoretical, it had to exist, so I could leave it at 90
degrees...

On the BBC website, there's a section dedicated to the TV program "How to 
build a human", mentioned in previous messages as having a borderline 
transhumanist attitute.

At this URL(http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/genes/court_of_opinion/index.shtml) 
you can debate the pros and cons of immortality, listen to the experts 
(watch out for Nick Bostrom) and vote. When I had a look, the ratio was 
about 70:30 between those that would like to live forever (various options) 
and those that wouldn't.

The graphics of the site make it look like its targeted at kids (unlike the 
tv program) and you won't find much that you don't already know, but it's a 
pleasant surprise to find an all-out transhumanist in the experts' panel!

At this link (http://www.bbc.co.uk/genes/) you can find out more about the 
program.

Cheers,
Fabio

True, but the proponents of the warming theory say that the warming is
primarily occuring at the poles, not the equator, and specifically at
the North Pole, where the sea ice is melting. The the evidence they tout
shows that seasonal differences will DECREASE with warming, with less
severe storm activity, so warming just makes northern winters more
tolerable, while reducing summer hurricane and tornado activity.

If the equator warms up, then the equatorial rainforests that these same
chicken littles have been claiming has been 'dissapearing' will increase
with warmer weather and higher CO2 levels faster than normal.

The fact is, though, that northern hemisphere warming, as recorded by
weather stations, is primarily an artifact of the fact that weather
stations are predominantly near urban centers, so while LOCAL pollution
may be causing LOCAL warming as a sort of thermal 'lake effect' near
cities, the predominance of urban weather centers biases the data, and
it is improper to ascribe continent-wide world-wide climate change when
there is so much thermal noise generated by urban centers.

But the pollution is not released at the poles, it is primarily released
at temperate latitudes, and wind currents and coriolis forces drive this
to the poles, which is why the modern data that the chicken littles
depend on actually shows that there is no temperature change at the
equator, and a 2 degree change at the poles, for an average of 1 degree
warming.

Well, if you are gonna be non-scientific and start relying on the Bible,
then we really can't continue this conversation.

For informational purposes, people didn't get kicked out of eden by a
flood, they got kicked out by a flaming sword (likely one or more of the
periodic aryan nomad invasions through the region). The flood happened
long after, and likely is a recounting of the 5600 BC flooding of the
Black Sea basin when the Bosporus was breached by rising Mediterranean
sea levels (due, again, to the continuing melting of ice after the last
ice age)

Well, yes, if you launch yourself vertically high enough, you will rise
to an altitude such that your angular velocity is less (i.e. you are
rising to a slower orbit) and the earth spins faster so when you land
again you do so outside the frictionless surface.

Better yet, do your little sex magic stuff so I can win the Powerball
lotto. I'll even give you a cut for doing it if I win (that wouldn't be
considered prostitution, would it? ;) ). By this independent
verification, I will thereby attest to the world that it works, and
everybody knows that I don't believe in magic.

Whats this about the amount of the prize? Don't you have enough mojo to
win big? Just think like Austin Powers, baby, yeah!

Yes, very nice. Considering that excessive water use in Israel and
Jordan is causing ground subsidence of the Dead Sea area, perhaps a test
plot should be to run a canal from the Med to the Dead (how much of
Palestine would get flooded by doing this?)...

Actually, few Main lobsters ever die of old age, those that do are
generally about 3' in length when senescence occurs. The lobster
continues to grow throughout life. So ideally, you want to dig a lot of
salt water lakes up in northern Canada to farm lobsters in, protecting
them from larger predators. So how big can a shrimp grow before it's no
longer referred to as a 'shrimp'? When it's as big as a real lobster.
"Pacific Lobster" really aren't. They have no pincers. They are just big
shrimp.

I think the best explanation for this (the most parsimonious one) is plate
tectonics. For the bulk of the period you mention the Antarctic continent
has been parked over the South Pole. As well as acting like a giant
refrigerator this has locked up masses of fresh water and made the whole
planet both colder and drier. At the same time tectonic movement around the
Arctic has effectively isolated that ocean from the rest of the world's
oceans (there are only two deep water passages into the Arctic, both very
narrow). The result is it's very cold and instead of warming the circumpolar
region keeps it in the "arctic" climate we know today. That is why an ice
age is the default climate setting at this (geological) moment. It only
takes a few years of unusually heavy winters and cold summers, given the
conditions in the holarctic, to raise the planet's albedo substantially and
lower the average temperature by enough to start an ice age. After that it
doesn't take long at all for the fully fledged ice age conditions to appear.
When an interglacial arrives it takes longer for all that ice to melt. Steve

Question:

Is there an atmosphere around me or a vacuum?

I could easily propel myself by blowing air in the right direction.

Is there (sun)light?

I could just wait until the light pressure accelerates me to a sufficient
speed.

Are there any fields in the surrounding space, like the magnetic field?

I could use interactions with these fields.

I wouldn't worry about being unable to leave the plane, under almost any
physical conditions imaginable.

I thought putting the surface on the earth was the loophole.

In the absense of gravity of course the trick wouldn't work at all,
but once it was on the earth I had the earth's mass and therefore
gravity to work with, and of course the surface was no longer
purely theoretical, it had to exist, so I could leave it at 90
degrees...

One slight correction, the worst period for the "little ice age" is the mid
to late 17th century. (That's why we're constantly being told that recent
years are the hottest "since records began" because official climatological
records were first kept then, at the peak of a cold period). The cooling
starts in the late thirteenth and gets bad after 1300. Otherwise, exactly
right. The world was as warm as it is now in the 12th/11th centuries when,
as we all know, the streets of Paris were choked with motor vehicles and
Constantinople had to bring in a clean air law. The evidence for historical
periods goes back further than this and the 4th/5th centuries were probably
warmer than today. All this suggests that while the earth may be warming up
we should be very sceptical of arguments that it's down to human activity.
In any event, it's not clear to me the current warming trend is a "bad
thing". Bad news if you're a Dutchman or live in Central America, great news
if you're a Canadian. Steve Davies

Plainly, societal infrastructure plays a necessary but not sufficient role in 
creating large inequalities in wealth.  Among hunter-gatherers, even someone 
twice as smart, strong, and liked as his peers will not own billions more in 
assets than his peers.

Beyond that, I'm at a loss for hard measures of the relative influence of 
chance, innate ability, acquired virtues, and societal infrastructure in 
creating disparities in wealth.  Perhaps social scientists can measure such 
things; I cannot say, as it is not my field of study.  But I wax skeptical.

At any rate, it seems to me that no one can intelligently address 
inequalities in wealth unless and until they make clear whether they care 
about inequality per se or simply poverty.  If the latter, they will have to 
answer very hard questions about why we should care about inequality and how 
we justify forcibly redistributing wealth.

I've found that most people care about inequality per se because, ultimately, 
they fear envy.  Note that I do not say "feel" envy; in my experience, 
outrage about inequality comes mostly from those who have relatively great 
wealth (though that perhaps reflects the media I consume).  Helmut Shoeck 
wrote an excellent book, ENVY, about the important role that poisonous 
feeling plays in cultures and economies.  I won't reprise his argument here, 
but I do strongly encourage interested parties to look into the work.

Regarding justifications for forcibly redistributing wealth, I think most r
eaders of this list know how the arguments go and long ago decided which they 
prefer to follow.

Of course, most truly useful things in life can't be done unless you "have
more income than you truly need".  It is why scientific, medical, and
technological progress tend to be driven by capitalism.  But hey, who needs
technological progress?

The consequence of hardcore socialism could be described as synchronized
mortality by consensus.  Thanks but no thanks.

I can't speak for your country, but in the U.S. your assumptions would
simply be wrong.  Nearly all the wealthy people in this country are entirely
self-made, and the majority of those achieved wealth as blue-collar workers
who were not born into the vaguest semblance of privilege.  This may not
square with popular perception, but it is in fact the truth.  Those born
into "the richer classes" as you are painting them are almost a non-existent
class here and largely irrelevant as they are vastly outnumbered by more
"deserving" folk of similar economic means.

People use rhetoric like yours about a vanishingly small class of people to
pass laws that exact punitive measures largely against self-made blue-collar
people of modest background.  That is like putting a hundred men in prison
to make sure that the five criminals among them are also in prison.

On the flip side, using reverse psychology, would not the best way to
cure people of socialist idiocy be to allow them to create the most
heinous sort of socialist tyranny possible...

Actually I thought it was much simpler, you just have to apply
force directly perpendicular to the frictionless plane, or apply
force equally in opposite directions on the plane. In other words
balance.

In the somersault you place your hands in front of you, as you
begin upward force away from the plane, pressure is applied to the
hands but the thumb and fingers are opposing so the force is
straight down. The center of gravity can rotate via the shoulders, 
and you can develop angular momentum.

In the hands and knees you lift opposite hands and knees while
maintaining downward pressure on the opposites. The axis of the
body can shift equally and the limbs brought straight down, then
you begin again.

Or just sit comfortably and use a CO2 fire extinguisher to jet
around... ;)

I have been listening, of late, to financial advisor Suze Ormon's CDs on
smart personal finance. She says that a law of finance is that money is
attracted to respect. People who treat money with respect attract more
of it, and those who do not repel it.

Certainly if the lowly masses continue to disrespect money by believing
in stupid communist fantasies, they will continue to repel money in
their daily lives, and that money will continue to be attracted most,
like interstellar gasses to massive star formations and black holes, to
individuals who demonstrate in their every act and statement their high
respect for the proper treatment of money.

In this way, you can apply a sort of gravitation law to the behavior of
money. Most people are minor asteroidal fragments or little chunks of
interstellar ice and dust. Some people coalesce into large asteroids and
comets. Still others form into protoplanets and terrestrial planets and
moons. Only a few become jovian planets and stars...

What would be the Enron version?

You have two cows.  You form 24 subsidiaries to manage the cows 24 hours a
day, with options to buy rights to the other cow-hours.  One subsidiary buys
out all the others, increasing its herd by 24 times.  You then sell cow
stock based on the business model of doing this every day for a year.  At
the end of the year, you have sold accounting rights to 24^365 cows.
(That's a 6 followed by 503 zeros!)

Then you shred the original two cows.

The BBC tonight showed a docudrama on the effects of a terrorist outbreak of
smallpox occurring in New York from April 2002 and leading to a pandemic
that eventually kills sixty million on a global scale.

Melodrama apart, the programme posits that the pandemic spreads rapidly as
the public health systems are unprepared, have insufficient stocks of
smallpox vaccine, and try to strike a balance between containment of the
disease and the prevention of public panic.

The death toll is 1.5 million in the United States alone and the pandemic is
eventually contained through the severe curtailment of civil liberties,
especially the freedom of movement of individuals.

The programme joins a long list of televisual scares, but one of the
unspoken assumptions was that a 'window of opportunity' does exist for such
a terrorist act before the delivery of a sufficient quantity of smallpox
vaccine towards the end of this year.

The URL is not very useful: www.bbc.co.uk/smallpox2002

How accurate is this scenario in tracking such a pandemic? Or should we see
such commentaries as alarmist?

re:'For a given caloric intake you can achieve a specific mass, no more'

Some people will be more muscular than others at a given caloric intake
depending on several factors including but not limited to:
Type and frequency of exercise, and efficiency of recovery (repair) from.
Macronutrient ratios (protein fat carb ratios, and what type,
bio-availability etc.)
Micronutrient factors (given caloric intake of potato chips and beer vs.
lean meat and fresh veggies)
Sleep/rest factors (stress hormones have an effect, as you 'grow' at rest,
not in the Gym)
Genetic factors (der...)
Endocrine state (hypothalamic sensitivity to LH, estrogen, GHRH etc, free to
bound testosterone etc.)

And so.. you can be more muscular or less for a given caloric intake, you
can look Brad Pit in fight club, or Bruce Lee enter the dragon 'ripped'.

I would chose to cut carbohydrate as the primary macronutrient (Protein
35%,  Omega 3 rich. Carbohydrates (also 35%) only vegetables and fruit, no
beans, bread, potatoes, or any grain. Then dietary and supplemental forms of
fat should provide 20-30% of (daily) calories.

I would chose high bio-available proteins
I would avoid excessive aerobic activities
I would lift weights as a body builder (because I am)
I would supplement with Bulgarian Tribulus terrestris and Avena sativa, and
GH releasers

Yes, the website seems to be a joke, with links that are real.  I only wish

Accurate only if a weaponized smallpox is used, dispursed as a aerosol
that creates a few hundred thousand "index" cases.  That would be very
bad, and probably impossible to contain.  Pretty much a worst case for
unmodified smallpox.

A scenario where a few self infected terrorists walk around the airport is
probably fairly easily contained, but pretty scary nevertheless.

Even the worst case could probably be contained with enough vaccine
available an aggressive approach.

Google and the Encyclopedia Britannica say Milankovitch, as do both of
my geology texts.

I note that even if I had been wrong about the correct spelling (he was
Serbian.  Do they use Cyrillic?  _Is_ there a single transliteration for
the 'ich'?)  I would still have been right about it being the best term
for websearching, because that's how I checked the spelling the first
time: respective Google counts.

  Zdravo,
  The beautiful Serbo-Croatian girlfriend tells me that the proper
spelling would be (in Latin letters) "Milankovic", but would be
pronounced "ME-Laan-Kov-VICH".  Children are taught
in both Cyrillic and Latin scripts.
  The usual spelling convention into English from south Slavic
follows 
  "Tomic" prounouces "TD-ome-ICH" etc.
  Incidentally Serbo-Croatian has some very neat words...
the word for darling (fem.) is "draga".

Hmm... not in principle of course, because in theory the entire process is
explicable. I know it doesn't feel that way in practice, though :-)

They do, but it's a slightly different version than Russian Cyrillic,

S/he's *not* ahead. That's the whole point. I've suggested a way to
demonstrate to us all that `sex magick' works; that it can bring about
objective changes to the world that can't be achieved by customary means.
Chesh declined the challenge. That isn't any way to be `ahead'; that's just
a way to cover your arse (and with the emperor's new undies, at that).

As for the strange, nay unearthly, claim that there's no Lotto available in
the USA (which I *think* the love doll was saying), try:

http://www.lotteryusa.com/

or follow Mike Lorrey's hint and send *him* the winning numbers. That way
you keep your hands clean of wrongful gain, and Mike will be able to fund a
starship using equally mysterious principles. :)

Not "taboo", but requiring plausible explanations and if it
involves "extraordinary" claims, it requires "extraordinary" proof.

I'd argue that 90% or more of the people on the list cannot explain
how the 5-40 million transistor microprocessor in their computer
actually works.  To someone of my grandparents' generation it 
certainly *seems* like magic even though it follows the principles
of physics as we now understand them.  

Even worse nobody in the world is able to explain the functioning
of a human body or the human mind.  Certainly "magic" from where
we now stand, though we "suspect" they follow principles of physics.

Now, if I happen to suggest that the alignment of the planets
results in fluctuations in the quantum gravity field that
dictates how chromosomes recombine which results in the
variations in personalities that we happen to associate
with star signs, due to my "reputation" for not invoking
magic physics, at least some people might think I was making
a serious claim.  But people are going to want to see the data. 

I was recently asked my opinion about this site:

http://www.stardrivedevice.com/

All I could say was that at first glance they seemed to be
proposing technologies that would violate a number of accepted
laws of physics.

So -- that may be the "razor" when it comes to "Magick" -- if
you can propose a magick that appears magical but does not
violate laws of physics then it is reasonable to bring it
to the table.  If you propose magick that appears to violate
laws of physics then the burden of proof is on your shoulders
to explain where the laws of physics need to be extended or
how such ideas do not violate the laws.

I would sooner believe that one could change the neural connections
in your mind to *really* believe that magick had happened than
you could change the physical laws of the universe.  It comes
down to a simple question of which is more malleable.

A successful new drug treatment for obesity was described on TV news last
night in Australia. Thus far it requires intravenous injection; oral
preparations are not expected on the market for another four years. News
reports spoke of middle-aged Ss. losing half a kilo a week with no change
in diet or exercise; the stuff speeds up metabolism, and has no known
harmful side effects. I wonder, though, if this accelerated
metabolism--which was described as a reversion to young adult levels--might
not be a no-no, due to malign oxidation effects, etc.

A quick google shows zip so far; the Aussie newspaper don't have it either.

I would say that comment seems to have a ring of falsehood.  Just
the opposite in fact, for when one accumulates money, one's personality
begins to emerge.

Perhaps Vidal's comment can be understood in terms of the fact that
as people accumulate money they also accumulate years and wisdom,
and so are less likely to do exciting risky activities.  spike

Hi Extropians! I've been so busy now that I've started practicing law again
full time I've only had time to dip into the list every few days.

I've just moved my website devoted to Damien Broderick's work. The new url
is www.panterraweb.com/the_spike.htm

I know it might seem rude to be silent for weeks and weeks and then show up
only to promote my own web site. But there's a great deal of material up
there relevant to topics that repeatedly come up on the list. Rather than
try to list the material here, I'll invite you all to take a look.

Hey Spike, love your bovine humor.

Smallpox really did break out in New York City but it was in 1947. A man died
of it but it was 5 weeks before that was recognized, by then 12 people had the
disease and two would die of it. However that's as far as it got because within
a month after it was realized what they were dealing with 6.3 million people in
the city were vaccinated. Smallpox doesn't always win.

Yeah, you may be right.  In any case, it's not gospel.  The quote reminded
me, though, of an oh-so-elegant party in the '80s.  I sidled up to a group
of people when I heard them talking about China (having been born there,
I've a particular interest in China).  Then, to my dismay, I realized they
were talking about ... China ... **patterns.**   Patterns ... crockery!
Another group talked excitedly about "zins" (I soon figured out that was a
diminutive name for Zinfandel wines).  Maybe it's just the parties I've
attended ... it seems the more "elegant," the more boring they've been,
generally speaking.  And I don't know why.

They sound like parties of the status oriented. They just look elegant; it's
actually rather crass to be so vacuous, imo. You possibly need to find the
people who set the trends that these people ape.

Actually, I find the most interesting people online.

I woulda been more lost than anyone at that party.  I drink beer.

Definitely going to the wrong parties Olga. {8-]

I know why.  People are interesting as a function of their brains,
not their bank balance.  You need to find some good nerd parties
Olga.  The nanoschmoozes work pretty well for that.  People
there don't expect you to know which fork is supposed to be used
for what purpose.  I never did get up to speed on that kinda thing.

Nowthen, speaking of zins, I have learned that there is a site
where one can download one of my faves, Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance.

http://bonigv.tripod.com/

Ive longed for an ASCII version of this classic, so I can search
it, instead of having only (as Eliezer so aptly put it) a picture of
the information.

How can I find out if Pirsig has granted some yahoo the right
to post his book?  If he is still holding the copyright, I will dump this
site right off of my bookmarks.  Since I am a believer in intellectual
property rights, should I not even mention the site until I can
determine that it is legitimate?  spike

Do you mind if I use your middle name to say a few words about art
at the Vatican Museums? I saw some wonderful art there a week ago,
and it's on my mind.

Some people may be surprised to discover that near center of Roman
Catholic faith houses one of the world's great collections of
Classical and Renaissance art. Egyptian and Assyrian art, Etruscan
art, Greek and Roman art, Medieval art, and Renaissance art.

While Michelangelo (the 'solitary genius') was nearby painting the
ceiling of the Sistine chapel, a young fellow named Raphael
(Raffaello) was effortlessly sythesizing lyrical and dramatic
elements into a style that captures much of the Renaissance. He was
commissioned by Pope Julius II to decorate a series of rooms in the
Vatican Palace. The first room, the Stanza della Segnatura,
might have housed the pope's library, and this room contained one my
favorite works in the Vatican (The School of Athens). In this room,
Raphael's cycle of frescoes on its walls and ceiling refers to four
particular domains of learning: theology, philosophy, law, and the
arts, which some humanists see as a a parallel in the four elements
making up the universe: air, water, fire and earth. Each of these is
represented by an allegorical painting on the walls of this room:
the Disputation of the Holy Sacrament, the School of Athens, the
Parnassus and the Virtues (Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance),
respectively.

Of these the "School of Athens" is Raphael's masterpiece. Its
subject is a group of famous Greek philosophers and mathematicians
each in a characteristic pose or activity. Raphael must have already
seen the Sistine Ceiling, when was then nearing completion. He owes
to Michelangelo the expressive energy and physical power of his
figures (Michelangelo's muscle-bound superhumans literally leap at
you from the ceiling), but he absorbed that power into his own
style, giving it a different meaning. Every action and emotional
element is harmoniously balanced. A terrific purposeful clarity to
this fresco. In this painting you will see: Euclid, Diogenes,
Zoroaster, Ptolemy, Raphael (himself), Sodoma, Heracleitus (features
of Michelangelo), Socrates, Xenophon, Eschines, Alcibiades, Plato,
Aristotle and Pythagoras.

I studied this painting a bit. and found web sites that show each of
the School of Athens figures, so you can see a little for yourself.

The other Rahael fresco in that room that I liked alot was Mount Parnassus.
http://www.christusrex.org/www1/stanzas/P-Segnatura.html

(The following are words on the Web describing this fresco)
http://www.kfki.hu/~arthp/html/r/raphael/stanze/1segnatu/2/3parnas.html

{begin quote}
Mount Parnassus, the home of Apollo, is, like the hill of the
Vatican, a place where in ancient times there was a shrine to Apollo
dedicated to the arts. This has a direct bearing on the picture
because through the window on the wall where the fresco is painted
there is a view of the Cortile del Belvedere and the hill of the
Vatican. There were newly discovered classical sculptures in the
Cortile, such as the Ariadne that Raphael used as a model for the
muse to the left of Apollo.

Raphael in several sketches significantly changed some of the
details, including the musical instruments used. In the early
versions Apollo played on a traditional stylized classical lyre, but
this fresco shows him playing a Renaissance lira da braccio with a
bow. The bow was unknown in Antiquity, although later they
attributed its invention to Sappho. It has nine, instead of seven,
strings to match the number of Muses; this, in Raphael's conception,
signifies timelessness, just as the fact that the most eminent
classical and contemporary poets are depicted together. Homer is
flanked by Virgil and Dante, Ovid and Horace are next to Sappho,
while from the "ranks" of moderns we can identify Petrarch,
Boccaccio and Ariosto.

While working on this fresco, the artist may have become acquainted
with that ancient sarcophagus from Asia Minor which is adorned with
the relief sculpture of the nine Muses. This was his source for the
three additional instruments shown in this fresco: Erato's kithara,
to the right of Apollo, the Lydian aulos of Eutherpe, on the other
side, and below, the strange, tortoise-shell lyre of Sappho - all of
which he rendered striving for archeological accuracy.

In this fresco, music fills the role of moving force behind the
Apollonian universe, at the same time being the symbol of poetry.

I was wondering when someone would notice this...half expected to see some
more of you guys on it...The UK media does this: it chucks things at people.
In at the deep end, a little like the style of 'Great Mambo Chicken' did way
back whenever. Be assured the program isn't aimed at kids...it's aimed at
the average British person's knowledge of science...and more. It's going to
cause as many endless debates as GM food did last year. But with one
essential difference...this programme comes out apparently firmly on the
positive side of new tech. And, as you say, at least some of the
'spokespersons' know what they're on about.
The debates are going to be heated and over the top for about six months,
after which things will settle into the traditional British habit of
'people-getting-bored-with-it-all-and-they-don't-really-understand-it-anyway
-so-who-cares?' Meaning, simply, that people on the whole will forget about
it all again.
But which is the best tactic here? -Any publicity is good publicity?
Or -stay out of the news; stay out of trouble?
What thinkest thou?

When you go through generations of man-made selection based on the
quantity of meat you produce and how good it tastes, you obviously
drift into nonsense in other, more fundamental features. Most
importantly, you stop caring about yourself, which is pretty much what
natural life is about... In my childhood in Switzerland I have often
observed cows, and I often had the impression that they would share
two minds in three cows, or something like that.

I find it disturbing to feel that there is someone all the same
looking at me behind these big eyes, that has partly lost its sense of
individuality, but still sort of feels and sort of dimly remembers
what it once was to be a cow (see the way they stop eating, look at
you, and seem to try to "compute" ?). After all, many *people* are
quite alienated, and *somehow* we are all absent to ourselves, only
*tending* to presence. If you don't see the person in the cow, you'll
probably miss it in the man, too.

Sorry to talk about cows in the Damien Broderick thread :-)

Or possibly the complexity was out of sight.  The discussion of chinaware
may have been replete with subtle tones of voice and inflection, patterns
of who dares to disagree with who - an exciting power struggle,
steganographically encrypted using the chinaware discussion as a carrier.

On second thought, nah.

Some interesting discoveries about the chat applet:  It's a
perfectly normal, compatible, Java applet that runs just fine
with any Java VM, including under Linux, which I'm running
(using Sun's JDK 1.3.1 and the Galeon browser)  But I had to
invoke it from a hand-created page on my own server to use it.

The problem is that the HTML in which the applet is embedded
uses Microsoft-specific scripting features to, among other things,
set the size of the applet, which gets set too small on other
systems.  Yahoo's own "system requirements" doc simply says that
Windows os required--they don't even make any attempt to
accommodate those of us with real computers.

At any rate, there's no technical reason the chat won't work
for anyone, except that Yahoo seems to go out of their way to
make it not work.

That's Fred.  Fred has been lost in the cows since 1967.

I found it wasn't bad. I think the concept of listening (input),
discussing (processing), and voting (output), in succession, was quite
a good idea, and I thought it was a nice use of the web to let people
think about something.

I thought designing web sites with such limited content and guided
interaction could be a great way to spread particular idea. People
could say : "you know what nanotech is ? no ? well have a look at that
address" ; and instead of finding there a whole book or series of
article, there would be limited content and a guided interaction with
a beginning and an end, taking the user by the hand, a conveying a
simple but accurate version of the ideas.

You could even have a (private) institution that becomes well-known
for providing useful popular simple-but-accurate presentations of
concept, that could be referred by people in democracies. Think
"therapeutic cloning" for example.

Why the hell don't political parties do that ? (Or maybe they do ?)

In Switzerland, they have a direct democracy as you know, which means
people vote very often on very many things. Before each voting day,
citizens receive a booklet with a description of each topic to be
voted on, with a presentation made by the gov., but also a
presentation made by political parties defending opposite viewpoints.
It is not too long, and every "good citizen" is supposed to take some
time to read it and make up his mind, before to cast his vote.

Enron, Spawn of Business Journalism
by Gary North

This is "National Enron Media Week." Now that Ex-CEO Kenneth Law has
refused to testify to a Senate committee, we may be facing "National
Enron Media Year." It's "All Enron, all the time."

The media are on Enron like a dog on a bone. The reporters have one
assignment from editors: to expose dirt. They want workers' empty
retirement fund dirt, payoffs to top Republicans dirt, and insider
trading dirt. Dirt attracts viewers. Dirt gets the ratings up. Higher
ratings allow the media to charge more money to advertisers.

This media feeding frenzy is basically reports on an empty barn from
which the thoroughbred horses have all escaped. The horses that were
left behind - nags, mostly - are not topics for public discussion. I
have yet to see even one report on Enron's future prospects, yet 15,000
of Enron's 20,000 employees are still at work. They are of no interest
to the media. "No dirt here." The public will feast on stories of what
the barn's managers failed to do to keep the thoroughbreds from
escaping.

...We explain, and explore, ever-increasingly, both of these things. In the
same way that some dork said, 'Strangers are just friends I haven't met
yet', I see 'magic' as 'science we haven't sussed yet'.  Am I missing
something here?

And 'magic'. Sci-fi turns into reality? How many times?...If we 'play' hard
enough on the surface, the real work goes on underneath. That's all I think
people mean when they speak of 'magic'. In another couple of years it will
have some respectable name, such as 'Biofeedback Psychology', and will be
another useful neurohacking software tool.

True, true.  The mass media is such a joke. I came *this* close to
buying a huge wad of Enron stock back when the mass media anti-hype
began a couple months ago (Enron went to .26/share: I woulda made ~5X
on that--it went to 1.21/share in a week. It will probably still go up
from what it is now).  Whatever way the mass media arrow points, go
the OTHER way...that is always the best course :-)

BTW, I work in downtown Houston and ride by Enron every day.  And
there is at least one Exi list member who works at Enron.

Another sick joke: the Enron employee relief fund: 1000's and 1000's
of dollars for relief for the poor Enron employees--what a joke: the
median income of Enron employees is probably at least 45K...boo hooo!

Meanwhile the working poor typically are completely ignored by the
mass media--the poor darlings don't patronize the advertisers that
support the media, dontcha know....and as for the inner city welfare
poor, well, the mass media certainly wouldn't ignore them--otherwise
they would destroy the property of the business class, the true bosses
of the media, who buy the ads.

BTW, lewrockwell is a great site. It is good to see people that
actually think original thoughts, as opposed to being an empty vessel
for memes backed by money.

I know what you mean! Believe it or not, a recently published scientific
paper argues that cows are actually smarter than we think. Apparently they
can recognise faces, distinguish between different humans and run up to
people they remember doing nice things to them while avoiding people who've
done nasty things to them. Smarter than some humans I know. I wonder what
the grant application for that research was like...Steve.

Hi Sabine,

Have you had a chance to review the Press Release at extropy.org?

We will need to send it out to folks.  Has Max contacted you?  I've had a 
darn headache from scuba diving (my neck was strained) but I'm feeling 
great now, so I'll pick up where things left off.

Please let me know status.

Thanks,
Natasha

I agree. In many ways I consider it the ideal this list should strive

Alejandro Dubrovsky has been kind enough to work with me offlist
and point out errors in my theoretical physics homework. I just
shared this real world story with him and then I thought everyone
could use a laugh...



I worked for a summer during college for a cookie and pastry
company in the lab. One of my jobs was to do quality control tests
in the "jam" room, a room where they made jam for toaster pastries.

The jam room was about 125' by 125' feet and filled with stainless
steel equipment. It had the oddest floor I had ever seen, it was
some sort of nontoxic substance that had been fused directly in
place, so there were no cracks for bacteria. The whole room was
steam sterilized a couple of times a day. That floor was well known
for being dangerously slippery when wet.

Well one day I'm in there doing tests in the corner as the shift
changes, and the lead guy from the first shift is going to start
his first batch of jam.

The jam was made in these giant horizontal mixers. The bowl of the
mixer was a stainless steel 3/4 cylinder with a lip on one edge
about 6' across and 20' long. You would rotate the cylinder
horizontally to add the ingredients, then rotate it vertically to
mix them via a log mixer that ran the length of the cylinder. When
it was ready you slowly rotated the cylinder and a 20 foot stream
of jam poured off into a waiting pre-sterilized stainless steel
car, about 5'across, 3' deep and 20' long.

The first ingredient is dozens of 25 pound blocks of lard, so he
hits the button to open the mixer and walks off to get the cart
loaded with the blocks.

He was in a hurry because he had called in that he was going to be
late that day.

Well what he didn't know was that his buddy on the previous shift
heard he was going to be late, so being a nice guy decided to go
ahead and make his buddies first batch for him. And the new guy
forgot to check the mixer first...

Yep, the mixer was loaded with thousands of pounds of grape jam,
and the mixer with no cart in place, opened at full speed, and a
20' wave of jam came pouring out of the mixer.

Everybody started yelling at the same time as the jam came pouring
out. The mixer operator made a mad dive to get back to the mixer
but hit the jam slick first and promptly slammed into the floor.

Now the jam quickly bounced off the walls and in seconds covered
the entire floor. I was in the corner and when I saw what was
happening, grabbed the ladder to the catwalk in the corner and
scampered out of the way and up to the catwalk to watch the fun.

A dozen guys all dressed in white were now trying desperately not
to end up on the floor covered in grape jam.

A few guys managed to get their feet the exact correct width apart
and stood perfectly still, others got their feet a little too wide
and started doing a slow motion splits till they fell over into the
jam. A couple who got their feet right started drifting slowly
across the slight incline toward the floor drains. Even guys who
were standing up clinging to equipment started falling over if they
made the slightest wrong move.

Pretty soon everyone was down in the jam.

Even attempting to move on hands and knees would generally end up
with your arms/legs splaying outward and ending up face first on
the floor. It was the slipperiest thing I'd ever seen.

But a few careful souls did manage to negotiate their way out,
using the very careful direct lift-and-place method I was talking
about.

Me? when I could stand up on the catwalk after laughing so hard, I
went out the upper deck door and went for help.

Individualism vs. herdism. Acting as a member of a herd, an individual cow
might seem to have no mind of her own, might blindly follow the rest of the
mob (sortta like humans). But when acting apart from the herd, an individual
cow seems at least as smart as a horse. I once raised a Beefmaster/Jersey
mix calf on a bottle. She would come running from far across a pasture when
she saw me coming; but she'd shy away from strangers. She knew her name, of
course, and could understand simple commands. When she grew up, I sold her
to my neighbor and she went to live among his herd of cows. But she would
often leave the herd and come back to my house to visit me (I lived on the
adjacent land). When she got sick, she came back to her original home to
die.

The Texas Longhorn seems to be an especially smart breed. These cattle are
able to survive under extremely harsh conditions, mainly because of their
intelligence and ability to modify their habits when necessary. I say this
based on personal observation and from reading accounts of men (cowboys,
actually) who worked the cattle when they were a popular breed for beef in
the 1800's.

The word "Moo" comes from the contraction "M'oo" which stands for "Me too!"
When a particularly expressive speaker is presenting at an Extropy
convention, you can often hear the audience enthusiastically Mooing in
agreement.

An inspiring painting in many ways, especially in its embodiment of High Italian Renaissance classicism. One day, perhaps I'll do a modern impression of the "School of Extropy" where transhumanists (male, female, transgender, nongender, agender, etc.) converge on the steps of reason embodying the Transhuman Enlightenment. It could be accompanied by Extropic music produced by E.Shaun and Emlyn.  Better yet, it would be great if Bill Viola (videographer of enormous talent) created a looping video image of a few minutes of movement and dialogue among transhumanists and "Primo 3M+" joining in the discussions amongst other transhumanists discussing the advancement of humanity. 

By the way, "School of Athens" evidences the use of encryption in the early arts (finger print, symbol or other marks to convey a message or their signature), which continues today in modern digital mediums. 

"Several hand prints that date from the time of the fresco's execution were found in an almost straight line across it at the height of the shafts of the pilasters. Although a detailed analysis of the fingerprints has not yet been undertaken, one hand must almost certainly be Raphael's. The others could belong to his assistants or to visitors on the scaffold."

 A vendor can offer compelling evidence of security by promising to pay,
say, $100,000 to anyone who demonstrates the existence of a security flaw
in their software. If consumers refused to buy closed-source software that
wasn't backed by such evidence, I suspect it would quickly become obvious
that closed-source software has been insecure because of inadequate
motivation, rather than due to any inherent limitation of the closed-source
approach.
 Oddly enough, the only software I'm aware of that is backed by such an
offer is qmail, an open-source program (http://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html).
Last I checked, the typical Linux distribution installed sendmail rather than
qmail by default. Given sendmail's less than exemplary security record, it is
hard to say that security is a terribly high priority in much of the
open-source world.

I saw another story this morning on the issue of reviewing open source
software for bugs. Sardonix, www.sardonix.org, is a new project to
organize the search for bugs, keep track of which code has been audited,
and give credit to the people who find the most bugs.  The project is
being funded by DARPA for two years (although they are not giving cash
prizes to bug finders).

The story is at http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23956.html:

   Conventional wisdom has long held that open source software garners
   extra security from the sheer number of people who are free to review
   the code -- "Many eyes make all bugs shallow," the adage goes. The
   reality is often different; it turns out many of those eyes have
   little interest in the thankless task of examining other people's
   code for security holes.

   But now the "many eyes" school of software security may become more
   than a theory, thanks to a reward system devised by a Oregon-based
   computer scientist and funded by the U.S. Defense Department, which
   was announced over security mailing lists Tuesday.

   Part software development system and part psychological gambit, the
   Sardonix project would replace the current loosely-structured open
   source security review process with a central Web site that tracks
   which code has been audited for security holes, and by whom. An
   automated reward loop grants points to volunteer auditors according
   to the amount of code they've examined, and the number of security
   holes they've found. Auditors lose points if a subsequent audit by
   someone else turns up bugs they missed.

Corporate and tax.

One of my favorite areas of practice is business startups. I love working
with entrepreneurs, who generally have many Extropian qualities, such as a
high level of optimism and confidence that one can, through logically guided
action, create a future better than the present.

Ok. Synopsis of 4FEB02 Investor Release from Metabolic Pharmaceuticals Ltd 
re:AOD9604 Phase 2A Human Clinical Trials.

Four week human trial of an anti-obesity drug administered intravenously to 
assess various parameters, including safety and efficacy.

"...AOD9604...acts specifically on the body's fat cells to enhance the 
breakdown of stored fats and inhibit the synthesis of new fat....The drug 
is modelled on the fat reducing portion of the hGH (human growth hormone) 
molecule."

The drug shows significant fat-reducing results in an ~45yo population 
subset, whereas no significant reduction in the ~25yo subset. Confirms hGH 
mimicry as the 45yo group would be expected to have declining levels of 
hGH, with the likelihood of being more responsive to artificially induced 
metabolic up-regulation.

In treating age-onset obesity, the drug appears to be an effective 
candidate for the targeted clientele. It avoids the overall weight gain 
that is seen in hGH supplementation due to increased mass in muscle, organ 
and bone.

==============================================
Aside.
There already exists data that demonstrates that eliminating obesity 
oftentimes/usually resolves the coexisting Type II diabetes, high blood 
pressure and increased frequency of cardiovascular events. Surgical 
intervention in the morbidly obese via an improved "stomach-stapling" 
procedure has shown dramatic results in improved patient outcome. 
[Evidence-based appropriate care]

With AOD9604 issues of cost, coverage and compliance will be interesting to 
follow.

Insurance companies are already assessing pro-rating drug co-pays by 
categorizing/classifying clients on different protocols according to 
prognosis in order to minimize costs while maximizing outcomes. Also, 
big-brother may become a retroactive Siamese twin as compliance monitoring 
may drive reimbursement payments for increasingly costly drugs cluttering 
unopened medicine cabinets.

Of course, if Metabolic can put AOD9604 in a can of diet Coke and a bag of 
chips, perhaps I should give my broker a call!

Ahhh! The fluoride of the *new* millennium.

Could you post that page here, or at least some instructions about how
to set something like this up for ourselves?

> Enron, Spawn of Business Journalism
> by Gary North

It's hard for me to get past Gary North's name in judging this article.
For those who have forgotten, North was the single loudest voice in
predicting Y2K apocalypse.  He predicted absolute disaster, starvation
and death throughout the entire world, with complete certainty.  His web
site had thousands of documents, each with his own pessimistic commentary,
selected to drive home the point that we were headed for an inevitable
and unstoppable catastrophe.  Of course he turned out to be absolutely
wrong, and he disappeared for quite a while after that, but apparently
he is now starting to show his head again.

So Gary North does not have much credibility with me.  Should I bother
to read his article, given his track record of being not just wrong on an
important issue, but being flagrantly, obnoxiously, infuriatingly wrong?
Here is where the ad hominen fallacy raises its head.  Usually it is
used as a debating tactic.  But the real point is that it can be an
error in our own thinking.  Should we reject possibly-valid analysis and
information just because of flaws in the source?  On the one hand, we
do need filters; we can't read everything that is written by the entire
human race.  But on the other hand, we risk filtering out useful data.

In any case, I read the article, and while it is not badly written, in
fact I don't agree with most of it.  However the errors that I see are
not blatant and some of what North says seems correct.  Errors include
his conclusion that Enron and the dot-com debacle disprove the efficient
market hypothesis, and that the Enron failure is largely due to government
subsidies.  I agree that the story does illustrate groupthink among
journalists and investors, but IMO that is not newsworthy analysis.

I think the core of the Enron story is and will be that the people
entrusted with management defrauded the investors.  This is a constant
problem in the capitalist world, at all scales.  Each of us puts our
savings into other people's hands, meaning that we have to trust them.
And such trust is risky.  Every day people lose money because they are
cheated by people they trusted.

In business, the issue is whether the management truly represents the
interests of the owners, the stockholders.  Every company is aware
of this risk.  The entire structure of the business firm is set up to
try to minimize this problem.  It's similar to cancer in an organism,
where a part of the whole decides to advance its own interests at the
expense of the larger body.  Biological organisms have defense in depth
against cancers, but sometimes those defenses fail.  In the same way,
firms have all kinds of checks and balances to try to keep individuals
from enriching themselves at the expense of the business.  But these
aren't perfect either.

In the case of Enron, I believe the evidence indicates that this is what
happened, that the managers looked after their own interests rather than
those of the company's owners whose investments they were supposed to
be protecting.  The use of complex financial structures defeated the
checks and balances; no one could tell where the money was going, so it
was too tempting to direct it into their own pockets.

Enron, in fact, was killed by cancer.  (Technically it's not quite dead
yet; it is dying of cancer.)  It's newsworthy, because it doesn't happen
often to businesses at this scale.  But the real lesson is that investors
need to be aware of this new risk.  They need to make sure that their
managers are not in a position to cheat the company through the use
of complex financial instruments.  The use of derivatives and swaps
can be profitable, but unless there is effective auditing in place,
the business is risking its own life in using these instruments.
Investors need to think of derivatives as carcinogenic stimulants.
They produce short term benefits but can lead to long term destruction.

IMO the Enron bankruptcy does not show the need for more government
supervision, or fewer government subsidies, or most of the other
lessons people are trying to draw.  It shows the need for investors to
be more careful.  It shows a failure of one of the main limits against
corruption, the use of independenet auditors.  Investors will want to
protect themselves by insisting that their employees, the managers,
hire auditors who have no financial incentive to cheat the investors
whom they are supposedly protecting.

These are the kinds of lessons which Enron teaches, and they are exactly
the kinds of lessons which the capitalist system excels at learning.
Even without any regulatory changes, Enron will lead to a new awareness
of risk, and new techniques to manage it.  The end result will be a
system which is more robust and more able to fight the cancers which
constantly threaten business survival.

I can like them even if they are not very intelligent.

Susan Griffin's fascinating account of the courtesans, women with
great power in a time when most women had none.

Not just the courtesans and their lives, but the lives of their
patrons, their times and even their methods.

Wonderfull stories of Paris during the Belle Epoque, Venice during
the Cinquecento, philosophers, poets, painters, and politicians.

And I'm barely halfway through.

Its axiomatic: people who are nuts are far more interesting than those
who are merely eccentric... wealth conveys mere eccentricity to any
insanity (and the wealthy can afford better psych meds)...

Fred is the patron saint of cows. Fred Tuttle, that is. See the indie
movie "Man with a Plan" about a Vermont cow farmer who runs for congress
so he can get that federal government health insurance for his wife's

Pat Leahy and endorsed Leahy (even voted for him). You can still buy
"Spread Fred" bumper stickers...

That matter influences light is an obvious fact - 
if it were not so, we could not see objects. 
The influence of light on matter is, however, 
a more subtle effect .....

<< In order for the eye to be able to focus an image on the retina, 
the axial length of the eye needs to be just right. If the eye is too 
long (or too short), then the image is perpetually focused in front 
of the retina (or behind it). The result is nearsightedness (or 
farsightedness). It turns out that the retina of the eye plays a big 
role in making sure that the axial length of the eye is just right. 
How? Well, the retina has the ability to determine whether an image 
is "in focus" or "out of focus." If an image is "out of focus" then 
the retina emits chemical signals that control the growth of the eye, 
making it either longer or shorter, as needed, so that the image can 
be focused properly.
But there's a big unanswered question: How does the retina determine 
whether an image is "in focus" or not? The obvious answer is that an 
image that's "in focus" is clear and has sharp edges, while an "out 
of focus" image is blurry. So one idea is that the retina can 
distinguish between "fuzzy" and "not fuzzy." But the photoreceptor 
cells (the cells that directly absorb the photons) cannot do this by 
themselves. Instead, a little bit of image processing is required. 
The photoreceptor cells synapse onto bipolar cells, and these synapse 
onto retinal ganglion cells. A single ganglion cell receives input 
from multiple photoreceptor cells. One function of ganglion cells is 
in "edge detection." An edge is defined as a sharp boundary 
between "light on" and "light off." So if the ganglion cells detect 
lots of sharp edges, then they might be able to conclude that an 
image is focused on the retina. 
The problem with the above hypothesis is that the ganglion cells 
appear *not* to be involved with the ability of the retina to 
determine whether an image is in focus. That is, if you kill off the 
ganglion cells (while keeping the photoreceptor cells intact), then 
the retina is *still* able to guide the development of the eye in 
such a way as to maintain the proper axial length. The experimental 
evidence is still a little bit sketchy, iiuc; but an argument can be 
made that the photoreceptor cells, all by themselves, can determine 
whether an image is focused or not on the retina. And as far as I 
know, there's no way to explain, in classical terms, how that might 
work. >>

YES.  I use Windoze where I have to for work and for one PDA 
that I am not convinced works better or as well when converted 
to run Linux.  But the above article is somewhat dated as it 
ignores the fact that Open Office reads (and writes) Word 
documents just fine in its latest incarnation and has an open 
format to its own data storage (XML).  Highly recommended for 
staying off of Windoze without losing the ability to read many 
files.

Interesting phenomenon.  The other obvious question is, even if the
retina can tell that the image is out of focus, how does it know whether
the focal plane is in front of or behind the retina?  In other words,
how does it know which way to grow in order to correct the problem?
That sounds even harder than determining whether the image is in focus
or not.

I wonder if they are barking up the wrong tree, and it is a signal from
the lens that does the trick, maybe some subtle chemical wafting through
the vitreous humor.

What do you mean by "not essentially different"?  I fail to 
comprehend this because I find incredible variety in people in 
terms of their level of GI, their motivations, goals, 
dedication, energy and so on.  I have met a few people in my 
life who are so different from me in some critical ways they I 
have wondered if they are even of the same species.

Now I agree perfectly that what Gates has done includes a lot of 
very slimey things that are a great part of his acheiving his 
billions and that this should not be.  But I don't agree that 
there are not essential differences in people in actuality 
(perhaps less so in potential) that will and should lead to 
different outcomes in how much they acheive and how much they 
are rewarded (as long as that kind of system exists and/or is 
needed).

This is a rather cynical view of work, isn't it?  While I have 
been fortunate enough to meet a few people in my time that I 
consider significantly brighter than I, I was bright enough in 
school  (I suspect many here were) to understand "effortlessly" 
things that most  had to struggle mightily with.  I used to feel 
guilty for getting the A while others worked many, many times 
harder to eek out a C.  But does that mean the system was unjust 
or simply that we are not all born or nurtured or somehow 
[randomly] meta-programmed equally?

The major innovators and achievers in most any profession are in 
fact "worth" considerably more in the magnitude of their 
accomplishments and their significance to the work and 
organization they are part of.  Whether or not they should 
receive all or a lot of that difference is another question.  In 
point of fact, most of the major contributors are "in the 
trenches" and often do not receive anywhere near the true market 
value (to their organization) of their work.

Well, I believe it is more complicated than that.  And whether 
humans are that different from one another or not isn't even the 
crux of the question imo.  The question is one of relative 
influence, well-being, access to tools and power to acheive. 
Personally I think that maximizing the last three for all people 
should be near the top of extropian goals.  But we don't need to 
deny differences in people to do this.

It might not work for anyone else because of Yahoo's session
cookies and such, but I'll describe what I did:

First, using Galeon (a Mozilla variant)  with Sun's Java VM installed,
I browsed to the chat applet in the usual way.  It comes up, but is
too small to be useful.  If you can't get that far, then you won't be
able to get any further.  From that page, I did a "view source" and
looked for the <applet> tag.  I cut that entire tag and its contents
into a text file, then manually edited the "height" and "width"
parameters to reasonable values (640 x 480 is good). I put some
minimal HTML code around the tag so it was a valid page, and put that
page on my server.  I then typed the URL of that new page into my
browser--the same browser session I was already using.

If it doesn't depend on the Yahoo login and session cookies,
then using the JDK's appletviewer might work.  I'll have to
experiment with that when I get home tonight.

Well, it is a sort of bootstrap problem.  You define the best 
goal-structure you can from where you are if you are to keep 
moving and simply not lay down and die or merely survive. 
Hopefully that goalset includes enough growth, experience, 
self-examination and (for extropians especially) expansion of 
abilities and working intelligence that you can later on 
re-analyse your drivers, motivations, goals and where they come 
from and create a more refined set.  Of course there are no 
guarantees up front that the process doesn't break down sooner 
or later.  There never are in any process that may be referred 
to as life.

Actually, I am not at all clear that we fully can yet or that 
doing so would actually not tremendously backfire politically 
and economically.  I very much want to believe we can however. 
But the attempts to do so, halfhearted as they were and even 
within the borders of highly developled countries, have been 
pretty dismal to date.

Actually, housing is not cheap relative to income in much of the 
  US and there are still far too many under- as well as 
malnourished people even here.  The problem is that our economic 
model has not shifted to "post-industrial", to the place where 
all of the adults working in a paying job is no longer required 
to take care of all the real needs and most of the wants of the 
population.  Our model is based on continuing climbing 
production and consumption.  This cannot be acheived without 
indefinitely without creating cancerous economic growths.

Or your benefactor does.  However, the premise is questionable 
on several grounds.  For many types of scientific, medical and 
technological progress the greatest need is sufficient talent 
and time free from other duties to focus upon the problem.  In 
an abundance based society where more than adequate food, 
clothing, shelter plus access to knowledge bases and processing 
power were guaranteed to all, these types of progress should 
flourish as should the arts generally.  For types of progress 
requiring more concentrated energy/material resources and 
greater organization it is not automatically given that these 
can only occur under capitalism.

Actually, you would be right on the ball... that's what status oriented
people do. Complex pecking order stuff. Poor substitute for a life in my
opinion, but then who the hell am I?

Interesting phenomenon.  The other obvious question is, even if the
retina can tell that the image is out of focus, how does it know whether
the focal plane is in front of or behind the retina?  In other words,
how does it know which way to grow in order to correct the problem?
That sounds even harder than determining whether the image is in focus
or not.

I wonder if they are barking up the wrong tree, and it is a signal from
the lens that does the trick, maybe some subtle chemical wafting through
the vitreous humor.

### The retina contains a number of other types of cells in addition to the
ganglion cells - such as the bipolar and amacrine cells (many types).
Apparently, muscarinic cholinergic activity is needed in the regulation of
ocular growth, but the exact pathways are not known (the cholinergic
amacrines are not its source). Other amacrines (with opiate and dopaminergic
receptrors) are apparently involved, as well as the activity of bFGF-2, VIP,
and possibly other signals. Even with all ganglion cells gone there is
enough circuitry in the retina for an edge detection algorith to hide in.

As far as I know the developing eye does not "know" if the retina is behind
or in front of the focal plane. However, by default the fetal eye is shorter
than it should be, so the focal plane is behind the retina. The eye keeps
growing until the image gets in focus, and then stops. If for some reason
this sharp image does not form, as in partial visual deprivation, or when
the signal from edge detection is not properly received by sclerocytes,
growth continues well beyond the optimal setpoint, resulting in worsening
nearsightedness. As far as I know there is no signal to shorten the eye,
only modulation of its growth rate.

GH is bad for you. It has a significant aging-promoting effect in transgenic
mice and most likely humans (see Bartke A. Brown-Borg HM. Bode AM. Carlson
J. Hunter WS. Bronson RT. Does growth hormone prevent or accelerate aging?.
[Review] [78 refs] [Journal Article. Review. Review, Tutorial] Experimental
Gerontology. 33(7-8):675-87, 1998 Nov-Dec) for review.

This reminds me about two of my patients, a married couple, who were
spending a fortune on GH supplementation, dreaming of staying forever young,
but most likely just speeding up a rush towards an early grave, all because
they read some quack's book on the alleged benefits of GH. And they wife was
very tanned, too - she looked ten years older than she was.

On Wed, 6 Feb 2002, Brian D Williams wrote a story
that I think I'll title "Extrication strategies
when one finds oneself in the jam".

Its one of the best stories I've heard in a long time.
I hereby nominate it for post of the month and
hope that I have the opportunity to hear him
tell it live and in person at a future extro
conference.

In my book the purpose of life is to collect
(and share) good stories.  Perhaps it should
be a standard feature of extro conferences to
have a story telling session.

I've seen it and checked out the website, but I won't be able to add to the 
online debate until tomorrow.  Gotta gather my thoughts....

Very true.  I was expecting the usual hatchet job, wondering when the 
"buts" would appear, followed by the obligatory spiel from the 
Eco-spokesperson or Right Reverand Killjoy.  But they stayed very much 
within the topics presented, and very much focussed on possible benefits.

Heh heh, that about sums it :)

Publicity is in general good, provided it is reasonably balanced.  Those 
who support or oppose it aren't likely to change sides anytime soon.  But 
it's the middle ground people who will make the difference, and your 
average middle grounder, given a little time, will be wanting the new tech 
for him/her self.

Most people, when it gets right down to it, will pick life over death, and 
the argument that they are stealing resources from some kid in the third 
world will be so distant from their frame of reference that it'll be 
ineffective.  Most aren't too worried if it steals it from their 
neightbour, let alone someone half a world away.  They won't buy that 
argument in relation to the BMW they just bought or their new villa on the 
Riviera, and it'll be much harder again to make a direct connection between 
them living longer and some claimed side effect on the worlds poor.

As I've said before, people don't yet know how "handy" extended health/life 
will be.  But safe and effective near term products would do a whole lot to 
help that.  Trouble is, how long will they take to appear?

I think, overall, the programme presented genetic technology as an exciting 
new thing with much promise for the average middle grounder.  And that is 
exactly the sort of exposure needed.



James....

BTW, it's good to see Nick Bostroms' excellent item on LE again on the BBC 
website!  I remember seeing the original showing on the "Heart of the 
Matter" programme a few years back.
"If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid."

Caveat: I have not read this article.  *But* the significant differences
in the relationship between teleomere shortening in mice and humans and
aging should caution us against extrapolations from mice to humans.

I would freely accept that GH supplementation in humans might accelerate
cancer progression.  That however might be counteracted by angiogenesis
inhibitors.  On the other hand GH supplementation might contribute to
increased muscle mass that would tend to reduce falls, hip fractures,
long periods of hospital down time and decreased mobility.

"Aging" is a complex multifactorial process.  Extrapolating conclusions
from GH supplementation in mice into humans is an *iffy* proposition --
as is supplementing GH in humans on the basis of limited studies.
It might be entirely true that GH supplementation could have a longevity
promoting effect for the elderly in some environments and a longevity
diminishing effect for the elderly in other environments.

Clearly GH is not the "one answer" -- provided people realize that and
carefully balance risks and benefits, I do not think they should be
prevented from using it.  At the same time it would be useful for
physicians to generate a meta-database of results based on such
individuals who are willing to treat themselves as "experimental vehicles".
Ultimately one wants to tie it back to genetic and lifestyle data so
one can determine when GH is likely to help more than it hurts.

In fact there is a completely orthogonal judgement vector that
extropians should consider -- a drug might actually serve to
shorten life, but significantly increases the quality of that
life.  The length of life x quality of life product is one that
has a very subjective valuation.  We must always be careful to
look to the person whose life is involved to ascertain those
values.

Obese, yes, but the other effects appear less significant than aging.
Would you rather be thin and die at 80 or fat and die at 112?  I like
being thin, but not *that* much.
Here's a cite:

Flurkey, Kevin; Papaconstantinou, John; Miller, Richard A.; Harrison, David
E..  Lifespan extension and delayed immune and collagen aging in mutant mice
with defects in growth hormone production. In: Proceedings of the National 
Academy
of Sciences of the United States of America June 5, 2001. 98 (12): 6736-6741.
Language: English;  Pub type: JOURNAL ARTICLE

Abstract: Single-gene mutations that extend lifespan provide valuable tools 
for the
exploration of the molecular basis for age-related changes in cell and tissue 
function and for
the pathophysiology of age-dependent diseases. We show here that mice h
omozygous for
loss-of-function mutations at the Pit1 (Snell dwarf) locus show a >40% 
increase in mean and
maximal longevity on the relatively long-lived (C3H/HeJXDW/J)F1 background. 
Mutant
 dwJ/dw animals show delays in age-dependent collagen cross-linking and in six
age-sensitive indices of immune system status. These findings thus 
demonstrate that a single
gene can control maximum lifespan and the timing of both cellular and 
extracellular
senescence in a mammal. Pituitary transplantation into dwarf mice does not 
reverse the
lifespan effect, suggesting that the effect is not due to lowered prolactin 
levels. In contrast,
homozygosity for the Ghrhrlit mutation, which like the Pit1dw mutation lowers 
plasma growth
hormone levels, does lead to a significant increase in longevity. Male Snell 
dwarf mice,
unlike calorically restricted mice, become obese and exhibit proportionately 
high leptin
levels in old age, showing that their exceptional longevity is not simply due 
to alterations in
adiposity per se. Further studies of the Pit1dw mutant, and the closely 
related, long-lived
Prop-1df (Ames dwarf) mutant, should provide new insights into the hormonal 
regulation of
senescence, longevity, and late life disease.

Ames dwarf mice seem to be doing quite well on reduced GH, at least in terms
of prolonged lifespan under laboratory conditions. Mice with increased GH
levels die early. Acromegaly, with high GH levels, is associated with early
death.

Presumably our levels of GH are tuned to conditions of our caveman
ancestors, where muscle mass, speed, boosted immune function, were much more
important than today, with large predators, and lots of parasites and
bacteria in the evironment. Perhaps a lower GH level would better fit the
reduced metabolic demands of today's life.

	He was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison.

        Recent tests by two laboratories hired by the
        prosecution and the defense came up with the
        same results: both rapes were committed by the
        same man, and that man was not Bruce
        Godschalk.

        Even so, the Montgomery County district
        attorney, Bruce L. Castor Jr., whose office
        convicted Mr. Godschalk, has refused to let Mr.
        Godschalk out of prison, saying he believes that
        Mr. Godschalk is guilty and that the DNA testing
        is flawed.

        Asked what scientific basis he had for concluding
        that the testing was flawed, Mr. Castor said in an
        interview today: "I have no scientific basis. I
        know because I trust my detective and my
        tape-recorded confession. Therefore the results
        must be flawed until someone proves to me
        otherwise." 

Damn pointy headed scientists!

Quite possible.  Reducing GH will reduce insulin growth factor activity,
and that reduction seems to be what triggers the CR effect.  I believe all of 
the longevity mutants with identified effects downregulate the IGF-1 pathway.
It's in nematodes and yeast as well as mice; that's pretty broad.
There's a lot of concern on the CR list about osteoporosis (several of the 
serious
practitioners have it as middle-aged males; very unusual) and osteoporosis
appears to be linked to low IGF-1 levels in humans.

But the link between low IGF-1 activity and slow aging is very good;
hence it's very likely that GH supplementation will speed aging per se.

Of course.  But right now, I'd say don't use GH unless you have some medical
problem (ie. osteo, immune deficiency) that justifies it.  GH for looks,
sexiness, or athletic performance is a bad deal IMO - you're risking 
many years of life and early deterioration.

Crypto-fascist is a made up word created by left-wingers to describe
anyone who is not openly for socialism, or else anyone who is not openly
against any sort of system where individual responsibility, liberty, and
accomplishment are of paramount importance. Anyone who pursues and
extolls excellence rather than mediocrity is a crypto-fascist (which
explains so succinctly why there continues to be political strife among
transhumanists).

Sorry I don't have time to answer responses adequately, although one
(Samantha's)  above perplexes me.  I was talking about "work" (as in making
a living) v. leisure and personal time (as in reading, traveling, cooking,
raising orchids, or whatever ...).  I'm not certain how eeking good grades
in school came into play.  (My idea of school is that it's a perpetual
vacation - what could possibly be more fun?  To me, the most decadent life
imaginable would be to live as an intellectual.)

Yes, that's a *very* funny story.  It will at least be mentioned in the

Hey, not a bad idea.  I can already foresee the chants of

Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset="iso-8859-1"

I just finished reading CFAI and GISAI and here are some questions and
comments:
Of course, SIAI <../GISAI/meta/glossary.html> knows of only one current
project advanced enough to even begin implementing the first baby steps
toward Friendliness - but where there is one today, there may be a dozen
tomorrow.
### Which other AI projects are on the right track?
------- 
That is, conscious reasoning can replace the "damage signal" aspect of pain.
If the AI successfully solves a problem, the AI can choose to increase the
priority or devote additional computational power to whichever subheuristics
or internal cognitive events were most useful in solving the problem,
replacing the positive-feedback aspect of pleasure.
### Do you think that the feedback loops focusing the AI on a particular
problem might (in any sufficiently highly organized AI) give rise to qualia
analogous to our feelings of "intellectual unease", and "rapture of an
insight"?
-------
The absoluteness of "The end does not justify the means" is the result of
the Bayesian Probability Theorem <../../GISAI/meta/glossary.html> applied to
internal cognitive events. Given the cognitive event of a human thinking
that the end justifies the means, what is the probability that the end
actually does justify the means? Far, far less than 100%, historically
speaking. Even the cognitive event "I'm a special case for [reason X] and am
therefore capable of safely reasoning that the end justifies the means" is,
historically speaking, often dissociated with external reality. The rate of
hits and misses is not due to the operation of ordinary rationality, but to
an evolutionary bias towards self-overestimation. There's no Bayesian
binding <../../GISAI/meta/glossary.html> between our subjective experience
of feeling justified and the external event of actually being justified, so
our subjective experience cannot license actions that would be dependent on
being actually justified.
### I think I can dimly perceive a certain meaning in the above paragraph,
with which I could agree (especially in hindsight after reading 3.4.3:
Causal validity semantics <design/structure/causal.html> ). Yet, without
recourse to the grand finale, this paragraph is very cryptic and in some
interpretations for me unacceptable.
------
I think that undirected evolution is unsafe, and I can't think of any way to
make it acceptably safe. Directed evolution might be made to work, but it
will still be substantially less safe than self-modification. Directed
evolution will also be extremely unsafe unless pursued with Friendliness in
mind and with a full understanding of non-anthropomorphic minds. Another
academically popular theory is that all people are blank slates, or that all
altruism is a child goal of selfishness - evolutionary psychologists know
better, but some of the social sciences have managed to totally insulate
themselves from the rest of cognitive science, and there are still AI people
who are getting their psychology from the social sciences.
### Is altruism something other than a child goal of selfishness? It was my
impression that evolutionary psychology predicts the emergence of altruism
as a result of natural selection. Since natural selection is not
goal-oriented, the goals defining the base of the goal system (at least if
you use the derivative validity rule),  are the goals present in the
subjects of natural selection - selfish organisms, which in the service of
their own survival have to develop (secondarily) altruistic impulses. As the
derivative validity rule is itself the outcome of ethical reasoning , one
could claim that it cannot invalidate the goals from which it is derived,
thus sparing us a total meltdown of the goal system and shutdown.
------
The semantics of objectivity are also ubiquitous because they fit very well
into the way our brain processes statements; statements about morality
(containing the word "should") are not evaluated by some separate, isolated
subsystem, but by the same stream of consciousness that does everything else
in the mind. Thus, for example, we cognitively expect the same kind of
coherence and sensibility from morality as we expect from any other fact in
our Universe
### It is likely that there are specialized cortical areas, mainly in the
frontopolar and ventromedial frontal cortices, involved in the processing of
ethics-related information. Many of us are perfectly capable of double- and
triple-thinking about ethical issues, as your examples of self-deception
testify, while similar feats of mental juggling are not possible in the
arena of mathematics or motorcycle maintenance.
----- 
Actually, rationalization does not totally disjoint morality and actions; it
simply gives evolution a greater degree of freedom by loosely decoupling the
two. Every now and then, the gene pool or the memetic environment spits out
a genuine altruist; who, from evolution's perspective, may turn out to be a
lost cause. The really interesting point is that evolution is free to load
us with beliefs and adaptations which, if executed in the absence of
rationalization, would turn us into total altruists ninety-nine point nine
percent of the time. Thus, even though our "carnal" desires are almost
entirely observer-centered, and our social desires are about evenly split
between the personal and the altruistic, the adaptations that control our
moral justifications have strong biases toward moral symmetry, fairness,
truth, altruism, working for the public benefit, and so on.
### In my very personal outlook, the "moral justifications" are the results
of advanced information processing applied in the service of "carnal"
desires, supplemented  by innate, evolved biases. The initial supergoals are
analyzed, their implications for action under various conditions are
explored, and the usual normative human comes to recognize the superior
effectiveness of fairness, truth, etc., for survival in a social situation.
As a result the initial supergoals are overwritten by new content (at least
to some degree, dictated by the ability to deceive others). As much as the
imprint of my 4-year old self in my present mind might object, I am forced
to accept the higher Kohlberg stage rules. Do you think that the Friendly AI
will have some analogue of such (higher) levels? Can you hypothesize about
the supergoal content of such level? Could it be translated back for
unenhanced humans, or would it be only accessible to highly improved
uploads?
-----
An AI's complete mind-state at any moment in time is the result of a long
causal chain. We have, for this moment, stopped speaking in the language of
desirable and undesirable, or even true and false, and are now speaking
strictly about cause and effect. Sometimes the causes described may be
beliefs existing in cognitive entities, but we are not obliged to treat
these beliefs as beliefs, or consider their truth or falsity; it suffices to
treat them as purely physical events with purely physical consequences. 
This is the physicalist perspective, and it's a dangerous place for humans
to be. I don't advise that you stay too long. The way the human mind is set
up to think about morality, just imagining the existence of a physicalist
perspective can have negative emotional effects. I do hope that you'll hold
off on drawing any philosophical conclusions until the end of this topic at
the very least
### If I understand this paragraph correctly, my way of thinking about
myself has been physicalist for the past 10 - 15 years, yet it failed to
produce negative emotional effects. I am an information processing routine,
with the current self-referential goal of preserving its continued
existence, all in the context of  15x10e9 years of the Universe's evolution.
Even this self-referential supergoal can be explicitly renounced if it
becomes advantageous for the routine's survival (as in joining the Borg to
escape the Klingons).
----
The rule of derivative validity - "Effects cannot have greater validity than
their causes." - contains a flaw; it has no tail-end recursion. Of course,
so does the rule of derivative causality - "Effects have causes" - and yet,
we're still here; there is Something rather than Nothing. The problem is
more severe for derivative validity, however. At some clearly defined point
after the Big Bang, there are no valid causes (before the rise of
self-replicating chemicals on Earth, say); then, at some clearly defined
point in the future (i.e., the rise of homo sapiens sapiens) there are valid
causes. At some point, an invalid cause must have had a valid effect. To
some extent you might get around this by saying that, i.e., self-replicating
chemicals or evolved intelligences are pattern-identical with (represent)
some Platonic valid cause - a low-entropy cause, so that evolved
intelligences in general are valid causes - but then there would still be
the question of what validates the Platonic cause. And so on. 
The rule of derivative validity is embedded very deeply in the human mind.
It's the ultimate drive behind our search for the Meaning of Life. It's the
reason why we instinctively dislike circular logic. It's a very powerful
shaper(!). Just violating it arbitrarily, to trick the AI into doing
something, or in the belief that it doesn't really matter... well, that
wouldn't be safe (4), because that kind of "selfishness" is designated as an
extraneous cause by quite a few deeper shapers. Of course, I'm omitting the
possibility that the programmer personally believes that kind of logic is
okay (i.e., would use it herself), in which case things would probably come
out okay, though I personally would worry that this programmer, or her
shaper network, had too high a tolerance for circular logic...
### I think it's possible for a human to have both a limited use of
derivative validity and circular (or self-referential) basis for the goal
system. See my comments above.
---
We want a Meaning of Life that can be explained to a rock, in the same way
that the First Cause (whatever it is) can be explained to Nothingness. We
want what I call an "objective morality" - a set of moral propositions, or
propositions about differential desirabilities, that have the status of
provably factual statements, without derivation from any previously accepted
moral propositions. We want a tail-end recursion to the rule of derivative
validity. Without that, then yes - in the ultimate sense described above,
Friendliness is unstable
### I do agree with the last sentence. A human's self-Friendliness is
inherently unstable, too
---
As General Intelligence and Seed AI describes a seed AI capable of
self-improvement, so Creating Friendly AI describes a Friendly AI capable of
self-correction. A Friendly AI is stabilized, not by objective morality -
though I'll take that if I can get it - but by renormalization, in which the
whole passes judgement on the parts, and on its own causal history.
### This seems to summarize my goal system functioning, with the importance
of personal history, use of a wide range of cognitive tools to derive rules,
and to slowly change the goal system. 
----
. Even if an extraneous cause affects a deep shaper, even deep shapers don't
justify themselves; rather than individual principles justifying themselves
- as would be the case with a generic goal system protecting absolute
supergoals - there's a set of mutually reinforcing deep principles that
resemble cognitive principles more than moral statements, and that are
stable under renormalization. Why "resemble cognitive principles more than
moral statements"? Because the system would distrust a surface-level moral
statement capable of justifying itself! 
### Can you give examples of such deep moral principles?
-----
Humanity is diverse, and there's still some variance even in the panhuman
layer, but it's still possible to conceive of description for humanity and
not just any one individual human, by superposing the sum of all the
variances in the panhuman layer into one description of humanity. Suppose,
for example, that any given human has a preference for X; this preference
can be thought of as a cloud in configuration space. Certain events very
strongly satisfy the metric for X; others satisfy it more weakly; other
events satisfy it not at all. Thus, there's a cloud in configuration space,
with a clearly defined center. If you take something in the panhuman layer
(not the personal layer) and superimpose the clouds of all humanity, you
should end up with a slightly larger cloud that still has a clearly defined
center. Any point that is squarely in the center of the cloud is "grounded
in the panhuman layer of humanity".
### What if the shape of superposition turns out to be more complicated,
with the center of mass falling outside the maximum values of the
superposition? In that case implementing a Friendliness focused on this
center would have outcomes distasteful to all humans, and finding
alternative criteria for Friendliness would be highly nontrivial.

### And a few more comments:
I wonder if you read Lem's "Golem XIV"?
Oops, Google says you did read it. Of course.

In a post on Exilist you say that uploading is a post-Singularity
technology. While I intuitively feel that true AI will be built well before
the computing power becomes available for an upload, I would imagine it
should be possible to do uploading without AI. After all, you need just some
improved scanning methods, and with laser tissue machining, quantum dot
antibody labeling and high-res confocal microscopy, as well as the proteome
project, this might be realistic in as little as 10 years (a guess). With a
huge computer but no AI the scanned data would give you a human mind in a
box, amenable to some enhancement.
What do you think about using interactions between a nascent AI and the
upload(s), with reciprocal rounds of enhancemnt and ethical system transfer,
to develop Friendliness?

And, by the way, I do think that CFAI and GISAI are wonderful intellectual
achievements.
Rafal

Moo!!!

### Gee, I hated school with a vengeance - as in having to sit bored out of
my mind after reading the handbook (if boredom didn't stop me from that as
well), while the class was still going through the first chapters. Or
memorizing dates of battles (1410, the battle of Grunwald, 1648 the Cossack
uprisings... no google needed to recall these useless facts).

Just to make it clear: DNA is transcribed from the 5-prime to the 3-prime
end. What happens when the uncoiling hits the centrome? Beats me.

### Gee, I hated school with a vengeance - as in having to sit bored out of
my mind after reading the handbook (if boredom didn't stop me from that as
well), while the class was still going through the first chapters. Or
memorizing dates of battles (1410, the battle of Grunwald, 1648 the Cossack
uprisings... no google needed to recall these useless facts).

I agree if you are talking about school that kids go to. Blah.

I meant, and I think Olga meant, grownup, self-educating, uni kind of
school.

Then I am afraid that I am at a loss to get a handle on what you 
really mean by "work", "living", "school" or your understanding 
of what an intellectual does and does not do or of the effort 
required.  I get the impression that you have a rather, well 
classical Marxist view of work being that which is imposed on 
one by others and any life other than such effort being one of 
"decadence".  But that can't be right.

The original subject was notions of social justice in some 
getting more rewards than others from which the mundane example 
of brighter or more scholastically able kids being treated 
better and getting more goodies than others was thrown in as 
possibly illustrative.  You seem to have been derailed by it 
though so I guess it didn't work for the subject at hand.

Asuming we agree that it was intended to be a
democratic nation:

Sadly, IMO, the intentions were at best only
conceptually anything great.  Democracy at its finest
can guarantee the liberties of the majority and those
who they favor.  In theory, if human logic evolved as
was hoped in the age of reason, the majority would be
unified under goals benefiting the maximum possible
number of humans.

In America's current state however the majority pushes
for extreme vengence as much in the courts as abroad,
petty selfish lifestyles, and looks the other way at
the *sometimes* dark truths of the nation's actions. 
The majority wants unfettered and blind nationalism to
avoid the pains of independant (and hence often
lonely) thought.

This majority under any standard is poorly educated
and easily manipulated.  Right now I believe Bush's,
Ashcroft's (in the past maybe Reno's) goals will
reflect the thoughts of the majority since they helped
forge the image in their minds to begin with.  To me
this is the nature and intention of democracy no
matter how sour and depressing it may seem.

I didn't say that I *ever* knew of any AI project on the "right track". 
My phrasing was "advanced enough to even begin".  And now that Webmind has
gone down, there aren't any AI projects left even in that category - that
I know about, anyway.  Peter Voss has earned my respect, but he hasn't
said enough (that I know of) about the proposed architecture of his AI
project for me to judge whether it would be capable of representing a
Friendly goal system.

I do not pretend to understand qualia.  But what focuses the AI on a
particular problem is not a low-level feedback loop, but a deliberately
implemented feedback loop.  The AI controls the feedback.  The feedback
doesn't control the AI.  Unless an FAI deems it necessary to shift to the
human pleasure-pain architecture to stay Friendly, I can't see vis mental
state ever becoming that closely analogous to human emotions.

My apologies.  Just because CFAI is 910K long doesn't mean that it wasn't
written in a tearing hurry.

For the record, what I was trying to talk about was the internal use of
the Bayesian theorem for meta-rationality - deciding to what extent the
thought "X" implies the real-world state X.  Any imperfect organism can
use meta-rationality to correct for internal errors - not just evolved
biases, but also things like insufficient cognitive resources.

However, Bayesian reflectivity is most important for (a) correcting human
biases, (b) understanding the ethical heuristics that humans use to
correct those biases that they view as invalid, (c) understanding the
social heuristics that humans use to spot uncorrected biases in others,
and (d) making principled statements about whether such social heuristics
should be generalized to AIs.

Within a given human, altruism is an adaptation, not a subgoal.  This is
in the strict sense used in CFAI, i.e. Tooby and Cosmides's "Individual
organisms are best thought of as adaptation-executers rather than as
fitness-maximizers."

Yes.  (Strictly speaking EP explains known altruism in terms of natural
selection, and makes predictions about further details, but "altruism" was
a known phenomenon before EP or even Darwin, and shouldn't count as a
successful prediction.)

If the rule of derivative validity can't be tail-ended through an
objective morality, then the point at which we will be forced to make a
controlled exception (for ourselves, and for our AIs) will lie somewhere
around the evolution of altruism.

The derivative validity instinct becomes complex when partially thwarted. 
Where we choose to place our reluctant exceptions will then likely be
based on the degree to which evolution is seen as playing puppeteer or
conduit.  For example, in the case of when a human feels that he or she is
"entitled" to something, evolution is clearly playing puppet master.  In
the case of mathematics, evolution is clearly playing unbiased conduit. 
The question then becomes whether the rule of derivative validity, or the
semantics of objectivity, are more like self-righteousness or
mathematics.  I would say they are more like mathematics.

I agree.  But emotions modulate the stream of consciousness; they don't
reimplement the stream of consciousness under different rules.  There is
not one hippocampus used by moral thinking and a separate hippocampus used
by motorcycle maintenance.  To have two completely different systems, you
would need two completely different brains.

Possible, but not likely - possible if mathematics or motorcycle
maintenance becomes a political issue.  Our emotions are capable of
influencing any mental "cause" that has a moral "effect".  To the extent
that motorcycle maintenance is rarely biased, it is because motorcycle
maintenance rarely becomes a moral/social/political issue.  Let two people
get in an argument about motorcycle maintenance and each may begin to
tolerate flawed arguments that happen to argue in favor of their own
positions, or reject correct arguments that argue against their positions,
where in private they would have evenly weighed both sides of the issue.

By computation in the service of "carnal" desires, do you mean computation
in the service of evolution's goals, or computation that has been skewed
by rationalization effects toward outcomes that the thinker finds
attractive?  In either case the effective parent goals are not limited to
"carnal" desires.

I think this is a common misconception from the "Age of Game Theory" in
EP.  (By the "Age of Game Theory" I mean the age when a game-theoretical
explanation was thought to be the final step of an analysis; we still use
game theory today, of course.)  Only a modern-day human, armed with
declarative knowledge about Axelrod and Hamilton's results for the
iterated Prisoner's Dilemna, would employ altruism as a strict subgoal. 
And even then the results would be suboptimal because people instinctively
mistrust agents who employ altruism as a subgoal rather than "for its own
sake"... but that's a separate issue.  A human in an ancestral environment
may come to see virtue rewarded and wickedness punished, or more likely,
witness the selective reporting of virtuous rewards and wicked follies. 
However, this memetic effect only reinforces an innate altruism instinct. 
It does not construct a cultural altruism strategy from scratch.

I'm not sure I believe in Kohlberg, but that aside:  From the perspective
of a human, an FAI would most closely resemble Kohlberg 6, and indeed
could not be anything but Kohlberg 6, because an FAI cannot be influenced
by threat of punishment, threat of disapproval, someone else's opinion, or
society's opinion, except insofar as the FAI decides that these events
represent valid signals about vis target goal content.

Yes, that's the point.  The design requirement is that Friendliness should
be at least as stable as the moral structure and altruistic content of any
human.  If the human structure disapproves of itself, so will
Friendliness.  If the human structure reluctantly decides to keep the
human structure for lack of a better alternative, so should Friendliness.

Heh.  Such principles in CFAI are more described than seen, because they
mostly fall under the catgory of "Friendship content" rather than
"Friendship structure".  The deep principles can be discovered by
examination of a human, as long as you start out with the Friendship
structure needed to deduce moral shapers from moral statements.

Two deep principles that do make a cameo in CFAI are the rule of
derivative validity and the semantics of objectivity, both of which, when
applied to themselves, unflinchingly judge themselves to be flawed.  The
semantics of objectivity are derived from social selection pressures as
well as objective truths; the rule of derivative validity is ultimately
caused by evolution, even though it is more in the nature of mathematics
than self-righteousness.  Both are stable under renormalization as long as
they are the optimum *achievable*, even though they may not be the optimum
*imaginable*.

But at any rate they are not self-protecting; there is no reason why they
would be.

Well, what would *you* do in a situation like that?
What would you want a Friendly AI to do?

It seems to me that problems like these are also subject to
renormalization.  You would use the other principles to decide what to do
about the local problem with panhuman grounding.

If that's not the answer you had in mind, could you please give a more
specific example of a problem?  It's hard to answer questions when things
get this abstract.

The statement about post-Singularity technology reflects relative rates of
development, not an absolute technological impossiblity.  In other words,
you might be able to carry out uploading in 30 years (10 is a bit much),
but the precursor technologies are such as to permit the construction of
an AI, using the knowledge of cognitive science gained from snooping on
human neural processes.  For that matter, uploading precursor technologies
would allow you to construct a 64-human grid with broadband
brain-to-computer-to-brain links.  Uploading does not require SI; it
requires knowledge and technology that could also be used to follow much
shorter paths to strong transhumanity.

Using a system with a human component should only be necessary if
Friendliness turns out to be substantially more "human" (nonportable) than
I currently expect.  I would consider it as, if not a "last" resort, then
at least not the default resort.  Hopefully it will be pretty clear that
the AI has "gotten" Friendliness and is now inventing vis own, clearly
excellent ideas about Friendliness, so that the thought of the AI needing
a human to supply some extra "kick" seems unlikely, and in any case we
would trust the AI to notice on vis own if a situation like that
developed.

I suppose that during the Singularity someone could volunteer to be
uploaded, copied, and have the copy/original go along with the AI on vis
path to superintelligence, as an advisor, as long as it's clear that this
presents *no* additional threat of takeover by a transcending upload. 
Necessary conditions for "no additional threat" are that the AI-born SI
remains smarter, remains in control of the computing system, and does not
accept the upload-born SI's advice uncritically.

Thank you kindly, good sir.  No doubt your message will someday appear
under the dictionary entry for "constructive criticism".

Actually, it was intended as a democratic republic, the republic

The majority is not even conscious enough (my design I believe) 
to even be said to want anything in particular.  It simply does

It has less to do with democracy than it has to do with the 
purposeful manipulation and crafting of the mass pysche.

No, i think Dan Clemmensen was correct.  RNA Polymerase goes from the 3'
to the 5', so the RNA produced is created in the 5' to 3' direction and
can be processed by the ribosomes while transcription is still going on
(in prokaryotes that is, in eukaryotes this simultaneity doesn't occur,
but the direction of transcription is still the same).

How does capitalism dress up, in your opinion?  IMO, whether dressing in
traditional vestments, or preferring the latest in haute couture fashions:
oligarchy seems to be the clothing of choice in Capitalism, USA.

Is this phenomenon still observed in late(r) life? I seem to have developed a bit of nearsightedness in my one
LASIKed-to-better-than-20/20 eye, and have been wondering if some adaptation effect related to my uncorrected eye might
be "pulling" the other back into elongation. The new nearsightedness only became noticeable after the one year warranty
expired (*sigh*).

With regard to calorically restricted mice, there has been a report1 that
the IGF-1 receptor density increases with age (as compared to no consistent
changes in ad lib-fed animals with age), accompanied by a decrease in IGF-1
levels and an increase in growth-hormone release. IGF-1 levels increase in
ad lib-fed aging mice and in aging humans, while growth-hormone release
decreases with age.

The amplitude of growth-hormone secretory pulses decreases with age in ad
lib-fed animals, and short-term caloric restriction in young animals also
results in a decline in the amplitude of growth hormone.  However, in older
caloric-restricted animals, growth-hormone pulses were similar to those in
young ad lib-fed mice, with both the number of pulses of growth hormone and
mean growth hormone concentrations increased substantially compared to older
ad lib-fed mice. Apparently, there is a long-term adjustment that takes
place in the growth hormone and IGF-1 axis in chronically calorically
restricted mice so that, even with 40% less food (called "moderate caloric
restriction" to distinguish it from outright starvation), the animals have
greater protein synthesis, along with greater growth-hormone and lower IGF-1
levels.

Growth Factor (IGF-1) on Biological Aging: Inferences from Moderate
Caloric-Restricted Animals," J. Gerontol.: Biological Sciences

Any society that doen't recognise the sanctity of private property, of
the individual's right to the fruit of their own labor (and what may be
earned by investing the savings of that), is quite rightly called a
dictatorship. Anything that isn't capitalism is tyranny.

Yes, a mercantilist oligarchy is an apt description of a large chunck of
the national government and big business, while the majority of business
is still a free market (since most businesses are and employees work for
small businesses involved in local/regional trade. Keep in mind that
large scale labor brokers (i.e. so-called labor unions) are also
properly classified as mercantilist oligarchs (since their members have
little choice in joining or not, and have no voice in how their
membership dues are spent on bribing politicians), while other special
interests, the so-called NGO's, purport to have their members interests
in mind, but are generally just for anything that for-profit businesses
are against, and vice versa, with a few exceptions, like the NRA, the
Red Cross, etc..

I should have made myself clearer. Sorry.

You make the mistake of thinking that I was referring simply to people who 
inherited money from their parents. But I was actually thinking of lucky us 
-- us on this list. I would not be considered wealthy by many in Australia 
or USA -- my total income is currently about US$75 per week. I am 
nevertheless very wealthy when compared against the bulk of humanity, and 
consider myself extremely priveleged. I have no intention of wasting that 
privelege though, and am building my own business that hopefully will 
increase my income 100-fold soon.

Whether we acknowledge it or not we have all benefitted from a social 
contract. Over many centuries people have built up all the knowledge and 
capabilities that we wield.

There is no such thing as a self made man. Each of us here has got here 
largely through the efforts of countless generations of people before us 
and those around us now.

If someone uses this knowledge and power for the general good then they may 
do well out of it or not, but it is unlikely that those around them will 
hate them for it. However if they decide that they owe nobody anything and 
contribute as little as possible then they should not be surprised or feign 
moral outrage when those around them consider them parasitic or work 
against their interests.

We are all free to help the rest of humanity or to contribute nothing, or 
anything in between. In a very real sense we owe nobody anything, but at 
the same time it is easy to see how it makes good sense to live by rules 
that ensure people give back to society in some kind of proportion to their 
capability. It prevents things becoming too lopsided -- it is in nobody's 
interests to create a very deep social divide that results in violent 
revolution.

I have seen plenty of people (particularly on this list) say that they 
object to having to comply with a social contract that is not of their 
making, but they are not seeing the whole picture. If they really want no 
part of the deal I don't think there'd be much objection to them opting 
out. The problem comes when they want to keep all the benefits from society 
without complying with its commonsense rules.

Cheers,

         - Miriam

A slight correction...

Unions cannot spend member money directly on political causes.
However unions due try to collect money ($3.00 a quarter) for the
PAC, which is used for political purposes.

You can deduct the PAC from your dues and members like myself who
do not blindly support a political party, do.

The book I mentioned awhile back "The Rule of Three" goes into why
in a mature market there will be three main generalist competitors
with niche players catering to speciality markets. An emergent
behavior of markets.

Effectively an oligarchy.

A POLISH CORPORATION

You have two cows. Each one is worried that the other one might get a better
milk output, so she keeps kicking the other one's milk pail. All milk goes
to waste. And then the farmer asks them to screw in lightbulbs, 'cause he
doesn't know how.

Yet the union claims to represent ALL of its members when lobbying, AND
I have first hand experience with how 'voluntary' the PAC donation is.
Many unions, like Laborers International, actively discourage members
having a party affiliation outside the DNC, especially for shop stewards
and local presidents.

And how many members of the union are aware of this and take advantage
of it? And how many unions do, in fact make this voluntary? A few? Some?
Apparently not a lot, since the unions have successfully fought against
this being mandated in the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Act.

This is of course highly dependent upon what the cost of entry to the
market is as well as how advantageous economies of scale are in that
particular market. 

A market that requires huge amounts of capital every year to be invested
in manufacturing infrastructure to compete effectively in the mass
market, as well as in new model year product development would tend
toward oligopoly under standard industrial technologies due to this
large cost barrier to entry. This is not always the case, however.

For example, take the firearms industry. Few people will dispute that it
is a rather mature market: we are still using propellants and basic
architectures of firearms that have changed little in more than a
century, and many of the most popular models were designed, or are based
on designs dating back to the US Civil War. Yet despite this apparent
maturity, there are a dozen or more major firearms makers in the US
alone, and thousands of smaller outfits producing all manner of
firearms.

Why is this? Ray Kurzweil can explain this best: because of
technological singularities. Industrial manufacturing technology has
become so mature, so commonplace, and so easy to use that the cost of
entry for a firearms maker is very small, and one can easily outsource
many manufacturing steps that a small maker cannot perform in house. A
good friend of mine is a firearms manufacturer who makes firearms in the
shop of his retail gun store and in his home workshop. Another group of
friends have a similar operation a few miles further down the road. 

The only real restraint on their ability to do business is that of
governmental regulation, which restricts what kinds of arms they can
make and who they can sell them to.

Look also at the illicit drug industry. In the manufacture of marijuana,
cocaine, heroine, methamphetamines and many other illegal drugs, it can
be said that the market is highly mature. The market for designer drugs
is small relative to the market as a whole, and the technology of
manufacture is inexpensive and easy to use.

Furthermore, look at the software industry. There are far more than
three major software makers, and much, if not the majority, of software
comes from specialty programmers.

The reason for this needs to be determined.  I've always thought
there might be a number of possibilities.
1) A loss of cells producing GH (neurons die with age).
2) A decrease in protein production efficiency with age, say
   due to the accumulation of junk like lipofuscin in the cells.
3) A decrease in the energy available for protein production with age,
   due to an increase in mitochondria with damaged DNA.
4) A decrease in protein manufacturing capability due to homologous
   recombination repair between ribosomal-RNA "repeats" in the genome
   causing a physical loss of raw ribosomal blueprints from which
   ribosomes can be produced.
5) Explicit downregulation of GH production.

Obviously there can be complex interactions between 2-4, perhaps
promoting 1.  This can also be "systemic".  If GH declines and
causes liver production of albumin to decline and albumin is
required for the adequate production of GH, then you get locked
into a downward spiral (note that I don't *know* this is the case,
I'm speculating here).  Rafal might comment on the degree to
which various parts of the brain depend on circulating levelsFrom owner-extropians@tick.javien.com Thu Feb  7 11:18:45 2002

IIRC, GH spikes start falling off quite early - around 30.  That would argue
against most of 1-4.  I wasn't aware 4 happened.  What's the timeframe on
that?

As in, response to GHRH holds up, it's the GHRH spikes which fall off?

Goofy on one level, but then even if aging were recognized
as a disease, how do you measure it?  Better to test and
market these things as preventing loss of muscle strength,
osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, memory loss, etc.  Something
with a significant effect on aging in general (to the extent that
that means something) will show up on some of those nice
crisp markers.  We won't lose anything useful.

I think you're giving its users too much credit.  It's just a
meaningless buzzword tossed around for emotional impact; to assign
sinister motives implies that one is operating rationally to
achieve some goal, rather than just reacting.

If you're reading about some drug, you know that when you see
certain words like "burns fat" or "removes toxins" or "increases
energy" that you need read no further; they have destroyed any
credibility they might have had, and you can safely assume you're
being scammed without reading further. Likewise, when a political
opinion includes the word "crypto-fascist", you need read no
further: nothing else being said there is likely to be of value.

NASA has just given/gotten the goahead for new development of nuclear
power and propulsion systems for space vehicles. Beyond RTG's, NASA
wants Sterling Radioisotope Generators (SRGs) as well as nuclear rockets
and nuclear powered ion engines for long range exploration: not just for
Pluto and Kuiper Belt probes, but for unmanned and manned Mars
missions....

I'm just surprised that that old anti-nuker astrophysicist Michio
"Ka-Ka" Kaku wasn't there spewing inanities about solar power and the
alleged risks of RTGs...

Crypto-fascist is a term often used by marginalised political movements to
argue that those in power have a hidden agenda of undermining democratic
government and supporting an agenda of authoritarianism and nationalism.
Crypto = hidden, as these "faceless fascists" do not wish to publicise their
long-term goal of an authoritarian, nationalist state after overturning
democracy. After all, fascists are the revolutionaries.

The description is not very useful as it can be compared to the use of the
term 'Communist' during the 1950s which functioned as a slur to undermine
the public reputation of many liberals as well as identifying communists.

You could toy with the clumsy term illiberal for Ashcroft although it has a
different sense for an American audience due to the pejorative connotations
of the term 'liberal'. Authoritarian is probably a sufficient descriptive
for his actions as he intends to extend the power and authority of the
Federal Government in an emergency situation at the expense of civil
liberties and percieved traditional freedoms.

Here is the complete  article I snipped the early information  from, pardon
for not including it all for proper context, my bad.

INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 1: PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS
The expression of some genes is more favorable when it takes place in young
animals than when it takes place after animals are older. The existence of
differences in the effect of a gene's expression depending upon where it
acts or the time of its expression are called pleiotropic effects.
The effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) looks more and more like
a pleiotropic effect. In mammals, IGF-1, released in response to growth
hormone, stimulates growth and wound healing. As mammals age, however, it
appears that IGF-1 may increase the likelihood of developing cancer, because
it increases cellular division. It is well known that mitogens, substances
that increase cell division, can increase the risk of cancer simply because
the more times a cell divides, the more chances there are for a mistake to
take place that will result in loss of proliferative control. In older
humans, elevated levels of IGF-1 have been reported to be associated with
increased risks of prostate and breast cancer.
Thus, we find that IGF-1 is associated with retinopathy because it
stimulates the neovascularization (excess formation of blood vessels in the
retina) that underlies retinopathy. While it is obviously important to be
able to grow new blood vessels in case of injury, in response to exercise,
and during preadult growth and development, in the long run there may be a
pathological downside of excessive growth of blood vessels in some places,
such as the retina (retinopathy) or in tumors (angiogenesis).
With regard to calorically restricted mice, there has been a report1 that
the IGF-1 receptor density increases with age (as compared to no consistent
changes in ad lib-fed animals with age), accompanied by a decrease in IGF-1
levels and an increase in growth-hormone release. IGF-1 levels increase in
ad lib-fed aging mice and in aging humans, while growth-hormone release
decreases with age.
The amplitude of growth-hormone secretory pulses decreases with age in ad
lib-fed animals, and short-term caloric restriction in young animals also
results in a decline in the amplitude of growth hormone.  However, in older
caloric-restricted animals, growth-hormone pulses were similar to those in
young ad lib-fed mice, with both the number of pulses of growth hormone and
mean growth hormone concentrations increased substantially compared to older
ad lib-fed mice. Apparently, there is a long-term adjustment that takes
place in the growth hormone and IGF-1 axis in chronically calorically
restricted mice so that, even with 40% less food (called "moderate caloric
restriction" to distinguish it from outright starvation), the animals have
greater protein synthesis, along with greater growth-hormone and lower IGF-1
levels.
Another study2 reports that in 24 postmenopausal women aged 57 and older who
had taken long-term estrogen replacement treatment (83% for ten years or
more), there were higher growth-hormone levels and lower IGF-1 levels than
in estrogen nonusers. The long-term estrogen users had higher mean
circulating GH levels and more frequent GH secretory bursts (though the
amplitude of the GH bursts was no greater than in the nonusers), along with
lower IGF-1 levels. All hormone users were taking 0.625 mg a day of Premarin
for at least three years prior to the study. Whether the higher GH/lower
IGF-1 has similar youth-promoting implications to the higher GH/lower IGF-1
of caloric restriction is something we don't know. It should be noted that
the decrease in IGF-1 levels was specific to oral estrogen replacement
therapy (ERT) and did not apply to transdermal ERT. The authors state that
oral but not transdermal ERT results in high liver-portal estrogen
concentrations, and estrogen inhibits liver IGF-1 synthesis. Hence, the
lower IGF-1 levels may be a direct effect on the liver.

Funny.  In "Visions", he appeared to be totally in favor of nuclear and
ionic based propulsion systems as being the future of spaceflight in the
21st century.  What would he be doing there?

Weeellll-- This is probably all incomprehensibly parochial for the
non-Aussies who largely comprise the list, but those in charge of cow entry
would disagree with this account, asserting that it's more like:

AN AUSTRALIAN CORPORATION
You have one cow that swam ashore. You can't be certain that it is not
infected with plague, so you place it in a razor-wire-fenced detention
center. Another cow swims ashore but you are starting to suspect that these
are not cows but rabbits, so you send it to a distant Pacific island. The
number of cows (or possibly rabbits) arriving at shore drops drastically
and your board gets reappointed with a bonus.

I'm not ahead, true. I'm quitting before I'm too far behind.
(Oddly enough, Damien, a friend of mine decided that ze's going to try and win the lottery,

My best definition would be along the lines of Crowley's: "Magick is the art and science of 
causing change in reality in conformity with Will" (or close to that, I don't know the exact 
wording off the top of my head.).
So, in short, mental bootstrapping.
(This of course, requires a definition of Will. "Intent" is probably a better word. Will could 
be said to contain the entire process of imagining something - figuring out how it is done - 
doing it.)

Yep. Neurolinguistic Programming plays quite a large part in modern chaos magick, 
actually.

Or you just believe on observation.. I bitch about running into constant red lights, do a bit 
of mental acrobatics, and note that every (or very nearly, nothing's perfect) traffic light is 
green for the rest of the day. Sometimes this has lasted a few days or a week; depending 
on my general state of mind.

The ironic thing here is that magick generally isn't useful for much more, at least in my 
experience. Plenty of intimate subjective things can happen in my head and sometimes in 
another persons if we're very close and working together; but try and do anything more 
practical than nudging small coincidences into favorable conditions and I fail, rather 
spectacularly.

Scared to death of being alone and afraid, but I wish I was able to not feel like killing

No, I don't :/
If I had that sort of mojo, I'd probably have an insanely popular (well, as far as EBM goes, 
anyway) album out, a few books of poetry, and either some sort of non-hellish job or 
enough income from that to not need to work.
Instead, I am unemployed, in the middle of making a lot of songs, but nothing ever gets 
finished, and I lost the vast majority of my poetry in the Great PDA Crash of 2001 (the 
sync program wasn't working right, but thankfully I've found hardcopies. Just need to 
redigitize, although looking back, nothing is as good as I remember it when I wrote it.)

Right. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. One just has 
to shift perspective to where we are now, as opposed to where we'd like to be. I'd love to 
be able to build anything I pleased out of nanobots in an hour, I even have a vague idea

That is exactly what I'm saying. But this is only my own, personal god. Anyone else is free 
to have their own - whether it be some omnipotent and omniscient force that created 
everything or nothing more than dog backwards is up to them.

All of this makes sense in the context of my above statement. And I never said anything 
about worshipping gods. Like I said earlier - gods are something to be aspired to, not 
worshipped. Never worship. Respect that something is bigger or more powerful than you 
(which, in the end, comes down to fear), respect when a reason for respect is given, but 
never worship.

Since this is the Extropian List and not the Deluded Magical Thinking List,
probably most readers will have blipped over this post with a sigh. But
since it's such a classic but truly dopey New Age claim that people can
change traffic lights by wishing, it might be interesting to prod it a bit.

How would the world have to be for this to work? More exactly, how would
traffic light systems have to be?

(We could do a different kind of analysis and ask how it's possible, if
such an effect really occurs, for lights *ever* to change to allow
cross-highway traffic through. Obviously there are always many more people
wishing for the busy stream to have green lights all the way through, and
their magickal wishes should sum to keep the light always switched their
way. But that might not be how magick works; perhaps there's a cosmic bean
counter that maintains a certain even-handedness in the world.)

No, what I'm asking--as I do when my sweet, endlessly gullible
sister-in-law tells me of her inner power over traffic lights--is: how is
the mechanism of traffic lights vulnerable to this magickal power? 

Isn't there usually a hardware timer inside the things that switches from
red to green and back at pre-set intervals? (Leave aside manually-tweaked
systems where an operator views a bunch of intersections on screen and
routes around accidents, smooths the flow, etc.) 

I don't know the answer, but I assume most traffic lights are just not the
kinds of mechanisms that can be influenced from the outside, except by
pressing a button on the street corner. But of course a *huge* proportion
of pedestrians act is if they believe traffic lights can be coerced or
propitiated by hitting the button repeatedly. That might not be magical
thinking, though, just displaced frustration. I found a woman at a busy
intersection the other day hammering repeatedly at the button, and asked
her politely why she was doing it. `Because I'm frustrated,' she said with
a grin. `Yes, but you don't actually think that it affects the--?' `No, but
it makes me feel better.' `Okay.' It also wears out the mechanism more
rapidly, I suppose. But I suspect that she was smarter than many people; I
really think that many people believe that if you slam the button ten or 20
times the lights will change more quickly.

Any traffic light experts on the list?

I have suggested this venue elsewhwere to extropians as a possible convenient meeting place.  Tomorrow evening might be an ideal time to check it out and also have a fine night of entertainment, perhaps even in the company of other extropians - I plan to be there at least (the short muscular guy with the beard, the orange motorcycle helmet, the backback). 

A local libertarian objectivist web designer, FOI-hacker friend first introduced me to this band.  They are really quite original and good - think Neil Young, maybe Moody Blues with mideastern minor keying mixed in, really rich, intricat melodies and complex lyrics, heavy on the romantic side, but with really high energy.  Not so loud that you can't carry on a conversation - outside anyway.

The coffee and food are also quite good and very reasonably priced.  This place is a local hangout for the digerati as well as a crew of science fiction fans.  

You might want to bring your MP3 recorder, if you have one.

Ain't that the truth? If magic actually accomplished useful things, it
would, of course, be a science that was respected and taught in major
university science and engineering departments. I guess magic stopped
doing practical things back around the time of Stonehenge...

A few years ago, when NASA was launching the Cassini Probe, Michio Kaku
led the protests in public and in the scientific community against
launching the probe, despite the fact we'd already spent a billion and a
half bucks on the thing, all because it used RTGs for power. Kaku
claimed that the risks outweighed the benefits, and all sorts of other
drivel that never happened. Kaku claimed that we could send four smaller
probes using only solar power to Saturn for the same price, although
with fewer instruments and with most of the mass of the probes being
solar panels. Of course, those probes would be ones that HIS university
group would design and build....

A bit of googling to baby-talk sites assures me that many busy city streets
do indeed use hard-wired timers. Nowhere there for magick or psi to weave
its spell, I assume.

But there are plenty of other cute gadgets: induction coils set in the
pavement near the intersection, waiting for a heavy steel vehicle body to
sit over them and close an induction loop. If you didn't know it was there,
the lights would seem to change by... wow... *magic*. And there are
variants: rubber hoses with air, squeezed by the weight of the vehicle;
laser beams; digital cameras... Not many of those are vulnerable, you'd
suppose, to magickal interventions, although their routine functioning
might make a cave man (or me, dope that I am on a bicycle) think there was
something awfully animist and car-besotted about this street corner...

Okay, I concede. I have no way of convincing anyone of any of this; there's really no

If so, I will remain delusional until I get expiriential evidence to the contrary.

Yep. Although, delusion or not, it makes life a lot more interesting!

Only if I can be downloaded, eventually. Or not, depending on how far in the future this

It's probably his own behavior that chesh is modifying, not the
lights'.  Back in my wild days as a late-night taxi driver, I learned
which lights in Colorado Springs were triggered by sensors in the street
(some of which required *two* counts to trigger a change- zoom up, slam
on the brakes, throw it in reverse, back up, pull forward, light changes
pronto), which were synchronized for a particular speed (drive mellow,
stay back from the leading edge of the traffic wave, get there quick and
safe), and which were on dumb timers (watch the light from a distance,
adjust speed according to the current light state and distance).

I also learned that the 45 mph synchronized lights on a major N-S
arterial could also be negotiated at speeds from 60-90 mph, since the
spacing between them varied.  On a long stretch without lights, I'd
accelerate and hit the next green light only seconds after it came on,
then squeeze thru the end of the next light having gained almost one
half cycle; at the third one, another half cycle ahead, I'd be early
again.

The safest way to speed on the city streets, though, was to follow a
lights-out cop about 200 feet back- hard for him to give you a ticket
for matching *his* non-emergency speed.

Thus one occupies one's mind when underemployed.

To play devil's advocate: it might not be that the magic is affecting the 
street light mechanism, but instead the time at which you arrive at the 
street light.  If your magic is affecting all sorts of subtle things about 
the way you and the people around you react, it could reasonably change 
your schedule enough that you always happen to arrive when the light was 
going to turn green anyway.  Of course, this would be a scientifically 
testable phenomenon, and you could definitely arrange some pretty easy 
experiments, even without the subject being aware of it (since that might 
interfere...somehow).

The Times had these theological insights, conveniently muddled and mutually
inconsistent:

THURSDAY FEBRUARY 07 2002

             Illness caused by sin says
             Vatican official

             FROM RICHARD OWEN IN ROME

             A SENIOR Vatican official has asserted
             that illness is the result of sin and that
             people have a natural desire to be healthy
             and good-looking. 

             Presenting the Popes message for Lent,
             Archbishop Paul Cordes, the German head
             of the Vaticans agency for humanitarian
             aid, maintained that there was scriptural
             authority for the idea that those who
             contract illnesses do so because they have
             sinned. 

             Father Georges Cottier, the Popes chief
             theologian, immediately stepped in to
             reassure those who were ill that they were
             not in fact paying for their sins. 

             The Pope, in his message, had urged
             genetic scientists and other health experts
             not to succumb to the temptation of
             tampering with the Tree of Life under
             the illusion that advances in biotechnology
             had made man his own creator. 

             Monsignor Cordes, elaborating on the
             Popes remarks, went further and said that
             the root of much modern illness lay in
             sinful or immoral behaviour. 

             Jesus heals sickness and banishes sin, he
             said. He therefore teaches us that there is
             a link between sin and illness. This does
             not happen in every individual case, but it
             is a fundamental law. The history of
             salvation shows us that illness is a
             consequence of sin. 

             The theory was enshrined in Roman
             Catholic doctrine, he said. Mans desire to
             be healthy, good-looking and strong is
             justified because it anticipates our future
             salvation. One cannot deny that death, of
             which illness is an anticipation, has always
             been seen as a consequence of sin. 

             He quoted the Gospel of St John, which
             describes Jesus curing a crippled man he
             found lying on a pallet by the pool of
             Bethesda in Jerusalem. Jesus told the man,
             who had been crippled for 38 years: Take
             up your bed and walk. Finding him later
             in the temple, Jesus ordered the cured man
             to go and sin no more, or something
             worse may happen to you. 

             Father Cottier said that the original sin
             committed by Adam and Eve in the
             Garden of Eden had introduced sin and
             suffering into the human condition. This
             was not the same as saying the sick were
             guilty and it was unacceptable to use
             passages from the Gospel in which Jesus
             frees people from sin to suggest
             otherwise. 

             Commenting on the altercation, La
             Repubblica said that the idea that those
             who were vigorous and good-looking
             were blessed while the ugly and the sick
             were damned was an ancient one that
             predated Christianity. La Stampa said that
             if illness really was the result of sin and
             crime, then the great dictators and
             criminals of the world would all have been
             struck down. 

             Father Bruno Moriconi, a leading
             theologian, said that illness was neither a
             blessing nor a curse, but simply a result of
             the malfunctioning of the human
             organism. There is no point in looking to
             the Bible for an explanation.

Demonstrating that Christianity is ever more Greek in orgin, then Jew. 
Perfectionism is okay, but it detracts from more achievable goals. Maybe.

A SENEGALESE CORPORATION ( yeah sorry but my hdd is failing on my vaio
(development machine) so I'm depressed and just feel like joining that cow
business =)):
You have 5 cows, they're healthy and produce x amounts of milk/month. Soon
there are 10 cows, then 20, then 30. When the number reaches 40, suddenly 38
cows literally disappear. Some Senegalese breeders accuse Mauritanians. The
Mauritanians say they're innocent. Some fight starts, and someone dies. The
story gets told and retold by the press. People's fears and angers are being
played with. A few hundreds Mauritanians get slaughtered in broad daylight
(decapitations and emasculations and the whole shabang...), their shops and
businesses are vandalized, burned. State of emergency is declared in
Senegal. In the meantime, everybody forgets about the cows....


PS: I was there....it's a true story (in the real story, no cows were
stolen, I forgot what was the exact issue but it was like 'your cows are
eating my grass'), , I was a teenager then and it scared the hell outta
me.... Some perfectly 'normal' people that I knew, turned into shop
looters... I'm talking about adults, not kids.... Public anger is a
dangerous thing. Senegal and Mauritania are long term neighbours,
Mauritanians used to run most street corners shops in Senegal, those events
ended that state of affairs.

*bored and angry Arona*

PS2: Anyone involved in anything PalmOS on the list ? If yes, reply offlist
please.

Doug's commentary seems the most plausible: that numerous clues about
traffic patterns and the activation/regulation devices are being observed
unconsciously (or in his case hyperconsciously, as befits a Rocket
Plumber), so the driver learns to optimize speed through the traffic.
That's maybe why a bad mood means you `lose the magic'; it interferes with
your coordination and flow.

But a simpler version of Andrew's version, with either real magic or a
highly motivated delusionary version, is that you selectively modify your
own memory to erase all the times you sat fuming at the red light... Easier
than re-arranging the local world and other people you encounter to fit in
with your own grandiose whims.

It is one issue.  A guy who's helped me to fix cars a lot is a Baptist.

I don't think this is a feature of capitalism so much as it is a feature
of living in any type of society -- of living with other people period.
It's the problem of trust in general.

See my Tuesday, January 22, 2002 10:43 PM post to this list where I
write:

"[L]ife is full of failures as well as successes.  This is especially
true in business and the stock market.  Everyone can't be right at the

That's why it might be a good idea not to stick your nest egg in your
company's stock options or even your company's 401(k).  Diversify and be
vigilant!  After all, it's your future you're playing with."

Well, this is where government intervention does play a role.
Government intervention in the financial markets, through controlling
credit and "safeguarding" investments, creates an atmosphere where
people don't develop strong mechanisms to deal with risk or weeding out
the good from the bad.  The story of the 1990s seems to be one of
repeated episodes of investors making risky investments without any
notion of the costs and then having the government bail them out when
they go sour -- as in Mexico, East Asia, Russia, with LTCM, and probably
next in Argentina and with Enron.

This has setup the context in which an Enron can happen often and can
take many investors unawares.  (The real question is not so much why did
Enron collapse -- businesses go under all the time -- but why so many
people didn't see the warning signs.  Fraud too happens a lot, but, on
this scale, it seems to show that the government's intervention has
created a climate where investors are less likely to be skeptical, to
take a second look, or to try to reduce risk through well tested money
management practices.)

The problem here is that such pyramiding schemes have happened before
and probably will happen again.  The fact is investors, especially
experienced ones, should have taken such complexities as a red flag.
(To be sure, some investors did and either stayed away from Enron or
treated it as a live one.  I forget the name of one analyst from Texas
who had almost none of his portfolio in Enron because he found the
nearly unreadable earnings statements to be such a warning sign.  He was
interviewed on NPR...)

This is the same story as that of LTCM.  (See _When Genius Failed: The
Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management_ by Roger Lowenstein and
"Too Big to Fail? Long-Term Capital Management and the Federal Reserve"
by Kevin Dowd in his _Money and Markets_.)  However, this is just, as
I've said on this list, a variation on the theme of "if it's too good to
be true, then it probably isn't true" -- something investors, especially
small investors, have to keep in mind whenever they plan to put money in
any securities, be they stocks, bonds, or derivatives.

See my above self-quote.:)

I do, however, think that, as I've also said above, government
interventions in the market have set the stage for failures like this --
i.e., of this magnitude and with this amount of surprise.  I'm not
saying under total laissez faire, no business will fail or that
sometimes investors won't be taken unawares, but I think under such a
system most investors would not take the same amount of risks or lose as
much because the information and incentives would be there to manage
risk better and to be prepared for big losses -- as opposed to expecting
the SEC to be omniscient and the Fed or Congress ever ready to bail out
any bad beats.

I partly agree.  I think changes to the whole system need to be made,
but in the direction of less regulation so that systems to control risk
can spontaneously emerge -- and so that people who really don't have a
clue will stay out of the financial markets.  (How did I ride out the
stock market plummet of 2000 and 2001?  By having most of my funds out
of the stock market!  What is there is long term stuff that I don't (or
hopefully won't) need to touch right for years.  I did this while
friends of mine lost lots of money in their investments.  Of course, I
didn't make any big killings, but I haven't suffered any big losses
[yet] either.)

I happen to have my own very powerful magick which changes red lights to green.  I certainly will not promise it works right away, but if you do it LONG ENOUGH, it is practically guaranteed to work!! 

"Dang, this light dared to turn red on me!!"  
"I'm in a big hurry here!"
"Damn!!!"

"Turn Red!!"
"Turn Red!!!!"
"Please turn Red!"

I agree with your sentiment -- to some degree.  It's not funny to see
anyone lose their retirement fund, but there are people who are much
worse off.  In a way, seeing them paraded before Congress reminds me of
those rich people who want the government to help them rebuild after the
mud slides in CA in the 1980s.  These were like $2 million homes, IIRC,
that insurance companies wouldn't touch because of their location.  By
no means were these people going to be living in dumpsters if the
government didn't help them rebuild...

That said, it's still a sad story, though one that shouldn't overwhelm
our reason.  The same is going on now in NYC where the Red Cross is
doling out money to people who really don't need it.  This makes me a
bit angry because I donated some money to them specifically to help the
victims of September 11.  I thought my money -- I'm not bragging here,
it wasn't that much money -- would go to things like medical help for
people who were injured or assistance for the poor people put out of
work.  Instead, much of it is just being giving away door to door to
people who live in apartments that rent for more than monthly income.
(This is according to an NPR report.)

While I'm against welfare in all its forms -- including corporate
welfare -- I agree here.  There are certain groups in society which it's
okay to ignore and others that are the official repositories of
sympathy.

Hmm.  I find the site to be provocative -- even when I don't agree with
it.  I hope others will look at it too, though, I hope, they will come
to it looking for truths rather than just another line to swallow.

I have noted that the signals' timing depends on time of day in some areas. 
When I leave to visit my major customer at one time, I ALWAYS get stopped 
by several lights. If I leave just a few minutes alter, I almost NEVER get 
stopped.

Interestingly, the volume of traffic varies by about three to one over the 
same period...must be lots of people all on the same schedule.

I like being an independent contractor...

You have two cows, so you demand government support for struggling small
farmers. While struggling against all the other small farmers for the
government support (arguing that not only is your company providing at
least two jobs for cows in a rural area, but also that since they are
female you are also promoting equality) you don't have the time to get
the massive EU grant for corporations with two cows.

Actually, this could be simply the power of the human subconscious at work.
Traffic lights are easy to predict.  They have repeatable patterns.  My
business partner always complains when we get to a light at the wrong time
of the cycle.  He knows which light will go next, whether the crosswalks
will go or not this time, and whether cars are on the trip-switches or not.
He predicts this stuff very easily because he has noticed the patterns and
drives through them all the time.

He doesn't know exactly when he noticed this.  He didn't consciously study
or memorize the patterns.  His subconscious mind figured these patterns out
over years of experience in this neighborhood.  I have no doubt in my mind
that before he consciously was aware that he knew all the patterns, he was
subconsciously or partially aware.  He probably felt like he had good
timing, or felt like he was probably going to run late.  I believe that a
lot of psychic powers are easily explainable by simple patterns that are
easy to predict.  However, the human mind does a lot of this processing
behind the scenes where we are not consciously aware of doing it.  Our mind
analyzes the patterns and pops up the right answer without us knowing
exactly how.

What's more, these patterns are very easy to manipulate.  Driving faster or
slower between lights can easily influence whether you hit the next light on
a red or a green.  Even easier than that is the fact that cars around you
get grouped into clumps that are delayed at red lights and allowed through
together at green lights.  For each road, it is easy to figure out if the
speed limit hits all the greens (on streets with well-timed lights), or
whether the timing is off.  If the timing is off, it is easy to go faster or
slower than other cars to hit the correct timing while everyone else hits
the red lights.  Perhaps you can drive faster than everybody and breeze
through all the lights, or perhaps you can drive leisurely and have the
lights turn green before you hit them.  In either case, there are only a few
minor adjustments to figure out for each road to get into the right pattern.

If the lights are timed correctly for the speed limit, or triggered
regularly for traffic flow, then it is easy to go with the flow and hit all
the green lights.  That's how the traffic engineers designed the system.
Any impatience and driving fast will hit red lights that will slow you down.
Any pokiness and driving slow will let you get caught by red lights just as
you reach an intersection.  It would not take very much for the subconscious
mind to figure out that if you relax and stop trying to hurry that you seem
to get all the green lights and breeze through faster.

This is how neural nets and pattern-matching works.  Traffic lights are a
perfect example of predictable patterns that your brain absorbs every day.
I have no doubt that the subconscious pattern-matching software tries to
utilize these patterns to make driving more efficient.  This is a simply
amazing part of the human brain.  Instead of debunking such claims, I
embrace them and say that this phenomenon is surly happening.  The brain is
more powerful than we think.

(I got this attitude from the great Randi, believe it or not.  I noticed
that most of his "debunking" of psychic claims were not the exposure of
fraud, but the simple explanation of how things were really working.  I
started noticing this myself.  Most claims are not ludicrous.  They actually
are occurring due to an explainable scientific reason.)

I say that attitude and driving style obviously affects whether you get
mostly green lights or mostly red ones.  I say that it takes a genius mind
to tap into these patterns and exploit them.  Whether you call this pattern
psychic or merely psychological, the brain is getting extra information
outside the conscious awareness of the individual, and is putting that
information to work to influence the outcome of events.  Psychic people do
this all the time, but they don't consciously know how they do it.

New Prospects for Putting Organs on Ice

Jocelyn Kaiser

After a lull, scientists are again exploring vitrification and other
techniques for deep-freezing tissues and organs

In the movie Vanilla Sky, Tom Cruise has his broken body frozen in the
hope that he'll someday be revived and healed. In reality, cryonics, as
this practice is known, remains the most speculative science fiction.
Researchers have failed for decades to deep-freeze and thaw most
tissues--let alone organs or animals--without damaging them, often
seriously. But recently, a few cryobiologists have celebrated successes
with ovaries and complex tissues like vascular grafts.

The work has sparked hope that donated organs can eventually be banked for
longer than the current few days, which would buy time for distributing
them and finding recipients who are good immunological matches. And as
progress is made engineering artificial livers, bladders, and other
tissues containing living cells, the need for better preservation
techniques is expected to grow (see Viewpoint on p. 1009). "Each company
at some point will need to store and transport their product," says Mike
Taylor of Organ Recovery Systems in Charleston, South Carolina.

Currently, transplant surgeons perfuse whole organs with a special
solution that enables them to be banked just above 0C for up to a few
days. Ideally, they would like to preserve organs at -196C, the boiling
point of liquid nitrogen--so cold that molecular motion virtually stops
and tissues cease to decay. Half a century ago, that seemed within easy
reach. Scientists found that blood and sperm could survive such deep
freezing if mixed with glycerol. The glycerol lowers the cells' freezing
point and keeps them from getting lethally salty when they do freeze and
water diffuses out. And since 1972, embryos have been frozen with liquid
nitrogen and later successfully implanted.

Organs, however, don't hold up so well below the freezing point. Water
leaked from cells during freezing forms ice crystals in the space between
cells, and this ice destroys fragile structures such as ducts and blood
vessels. Sometimes pieces of organs, such as pancreatic islet cells, work
adequately after freezing. But larger, more complex organs such as kidneys
don't function properly when sufficiently ravaged.

As a way around this problem, some researchers turned to vitrification, or
"ice-free" cryopreservation. The idea is to fill the organ with a viscous
fluid that turns into a glassy (not crystalline) solid at low
temperatures. This reduces the problems of ice, but toxicity of the
cryopreservant can still damage organs. And ice crystals tend to form as
vitrified tissue--especially large pieces--is warmed. Partial success came
in the 1980s, when Red Cross scientist Greg Fahy showed that rabbit
kidneys could withstand the high concentrations of cryoprotectants needed
to vitrify these organs. They worked when reimplanted, but Fahy had only
cooled them to -3C. Many experiments later, it's clear that
"vitrification is very, very complicated," says cryobiologist David Pegg
of the University of York, U.K., and in most labs vitrification of large
organs has been on hold.

Recently, cryobiologists have had better luck studying vitrification on a
smaller scale. For example, fine-tuning the solutions that are injected
into the organs, as well as heating and cooling rates, minimized injury to
2- to 3-centimeter-long pieces of rabbit veins, Taylor's team at Organ
Recovery Systems reported in the 18 March 2000 issue of Nature
Biotechnology. The vessels retained 80% of their function when dosed with
drugs that cause them to contract, compared to 20% following simple
freezing. When implanted in rabbits, the grafts appeared to work normally.
"We're the first to demonstrate [that vitrification works better than
freezing] in reasonably complex tissue," Taylor says. Two other groups
have recently shown that they can vitrify corneas, getting much less
damage than from freezing. But the scientists have yet to show whether
these corneas function in vivo.

Roger Gosden and colleagues at McGill University in Montreal have had
success even with conventional freezing with a small organ, they reported
last month in Nature. They froze rat ovaries, fallopian tubes, and
attached blood vessels in liquid nitrogen and transplanted them into
genetically identical rats whose ovaries had been removed. The animals
ovulated. Some ice damage occurred, so vitrification might be even more
successful, suggests Gosden, now at the Jones Institute for Reproductive
Medicine in Norfolk, Virginia.

Several groups are tackling problems that thwart both vitrification and
conventional freezing. Pegg's group at York, for instance, is working on
how to thaw tissues and avoid ice crystal formation. The team has
developed a technique that Pegg says can evenly and quickly heat pingpong
ball-sized clumps of cells embedded in gelatin to simulate large tissue.
Taylor's group, meanwhile, is collaborating with Carnegie Mellon
scientists on dosing tissues with iron compounds that are then excited
with magnets to generate heat.

Taking a cue from nature, researchers are also using natural antifreeze
proteins to help mop up crystals formed during freezing and thawing. Many
organisms, from carrots to fish to beetles, produce proteins that latch
onto and isolate growing ice crystals. The one drawback is that at
temperatures well below 0C, this system can backfire by causing ice
crystals to form spikes that disrupt cells. Several companies are
developing improved synthetic versions of these "ice blockers"; for
example, Taylor's company hopes to produce smaller molecules that attach
to ice crystals at the base as well as the face, which could prevent spike
formation.

Fahy, meanwhile, has never given up trying to vitrify large organs. "He
has soldiered the way on this for years and years," Pegg says. Now at a
company called 21st Century Medicine in Rancho Cucamonga, California, Fahy
has tested hundreds of vitrification solutions and patented the most
promising ones. "Greg has always been tantalizingly close to getting it to
work," says cryobiologist William Rall of the National Institutes of
Health. The company Fahy works for receives funding from the Life
Extension Foundation, which supports cryonics. Fahy says his work is
strictly limited to cryopreserving organs. But he adds, "If I'm
successful, perhaps it will remove some of the [cryonics] controversy."

No, it would be taught if it accomplished useful things in a consistent
and repeatable manner. Often, extropians are such literalists. Try 10
different magic experiments 10 times each, if one works once, then it
did accomplish something although not (as I've said previously) enough
to base your life around it.

As a former VW Beetle owner, I was often stuck at a light near where I
used to live that had a weight sensor which seemed to require more
weight than my car had. I often had to drive forward and back near the
sensor repeatedly to get the light to cycle. I didn't refer to this as
magick, though, I called it 'jerking off the light'. So, maybe sex
magick applies.

Would you consider it possible that your 'mental acrobatics' motivated
you to find green lights and/or intuitively better understand the light
timing patterns?

    >A SENIOR Vatican official has asserted that illness is the result of sin

Considering the brutal history of that organization I'd say that's just about
the level of wisdom you'd expect from a senior Vatican official.

One day a religious zealot was haranguing Sigmund Freud  for the his evil
ways and said " You will have to stand before God someday, what are you
going to say to Him?"  Freud responded  " I'm going to hold up a child's
cancerous leg bone in his face and say, "why?" "

> 2) That might be true if I drove, but I don't. 

then, having your hands free would you mind doing
field testing to settle this?  Record your mood, or
whatever it is you think alters lights *before* you
leave, then record the average wait time per light. 
Make an arbitrary scaling for your mood, graph it and
see what happens.  If there's a distinct positive
correllation it will be sufficient to prove that you
are truly a modern scientist...willing to fabricate
data to fit the curve.

Well it's about time that people start writing about the actual science 
that is involved in ethical cryonics ("ethical cryonics" being my term for 
cryonics that is done with full disclosure of case reports and the primary 
focus being on the science of the industry).  Usually reports about 
cryonics center on the "kookiness" of the idea, as opposed to the plausible 
science of the field --perhaps rightfully so.  Let's just hope that 
articles such as this help folks like Greg Fahy get the respect they 
undeniably deserve.

A CANADIAN CORPORATION

You have two cows, but only need the milk from one.  So you sell one cow to 
an American company, who markets its product as being "pure Canadian 
milk."  That American corporation prospers thanks to its "pure Canadian" 
marketing campaign.  Meanwhile, you continue to sell the milk from your one 
cow at the same price in the same way.  Canadian media finds out about the 
original "cow to America" transaction and creates a major story throughout 
Canada about how the big, greedy, successful American corporations prey on 
the ma and pa corporations North of the border.  Influenced by the media, 
you file an unsuccessful lawsuit towards the American corporation.  Upon 
the failure of the lawsuit, the Canadian media once again complains about 
the big, greedy American corporations.  Three months later, you decide you 
don't like the cow farming business anyhow, so you sell your remaining cow 
to the same American corporation that bought the first cow, and go into the 
ping-pong ball manufacturing business.

You're invited to my next poker game.  If you call a half-pot-size
bet with a 20-to-1 longshot draw, the one time your miracle card
comes you have accomplished something and won a big pot; it's those
other 19 times that you can attribute to blind chance, so the fact
that you'll end up paying my rent just means I'm lucky.

COWS.COM:

You own two cows, so you send a business plan to 20 venture
capital firms about how you can make money by giving away milk
and selling ad space on the cartons.  As the venture capital
runs out, you issue an IPO based on your projections that your
research team will develop new milking technology any day now.
When your milking engineers tell you that they can't get any
more milk from a cow by working 60-hour weeks, you offer them
more stock options if they'll work 80-hour weeks solving the
problem.  The good engineers, who might actually have solved
the problem, all work until their options vest, then retire,
leaving you with junior engineers whose options all become
wallpaper in another year when the company collapses and
liquidates all its cows to a traditional dairy farm started
by one of the old engineers.

Isn't there a species of frog that survives winter by allowing itself to
freeze solid (underground/tundra/mud), and then thaw out for spring and
breeding? Is anyone looking at its chemistry - Shouldn't someone sequence
its DNA right away or at least do some cell analysis? Has anyone doen this?

FYI, the SL4 mailing list will hold its first chat on Saturday, courtesy
of the Extropy Institute, which is allowing us to use their IRC server. 
Our chat room will be #sl4.  If you're interested in meeting the folks who
hang out on SL4, drop by after 5:30PM EST (2:30PM PST).

(Please note, though, that SL4 moderation may also apply to the IRC
channel.  Or not.  I don't know yet whether real-time communication will
need moderation in the same way as email.  The point is that SL4 is a
"topic focus" list rather than a "free speech" list, and there may be some
moderation of the chat as well.  In particular, SL4 usually prefers to
focus on advanced topics rather than rehashing the basics.)

To participate via a standard IRC client, connect to "extropy.org" on a
standard IRC port (for example, 6667), and join channel #sl4.

To participate through Java applet on ExI's pages, point your browser at
 http://www.extropy.org/bbs/
and pick one of the IRC applets shown there.  Once you're in, type
 /join #sl4
since we aren't listed among the available chatrooms.

There's a bare possibility that you may be able to log in via Java applet
at
 http://sysopmind.com/sl4chat/
but I haven't been able to get this working yet.

Thanks again to the Extropy Institute for letting us use their IRC server!

FIRST GENETIC EVIDENCE UNCOVERED OF HOW MAJOR CHANGES
IN BODY SHAPES OCCURRED DURING EARLY ANIMAL EVOLUTION



http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/mchox.htm


Biologists at the University of California, San Diego have uncovered the
first genetic evidence that explains how large-scale alterations to body
plans were accomplished during the early evolution of animals.

In an advance online publication February 6 by Nature of a paper scheduled
to appear in Nature, the scientists show how mutations in regulatory genes
that guide the embryonic development of crustaceans and fruit flies allowed
aquatic crustacean-like arthropods, with limbs on every segment of their
bodies, to evolve 400 million years ago into a radically different body
plan: the terrestrial six-legged insects.

The achievement is a landmark in evolutionary biology, not only because it
shows how new animal body plans could arise from a simple genetic mutation,
but because it effectively answers a major criticism creationists had long
leveled against evolution=8Bthe absence of a genetic mechanism that could
permit animals to introduce radical new body designs.

=B3The problem for a long time has been over this issue of macroevolution,=B2
says William McGinnis, a professor in UCSD=B9s Division of Biology who headed
the study. =B3How can evolution possibly introduce big changes into an
animal=B9s body shape and still generate a living animal? Creationists have
argued that any big jump would result in a dead animal that wouldn=B9t be abl=
e
to perpetuate itself. And until now, no one=B9s been able to demonstrate how
you could do that at the genetic level with specific instructions in the
genome.=B2

The UCSD team, which included Matthew Ronshaugen and Nadine McGinnis, showe=
d
in its experiments that this could be accomplished with relatively simple
mutations in a class of regulatory genes, known as Hox, that act as master
switches by turning on and off other genes during embryonic development.
Using laboratory fruit flies and a crustacean known as Artemia, or brine
shrimp, the scientists showed how modifications in the Hox gene Ubx=8Bwhich
suppresses 100 percent of the limb development in the thoracic region of
fruit flies, but only 15 percent in Artemia=8Bwould have allowed the
crustacean-like ancestors of Artemia, with limbs on every segment, to lose
their hind legs and diverge 400 million years ago into the six-legged
insects.



=B3This kind of gene is one that turns on and off lots of other genes in orde=
r
to make complex structures,=B2 says Ronshaugen, a graduate student working in
William McGinnis=B9 laboratory and the first author of the paper. =B3What we=B9ve
done is to show that this change alters the way it turns on and off other
genes. That=B9s due to the change in the way the protein produced by this gen=
e
functions.=B2

=B3The change in the mutated protein allows it to turn off other genes,=B2 says
William McGinnis, who discovered with two other scientists in 1983 that the
same Hox genes in fruit flies that control the placement of the head, thora=
x
and abdomen during development are a generalized feature of all animals,
including humans. =B3Before the evolution of insects, the Ubx protein didn't
turn off genes required for leg formation. And during the early evolution o=
f
insects, this gene and the protein it encoded changed so that they now
turned off those genes required to make legs, essentially removing those
legs from what would be the abdomen in insects.=B2

The UCSD team=B9s demonstration of how a mutation in the Ubx gene and changes
in the corresponding Ubx protein can lead to such a major change in body
design undercuts a primary argument creationists have used against the
theory of evolution in debates and biology textbooks. Their specific
objection to the idea of macroevolutionary change in animals is summed up i=
n
a disclaimer that the Oklahoma State Textbook Committee voted in November,
1999 to include in that state=B9s biology textbooks:

=B3The word evolution may refer to many types of change. Evolution describes
changes that occur within a species. (White moths, for example, may evolve
into gray moths). This process is microevolution, which can be observed and
described as fact. Evolution may also refer to the change of one living
thing into another, such as reptiles and birds. This process, called
macroevolution, has never been observed and should be considered a theory.=B2

=B3The creationists=B9 argument rests in part on the fact that animals have two
sets of chromosomes and that in order to get big changes, you=B9d need to
mutate the same genes in both sets of chromosomes,=B2 explains McGinnis. =B3It=B9=
s
incredibly unlikely that you would get mutations in the same gene in two
chromosomes in a single organism. But in our particular case, the kind of
mutation that=B9s in this gene is a so-called dominant mutation, so you only
need to mutate one of the chromosomes to get a big change in body plan.=B2

The discovery of this general mechanism for producing major leaps in
evolutionary change has other implications for scientists. It may provide
biologists with insights into the roles of other regulatory genes involved
in more evolutionarily recent changes in body designs. In addition, the
discovery in the UCSD study, which was financed by the National Institute o=
f
Child Health and Human Development, of how this particular Hox gene
regulates limb development also may have an application in improving the
understanding human disease and genetic deformities.

=B3If you compare this gene to many other related genes, you can see that the=
y
share certain regions in their sequences, which suggests that their functio=
n
might be regulated like this gene,=B2 says Ronshaugen. =B3This may establish
how, not only this gene, but relatives of this gene in many, many different
organisms actually work. A lot of these genes are involved in the
development of cancers and many different genetic abnormalities, such as
syndactyly and polydactyly, and they may explain how some of these
conditions came to be.=B2=A0

Just a thought (to get back to extropian matters): suppose drivers could
affect lights through some technological means. Would there be any
system that would make the traffic throughput more efficient than the
current timer-based lights?

Suppose each car could "vote" for the light (similarly for the
pedestrians at crossings). At a crossing this would likely mean that the
biggest queue would get green first, and decrease until the votes of the
other queue weighed over. With a bit of inertia in the system this would
likely ensure a fair division. There is likely a bit of need for
weighing votes by the time the light has been red too, in order to ensue
that cars crossing a very busy street along a far less busy street ever
will get past. At night, when there are few cars at all, all lights
would turn green since there are just single votes. 

However, traffic flow theory is filled with surprises and paradoxes, so
I wouldn't be surprised if there are conditions where this kind of
solution wouldn't be optimal. Any thoughts?

Ack! No, late at night the lights would go *off* (unless a spurt of traffic
reactivated them). You *can't* allow an intersection to show green on all
lights.

A market-based system would be interesting to try.  Give each intersection
an owner (could be just a software agent) which tries to maximize profits.
Then sell green-light futures seconds or minutes in advance.  This would
allow someone to purchase green lights for their entire cross-town trip.

At uncongested times, there wouldn't be many people bidding the other
way and you could get your green lights for cheap.  But when there is
congestion, more elaborate mechanisms would be required.  You would
want to be able to see who else is setting up green light paths which
are going your way, so you can add your clout to their path and outbid
rivals who are setting up conflicting (crossing) paths.  You would also
want to be able to easily slip your schedule forward and backward a few
seconds so as to avoid crossing conflicts as much as possible.

It's easy to say that the market will screw in the lightbulb, but actually
setting up the institutions to let a market work is another matter.
Optimizing traffic flow is a complex, nonlocal problem which may not be
ideally suited to market mechanisms.  But in principle the market takes
into consideration the wishes of all participants and prioritizes them.
If mechanisms can be arranged to let the market work, this could be an
optimal solution.

I've been thinking about similar ideas for traffic flow in general, not
only at intersections but on highways as well.  Wouldn't it be great if
there were some mechanism to pay the slowpoke in front of you to pull
over, or to get the tailgater behind you to move back?  The signals which
exist now from driver to driver are limited and clumsy.  Surely it should
be possible to improve on what exists today.

I tried to register, but it said that a user with my email was already
registered (apparently me, though I don't recall doing so) but I've
never received a password to log in with, so I'm quite unsure of how to
proceed. Perhaps whoever is administering this fine new forum can please
remember to send passwords out to members who are already registered

Turning them off is the same as making them all green. Round these parts
in Cow Hampsha', after a certain o'dark hundred hour, the traffic lights
go to pulsing yellow full time....

The difficulty with making them turn green is that you really want some
advance sensor, which senses your vehicle a couple hundred yards down
the road, so it has time to turn the opposing direction yellow then red
before it gives you the green just as you arrive at the intersection. In
such cases, I try to pulse my high beams at something similar to what a
police or ambulance does, since most traffic lights have strobe sensors
now for emergency vehicles.... that usually does the trick...

No it's bloody NOT. `Green' means roar ahead, nothing is coming from either
side because those guys have been stopped by the collateral red. `Lights
out' means take the usual intersection precautions.

Yep, I would have suggested that, but I understand that many traffic lights
these days are only Red/Green, without the Amber or Yellow in the middle.

Same deal for me; the page says that recent posters are already
registered and there's a form to have the system mail you your
password, but /that/ form tell's me I'm not registered, so I'm
out of luck.

HAL!  This is a helllll of an idea.  Good thinking!

We could set up a system whereby your car has a radio transmitter that
broadcasts to traffic lights the value of your time.  If you are out poking
around on a Sunday afternoon, you might set it lower than if you are late to
work, or if you have several business associates in your car, or if you
are racing to get to your kid's daycare center at the end of the day where
they charge a dollar a minute after 1800 (they really do this in Taxifornia).

Emergency vehicles would automatically get a very high time-value rate.

The traffic lights then change in such a way to maximize profits, and
send out signals to a receiver in your car to figure out *your bill for
that month* which you then hafta pay if you want your receiver to
keep working.  If it doesnt work, your time automatically becomes
cheap indeed.

The proceeds would reduce the taxes that would otherwise be spent
on maintaining roads.  The perfect user fee!  Each person is free to
set the value of their time to whatever they feel it is worth.

Hal, you are the Chosen One, bud.  spike

"Limited to clumsy" is exactly right, except when a
bit of ruminating about what might be possible
sugggests that, perhaps it's something of an
understatement.  That we consider it satisfactory at
all is because we have lived--those who have
survived--with it for so long.  When one considers the
quality of life, safety, expense, and efficiency
factors, "barbarically inadequate" and "capriciously
suicidal" might gradually suggest themselves as more
apt.  

Rather, let all the cars and and the traffic control
devices communicate with wireless, enabling start to
finish coordinated routing,
flow-distribution-to-capacity matching, flow
interweave management for speed, smoothness (almost
nonstop), and energy efficiency, and, top of the list,
accident avoidance by realtime millesecond monitoring
of and response to internal and external conditions. 
Smart cars and smart highways.  Lots of communication.
 Way safe. 

Clearly, implementation would be a gradual process.

Best, Jeff Davis

Like Mr. Jones said, a market-based solution is a favorable one, but letting
people set the value of their time does not sound like a good
implementation, as there is absolutely no motivation to set the value of
your time at what it "really" is. If I can do more by setting my time's
value to "high," why would I opt to sit at a traffic light? I do really like
the idea of prioritizing the traffic light system, though.

The reason you would be motivated to set the value of your time
at its actual value is that setting it high costs you more.  You would
save money if you set the value of your time lower.

The system would need radio signals from the cars.  It would need
to calculate the cumulative value of the time of those sitting at the red
light, compared to the value of those with the green.  The system
would only respond to those cars which can identify themselves to
the traffic light, for the persons who save time are those who will be
billed according to their own declaration of the value of their time.

The system would maximize its own profits by calculating how to
save time for the self-proclaimed most valuable persons, then
sending each a bill in accordance with that self-proclaimed value.
If someone does not pay their bill, they might be waiting longer
at the traffic light.  There need not be any law that requires one
to pay one's traffic light bill, but the system would eventually ignore
the non-payer, or treat the non-payer the same as a car with no
self identifier, whose time value would be set to minimum wage,
for instance.

Consider an intersection where there are three east-westers whose
value is set at 10 dollars an hour.  A yahoo is coming north to
south, late to pick up junior at daycare, which is charging him a
dollar a minute he is late.  It pays the system to make the three
10-per-hours wait for the single 60 per hour.  If the light turns
to save Daycare Dad one minute, he gets a bill for one dollar,
and its a breakeven for him, whereas the system lost only 50 cents
by holding up the three minimum-wage-proles, for a profit to
the system of half a buck, which goes to reduce the taxes for
all.  Such a deal!

I need to write up a spreadsheet demonstrating how this would
work.  I would welcome helpful suggestions.  spike

Economic Terror

by Congressman Ron Paul, MD

Dealing with the slumping economy will prove every bit as challenging to
Congress as fighting terrorism.

No one challenges the need to protect American citizens from further
terrorist attacks, but there is much debate throughout the country as to
how it should be done and whether personal liberty here at home must be
sacrificed. Many are convinced that our efforts overseas might escalate
the crisis and actually precipitate more violence. A growing number of
Americans are becoming concerned that our efforts to preserve our
freedoms and security will result in the unnecessary sacrifice of that
which we've pledge to protect- our constitutionally protected liberty

That's 23:30 for continental Europe if I am not misled.

I heard Griffin interviewed on the radio a few weeks back (by Leonard
Lopate on WNYC's "NY and Company" show).  She's very articulate and I
found her discussion of Venice to be very interesting.  I haven't picked
up the book yet...

Thanks for sending the password. When I logged in, first off I had to
resize the browser so I could see your email and the browser screen at
the same time so I could type in the ungainly password, because the
browser doesn't let you cut and paste information into a password field.
Then, once I completed this, I resized the browser so I could actually
see the whole screen, but it lost the page, responding with the
following:

"Data Missing

This document resulted from a POST operation and has expired from the
cache. If you wish you can repost the form data to recreate the
document by pressing the reload button. "

By hitting the back button, I got the login screen again, but would have
to resize again so I can see my password..... etc etc etc

It would be nice if the BBS was able to repost the page when you resize
your browser...

Err, actually, the RNA polymerase transcribes toward the 5' end of the
antisense DNA, which is toward the 3' end of the "sense" DNA, and 
building toward the 3' end of the RNA it is polymerizing. The resulting
RNA is a faithful RNA transcription of the "sense" DNA strand, but the
actual mechanics of the polymerase make a complement of the anti-sense 
strand rather than a direct copy of the sense strand.

Subject: changing traffic lights by the force of your personality
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Traffic lights are interesting for a lot of reasons.  For one, they're a classic case of Bastiat's "The Seen and the Unseen."  Everybody bitches about the idiocy of unsynced lights, but no one individually has enough clout or incentive to actually do anything about it, despite the total cost - in the many billions of dollars per year in the U.S.

In addition, however, there are the concentrated interests that Bastiat opposes to the diffused - loser - interests, who lobby city councils or coerce or bribe city employees directly, I'm sure, to have the lights synced for their own purposes, such as forcing everyone to stop or travel very slowly in front of their mall.

One might think that a politician who bravely campaigned on the "sync the lights" platform would make it bigtime, but the fact that this doesn't happen tells you that those people who can afford to run a campaign either have bigger "hot button" issues and/or are financed - not by the diffuse public of losers in the light control battle - but by the very concentrated interests who put a low or negative priority on this issue.

When I visited relatives in New England a couple years back, one of the most amazing things I witnessed was that the lights did actually appear to be synced, or at least they changed rapidly enough that I could easilly time my arrival to synchronize with the green, almost every time.  I was able to drive for miles in fairly dense suburban/urban traffic in Shrewsbury or Worchester, MA, and the surrounding areas, without ever having to actually stop.  The speed limits were very low by CA standards - 30MPH typically - but I could still make much better time with a lot less gas and wear and tear on the vehicle than I ever could in most of S. California.

Of course, Massachussetts is a different world anyway - better (or at least the locals are sure it is, and let you know it) - than lumpen, Just Do It, Close Enuf For Government Work California.  There was this one intersection I used several times, where a two lane local street crossed a six lane major artery.  I know that no one from California is going to believe me on this, but here's what I observed:

People actually voluntarilly stopped at what looked like unspoken agreed upon intervals to let other people either turn left onto the six lane or proceed accross.  !!!  NOBODY would be fool enough to do that in California, as it would be the insurance fraud professional accident victim who would stop, smile and wave you on, and then slam into you if you ever tried that here.

Then, of course, there are the vast numbers of idiots or bumbling incompetents on the road in California, mostly from cultures only recently introduced to horseless transport.  And in the Hispanic community, there is the long-standing low-rider mentality, of resisting the hated Yankee emphasis on efficiency, by waiting an additional five or ten seconds before responding to a green light, thereby making the smooth, stress free driving of Massachussetts pretty much impossible whereever Hispanics are a sizable percentage of the drivers.  Typically, only about 30% of the vehicles that could get thru an intersection during rush hour in Massachusetts can make it in California, due to the one or two low-rider types who always gum up the works for everyone.

(The Yankee culture puts a premium on the person who is acting - as in driving.  He is assumed to have the right of way, and people who slow or block traffic unnecessarily are severely frowned upon.  The Hispanic culture has exactly the opposite attitude, similar to the Ghetto Black culture's "shuffle," i.e., a traditional response to thwart authority, now transposed into an attempt to maintain cultural hostilities by those low-life ignoratis who feel the need to find something to give meaning to their sordid lives.  Thus, in California, both the Hispanic low-riders, and the general attitude that always grants the passive or slower person the right of way means that light timing is dominated by the time it takes to walk accross the intersection, assuming the worst case old lady with a walker and also assuming that she has never figured out how to use the cross buttons, as the timing is the same regardless of whether the crossing button is pushed, combine to strangle every artery.  So, to accommodate the slowest walkers plus the low-riders, the traffic engineers have to build six-lane streets where a two-lane would suffice in Massachussetts, which makes the crossing time that much longer, worsening all aspects of the situation yet more.  ... and so on ;) )

>From a purely technical standpoint, there are obvious solutions, such as using vehicle transponders as are already in use on many public emergency vehicles.  But that would require cooperation among all kinds of cut-throat yuppy city councils, so forget that.  Also, the whole focus on the hundreds of intersection cameras in SoCal has been to generate income for the cities by unbelievable fines for red-light violators, starting over $200 and then essentially doubled by all kinds of cute "administrative" costs.  That same system could be used to tweak the lights, obviously.  But, clearly the only utility of this ongoing farce is to point up the validity of anti-government economic arguments, which I guess is something, anyway...

This turns out go be a non-trivial problem. Sure, each traffic light 
could attempt to maximize its "profit" locally, but if their agents are
intelligent, they will quickly realize that they can make a lot more 
money by cooperating with each other or with "traffic arbitrage agents." 
A customer would contract with the traffic arbitrage agent
rather than attempting to contract with individual traffic lights.
The arbitrage agents would quickly realize that they can make higher
profits by negotiating among themselves to build packages of cars that
share routes, If the agents are all smart enough the result will 
approach a global optimization for the metropolitan area as a whole.

Like any routing problem, this is only useful if the cost of the more
sophisticated routing algorithms are cheaper than the cost of additional
bandwidth (streets and highways in this case.) My area of expertise is 
routing in data networks. In data networks, even the crudest algorithms
work perfectly well when the traffic is at 50% of the available 
bandwidth, And even the best theoretical algorithm cannot achieve 95%
utilization with acceptable performance. In most data networks it
is cheaper to build extra capacity than it is to deploy better routing 
algorithms. The reason the Internet works at all is that its core is 
massively underutilized.

Hey Doug (Doug Skrecky (oberon@vcn.bc.ca):

I keep seeing these interesting postings re your fly experiments.  Do you have a complete report available somewhere?  Also, you keep mentioning viral load as a major factor and the use of elderberry juice.  

So, is there a downside to using elderberry extract or juice for humans?  Or is it just the expense?  I chanced upon a year's supply of the extract for free a few month's back - nutrition store near to where I work apparently went out of business and just dumped boxes full of supplements, generally a few months out of date, but certainly still viable - and took a tablespoon per day during the early flu season.  I didn't catch a single cold!  After the holidays, I stopped taking the extract and shortly acquired that nasty 2 week bug that's been going around.  Just anecdotal of course - so, what is the state of research on elderberry as an anti-viral.  Should we all be taking it???

Well, I'm permanently logged in, now, so it doesn't seem to be a
problem. Password fields in forms are not supposed to be pastable under
the HTML standard, for security reasons.

However, another problem is that the eteria and jpilot chat clients only
display about 40 pixels of the left side of the client (I'm using
Netscape 4.77)

Making such an argument is useless, Phil, since those believers will
obviously respond that hemophiliacs are collateral damage created by the
irresponsibility of those who practiced a sinful lifestyle and were so
callous of human life that they gave blood as well. In the end, it will
all come back to claims that god hates gays and drug addicts (or at
least the sins they practice).

Isn't he the guy Hofstadter raved about in his great book about the
spontaneous creation of search-trees, "Goertzel, Ussher, Bark"?

[sorry]

[I loved Ben's comment on amazon about one of his earlier books:

[The author, Ben Goertzel, ben@psy.uwa.edu.au , November 9, 1996
This is a great book. Please buy many copies.
Chaotic Logic, in my personal opinion, is the greatest book in the history of
mankind. At very least, it is the best book I have written so far. I
suggest that
every human being on earth should buy it and study it closely. Within its
pages
are contained all the innermost secrets of the cosmos. However, if you are too
cheap to buy it, the text may be viewed on my Website at

You read a web page. When you have finished reading a screenful, you
hit "PageDown", and then resume reading at the top of the screen.

But now you come to the penultimate screen and you hit "PageDown".
Unless the remainder of the page is exactly one screen long, the top
of the screen now shows text you have already read, and you have to scan
the text to find where you were were reading before to hit "PageDown".

That's a good point, Jacques.  I have the same problem when I use the
"more" or "less" programs on my Unix system to read mail or text files.
They go down a page at a time until the last page, and you're right, I
often waste several seconds trying to figure out where I was just reading.
Sometimes there are only a few lines of new material and it takes quite
a while before I figure that out.  You'd think that upon reading the
first lines of the new page that I would immediately recognize how far
back in the text this was, but that's not true.

I can understand the reluctance of the designers to display a bunch of
blank lines at the end of the document when they don't really exist.
Maybe some other UI cue should be used, like a transient vertical bar
along one side, or some text shading, to distinguish the material you
have seen before from new text.

Nonetheless Netscape is a real browser, and it's not that difficult to
make your pages and style sheets compatible with it. OTOH it will
refresh on a resize, leading to a problem Mr Lorrey mentioned. I still
use netscrape for email, but prefer Opera for browsing...

I've gotten the message below a couple of times, so I guess the guy is
sending it pretty widely.  It's funny and sad at the same time, if he
is actually serious.  He obviously has some serious mental problems.
Still I supposed it is not that much more outlandish than the guy who
thought ET might be on the internet.

Anyway it's nice of him to pay for our teleport to visit him, along with
the hotel stay.  Of course anyone who could do what he asked would have
no difficulty acquiring all the money he wanted.

IIRC, the chat clients are just front-ends to the IRC 
server now running on extropy.org:6667 , channel 
#extropy , so if you have problems using those, you 
could just use mIRC (or other standalone IRC client 
program of your choice).

Because the value you set corresponds to $$$. It actually costs you more
money to raise your priority.

I think Anders meant that they would always turn green in anticipation of
arrival by single cars (with their complementary lights turning red).

Perhaps they are affecting things at a higher level... maybe the influence
comes earlier in a temporal sense, and just subtly alters the world so that,
at the point in time when the Magick practitioner sails through the lights,
they just happen to all be green. Also, maybe it only works for serious, not
very numerous magickal type people, thus not causing a fairness problem.

Chesh, if you want to try to accumulate a bit of proof, try logging the
exact amount of greens vs reds, maybe with a measurement of how long you
wait at the red. Get some non-magickal friends in the same area who use
similar routes to do the same. Compare notes. You could even try turning
them red vs turning them green to see if you can get a measurable
difference.

A related thought... I use a lift (elevator) every day to get to work. On
almost every trip there are multiple people in the lift, and, after everyone
has entered but before the doors close, almost without fail, someone will
press the "doors close" button. The thing I notice about this is that there
is no observable difference in how long it takes for the doors to close
(although I've never timed it; I should try that), if people press that
button or not. I even have a vague feeling that I've heard of lifts with
"doors close" buttons which are fake.

Internal locus of control... it's a bitch, ey?

I would think that, in terms of establishing repeatability, there would

Hi all,

As mentioned in today's Exponent, two arbitrary chat times have now been 
selected for weekly real-time chats at the ExI-Community forum on 
YahooGroups.com (this is until the chat at ExI-BBS is completed).  These 
times are as follows:

Tuesdays: 7:00 - 9:00 PM PST  (10:00 - 12:00 EST)

&

Saturdays: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM PST  (1:00 - 4:00 PM EST)

To join, simply go to http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ExI-Community/ and 
select the "chat" button on your left.

These chats can, of course, last as long as you want them to, but it's best 
to log on within the times above to ensure the most conversation.

						Sincerely,

							E. Shaun Russell

Hmm. I should try that. Once the Olympics are gone and I start leaving the house.... 
(coincidentally, I have almost no magickal friends here.The one I do doesn't drive either. 
So there's not much of a choice, there.)

Yes, I think there are.
There's actually a whole chapter about elevators in James Gleick's book Faster: The 
Acceleration Of Just About Everything (which I need to finish, dammit).
Same thing with crosswalk buttons, as the previous post mentioned....
They're a nice placebo, aren't they?

It doesn't get any better after that point, Chesh.  I really liked Chaos, but
Faster was probably Gleick's weakest book.  He refused to speculate
on what it all means, or extrapolate into even the foreseeable future.
I recommend our own Damien Broderick's The Spike if you like that
kind of work.  spike

I was recently surprised and pleased to see that Steve Jackson Games has 
recently published a transhuman setting for their Generic Universal 
Roleplaying System (GURPS).  From what I saw it looked really neat, 
allowing you to play humans, cyborgs, full cyborgs, uplifted animals, and 
several different types of uploads.  It looks like they might be supporting 
this setting quite a bit, so we should be seeing more people exposed to 
transhuman ideas.  There's even a link to the Extropy institute off of the 
official site: http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/transhuman/core/

So the US is no longer a free or capitalistic country since we 
now have thousands of selectively enforced federal "crimes" and 
dozens of excuses for forfeiture (forfeiture without due process 
where you have to prove they should give your property back). 
Also there is almost no financial privacy whatsoever.

Building new roads is very expensive at least in inner cities, so
unless the software system gets very complex and expensive it would be
worth it - at least to the drivers. In the current situation there is
less incentive for the politicians controlling the roads to make them
more efficient.

Besides, extra bandwidth does not always decrease the time it takes to
get anywhere. The Braess Paradox can complicate things:
http://tigger.uic.edu/~hagstrom/Research/braess.htm
 
I talked about this kind of market-based approaches to traffic planning
with a friend who is a politician involved in a lot of technical
planning in my area (he and his friends are essentially playing SimCity
with it :-). He told me there is already quite a bit of adaptivity in
many traffic lights here, although this is more like my original
proposal of having the lights react to where the bigger queues are.
According to him (too) the system might not benefit significantly with
an even cleverer lights algorithm. Still, he is looking at it from the
traffic throughput side, and not at the value to each driver. After all,
a traffic flow with slightly less efficient throughput but where people
arrive more commensurate with their perceived needs would increase the
overall utility.

Yeah, I've noticed. That's probably why I was so easily distracted and have not read it in 
a while! I love what I've read of Chaos (I'm *really* bad at actually finishing any nonfiction 
book. Though I did actually make it through (and love) Techgnosis, and I wish I could 
remember who it was by so I could plug it!); but Faster seems kind of pointless. All these 
statistics are nice, but what the hell do they mean?
I've had the Spike recommended to me before, so I'll definitely have to be looking into it.

They do that already when the whole page fits in less than a screen.
I think it would be natural to do the same here.

That would be a possibility, but perhaps a bit complicated. I think
that reading the last screenful should not be any different than
reading the previous ones.

The forfeiture you speak of is specifically in the case where a person
has been convicted of a drug trafficking offense, where after criminal
conviction, their property is seized by the government in civil court
proceedings, on the basis that the property was purchased, in part or in
whole, by the proceeds of drug money, leaving the owner to prove that
they didn't use drug money to obtain the property. While this is not
hard to do if one has used banks to process one's income and payments
for the property, when it comes to cash transactions, this is very
difficult to prove. 

I've known a few people who lost their property from such actions, and
frankly, I can say that in every case it helped them accelerate their
drug addiction trajectory so that they hit rock bottom and got help a
lot sooner than they would have if they had that property to depend upon
to maintain their lifestyle and drug habit.

While I am steadfastly opposed to the drug war, and support
legalized/medicalized drug use, I am also distinctly aware, through
extensive personal experience, that an individual addicted to drugs is
not a sane, mature, consenting citizen in control of themselves (no
matter whether the drug is alcohol, pot, coke, etc, even tobacco). I
have seen previously high functioning, rational people descend into the
most ludicrous, insanely infantile behavior due to their addictions that
they are unable or unwilling to control.

In this respect, civil forfeiture functions (admittedly poorly) as a
means of treating those who act like children as children. I do not deny
that it could be improved, in the form of making such seizures
temporary, until the individual has gone through rehab and recovery,
rather than just a get rich quick scheme for policemen and police
departments.

> Also there is almost no financial privacy whatsoever.

But should there be financial privacy? It's difficult to enforce private
property rights unless there is some record of what exactly is owned by
whome. While this doesn't necessarily mean it should ALL be publicly
available to all, it does mean that when you've sold something to
someone, you have as much a right to the fact that you sold it as the
buyer does. If the buyer doesn't specifically require you to keep the
transaction private, and you have no publicly announced privacy policy,
you have a right to sell the information about the sale.

Who sells your financial info? Credit agencies obtain it from financial
institutions and businesses who have extended you credit, either in the
form of a credit card, or in the form of accepting anything but cash for
payment. When you violate that credit, they have a right to report that
fact. If you don't want bad stuff on your credit record, don't do things
that will get on there.

As Suze Ormon says, "respect attracts money, disrespect repels it". If
you demonstrate your disrespect for money, yours or other peoples, you
will repel money, in the form of loans, investment, or credit to you for
transactions and enterprises you wish to undertake. It is, after all,
other people's money, and they have a right to know how respectful you
will be of it from your past record.

Samantha,
       There are many shortcomings that are acting upon our ship of state 
like an ice accumulation upon a real ship.  I understand that if allowed to 
continue real ice can finally sink a real ship.  Certainly this one is 
slowing in its economic efficiency.  Let me give one example: I am a retired 
engineer in a specialty that has almost disappeared.  I decided to study 
accounting.  As I was exploring the various fields of accounting I took a 
class in tax accounting.
       We have a one class each semester in our local community college in 
tax accounting that has perhaps 25 or thirty students.  You can bet that 
every college, two or four years, around here has classes of equal or larger 
size.
       Can you imagine the wasted manpower going into figuring tax bills?  
That is purely a waste.  It is just more ice accumulating upon the ship of 
state.
       But the question is what would you do about it?  Oh, and what is a 
crypto fascist?  I haven't heard the answer to that one yet.

Don't do it, Chesh! Most likely you won't find any measurable
difference, get turned off on magick, and get stuck at red lights for
the rest of your life. Once you start trying to pin it down, it'll go
away. Magick doesn't gel with empirical investigation.

Chances are almost certain anyway that we're living in a simulation,
where bored programmers amuse themselves by letting reality slip a
little for some people who are open to the flow. Generally, this means
extropians are excluded. It'd cause too many aberrations if they let it
slip for those engaged in any kind of scientific work. Aberrations mean
long days of work tweaking reality below the surface such that the
anomaly gets all logically explained in some theoretical paper written
by a physicist in Turkey a week before the observed event.

I think that roughly the same number of bizarre events happened to me
before and after I became comfortable with my grasp of how physical
reality works and sure that my thoughts had no effect on it except through
my actions.  The main effect of knowing that your thoughts have no effect
on reality - except for the sanity part - is that I can visualize a pickax
murderer lurking behind the door of my darkened apartment and still step
through quite confident that the probability of an actual pickax murderer
being there is no higher than on any other occasion.  Which really does
make for a more comfortable thought process.

The translation might be:
It wasn't Muslim Fundamentalists that did it, but dreadful space aliens.
Or, that space aliens are watching the terrible violence of humankind.

Ah, but a total lack of aberrations is evidence in and of itself. Since
life is chaotic, getting a perfect 50-50 split every time would be
suspicious.

Occasionally, it seems that various list members who are primarily of
urban origin will make comments about rural residents that displays at
best a sad ignorance of one's fellow citizens (especially when the
individual tends to consider themselves a worldly intellectual). I just
read a rather excellent column by Blake Hurst ("Seeing Red") on the Wall
Street Journal's "Opinion Journal" website:

http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=100001665

and I suggest that those with a tendency toward urban parochialism read
it thoroughly...

Having just given a talk to the LA Futurists on Friday on scenario 
planning, I was pleased to just discover that my paper, "Grasping the 
Future: Comparing Scenarios to other Techniques" is the first featured 
paper here:

http://www.plausiblefutures.com/

I wasn't aware of this site. Looks interesting if scenario planning and 
other futures tools interest you.

I can't, but I sent it to a friend of mine in Japan and asked him if he would; hopefully I'll be 
able to know within a few days if we havn't found a translation by then.

I probably wouldn't, but I would just remember that whenever I tried to post anything 
about it here and get in another war that I can't win :)

*shrug* I have little to no opinion on the simulation issue; I think it would be really neat if 
we are, though. Though that did remind me of the similarities between the old-school 
hacker ethos and the magickian ethos! The laws of physics are no different from any 
other, and I will break them, too, if they are in my way :p

Yeah. Although it occurs to me that, while we may be able to see how that works in 
theory and even in the equations that let it happen, until we do the expirement ourselves 
we have as little proof of any given amazing scientific thing as we do of any given 
amazing magickal thing. Or maybe that's just me; I can wrap my brains around these 
things in theory, but when faced with even something as simple as the speed of light my 
brain wants to explode (though I'm not sure if it can't figure out if it's absurd that there's an 
absolute limit to velocity, or of it's absurd that something can break that.
This is what comes, btw, from having a pseudo-new age mother and a geek father.
I always say how I'm not like my parents, until I look at myself from anything vaguely 
resembling an objective standpoint and realize that I'm just like them.

Greetings !!!!!!!!!! *huge grin*

I cannot translate... Which changes nothing to the fact that people like
seeing faces/stuff in smoke, clouds, tea leaves, or dried sea shells (my
Senegalese grandma does weird stuff with those sea shells). There's another
pic on da net showing what looks like an evil face in the clouds of smoke
spiraling up in the sky above the twin towers. My question is:
What's the point of caring about UFOs if we have no proof ? Before you start
about 'proof', this is what I mean:
standing next to an active volcano, nobody would feel too confident about
not getting burned by hot lava. You'll never hear someone (unless they're
into tea leaves, LSD what have you... yeah, just kidding) doubt that
standing next to an active volcano is dangerous. Volcanoes have been
observed, studied, are still being observed and studied... It has been
proved that lava burns...I used to love 'anything' even vaguely
mystical/paranormal as a teen... I gave up when I realized what I could do
with the 'normal' *laughing*

*Arona after a nice dinner and a glass of red wine, feeling quite
'ooooooooooooooooh' coz he's not really a drinker and is
quitting everything: cigarettes + THC (cannabis) + MDMA.... Yeah... 8 years
of Cannabis, 15 years of cigarettes, 6 years of MDMA (Xtacee / Ecstasy or
however it's spelled nowadays)... Feel like a bull... I could probably
headbutt a bull right now hehehe*

PS: I, for one, find it hard to believe that 'anyone' could even think of
aliens/UFOs in this case. I mean for Arona's sakes: thousands died...Can't
we at least think about it rationally ? Why involve UFOs etc ??? It would
even be easier to believe that both towers were blown by Americans in order
to get certain laws passed ( I almost do sometimes ). But UFOs ???
Puh-lease.

PS2: Anyone knows how to assemble/disassemble an Hitachi hard disk : model
DK23AA-12 ? Even pics would do... Mine died or is playing dead... Can't
code... using my wife/girlfriend's PC (for email) which runs Windows
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh... *misses his Debian distro*

Not always.  Not to go off on another whining-about-Florida-rant, but....
:-)

In Florida, carrying large sums of cash, say over $10,000, is legally
defined as "suspicious".  The police can and do seize such large amounts of
cash under the assumption that it is drug money.  The cash can be retrieved
only if the person can prove where it came from and that it was obtained
legally.  Any unexplained cash that is not later retrieved is simply kept by
the government.

The laws that allow this behavior are based on drug laws.  The cash is
seized as "evidence" under "reasonable suspicion" that a crime has been
committed.  Since no person is charged with any crime, there are no courts,
rights or procedures to follow.  The police in each county can set their own
policies about how people can apply to retrieve their property.  This is a
very controversial topic in Florida.

The nation DEA, FDA and IRS have similar powers to sieze property under
suspicion, and it is up to the individual to prove that they are innocent
before they can get their property back.

I'm about halfway through reading Ventus, the first novel by Canadian
writer Karl Schroeder, out in paperback.  It seems to be well written and
makes a good try at depicting a future in which ordinary human beings,
enhanced demigods, and super-human AIs all live together.

The story takes place on the planet Ventus, where a terraforming
experiment gone wrong has left the Winds, AIs which are practically forces
of nature, in charge of the planet and mostly ignoring the humans they
were created to serve.  The entire planet is full of nanotech; every
rock, every tree, even every ripple in the ocean is alive with its own
consciousness, although they don't seem to do anything.  They just sit
there going, "I'm a rock!"  "I'm a tree!" but most humans can't perceive
the dialog.

Here's a passage where a visitor describes the way life is on most of
the rest of millions of inhabited planets and habitats:

   "There are a million organizing principles in human space.
   None resemble Ventus.  Your world is unique, and the records of
   the designs of the Winds were lost in a war centuries ago.  Most of
   humanity lives in something known as the Archipelago - an immense
   region whose boundaries are so vague that most of its citizenry
   doesn't even know of its existence."

   "Now you're talking madness," smiled the Queen.

   "Archipelago is the only answer to ruling a population of trillions,
   who own a million different cultures, mores and histories."
   He shrugged.  "It is simple: an artificial intelligence - a mechal
   brain, if you will - exists and mediates things.  It knows each and
   every citizen personally and orchestrates their meetings with others,
   communications and so on in order to avoid irreconcilable conflict.
   Beyond that, it stays out of sight, for it has no values, no desires
   of its own.  It is as if every person had their own guardian spirit,
   and these spirits never warred, but acted in concert to improve
   people's lives."

   "A tyranny of condescension," said Galas.

This is reminiscent of Eliezer's "Friendly AI" scenario, where the AI
acts benevolently to keep things running smoothly.  Which is better,
this "tyranny of condescension", or a world in which people are free,
even though they bring harm to others?

I'm a little surprised to feel a need to say these things on the
extropians list. It's basic.

What you're advocating here is that any Means is OK, as long as
*you* find the Ends *acceptable*.

Drug-use is a victimless crime. The State has no business being
involved with what one does with their own person and property as
long as they don't physically harm the person or property of
another.

I do not find your Means acceptable. Once you tell the government
that it's OK to throw someone in jail or take their property because
of some behavior that is not harming anyone else, but that you find
unacceptable, then what comes next? Firing them, evicting them,
denying them credit, stripping away their civil rights, and the list
goes on without end. If a person chooses to diminish their lives
by using some drugs, then they have every right to do so.

All drug use carries a risk, and the risks are varied. As an adult,
each makes his/her own decision as to whether to expose themself to
that drug, and one measures the potential good/harm against their
own personal form of measure. "Inform yourself, then choose". The
best way to remove the largest dangers regarding drug use is
education .. not throwing that person into jail !!

Drug use is just one of a long list of victimless crimes, that the
State has no business sticking their stinking noses into. I wonder
if anyone here finds any similarities in the rhetoric between the
'War on Drugs' and the 'War on Terrorism' ?

I am developing an alternate theory to Max's "Dynamic Optimism" called
"Dynamic Pessimism".  Sometimes I think it makes more sense than Max's
philosophy.  I am not sure it will be as popular, however.

I claim that we actually will fail to get green lights most of the time when
we are in a hurry to go fast, and that we will fail to get red lights most
of the time if we want to stop and rummage through the glove box.  This is
because we talk about traffic lights as having two states:  green and red.
In reality, there is a third state (and I'm not talking about yellow).

State One:  You zoom through a green light without having to slow down or
stop.  This counts as success when you want to go, but failure when you want
to stop.

State Two:  You stop at a red light.  This counts as success when you want
to stop, but failure when you want to go.

State Three:  "The worst of both worlds."  The light has turned green, but
there are still cars stopped from when it was red.  You can't zoom through
because of the cars.  Therefore this counts as failure if you want to go.
However, you only slow down or stop for a moment.  There is not enough time
to rummage through the glove box.  This therefore also counts as failure
when you want to stop.  This is neither a go nor a stop, but some hellish
state inbetween that annoys everybody.

If we zoom through state one 40% of the time, stop at state two 40% of the
time, and get disrupted at state three 20% of the time, the odds are that we
will get a failure mode 60% of the time no matter which mode we want to be
in.

UPCOMING MEETING

http://ntweb.stsci.edu/sd/astrophysicsoflife/
Space Telescope Science Institute May Symposium
   ASTROPHYSICS OF LIFE
   May 6-9, 2002
   DEADLINE FOR EARLY REGISTRATION: April 8, 2002

The Space Telescope Science Institute will devote its annual spring
symposium to:  "Astrophysics of Life".  The goal of the symposium is
to understand the astronomical and astrophysical foundations upon which
searches for life in the universe must be based, and which bear on the
nature and origin of life.  Topics will include: extrasolar planet searches
and properties, the history of the solar system, emergence, dust disks,
star and planet formation, interstellar and solar system chemistry, the
habitability of planets, satellites and the Galaxy, strategies for searches,
and cosmological considerations.  Our aim is to lay the astrophysical
groundwork for locating habitable places in the Universe. New astronomical
mission concepts will also be an important element of the conference.

    Wolfe divides nanotech mavens into two categories. "There is
    a scale that moves from left to right," he said. "There are
    the 'cosa nostra,' or the 'mental enthusiasts'--like (Ray)
    Kurzweil--the extropians and the transhumanists," and then
    there are the down-to-earth folks, trying to "de-nanobot" the
    field.

    On the more far-out side, one business proposal Wolfe recently
    saw involved cryogenically freezing the deceased and bringing
    them back with nanobots in the future.

    As far as Wolfe is concerned, any technology based on the
    "Drexlerian vision of nanotech"--that is, the self-replicating
    assembler--should be put in its place.

    These far-out ideas should "promote ethical debates and get
    people involved," but "investors should not be looking at that
    type of thing," he said.

A bit of a slam, but the last paragraph is certainly true for nearly
all investors.  Nanodot had an article recently warning that nanotech
funding could disappear quickly if it doesn't meet overhyped short
term expectations a la AI in the 80s:
http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/06/1848253

The ExI link <http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm> obtains a 404,
someone ought to make that redirect to the homepage perhaps.

       I did a search and there are a few sites with copies of the animation 
but nothing with any more details. Also found some guff about seizmic waves 
causing the collapse, CIA responsible yadda yadda.

       I did find a great RealVideo clip of a UFO next to the WTC before 911. 
<A HREF="http://www.scifi.com/happens/happens_1_big.mov">http://www.scifi.com/happens/happens_1_big.mov</A>
I'm not sure when this was shot/Made or who by etc, but it is on the SCI-FI 
channels web site. so have a large pinch of salt at the ready.

 Its taken from a helecopter and It shows a UFO/blob/bird/flying fish etc 
next to one of the towers. The object then jumps/streaks out of shot and is 
picked up again by the camera. It then streaks up into the air leaving a 
excellent con trail. 
At first glance, this is a very impressive clip, all the angles seem to add 
up and it doesn't seem to have the usuall "staged" feel.

       As for the clip on the Japenese sight, If the object wasn't caught by

I mentioned that the best routing algorithms, when compared to primitive
routing algorithms, can at best double the utilization of a large data
network. A shy lurker e-mailed me privately and asked if there is an
analogy with other algorithms, and in particular with AI algorithms. I 
think that this is a good question.

Basically, to a first approximation, you can get the same performance
by over-engineering a data network by a factor of two as you can get
with the most clever routing algorithm (in practice, not in theory.)

This leads to two questions:
   1) Is any part of the AI problem isomorphic to the routing problem?
   2) What parts of the AI problem, if any, are amenable to brute-force
over-engineering, and what is a good guesstimate of the "cleverness 
factor" of a clever algorithm versus a brute-force algorithm? The 
cleverness factor for routing is a simple factor of 2.

As an aside, I mentioned to our "shy lurker" that this is exactly the
kind of question we like to see posted onto the list. I hope our lurker
will begin posting.

I did not look at this particular URL, but I assume that it refers to the 
anomalous object shown in at least one authentic and widely shown video of 
WTC 911. The object appears to zoom past the crash site (2nd jet into the 
WTC) with a speed and trajectory that have prompted some to speculate that 
it was a missle shot from one of the fighter jets that were to known to have 
been sent to the scene at that time.  If so, the missle obviously missed....

Sounds fascinating. I'd like to mention another recent sf novel, ECHOES OF
EARTH (Ace pb, Jan 2002), by Aussies Sean Williams and Shane Dix. There'll
be a review soon by Paul Di Filippo (who gives it an A-), viewable at

http://www.scifi.com/sfw/advance/11_books.html

It's a post-Spike novel (and I was delighted to find that they've used this
term, although their grisly version of the Singularity isn't one I'd care
to have stuck to my coinage for the rest of time). Inter alia, there's a
rather interesting throw-away cosmogonic speculation near the start; I
don't really think it makes sense since they blend the Many Worlds QT model
with state reduction; still, I find it intriguing... 

=========================

Adrasteia was small, dense and rugged, bombarded by rubble left over
from its evolution and at the mercy of severe plate tectonics.  Its
atmosphere was substantial enough to give rise to dramatic pressure
differentials: at the bottom of the canyon Alander inhabited, the air
was far too dense to be comfortable, while at the top of the nearest
peak it might as well have been a vacuum. The average temperature was
below the freezing point of water, and what little oxygen existed was
mostly generated by cyanobacteria sharing the air with the clouds
above -- clouds trapped in warmer atmospheric layers and never
yielding rain.  Apart from the clouds the planet's main water reserves
lay underground.  It probably wouldn't be that way forever -- or even
for long, if the terraformers got their way -- but for now, the only
remotely habitable planet around Upsilon Aquarius was proving to be a
pain in the ass.  Certainly nothing as wonderful as his original self
must have imagined it would be.

But there was life, of a kind.  Apart from faint hints in the deep
equatorial basins some of his fellow surveyors were exploring, the
cyanobacteria in the clouds proved once and for all that such could
evolve independently on another world.  There was no way they could
have come from Earth, as did, some skeptics still believed, those
found on Mars and Io.  And the fact they were little different to the
ones back home added credence to the original Peter Alander's theories
concerning the origins of life in the universe, not to mention why
there were no aliens waiting to greet the survey teams when they
arrived.

His original would have been pleased, that was for sure.  The
Adrasteian cyanobacteria had never evolved into anything terribly
sophisticated.  There seemed to be no reason why they shouldn't have,
though; conditions here were not fundamentally dissimilar to those
that existed on Earth, Mars or Europa.  Adrasteian life-forms hadn't
evolved any further, his original would have argued, because the odds
were stacked so far against such a thing happening that it shouldn't
happen even once in the lifetime of the universe.  In fact, life
should not have evolved at all -- even to the level of bacteria.

The fact that it had evolved suggested otherwise, unless one viewed
the early universe as a massive quantum computer, a near-infinite
number of parallel universes engaged in incomprehensible
"computations" from the moment of its creation -- smashing elements
together, creating new compounds and smashing those together in
turn -- until something appeared that could be called "alive".  This
unicellular life wasn't conscious, but it appeared and flourished
everywhere, on numerous worlds, multiplying and evolving in the
strange, uncollapsed place that was the unobserved universe.

The moment consciousness occurred, though, down one of those possible
reality-paths, the collapse occurred.  The universe, observed, could
no longer nurture the conditions required to "parallel-process"
bacteria to consciousness.  Once just one being saw, it robbed all
other life-forms the chance to evolve.  Rapid evolution stopped in its
tracks, confined as the universe now was just to one track at a time.
Even with a near-infinite number of stars in the universe, the odds
shrank to almost zero that other conscious life-forms would emerge
from primitive organisms, since it was too unlikely to happen in a
single universe -- and thus the majority of worlds humans surveyed
would be inhabited by nothing more exciting than bacterial sludge that
had evolved, in the past.

The lack of complex alien life on Adrasteia seemed to support his
original's argument: that humans were the universe's present
observers, and that they would find no other intelligent life-forms
anywhere, just many different types of dead-end bacteria.  There would
be nothing more, in fact, until humanity died out and the universe
could resume its quantum computations.


=======================

Curiously, my own novel THE JUDAS MANDALA (belatedly published in the
States in 1982) offers almost the exact opposite conjecture: a transhuman
species of humans, under the auspices of a posthuman superior group
uploaded into machine substrate (rather inappropriately called cyborgs),
teach their doctrine to a somewhat more recognizable human; this section is
from a chunk published in 1976 in the American magazine GALILEO, under the
title `Growing Up'):

========================

`It is impossible to argue against the cyborg *Weltanschauung*. To do so
would be absurd. The patterns they can manipulate so far surpass those we
can command that we must take what they tell us on faith. And what they
reveal is that life is a temporary necessary aberration in the unfolding of
a deterministic cosmos.'

`Gigo,' she says wearily. `The hoariest fallacy known to science: Garbage
In, Garbage Out.'

For a moment the beautiful ageless man shows anger. Sriyanie has ventured
close to blasphemy. He goes on, after a pause: `I've experienced its truth,
Sriyanie. At the universal dawn, in the great White Hole, the metrodynamic
was clear and linear and untarnished by Uncertainty. The cosmos told its
time by a perfect clockwork, a sublime Newtonian machine. Cause and effect
were simple and total. The intrusive blight of quantum probabilities had
not yet arisen.'

Dumbly, she shakes her head. His words are so close to the truth, as all
effective deceit must be, but he has everything turned about.

`Inevitably, the planets coalesced about their suns, organic acids came
together at their ice caps, amino acids formed as the enriched ice thawed,
peptides, proteins, nucleotides--life. And the first disharmony intruded.
Life multiplied, complexified, transformed the worlds where it was born,
and introduced everywhere its own randomizing horrors.'

`No,' Sriyanie says, aghast, `you're wrong.'

`But observing mind came from life,' Livani insists, more loudly. `The
underlying order of the metric frame was discovered anew, and the
possibility revived that it might regain its Laplacean grandeur. The
cyborgs are that hope embodied: mind free of the organic pestilence which
structured all five-space non-null-entropy systems into the ugliness of
unreason.'

[...]

`Of *course* life structures the metric frame,' she cries. `Of *course* it
imposes constrains on the primordial condition. But that Ur-State is
synchronistic. From the White Hole until the protozoa, the cosmic
parameters interacted only by affinity! How else do you suppose that life
arose? There simply wasn't *time* for the process to occur in your
Laplacean fantasy.... If the Newtonian laws have some general validity,
it's precisely because intention and value-ridden perception have *made*
them work. It's only by profound inner silence, a stilling of the beta
activity in your head, a retreat from will to wish, that the primal reality
can reassert itself. You hivers stuff yourselves to overflowing with a
clamor of contingent facts, and relinquish magic.'

`The goal of consciousness,' Livani says stubbornly, `is the hypostasy of
reason.'

`The goal of consciousness,' Sriyanie retorts, `is a harmonious
equilibration of confluence and cause. Your culture strives to enforce
predictability and you achieve nothing but a totalitarian extinction of all
that's beautiful and loving in the universe.' [etc]

==================

I don't agree with either of them, of course. :)

Yes, when I first learned that the Steve Jackson in the database was *the* 
Steve Jackson, I was happily surprised.  I quite literally grew up on his 
RPG-like "choose your own adventure" books.  It's interesting how, without 
knowing the Steve Jackson connection, years later I became involved with 
Extropy.  I'm sure there are a number of stories like this out there.

Location of male brain cells now confirmed!

< Viagra, a drug used for erectile dysfunction and one of the most
frequently prescribed medications in the United States, has been found to
reduce the effects of stroke in laboratory animals, according to a Henry
Ford Hospital study. 

"What we found is that we can use certain drugs like Viagra to create new
brain cells," said Michael Chopp, Ph.D., scientific director of the
Neuroscience Institute at Henry Ford Hospital. "And these cells are created
in both elderly as well as young subjects. 

"When animals with stroke are treated with Viagra, the drug provides very
significant neurological functional benefit. These animals do much better
on many different outcome measures, including motor function, somatosensory
testing, neurological outcome and weight gain. There are far fewer
functional deficits. We can treat with Viagra days after stroke and there
is a significan! t reduction in neurological deficit and a significant
induction of new brain cells," said Chopp. >

That's all very well, but I'm far from sure that a man with a limp dick
would want to see a quack with that name.

As a young teen I loved to play his Microgame collection of wargames!  I think I bought just about everyone.  I have fond memories of Chitin, Invasion of the Air-Eaters. Rivets, Holy War, Warpwar, Ogre(still very much around), Ice War, and the many other very inexpensive, yet very entertaining and creative titles he produced.   
 
Later I learned to love his roleplaying game, The Fantasy Trip.  This had combat based on the Melee and Wizard Microgames, which were a cool take on miniatures combat.  

His "Choose your own Adventure" books were so good!  At the time that type of thing was popular.  But no one did it as well as Steve Jackson.

Later, he came out with the great GURPS roleplaying game system, which I loved for the way he would adapt so many different times, books, and genres for gameplay.  And I can't wait to get my hands on Transhuman Space!! : )

I first realized Steve Jackson was involved in our "subculture" when I saw him post on Cryonet.  I was stunned!!  And to top it off, at the bottom of his post it said, "Yes, I'm THAT Steve Jackson." lol!

I am "one of the other stories" out there.  But considering the science fiction and fantasy themes Steve Jackson used in his games which I loved, there is little wonder to me that I wound up here!  And I am very glad Steve Jackson is reading Cryonet, and hopefully signed up.

best wishes,

John

This is a very interesting set of questions. As a computational
neuroscientist, I think I can answer them for the brain (which after all
is an existence proof of a hardware implemented AI). In the brain
routing does not seem to be very common - there are some ideas how you
could do it, but most signals are simply sent along firmwired paths
where adaptation (i.e. learning) changes where they lead on longer
timescales than the signals are themselves moving. This seems to be a
brute force solution: it grows many more axons and synapses than are
needed, and then the unnecessary are pruned or ignored.

Now, if I was to implement this system on a parallel computer
instead, routing immediately becomes more relevant. If I store different
parts of the network on different nodes, then routing signals
efficiently can affect my performance a lot. The tricky part is that the
brain seem to be very modular on some levels (lobe interconnections,
cortical minicolumns) and highly connected on others (intercortical
connections, inside minicolumns), making division rather hard. 

The general AI problem doesn't seem to me to be inherently about
routing, but any implementation beyond a dedicated hardware solution
subjected to scarce computing resources would likely have to deal with
routing to a very high degree. It would mainly be getting data to and
from processors, or accessing remote data/states. Clever routing would
improve the speed but not the smarts, and if cleverness can only help a
factor of 2 then brute force would be the way to go.

It is not obvious that the "tyranny" is even possible as stated. It is
the old problem of information again; while the AI may (somehow) get
around the usual problem that the ruling entity does not have full
information about the desires and actions of its subjects, it still is
forced to deal with an immense optimization problem that has to be
solved in real-time. It is not clear whether this would involve
preventing any bad encounter (and thus ending up with the risk of ending
up in a local optimum leading to a far worse long-term outcome) or
allowing some to happen in order to prevent worse problems in the
future. To some extent this is what people do all the time - just think
of a good host or hostess at a party - but it is not obvious at all that
this can be scaled up arbitrarily. 

It is also not explained whether it is possible to ignore the advice of
the AI in the above scenario. If it is, I see no ethical problem with it
at all. If it overrides the free behavior of the citizens, then there
are clearly problems with it (unless one is an untilitarian, in which
case the issue becomes whether this system actually manages to maximize
utility).

It seems both ns1.kumo.com and ns2.kumo.com are unreachable
while moosehead.merak.com refuses nameserver queries.

Is this a maintenance thing, or is extropy.org yet another

blocking them at the firewall ?

There's a presumption, in the quote, that the AI knows best period.  If
that were so, fine.  But how would we know it is so?  The problem of how
evaluates the AI comes up -- and this is no different than say turning
over our freedom to any benevolent dictator, group, or party.

The promises that such an AI will only think of our interests because
its own have been suppressed and because it's designed to have no
emotions or values seems silly to me.  Once it has the power, how will
one keep it from morphing into something else -- something with
interests antithetical to those it has power over?

This is not to say I stand against AI.  I do not.  But I don't believe
in giving more intelligent beings control over my life period -- be they
just people with ten more IQ points than me and two PhDs or
superintelligent passionless machines.

Cheers!

Hey folks.  Sorry I haven't been around to participate lately (off building 
a new business and all), but I stumbled across this article at CNN.com on 
Insulin-like Growth Factor-One.  Sounds like really promising (and fairly 
readily available) bio-enhancement tech.  Maybe old news to you all by now, 
but I figured I'd throw it in the pot and see what you can make of it.

It is extremely easy to implement Bresenham and higher-dimensional
defective Bresenham lattice routing on molecular hardware, assuming it's
connected that you can tell which links are local and which are not, and
the wiring is fairly orthogonal.

In fact above approach would also work on global and (super)stellar scale
networking. The reason the Internet has routing problems is due to the
fact that the protocols are braindead, not due to some basic computational
physics limitation (there is none).

There's no routing problem. There's only the problem which signals to send
and which not to send.

There is an old hoax that is making the rounds again.  I have seen a dozen
instances of this in the last 24 hours.

WARNING! The message about "sulfnbk.exe" being a virus is a HOAX. The
message tricks you into thinking that you have a virus and asked you to
delete a normal file found in Windows 95/98/ME.

Optical SETI: A Spectroscopic Search for Laser Emission from Nearby Stars

Authors: Amy E. Reines (1), Geoffrey W. Marcy (1,2) ((1) San Francisco State
University Department of Physics and Astronomy, (2) University of California
Berkeley Department of Astronomy)
Comments: 27 pages, 11 figures, uses aastex.sty

     We have searched for nonastrophysical emission lines in the
     optical spectra of 577 nearby F, G, K, and M main-sequence stars.
     Emission lines of astrophysical origin would also have been
     detected, such as from a time--variable chromosphere or infalling
     comets. We examined ~20 spectra per star obtained during four
     years with the Keck/HIRES spectrometer at a resolution of 5 km/s,
     with a detection threshold 3% of the continuum flux level. We
     searched each spectrum from 4000-5000 angstroms for emission lines
     having widths too narrow to be natural from the host star, as well
     as for lines broadened by astrophysical mechanisms. We would have
     detected lasers that emit a power, P>60 kW, for a typical beam
     width of ~0.01 arcsec (diffraction-limit from a 10-m aperture) if
     directed toward Earth from the star. No lines consisstent with
     laser emission were found.

They have every right to do so, ONLY if the only negative impact is upon
their lives alone. If there are dependents involved, who have their own
rights to be free of such irresponsibility, or even just creditors, who
have a right to expect their money to be treated responsibly, then the
individual engaging in such behavior is putting jeopardy on others, not
just themselves, and in a libertarian perspective, the interests of
others put in jeopardy are equally as important as that of the drug
user.

Are you advocating that an addict has a greater right to get high and
drive their kids off a cliff than their kids have to continue living?

Note that I did not once advocate throwing drug users in jail, did I?
Nor did I say that an individual shouldn't be free to drug themselves as
they see fit, or even suicide. I am fully in support of the individuals
right to choose such activities, SO LONG as those activities do not harm
others.

HOWEVER: From my experience in working with drug addicts, and my
understanding of the physiology of addiction, it is my opinion that a
person who becomes addicted to a drug is no longer fully in posession
their ability to freely make choices or decisions. At some point, it is
no longer the person making the decisions, the drug is (or rather, how
the drug has warped their minds physiologically and psychologically).
Drug addicts commit acts that they know are wrong, that they claim they
don't want to do, but are compelled to do so in order to get high again.

Such individuals are no longer freely acting adult citizens.
Furthermore, their acts in pursuit of the next high generally involve
causing harm or damage or death to other people and their property:
children and spouses, business associates, creditors, neighbors, etc..

For this reason, the claims that drug use is a 'victimless crime' is not
as black and white, slam dunk as many legalization proponents would like
to claim. Having been in the trenches of dealing with addicts, the
damage they do ALWAYS extends beyond themselves as individuals, as is to
be expected when an individual abdicates responsibility for themselves
to an inanimate substance.

Nor did I say that civil forfeiture worked particularly well at what its
intended purpose is. It actually works rather badly, doing more to
enrich police departments and their officers than helping the real
victims of drug addiction.

Nor do I consider all drug users to be addicts, which you seem to be
assuming.

Now, I expect to see a rather hostile and unthinking, inconsiderate
condemnation from others here, such as Curt Adams, et al regarding my
comments. Before shooting from the hip with comments that reflect a lack
of actual comprehension about what I actually wrote here, I suggest
those whose ire is raised to read my comments again.

Strange you should mention this.  We just had a short thread discussing how

Well, yes, of course. Not that I like it, but this is an entirely
rational argument to make, because if you kept that amount of cash
outside of a bank account, then you must be trying to hide it from the
government for some reason. At the very least you are trying to evade
tax laws, at worst you are engaging in illicit trade.

It is also rational to assume that if you got that amount of cash
legitimately, you should be able to demonstrate with receipt records who
you got it from and for what... at which point you'll be asked to pay
taxes on it...  of course, the fact that many businesses deal in far
greater sums every day has no bearing... a legitimate business is
assumed to keep the sort of records that would show how the money was
earned ;)

I can't speak toward your personal experience, Mike, or for Amara's,
but I, for one, refuse to concede that there's no such thing as a
responsible drug user.  Yes, drug abuse can lead to actual crime
against others, and those crimes should be prosecuted, but rational
people don't make the mistake of confusing the instrument with the
crime: that's the same argument of the gun-banners.

And further, while forfeiture cases may seem justified on criminal
drug-abuse grounds, the reality of the law and its present application
is that they are simply government theft of private property without due
process.  No conviction--or even formal accusation--of any crime is
necessary for a forfeiture.  Due process and the rights of the accused
don't apply, because no person is being accused: the property itself is
being accused (the court cases have wonderful titles like "U.S. vs. 100
Bottles of Wine")  Anyone who supports such forfeiture laws is no
libertarian, regardless of the pretext used to justify them.

Sorry, Mike,but your narrow world-view here is a bit detached from
reality.  I, and many other professional and semi-pro poker players
I know, routinely carry large amounts of cash into and out of casinos,
and we don't get receipts for every transaction.  Many cash merchants
carry large amounts as well (though they tend to have better records).

And besides, isn't hiding income from the government a marvellous
life-affirming expression of libertarian values?

Not at all. I said

Feh. Doesn't it seem a little ironic that in this allegedly capitalist
society, you're not allowed to move money around? It isn't just Florida, by
the way. Any and all cash transactions of $10,000 or more are routinely
flagged -- try it sometime if you have no worries about ending up in the
national drug enforcement database as a potential dealer.

My ex-in-laws are in the paper money business -- auctioning obsolete US
currency (funnily enough, there's an article up on mises.org about just
that). Baseball cards for rich people, a collectibles market for those with
hundreds of thousands of dollars to put down on that one-of-a-kind 1850's
color print. A rich and funny history, too, as early notes were often
defaced or enhanced to get across a political point (I have a cute little
1866 10c bill in which the portrait has been carefully and artistically
painted over with pointy ears, goatee, a red cowl, hat and horns -- souvenir
of my time as a trade assistant).

But I digress. Anyhow, since all paper currency printed since the umpteenth
set of banking reforms in the 1920s is still legal tender (officially, but
don't try it at home unless you want to end up on charges of passing false
currency) -- and looks more or less like current bills -- collectors have to
be very careful about how they transport these things for auctions and
shows. More than one collector has been arrested because of the transport
laws -- a particularly funny (in hindsight) story involves an auction item
from four years ago; someone had dug up a suitcase in their attic filled
with 1930s, 40s and 50s play money. Monopoly, dolls sets, other games,
standalone toys, you name it. Millions of dollars of various noncurrencies
in faded primary colors. So the whole shebang was to be sold as a single
lot, suitcase and all -- there are collectors who go for this sort of
found-in-the-attic chic. (Hell, there are collectors who collect hollowed
out stacks of bills for dye bombs, but each to their own...there was a stack
in which the bomb had gone off that went for several thousand dollars back
in 1998). Back to the story; so one of the auction company principals, who
is a big humorous, irreverant guy, heads into the airport (domestic trip, TX
to FL) with a battered suitcase full of play money. Needless to say, he
doesn't make it much past the x-ray machine before being picked up by
airport security. They cracked open the case, and refused to believe that
all the primary-colored toys were not real tender of some sort, somewhere.
So they arrested him. Took many hours to resolve all of the resulting
idiocy, but he was laughing about it by the end of the auction. Hard not to
with the killing they make on the commission.

Anyhow. "War on *" = stupid. Not even evil, just stupid, stupid, stupid. We
live in a sick, controlling society that encourages denial and a lack of
responsibility, can't look beyond tomorrow, curtails freedoms for idiot
reasons and looks more and more like the worst of Europe. Career politicians
are a major source of stupidity, popularity contents are no way to run a
society. Blah, blah, blah, heard it all before, possibly even from me, what
are we going to do about it?

Once upon a time in my (alot) younger days, I planned a libertarian
community with a group of friends in Boulder, Colorado where we (15 of
us) would build and live following our libertarian (Friedman, Hayak,
etc.)  principles, trade services (such as teach each other's kids,
'sell' our skills), using our own currency with each other, and so
on. We never actually did it, with the exception of using only our own
money with each other for awhile, but we had great fun putting the
pieces together about how it would work.

To answer your 'what are we going to do about it?', at the moment, I
can only give the lame response: "remove the State as much as possible
from your daily life."

(Filling in the details are left to imaginative reader :-} )

Amara

BTW: One large reason among several for me deciding not to return to
live in the U.S. is the U.S government's current "War on *"
stupidities.  There's a bit more sane attitude about that nonsense in
Europe. But maybe not for long.

I dunno if "rythym" would be the right word to describe most j-rock, more along the lines

Yes. You are, though, making the assumption that a person remains an
adult while impaired. As a veteran of hundreds of fraternity, dorm, and
squadron parties, and an attendee of the 2000 Rainbow Family Nation
Gathering (major hippie convention), I can emphatically say NO, people
do not remain adults while impaired. As the former business partner of a
cocaine addict, I can say most definitely NO, GODDAMMIT, people do not
remain adults while serious impaired and/or addicted. As a former
attendee of hundreds of AA and Al-Anon meetings, listening to how users
really screwed up their lives, I can most definitely say FUCK NO, people
do not remain adults while impaired and/or addicted.

A responsible adult who seeks to impair their cognitive abilities for
some period of time must accept responsibility and accountability for
the consequences of their actions while impaired. A responsible adult
will also take that risk into account and take steps to help minimize
that risk (i.e. give keys to a designated driver, lock themselves in a
room, put weapons, checkbooks, cash in a safe, etc) and take care to
dose themselves such that they do not develop an addiction.

An addicted person is not a fully independent adult, and should be
treated accordingly.

The problem with this argument is that a gun doesn't chemically alter
the mental processes by which the user makes decisions about responsible
use. It is a highly recursive tool, in that it alters the thought
process that initiates its use. 

Now, I did say that I delineate between drug users and drug addicts.
There is a distinctive difference, both physiologically and
psychologically, between a casual user and an addict, as well as between
a modest dosage and an impairing dosage. 

This is why drunk driving laws have specific blood alcohol limits which
are allegedly supposed to reflect a point at which a persons judgement
is sufficiently impaired that they shouldn't drive. Similar impairment
levels can be applied to other drug use. The only reason they are not as
widely applied is that a breathalyser test generally cannot test for
such substances, but there are limits set by statutes which are
generally met evidentially by blood tests performed at police stations.

If such dosage limits were not scientifically justifiable, they would
not be law. Similarly, the fact that they exist supports my arguments
that impaired individuals cannot be treated as responsible rational
adults while impaired.

There are other dosage related statutes: drunk while in posession of a
firearm is a crime in many states. Merely being served alcohol while
armed is a crime in some states.

I'm not  justifying them, as they are in my opinion a poor tool for the
intended purpose, in many ways the most unuseful you can make a legal
instrument perform its intended purpose. 

However I doubt there are many instances where the government can seize
property without some burden of evidence to support such a claim before
a judge. The drug seizure laws specifically say that the owner must have
been charged with a drug offense, and dropping, dismissing, or acquittal
does justify return of the property. Several people I know who have gone
through such a situation were offered their property back when charges
were dropped in one case, and acquitted in the other.

I also consider what you point out, that the property itself is accused,
not the property owner, to be a very specious legal mechanism. The idea
of bringing a case against an inanimate object is ludicrous.

A friend of mine, Jeff Steinborn, was one of the lawyers who argued
against these forfeiture laws before the Supreme Court on double
jeopardy grounds and lost.

If you accept that income tax laws are valid, then the argument that
property purchased with unreported income can be seized in lieu of
payment is also valid. If you want your property back, pay the taxes
owed.

Yes, but do you report your poker winnings as income? Under the law, you
are supposed to report winnings as income.

Yes it is. I am simply following the government logic to its rational
conclusion. It does hang together. I don't like it, and I try to do my
best to pay as little in taxes as possible (hey, I'll have no income tax
to pay for 2001!). If someone can actually prove in public, and have it
hang together in court, that income taxes are not mandatory, I'm all for
it. However, for those who accept the statist mindset, you either accept
it all or suffer the consequences.

Steve Jackson did the "choose your own adventure" books?  Are you sure?  I
googly think SJ Games did something *like* a "choose your own adventure"
book, but was not actually responsible for "Choose Your Own

I know it's pathetic, but "Choose Your Own Adventure" and "Pick a Path to

Borrowing this observation for my own fell purposes, I raise the question
whether some mental illness might be usefully modeled as an internal
contest between hardwired or firmwired modules, akin to a Dawkins' gene or
meme competition. What's in it for such selfish modules? I don't know.
Maybe everything with a kind of boundary just wants to be free. Well, in
fact, many subprocesses *are* kinda free and bottom-up anarchic, with
emergent coordination; maybe the feral thing is when this gets out of hand.

Relevant to this broad suggestion, perhaps, is the very good article by
Prof. Susan Greenfield in a recent NEW SCIENTIST (02 February 2002 issue,
`Sensational minds') where she argues interestingly for consciousness as
linked to sheer number of neural components activated in concert; I don't
have the article with me, and it isn't downloadable yet from their site,
but she proposes interactions between cognitive structures, affective
modules and the immune system. Depressive illness are linked to activation
patterns that exclude or downplay sensory inputs from body and world,
schizophrenic and bipolar disorders are those where too much unselected
noise drowns out cognitive control. Something like that, in brute summary.

My personal favorite was the one in Ancient Japan, which I sadly cannot remember the

My original question (which I communicated poorly) was more specifically

cost-effectiveness of extra capacity and the capacity of the human brain

As I mentioned, I was not careful in formulating my question to Dan. So I 
was actually a bit surprised with the direction it took in the replies above 
- I was given responses quite relevant to my intial inquiry, despite that it 
had never been specifically stated.
So I guess that would make me the shy lurker. I'm new to the list (and 
admittedly a bit intimidated), taking a break from school, making big life 
changes, & considering a drastic change in my major. Any suggestions 
regarding readings, list etiquette, etc. would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

My take on this goes something like this. World War 3 was won by the 
republics against the Soviet Union, circa 1991. This is currently World War 
4, and its being fought against terrorism. Terrorism from whom? Terrorism 
from Islamic Fundamentalist Muslims. This war will take a long time, and 
victory by the USA is by no means assured. Like the Cold War before it, this 
war is ideological. What is at stake? For whatever reason, as is now being 
demonstrated with that London educated sheik, who is on the run from the 
authorities (allegedly). This fellow, along with millions of fellow Muslims 
yearn for the destruction of America and the founding of Sharia, and a new 
Muslim ascendency. 

So what to do on either side of the Atlantic? Well, like the Cold Warm, 
before it, life did not stop, either intellectually or culturally, because we 
were locked in a struggle with the Soviets. Waiting for America to 
'cool-down' is a waste of your time. The Islamic opponents (enemies) wish the 
physical destruction of this nation and will acquire nukes, gas, or 
bioweapons, to achieve this. Perhaps (I am not being sarcastic) Europe can 
and should sit this one out. Placating the Wahabbis, and their allies will do 
no good. What may come out of this is, hopefully, and accelerated move 
towards renewable resources for transportation, and electricity. This would 
end the war years quicker.

Subject: Ventus review
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I've now finished Ventus, by Karl Schroeder.  It should be widely
available in paperback in the U.S.

I enjoyed the book very much.  It was a little slow to get going;
the planet Ventus is trapped in a medieval society, and while there are
hints of deep secrets and unexplained technologies, mostly we are dealing
with horseback and swords.  However by about 1/3 of the way through the
book most of the actors are in place, and we understand the role of the
struggle on Ventus against a galactic background.  From then on I could
hardly put the book down.

The plot unfolds in a linear and logical fashion.  Schroeder avoids
the tricks so many authors use to hold the reader's interest, dropping
tantalizing hints and cutting away from characters just as something
is about to be revealed.  For the most part, when we are warned that
something interesting is about to happen, it then immediately happens.
Characters reveal their knowledge freely, as it is needed.  Although there
is are great mysteries to be solved, the reader has as much information
as any of the characters.  We learn as they do, and in the end the
resolution is very satisfying.

Schroeder's perspective is fundamentally optimistic.  Unlike so many
authors in this genre, he doesn't feel the need to kill off most of the
main characters, or to arrange a galactic holocaust.  While there is
great evil to be faced, the good guys are given a fighting chance to win.

This shows through in his galactic milieu as well.  I literally got
tears in my eyes upon learning that the population of the Solar System
is 70 trillion humans (and others), while Earth is mostly a park with few
people living there.  How many authors would have the courage to present
such a future?  And we aren't just tantalized with this description,
we get to visit these places, get a view of the wonders.

The visual imagination in the story is extraordinary.  Ventus begs to be
illustrated.  The Winds, the powerful AIs which control the terraforming
of Ventus, manifest themselves amazingly.  The Diadem Swans, energy beings
of the upper atmosphere who can reach down to the surface via nanotech
threads; the vagabond moons, gigantic aerostats with grappling hooks for
moving huge quantities of matter about the planet; the shambling morphs
which create new life forms; the desals, with their shining towers;
the variety is incredible.

I do find some weaknesses in the writing.  The characters seem a little
cold.  They are all pursuing their various missions almost robotically.
While there is growth and change for virtually everyone, there wasn't
much conflict.  Most of the time, everyone is working largely at common
purposes.  I think Schroeder could work on bringing his characters to
more vivid life.

Ultimately, the story turns on a moral question.  What is the ideal
society?  What is the best way for man to live?  Most people in galactic
society (the Archipelago) apparently live in virtual reality, linked
into the inscape, the pervasive data net.  People are happy there.
But some see it as a dead end.  The "tyranny of condescension", where
man is ruled by benevolent AI gods, has brought peace and happiness,
but is that enough?  These are serious issues for budding transhumans
to consider.

>From the Extropian perspective, I don't think Archipelago society
is ideal.  Most people don't seek to transform and improve themselves.
They want happiness, indulging in "a permanent orgy inside the computers."
But the opportunities are there for more.  At least some people transform
themselves into gods, merging with AIs or enhancing their biologies.
However I think you may have to become rich and powerful to achieve
this transformation, a difficult task in a world with so many others to
compete against.

But in many ways I do find this a plausible and basically optimistic
view of the future.  In a world where benevolent AIs prevent violence
and harm, it's likely that happiness will be enough for the majority
of people.  They won't necessarily want to become gods.  They are happy
with the opportunities open to them.  And for those few who want more,
the goal can be reached.

Overall, I strongly recommend this book for Extropians, or anyone
interested in future societies involving gods and men.  The blurbs
printed in the book compare Schroeder to Vinge, Egan and Banks among
others; while I don't think his writing is as polished as theirs, this
is a highly promising first novel.  The Archipelago and Ventus represent
new and useful models of future worlds where we might want to live.

This is an interesting idea. Certainly plenty of people get into highly
strung states when their innate drives conflict with learned morals. I'm
less certain if the big mental illnessess fit this picture. Maybe
post-traumatic stress disorder is due to a "parasitic" memory that
causes extreme arousal whenever it is re-activated, which helps it to
get re-encoded and associated with other things.

Yes. This kind of self-organising hierarchy needs some emergent
regulation to keep it suitably balanced between overly plastic or overly
rigid states, especially when it comes to learning. If this balance gets
upset, then all sorts of problems could result.

It could well be that many of the major mental illnesses are functional
illnesses; rather than having a clear physical origin they consist of a
maladaptive state of our dynamical systems. Of course, genetics,
experience and physical lesions can bring them about or facilitate them,
but in the end they could be due to "being in the wrong attractor" and
having the normally adaptive responses cause a vicious circle. Getting
out of such functional states could require some interesting
combinations of mental and chemical signals.

Indeed.  I used to borrow these books from a local library.  I believe 
Deathtrap Dungeon was my favourite.  Now was it Emerald, Diamond, Sapphire 
to escape, or Diamond...

Nice to see he's involved.

Now we're all going to cry :-)

It's not pathetic, it means that the richness, instead of being in
your environment, was in yourself.

But I wish you the happiness of being fulfilled from the outside, too,

Yeah, I know, it was actually yesterday, but on the other hand it
means that I spontaneously remembered it, instead of using a calendar.

I knew next to nothing about the man, but then I am reading "The Moral
Animal" right now which I had not read so far, and from Darwin's
letters and stuff you read in the book he really appears (to me at
least) as a very, very nice person. Sensitive, funny, intelligent,
honest, delicate.

I love the deliberative memorandum he writes when trying to decide
whether to marry or not to marry (p. 113). That's just one of many
things.

I think it is great that a scientific achievement so important in our
history, initiating a whole new view about what it is to be human (and
really the first non mythic such view) has been made by someone so
delightful (I'd like to say "sweet" but hey, that's Charles Darwin, I
cannot talk of him with such familiarity).

I have much more sympathy for this than I did a few years ago (although I am
still uneasy about the sub-Kantian idea that your "higher self" is disabled
by the habit), particularly in the light of the research Brian (I think it
was) mentioned about the sector of any population which has a genetic
sensitivity to specific substances. So simply saying "everyone do what they
want and let the chips fall where they may" shouldn't be an option. The hard
question is what is the best thing to do? As you say civil forfeiture and
other aspects of the drug war are not helping (and make things worse in many
ways). They are also creating desperately dangerous precedents and
incentives for law enforcers. Perhaps we can learn from the way alcohol
abuse was reduced in Britain, from being a widespread, very severe problem
in the 1840s and earlier to being a relatively minor problem by the 1890s,
through things like education, social pressure, regulation and the use of
fiscal policy.  I think you have to accept you can't get rid of the problem
entirely, it's a matter of getting it to an "acceptable" level. The key
calculation must be a cost/benefit analysis where you trade off the costs of
drug use (the externalities you describe) against the costs of prohibition
(such as loss of liberty, corruption of the criminal justice system, growth
of organised crime). Steve Davies

FBI: Left Wing Green Terrorists the most active terror organization in the
U.S
Report by J.J. Johnson - Sierra Times.com: 02.13.02

WASHINGTON -- Move over Al-Queda. It's now official: The Earth Liberation
Front, a left wing organization that has carried out 600 attacks since 1996
has become the largest and most active U.S.-based terrorist group, the FBI's
top domestic terrorism officer said Tuesday.
But you might see this report buried in the inside of your Wednesday fish
wrap. Kenneth Lay will get all the glory for taking the fifth in front of
Congress Tuesday. But the House Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health's
efforts to shed light on the Earth Liberation Front and it's partners in
crime, the Animal Liberation Front, were frustrated when former ELF
spokesman Craig Rosebraugh also refused to answer questions from members of
Congress. Go figure - he's got more to hide.

Remember: According to the FBI, Rosebraugh's organization has done more
damage in America than even the Enron Corporation.

"I'll take the Fifth Amendment," Rosebraugh said more than 50 times to
questions ranging from whether he helped produce an ELF terrorist training
film to who was paying for his attorney.

Rosebraugh was subpoenaed to testify by Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo.,
Chairman of the House Subcommittee.

As published here in the past at Sierra Times, Rosebraugh was the mouthpiece
for the left-wing, extremist terrorists organization. He at least admitted
relaying anonymous messages on ELF's behalf from 1997 until he quit last
September, but had no firsthand knowledge of any attacks.

Innocent Arabs are in jail for less.

Here's the price tag in the name of green worship: $43 million in more than
600 attacks since 1996 (yes, they've been busy). Their tradecraft includes
spray-painting graffiti, breaking windows, firebombing research centers and
ski resorts. $12 million alone in the Vail, Colorado attack. This all
according to FBI expert James F. Jarboe.

"They're the most active. They cause the most damage," Jarboe told the
subcommittee, but the state-sponsored news version will make sure to let you
know that white supremacist groups are still considered more dangerous
because their attacks are often aimed at people. What they won't tell you is
that no white supremacist group is listed as a 'terrorist organization' by
the FBI, and urban gang members attack more people than anyone. But keeping
statistics like those could get one labeled 'insensitive'

Nobody has been killed in an ELF or ALF attack yet, but McInnis said it is
wrong to think of the green terrorists as "nature-loving hippies" or
misguided youths. Such would be an insult to "nature-loving hippies" and
misguided youths, respectively.

"These are hardened criminals," he said. "They are dangerous, they are
well-funded, they are savvy, sophisticated and stealthy, and if their
violence continues to escalate, it is only a matter of time before their
parade of terror results in a lost human life."

When a crime happens with a firearm, some politician attempts to repeal the
right to keep and bear arms from the citizenry. Six hundred acts of
terrorism costing $43 million, and no one dares mention repealing the
Endangered Species Act, or the Antiquities Act of 1906 - the laws passed
that fuel the fire for these terrorists.

In a report the ELF and ALF issued last month, the groups admitted
responsibility for 67 illegal actions in 2001, including burning down a $5.4
million horticulture building at the University of Washington. Gutsy, huh?

In 1998, the ELF claimed responsibility for an arson attack at Vail Ski
Resort that did $12 million in damage.

Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he understands that die-hard
environmentalists are frustrated with some of the Bush administration's
policies, but eco-terrorism hurts the cause by making it harder for him and
others to promote more environmental-friendly policies. Of course, the
Democrat, Inslee is not partisan about the matter - even though the ELF's
path of destruction has been ongoing since 1996 - when Bush wasn't
president.

Rosebraugh's attorney/mouthpiece, Stuart Sugarman, said he wanted "to thank
Mr. McInnis for providing attention for this important cause," as if the
hearings were merely a way to further the cause of eco-terrorism.

Just this Monday in Phoenix, one of their fellow terror-warriors, Mark Sands
was sentenced to 18 years in prison for torching seven luxury homes under
construction as he tried to stop development near protected desert areas. He
also admitted writing letters to the media and property owners warning that
the fires would continue as long as people continued to build next to the
protected land in Phoenix and Scottsdale. One note, found April 29 said,
``You build, we burn again.''

Yes, it sounds like a rather sick solitary hobby many lonely individuals
ingage in, but it is actually a real game many on the internet play
avidly.

Googlewhacking is the sport of coming up with two words which only
result in ONE page being found by Google. I'm sure the bright minds here
should have no trouble with such a challenge...

Paltry. Look at the impact financially of Fundamentalist Islamic "guerilla 
actions". Look at the WTC, the Pentagon, the crashed airplane in 
Pennsylvania. Paltry, and chump change to boot! What is plausible is the 
eventual connection between Islam Fundies and either Leftwing or Rightwing 
creepoids. Why not? If there is money to be had, and the Middle Easterners 
are willing to give Jimmy Bob some plastique, or Tammy Tree-Hugger a bunch of 
tear gas.....fill in the blanks. Al Qeida is reported to be looking for non 
Middle Easterners to further its goals in the US. A match made in Dachau, if 
you ask me, a natural.

This is directed primarily at our resident dust bunny, Amara Graps, but
anyone is free to comment, of course.

Question: Given that Hubble can view the dust disks around other star
systems, and do spectral analyses of same, would it be possible to
detect alien technological civilizations by differences in natural and
artificially produced space dust in such star systems? If someone in
another star system looked at our solar system with their own Hubble
type telescope, could they detect our presence by human produced space
dust?

Dear Extropes,

Carnevale in Venice, Italy finished last Sunday. The most visible
aspect was ~70,000 people (one-third of normal years, tho) flocking
towards Piazza San Marco, while a few hundred locals and foreigners
preened and exhibited themselves for the tourists' cameras. Noone
knew who were these few hundred exhibiting creatures because the
elaborate costumes masked the humans inside. That was the original
intent of Carnevale after all: intrigue, mystery, and fun, while you
danced, gambled and lewdly frolic'd, anonymously.

These days the outward show of Carnevale remains, but much more
sedately, while the real Venice continues underneath the surface.
The real Venice is between the cracks, in the canals, on the
opposite faces of the palaces on the Grand Canal, in the gondolas,
hanging from a clothesline stretched between two buildings, colored
decaying pinks, greens, and browns. There, you hear a different
rhymthm, smell the frowst of the sea, and become lost in the
fog-shrouded labrynth of narrow alleys and walking bridges.

(Here I think shows the Real Venice)
http://www.ArchitectureWeek.com/cgi-bin/awimage?dir=2001/0815&article=building_1
-2.html&image=11504_image_4.jpg

Venice is built on a series of swampy islands at the edge of the
Adriatic Sea
http://www.geographical.co.uk/maps/factfiles/venice.html
with man's ingenuity driving its development. Townfolk fled to the
Lagoon in the fifth century for refuge from barbarian attackers, and
remained there when they discovered that their refuge could supply
fish and salt. The Venetian builders evolved construction techniques
unique and customized to the swampy terrain. Into the compacted clay
and sand of the swamp, timber pinewood piles were driven, which
didn't rot, because there was no free oxygen available for microbes
in the closely-packed piles. On top of that, was a layer of bricks,
then another layer of marble, to create a damp-proof foundation for
the houses and palaces. With that as the foundation, the city was not
built entirely from scratch, but was also constructed from remnants
of ruined cities. Roman bricks were taken from villas on the
mainland, and arches and statues were taken from churches and
palaces. Venice also raided Byzantium for material to adorn its
facades.

=========
Venice's relation to its embedded water level have not remained
stable however. It has sunk by about 7.5cm a century for the past
1,000 years, and the rate is speeding up. It is both sinking, and
the water level is rising. The mean level of the land has lowered by
9 inches (23 centimeters) relative to sea level. At the same time,
the tidal level has increased by some 3 inches (8 centimeters) for
several reasons, including organic structure growth on the barrier
reef in the lagoon basin and changes in atmospheric pressure and
wind action on the Adriatic Sea.

Plans to hold back the tides.

Saving Venice
http://www.ArchitectureWeek.com/2001/0815/building_1-1.html
=========

The rhythm of the real Venice can best be experienced from the
gondola, a boat unique to Venice.
http://www.venetia.it/boats/gondola.jpg

The shape of Venice is reflected in the shape of the gondola, and
the boat's evolution reflected the growth of the city, as well.
http://www.venetia.it/boats/gond_eng.htm
http://www.squero.com/historyofthegondola.htm

The gondola is greater than 11 m long, it weighs about 400 kg, it is
built using (at least) nine different types of wood (beech, cherry,
elm, fir, larch, lime, mahogany, oak, walnut), and the degree of
curvature is based on the weight of the gondolier. It is shaped
asymmetrically, with a flat bottom that is tilted with respect to
the water:
http://www.gondolavenezia.it/storia.asp?Pag=6
http://www.squero.com/howaregondolasmade.htm
The asymmetrical shape counteracts the force of the oar, otherwise
the oaring on the right side would make the boat go around in
circles! Originally they were colored black because of the tar to
make them watertight, but then people started decorating them and
they became more and more ornate. Then in 1562, such displays of
wealth were banned, and black remained the standard color again.

In addition to the flatbottom-tilt, the boat reflects more features
of Venice. The rostrum in the front of a gondola ('ferro de prua')
http://www.venetia.it/boats/piafero.jpg
has the shape of Doge's hat, six fingers for the six districts of
Venice ('sestieri'), one finger in the opposite direction (the
'Giudecca' island). Another piece of the boat, the rowlock ('forcola'),
http://www.squero.com/forcola.jpg
can hold the oar in (at least) five different positions. It's a piece
of art.

=========
Man, scaled, is reflected in a macrocosmic state in Venice. The
Renaissance was triggered, in part, by a revival of Greek ideas. As
the Greeks often designed their buildings based on the proportions
of one part of the human body to another, so did the Italian
humanists. The Renaissance artists didn't want to just recreate
again, what the Greeks accomplished. Instead, the Renaissance people
wanted to build on those ancient ideas and then take those ideas
further into new directions. Leonardo da Vinci ('Leonardo from
Vinci') accomplished exactly that, with his Vitruvian Man.

http://banzai.msi.umn.edu/leonardo/vinci/vitruvian.jpg
Vitruvian Man, Study of proportions, from
Vitruvius's De Architectura 1492
Pen and ink, 34.3 x 24.5 cm
Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice

Leonardo was inspired by Vitruvius, De Architectura, and created a
drawing that provided a key link between ancient Greek architecture
and his time. This simple figure became a symbol for the Renaissance
and western civilization, so much so, that it is now on the backside
of the Italian 1Euro coin.

Vitruvius, De Architectural:
THE PLANNING OF TEMPLES

http://www.aiwaz.net/Leonardo/index.htm
{begin quote}
1. The  planning of temples depends upon asymmetry: and  the method
of  this architects must diligently apprehend.  It  arises  from
proportion  (which in Greek  is called analogia). [...] For without
symmetry  and  proportion no  temple  can  have  a regular  plan;
that  is,  it  must  have an exact proportion  worked  out after
the  fashion  of the members of  a  finely-shaped human  body.
2. For Nature has  so planned the human body that the face from the
chin to  the top of  the forehead and the roots of the hair is a
tenth part; also the palm of the  hand from the  wrist to the  top
of the middle finger  is as much;  the head from  the chin to the
crown,  an eighth part;  from the top of the breast with  the bottom
 of the  neck to the  roots of the hair,  a sixth part;  from the
middle of the breast to the crown, a fourth  part; a  third part of
the height of  the face is from  the bottom of the chin to  the
bottom of  the nostrils; the nose from the bottom  of  the nostrils
to  the line  between the brows, as much;  from that line to the
roots of the hair, the forehead  is given as the third part. The
foot  is  a sixth  of the height of  the body; the cubit  a quarter
, the breast  also  a quarter. [...] 3. In  like  fashion the
members  of  temples ought  to  have dimensions of their  several
parts  answering  suitably  to  the general sum of their whole
magnitude. Now the navel is naturally the exact centre of the body.
For if a man lies on his back with hands and feet outspread, and the
centre  of a circle is placed on his navel, his  figure   and  toes
will  be  touched  by  the circumference.   Also   a   square  will
be  found described within the figure, in the  same way as a round
figure is  produced. For if  we measure from the  sole of the  foot
to the top  of the head, and apply  the measure  to the
outstretched hands, the breadth will be  found equal  to the
height, just like sites  which are squared by rule.

Leonardo, as he is almost always called, was trained to be a
painter. But his interests and achievements spread into an
astonishing variety of fields that are now considered scientific
specialties. Leonardo studied anatomy, astronomy, botany, geology,
geometry, and optics, and he designed machines and drew plans for
hundreds of inventions. Because Leonardo excelled in such an amazing
number of areas of human knowledge, he is often called a universal
genius. However, he had little interest in literature, history, or
religion. He formulated a few scientific laws, but he never
developed his ideas systematically. Leonardo was most of all an
excellent observer. He concerned himself with what the eye could
see, rather than with purely abstract concepts.

Now, a little story for you from  the above site 'Wierdo Leonardo'.

_Leonardo and Michelangelo_

There was said to be some animosity between these two artists.
Michelangelo is reported to have said of Leonardo that "He cannot
create, only imagine."

This anecdote was told by the writer known as Anonimo
Magliabecchiano about an incident in 1503: "One day, Leonardo,
strolling in the company of Giovanni di Gavina de Santa Trinita,
walked past the benches of the Spini Palace, where a group of
gentlemen where discussing a passage from Dante.  They called to
da Vinci and begged him to explain it to them.  At that moment,
Michelangelo also happened to pass, and Leonardo told them:
'Michelangelo will explain it to you.'  Michelangelo answered
angrily, thinking that Leonardo was making fun of him: 'Explain it
yourself, you who made a design for a horse to be cast in bronze
and, unable to cast it, abandoned it, to your shame.' Leonardo
remained silent and blushed.  To embarass him more, Michelangelo
called after him: 'And those Milanese idiots believed you!'"

Nothing new, Dr Drexler, same old same old:
============================
After Kardama Muni married Devahuti, he decided at a certain point to take
her on a tour of the universe.
 To do this, he manifested an aerial mansion (called, as usual, a vimdna)
that was lavishly equipped as a
    pleasure palace. Here the sage Maitreya relates the story of this
mansion to his disciple Vidura: 

 Maitreya continued: O Vidura, seeking to please his beloved wife, the sage
Kardama exercised his yogic
          power and instantly produced an aerial mansion that could travel
at his will. 

 It was a wonderful structure, bedecked with all sorts of jewels, adorned
with pillars of precious stones,
 and capable of yielding whatever one desired. It was equipped with every
form of furniture and wealth,
                   which tended to increase in the course of time.... 

    With the choicest rubies set in its diamond walls, it appeared as
though possessed of eyes. It was
            furnished with wonderful canopies and greatly valuable gates of
gold. 

  Here and there in that palace were multitudes of live swans and pigeons,
as well as artificial swans and
  pigeons so lifelike that the real swans rose above them again and again,
thinking them live birds like
             themselves. Thus the palace vibrated with the sounds of these
birds. 

 The castle had pleasure grounds, resting chambers, bedrooms and inner and
outer yards designed with an
             eye to comfort. All this caused astonishment to the sage
himself.33

Iridium Satellite, LLC, the new owner of the Iridium communications
constellation of satellites, has just launched 5 new spare satellites on
a Boeing Delta 2 rocket, and will be launching another 2 spares in June
on a Russian booster, bringing its fleet of spares up to 14, above the
60 operational satellites. Iridium Satellite reports that its satellites
endurance and performance are exceeding design specs by wide margins,
greatly reducing the need to replace operational satellites. Its current
fleet is expected to service it growing number of customers until at
least 2010.

The US Govt, IS's prime customer, is expected to extend its current $72
million contract for service to the year 2007, making its value over
$252 million.

This is the 101st Delta 2 launch and the 290th launch of any Delta
rocket since it entered service in 1960.

I agree, almost everybody seems to have liked the man personally, even those
who hated his theories. However there doesn't seem to be any relationship
between friendliness and intelligence because the other great genius the
human race has produced, Isaac Newton, was as unpleasant a man as
you could find. If it wasn't for his boiling water IQ (Fahrenheit of course)
nobody would want anything to do with him. Darwin on the other hand
would be fun to be with even if you took away his genius.

My favorite nonscientific Darwin quotation comes from his autobiography.

        "Disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate but at last was
         complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have
         never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion
         was correct. I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish
         Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text
         seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would
         include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be
         everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine."

The first edition of the Autobiography published in 1896  just 6 months after
Darwin's death did not include the quotation, due to the insistence of his
very religious wife Emma. Her letter to the publisher written in her own hand
survives, she wrote:

 "I should dislike the passages in brackets to be published. It seems to me raw.
  Nothing can be said too severe upon the doctrine of everlasting punishment for
  disbelief- but very few wd call that  Christianity."

I think she was being overgenerous, even today lots of people would call that
Christianity. Anyway, after Emma's death in 1896 the passage  was restored
to the book.

Now a quasi-algorithmical solution. First type

  "rare words"

in Google, and push "I'm feeling lucky". Click a random letter (Q),
and pick a word on the list ("qualtagh"). Feed it back to Google and
feel lucky again. Now take a quick look around the page and find a
rare and unrelated word. I found "perambulating". Back to Google with

  qualtagh perambulating

Bingo. :-)

Regarding my statement: "The government has spent thirty years and 
millions of dollars looking for evidence to support its 
"cyclist-inferiority" hypothesis on which practically all of its bicycle 
transportation program is based," Jim Lund replied: "I didn't realize that 
a US federal 'bicycle transportation program' existed, and can't guess what 
it is.  I just ride my bike..."

         The federal government has an official bicycle transportation 
policy. Its official goals are to double the number of trips made by 
bicycle while reducing the number of accidents by 10%. Whoever wrote this 
did not realize that this meant that the accident rate per trip had to be 
only 55% of its original value, a reduction of 45% in the accident rate, a 
fantastic achievement if it could be achieved.

         The method adopted to achieve these goals is building bikeways 
everywhere. The casual thinker concludes that this is a good thing; 
separating bikes from cars means that there won't be any accidents, or at 
most very few. Consider the following facts. Bikeways are intended to 
protect cyclists from same-direction motor traffic. Car-bike collisions [to 
use a short phrase] constitute only about 12% of accidents to cyclists. 
Under urban daylight conditions, only about 2% of car-bike collisions are 
of the straight-ahead motorist, straight-ahead cyclist type. About 95% of 
urban, daylight car-bike collisions involve turning or crossing movements. 
On any urban journey from A to B, the cyclist has to cross all the traffic 
traveling through the gap between A and B. As long as all traffic is on one 
level, say ground level, it doesn't matter at all what kind of bikeway the 
cyclist uses; he still has to cross over that traffic. Bikeways do not 
provide any protection against that traffic. Indeed, midblock road 
crossings of bike paths are more dangerous than crossing the road at normal 
intersections. Bikeways alongside the roadway, which is the only generally 
available urban space, require both cyclist and motorist, when either is 
turning, to operate contrary to the normal operating procedures, in ways 
that require much greater care and much more time to ascertain whether or 
not the movement can be made in safety. In short, the government's bikeway 
program hasn't a hope in hell of reducing accidents to cyclists, and is 
more likely to increase the accident rate than decrease it.

         The bikeway program was originally cooked up by motorists to clear 
the roads of bicycle traffic, thus avoiding both delays to motorists and 
the concern that they would have to look out for bicycles. Of course, that 
motive wouldn't be politically acceptable, so it was sold as "bike safety", 
without any analysis of its actual probable results. Motorists had also 
cooked up the similar "bike safety" training for children, teaching them 
that the greatest sin is to get in the way of a car, and the wages of sin 
is death. So we have a population of people who are ignorant of cycling but 
who believe, with quasi-religious fervor, that bikeways must make cycling 
safe for untrained bicycle riders. If that were all, the bikeway program 
would have been beaten decades ago. Now the environmentalists [a name 
encompassing several viewpoints] jump on the bandwagon and make it really 
popular. These environmentalists hate and fear motoring. So what do they 
do? They apply all of their effort to advocating the program that the 
motorists had cooked up for their own convenience, the bikeway program, in 
the belief that the mass of the population is so frightened of motor 
traffic that they will bicycle only if bikeways are provided to relieve 
their fear, and the corresponding belief that masses of people will 
transfer from motoring to bicycling if only their fear is relieved.

         In fact, those cyclists who obey the rules of the road for drivers 
of vehicles have a much lower accident rate than those who don't (cycling 
club members, more likely to operate in the vehicular manner, have an 
accident rate only about 25% of that for the general population), and find 
themselves able to take direct, fast routes for all the trips that they 
desire. With more convenience and lower accident rate, one would expect 
that the proper governmental policy would be to promote the kind of cycling 
that best combines convenience and safety, in the belief that that would 
attract the optimum amount of bicycle transportation. Instead, governmental 
practice discourages that kind of cycling; we have to fight every year  to 
maintain our rights to operate in the lawfully required, safe and 
convenient manner.

Actually, the true impact of luddite terrorism is not found in the
actual physical damages. The true economic impact is in the future,
where the benefits of GMO crops and farm animals may or may not be
realized because of the terror tactics of the arcadian romantics. In
this respect, the true future cost is in the trillions of dollars.

Actually there is a simple technology which the AIs can exploit to
guide every facet of human society, arranging people's lives, guiding
their meetings and encounters.  This is the key to the pervasive yet
nearly invisible control which keeps the entire human world running
smoothly.

They control the traffic lights.

  It let me make it an article with the news because there was discovery that
  it wasn't transmitted though it had resistance to take up this event which
  many victims were taken out to. 
  ?? sacrifice ? part ?? mercy ?? image ? ridge ??? aircraft ?? back ?? 
object

  ? black ? smoke ? ridge ?? the sky ?? a moment 
      It is at the back from the building, and has considerable size, and it
  seems that the object is moved at a far faster speed than the aircraft at
  the back of the oblique right. 

  Though it seems to be ? that it is slender, a missile, too, when it has a
  look, as for fire ??, it can't think of ?? missile at this moment, and a
  fact isn't transmitted, either. 
  It has the possibility which is more than one object from seeing some lumps

  when it tries to expand (However, even if it is a missile, it feels too
  fast.), too. 

  But there was one fear ? ?? which might be a possibly serious image ?. 
  It is that this object isn't reflected by other images. 

  How should I interpret this? 
  object is small, and it is the thing which passed through the neighborhood
  of the camera. 
    Actually, the object moved at high speed is the supposition which is

  intuitively easy to accept from the experience near here. 
    But, how it is seen, it seems that an object appears from behind the
  building as for the image. 
  object is huge, and it is splashing through the place to leave a building. 

    It cannot but think like this if it is a fact to appear from behind the
  building. 
    But, the proof that it is proved is necessary. ?? then, ?? The second
  image existed. 

  Only one could be found when the thing this object was reflected ? the
  second collision image introduced to the public abundantly ? was looked for
  ? the ? second image ? ?. 
  An image catches an aircraft from the right, and it is moved and takes a

  moment to collide No.2 to the ridge. 
  <An aircraft approaches with this image just before the building.> ? a
  (yellow mark) ? goes to the building, and it is understood that there is an
  object (a red mark) to stand on the way in the air when it flies. 

  An object goes out from the sight because a camera is moved to the left
  after this. 
  But, that back, ??    Even the about size of the body almost approaches the
  aircraft that the right is four times expansion of the object ? the object

  which approaches it suddenly ? ? a (yellow mark) ? just before the building.

  It collides with the building from there, and a body disappears completely
  into the building. 
  The object (a red mark) which appeared from the right end of the image

  almost approaches with the body of 767 right after the building ? the
  aircraft ? ? the distance ? while it is moved because it is 48m. 
  Objects are the characteristics that 4 times were common to the object of
  the 1st image by 2-3 lump-shaped from the expansion image. 

  It is composed of more than one object. 
    An object passes through the side which an explosion spreads out in No.2
  in the ridge. 
  You may seem to presume both timing and a movement direction the same object

  from corresponding to the object of the first image. 
  It was probably caught around the third frame and the fourth frame from the
  top by ???? of the first image. 
  The movement of this object is very special. 

  It flies in super-high speed to wave in top and bottom. 
  Keep it by all the frame ?GIF animate cartoons 388KB a path all frames <An
  actual image ? is high speed beyond the double of the GIF animate cartoon.>
  ???????? ? right click, and see it. 

  It is made "??" in the first image, by the second image, this, with the "You
  must not be here." object 
  It is made to believe a certain thing. 
  As for this, a difficult image might be introduced to the public. 

  The image of the UFO which approaches a helicopter suddenly from the world
  trade center where it is caught in ? It is ?? from that image. ? July, 2000.

  It feels agreement in the appearance event of this UFO and the terrorism
  event. 

  It is very near the appearance position of the UFO and the collision
  position of the aircraft. 
  It thought suddenly, and a shock was received personally though the image of
  the color edition of the "UFO image that the helicopter" that Mr./Ms. the

  indication of ????? ?? was being analyzed is approached suddenly was
  reviewed. 
  In that film, in the ..... beginning, UFO, though it comes to the sight from
  behind WTC, ..... like around the place an airplane is thought to rush in

  the case of the simultaneous American frequent occurrence terrorism of the
  other day. 
  Moreover, a UFO approaches it suddenly after that, and ? is minded, and it
  seems to give it a ? feeling, too. 

  What does this mean? 
  It thinks certainly too much, ??????. 
  It felt a terrible thing because it was just recently that it was introduced
  to the public though nothing could be said because it didn't know this ?

  which film ?. 
    When it tries to verify an image there, the position of the ?? UFO of the
  ridge (the one with the antenna) is a little on the black zone No.1. 
  Though a collision position to the ridge is very the top from this, it

  passes behind the ridge No.1, and the position of the aircraft which
  collided No.2 to the ridge is the same as the altitude which a UFO was ?????
  ?? No.1. 
     Preparation for the terrorism has been begun with the information that

  the man presumed executive ? has gone to American pilot school since about
  July, 2000 being since this time. 
  Then, as for the UFO which raised warning, it is ?? that it was being
  watched ? the world trade center from the day ?.

If the design is to view one "page" or window screen at a time, then the
options are:
- Resize the viewport (aka window) to fit the last window (aka "partial
page") of rendered text.
- Using a book metaphor, show "page" delimiters like horizontal lines to
delineate, like MSWord Normal Layout View
- Render pages with blank spaces to fit the viewport a la Adobe Acrobat
viewer or MSWord Page Layout View

If the design wants to reduce eye movement, then the text should scroll by.
The brain can track moving text much easier than discrete jumps.

If you, the human, want to reduce eye movement, then scroll one line at a
time instead of a whole page at a time. In fact, if you scroll fast enough,
you can actually increase your (sub-vocal) reading speed.

Other speed-reading techniques involve reading larger chunks of text like a
whole page at a time, so then you need to get a browser that scrolls instead
of refreshes. Most versions of Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer has a
smooth scrolling toggle somewhere. I don't know how to tweak the speed or
anything like that though.

In Windows, if you have a three-button mouse you can configure the driver to
enable both horizontal and vertical scrolling with variable speed. There's
also the mouse-wheel for vertical scrolling as well. For this issue, I think
it is the best solution if you are running Windows and have a three-button
mouse.


The key to fast reading of screen-rendered text is in the scrolling. A
"page" at a time is far too much for our meager visual cortex to handle.
Other speed-reading techniques require more motor control, such as your
hands, applied to a more manageable 3-D object such as a book.


cheers,
    Simon

Very funny!!  And will these be "friendly" AI? lol  Actually, chesire morgan and I will be using our traffic light changing psi/magickal powers to rebel against the AI tyranny!!  And we will train others, who in turn will also train others!

In the meantime, Brian Williams will use his electrical/computing scientific skills in this great rebellion, but to much greater effect!  :  )

Of course any post of a googlewhacked pair to an archived mailing list
such as this one will ruin it as soon as Google reindexes the list
archive, for then the archived message will be a hit as well.

By the same token you can create self-referential googlewhacks by posting
any pair of words which gets 0 hits; then once the message gets indexed
it will point at itself.

Yes, I was the one who mentioned this work. The figure (for
alcohol) is 10% of the general population of the United States.
Specific cultural groups have much higher percentages, older
cultures like the middle east (alcohol is a muslim word) have lower
percentages and modern world cultures (native Americans for
example) have much higher.

I would expect other addictive substances to have similar numbers.

Evolution at work.

Excellent points, and education and real knowledge rather than
folklore is the key.

Alcohol is an addictive substance that affects different people
differently. If you were fortunate (pre-GATTACA) enough to be born
with the right biochemistry you couldn't get addicted if you tried,
if you were unfortunate you could become addicted almost
immediately.

Most people lie somewhere in between. Strangely it is those who
alcohol seems to affect the least who are actually those at
greatest risk. Many people drink for decades before becoming
addicted.

Until a cure is developed,(good extropian project) education and
acceptance as to the indicators and causes of alcohol addiction is
the best method for successful treatment.

All evidence indicates that once addicted, lifelong abstinence is
the only currently effective treatment.

     This was exactly my thought when I first saw the helecopter film. I have 
been trying to confirm the exact position of the UFO in conjuction with the 
north tower.
       Rumours have already started about this link with the position and the 
obvious ensuing conspiracy theories are emerging.
       Currently im happy that the impact/ufo footage shows nothing more than 
a fly. As for the 2000 film ?. very impressive.
here's the link again. <A HREF="http://www.scifi.com/happens/happens_1_big.mov">http://www.scifi.com/happens/happens_1_big.mov</A>

These two Cryonet posts tell of The Door Into Summer for-profit company which looks to be extremely promising.  I do wonder how their suspension protocols will compare to Alcor.  

Between the Timeship and now this project, Saul Kent and Bill Faloon are really making a mark on cryonics.  Of course, they have been for years the biggest patrons of the movement.

best wishes,

John

TDIS Comments (Sent to Cryonet and CI directors)

Thanks to Saul Kent, Bill Faloon, and David Shumaker for the operating 
plan/budget for The Door Into Summer project (TDIS). As I read it, some of 
the elements include the following.

TDIS will be a for-profit company which will, among other things, perform 
"suspensions" or freezings or vitrifications (both whole-body and neuro) for 
members of cryonics organizations, who will then be stored long term at those 
organizations. 

It will also provide equipment and guidelines for cryonics organizations to 
do the suspensions themselves, using TDIS technology on a fee/license basis. 

The first phase of operation is estimated to take about a year, and will 
develop and demonstrate a capability to do cryopreservation with 
vitrification.

Initial operating cost (overhead) will be roughly $600,000 per year. Pricing 
will be a compromise between cost and affordability. Meeting costs will 
depend on expanding demand or/and generating revenues or supporting funds 
from "originators, investors, or cryonics organizations" or/and other 
activities.  

Price for a vitrification cryopreservation performed by TDIS in Florida, 
exclusive of transportation costs and the charges of the cryonics 
organization providing the long term storage, will be around $40,000 for 
either neuro or whole body. If this holds up, it would mean that the cost to 
a CI member of whole body preparation by TDIS followed by storage at CI would 
be around $70,000 plus transportation.

TDIS Board of Directors will consist of William Faloon, Mike Darwin, Saul 
Kent, CEO (David Shumaker?), and three independent outside directors.

If I have misread any of this, no doubt someone will correct me.

Again, thanks to those involved and best wishes for the Florida meeting 
Saturday, at which I expect a few of our people will attend.

        You haven't misread anything in the plan/budget, but it's important
to 
note that the plan is an initial proposal and that the details of the
company may 
differ in various respects from what's in the plan. The meetings we have in
Florida 
will play a role in determining these details.  That's why it's important
for those who 
are interested in the venture to attend these meetings. A reminder. The
formal 
meeting is at the Life Extension Building, 1100 W. Commercial Blvd. in Ft.
Lauderdale at 2 pm on Feb. 16.  This will be followed by a buffet dinner at
a
condominium on the beach in Ft. Lauderdale (directions will be given at the
meeting).  There will also be informal meetings on Feb. 14 and 15.

Yes, except that with http://www.extropy.org/robots.txt stating
"Disallow: /exi-lists/" and the just-relocated Javien archive not
linked to from anywhere (link:www.javien.com/forum at altavista gives
0 match), no-one knows when indexation will actually occur.

I don't think manual scrolling is compatible with fast, effortless
reading. All moving of the text brings effort to the brain (mine at
least). It is not the moving of the eye which is an effort, the effort
is not muscular, it is computational.

Automatic scrolling is even worse, as the speed at which you read must
of course adapt to what you're reading. When you get to the middle of
a paragraph and you got the idea and you predict that nothing will be
added in the rest, you go to the next paragraph.

You need the page to stand still if you are to move fast and
comfortably.

I suspect that the automatic scrolling thing is adapted to people for
whom reading means reading aloud without the sound and listening to
the sounds they don't make with their inner ear :-)

Funn(nnnn)ily, reading is one of those things which is actually not
taught. Children are taught to read aloud, and then left to figure out
how to read for themselves. Some find good ways to do it, other don't.
Among the latter, some only learn to switch off the sound. Some
stumble later on a "fast reading" book. It's all left to improvisation
and chance.

That's how teaching now "works" : you test children again and again,
until they figure out a way to pass the test ; you actually never
teach them THAT, and some never learn. The only thing that should be
taught is left to complete improvisation, and that accounts for huge
differences between individuals, because some find great tricks and
meta-tricks with which the readily build feats of cognition, and some
are stuck with unefficient tricks.

A teacher should model his pupil's mind and actually help it to build
itself further. He should suggest useful tricks for the pupil to try,
adopt and combine.

Not true; it depends how you implement them. In the UK, bikeways are being
built by turning over former single-track railways -- closed during the
early 1960's and otherwise unused -- into dedicated cycle roads. This
provides a network that is (a) flat,  (b) segregated from traffic, and
(c) equipped with bridges and tunnels to keep it away from the traffic,
except at designated intersections.

Again, Holland has a different approach. If you visit Amsterdam you'll
see that roads are actually quite complex -- there are public transport/-
emergency/tram lanes, car lanes, cycle lanes, and pedestrian sidewalks.
Interestingly, the traffic signals integrate all of these, so that 
bicycles are expected to obey stop signs on the cycle lanes -- but in
return, are guaranteed a traffic-free crossing.

Caveat: of course the US government may be applying 'Not Invented Here'
to all the cool ideas other countries have come up with for ensuring that
cycle networks don't result in carnage -- but on the other hand, the
quoted figures don't reflect what can be achieved using a properly
designed network.

My take on this goes something like this. World War 3 was won by the

4, and its being fought against terrorism. Terrorism from whom? Terrorism
from Islamic Fundamentalist Muslims. This war will take a long time, and

war is ideological. What is at stake? For whatever reason, as is now being

yearn for the destruction of America and the founding of Sharia, and a new
Muslim ascendency. >>>

  This comment brings something to mind that I read and found amusing.
(loosely paraphrased) (back in a science fiction tome found in a school
library lo these many years ago)
  World War 1 was a war where the chemists showed their mettle.
(Chemical weapons etc.).
  World War 2 was of course the war of the physicists. Nuke nuke nuke.
 The suggestion was made that World War 3 would be the war of
the biologists...
  and World War 4 would be the War of the psychologists.
  I wonder if this is out of order ? :)

   I'll take WW1 as a chemist's war, and WW2 as a physicist's war,
but WW3 (the Cold War) I rather thought THAT was a psychologist's
war. A war of propaganda, maneuver, bluff etc. This War on terrorism
is perhaps the "fighting of the last war" with the weapons (mass media,
mob psychology etc.) we developed in the Last Big One.
It's working marvelously.
 Everyone
assumed we would be using the weapons of the Last Big One to
prosecute the Cold War, but we didn't, not exactly. More of
a War via marketing to muster the economic clout to outlast
socialism (at least in it's extreme form).
  Assume that the chem-phys-psych-bio progression is essentially
sound. What sort of war would WW4 be?
  Who are the likely enemies?....
   It's 1920.. where is the Evil Axis?

Actually, there's one more thing involved.

Once you've found the two words which together give 1 hit,
you test each word individually.

Your score is the multiple of the number of occurances of
each word.

It was the end of the First World War aka The Seventy-Five Years War

The World War was merely an interruption in and diversion from the far

It made so much sense that I didn't bother to reply. :-)

If you control the physical network topology you can improve the
routing dramatically, of course. The internet is anarchy, and the
it's routing is designed and implemented chaotically. It still manages
to function fairly well at 50% utilization, so my argument stands.

We all know that we can get from 50% to not more than 90% with clever
routing, so routing is not an interesting accelerator. To become more
efficient, we need to employ tricks like caching and task migration
that minimize the need for bandwidth. Again, this mostly requires the
net to be under more centralized control.

I'm attracted to the Internet as an analogy for emergent behavior
precisely because of its decentralized control. The Internet is a
collection independent networks that use frightenly informal agreements
about how to route traffic. They base these agreements on poorly
specified protocols that are loosely documented by an informal
organization known as the IETF. Each of the networks is cobbled together
from routers from vendors that don't particularly like each other.
networks frequently use multi-layer "overlay" techniques such as IP
over ATM wherein the layers react to each other in unforeseen ways.
This entire mess manages to provide good service to most of the users
most of the time while growing at a phenomenal rate. The growth of the
internet is not constrained by this chaos. It is constrained by the
"last mile." The last mile is provided by entities (mostly telephone
companies) that adhere to a more structure, controlled, and centralized
model.

How does this relate to progress in AI? Well I hope it demonstrated that
there is no need for central planning. Instead, the Internet is the most
most complex, expensive, biggest, and fastest growing entity humanity
has ever created, and we did it by accident and without central control

WW3 was a contest of mass mediocrity versus exceptional excellence,
stick versus carrot.

WW4 is the final contest between reason and faith. As the side of
reason, we are at an automatic disadvantage in that most of us are not
so convinced of ourselves that we would be willing to do anything to
win. Those on the side of faith are so convinced of themselves. 

At its core, all world wars have been over which is superior: lies
versus truth. First you had the imperialism lie versus the human liberty
truth, second you had the racism lie versus the humanism truth, thirdly
you had the socialism lie versus the free market truth, and finally you
have the lie of religion versus the truth of reason, science, and
technology.

Countries would not go to war against each other if one side or the
other were not lying about their point of view.

In this faith versus reason war, you have various faiths: in god, in
power, in a romantic vision of some arcadian or andelusian period, a
golden age in the past. This is true whether you are talking about
fundamentalist muslims, christian fundamentalists, or fanatical
eco-terrorists and anti-tech luddites. All of these seek to impose some
great lie on the world, and to stamp out the voice of reason which
illuminates the emptiness of their lies.

A weakness of the cause of reason is that we are portrayed as the
criminals against humanity, producing genetically engineered organisms
that are released to the environment, portrayed by the luddites as
bioweapons. The fact that this is a lie is of no consequence for those
prepared to believe such a lie and repeat it often. This will be a
largely propagandistic war. As such, eliminating the sources of enemy
propaganda are of paramount importance, as is countering it with truth,
exposing the lies for what they are, and convincing those who believe in
them otherwise.

Infiltration is also of importance. In WW3, one of the most important
operations of the war was the placement of one of the top western
members of the ComIntern as a double agent for the FBI. Unbeknownst to
the rest of the world, the FBI was aware of the millions of dollars
funnelled to agents in the US through the US Communist Party, and their
agent even sat in on Politburo meetings in Moscow, and was held in high
esteem by the Kremlin when he predicted that Nixon would leave office
over Watergate.

In WWII we had similar moles in Berlin, and most Nazi agents were caught
and turned to act as double agents, such as the famous 'Garbo' who
helped deceive Hitler about the D-Day invasion. We also had Alan
Turing's cracking of the enigma codes used by German military units.

In this respect, we too should focus on placing infiltrators into
various groups of the opposition, being patient about their movement up
the chain of command and supporting their work all the way. We need to
develop quantum computation to crack the encrypted communications of the
opposition (the luddites and anti-globalists love PGP, btw) and tools to
sniff out their packet traffic on the web.

The opposition is not an organized government. It is not necessary to
leave the job of combatting them to governments.

Sorry, I'm not Amara Graps, but I hope I will suffice. That sounds like an
interesting theory, but I have a few questions. Is there even enough
artificial space dust for anyone to detect? I know that planets are
determined to exist in a solar system, not because we can view them
directly, but because they exert a detectable gravitational force on their
sun. If we cannot even see a planet directly, how would we detect space
dust? I am not by any means an expert on the subject, so if I am incorrect
in my assumptions here, please correct me.

Did anyone else have trouble accessing the link provided by Sean Williams? I
encountered an error.

On a side note, Googlewhacking is surprisingly fun.

What have you got against the Spanish and their horses, anyway?

I like the idea that this really means `the period without delusions'.

I suspect you really meant `antediluvian'.

As described in the Akkadian texts. :)

A query - I want to validate something that I used in some lyrics.

Is it possible (in an entirely extreme, SI-complete context) to wrap a dyson
sphere (or layers of computronium, etc) around a black hole, instead of a
star? By pouring matter into it (or via some other mechanism???), would one
get capturable energy? Is this scenario useful, or would it be a dumb thing
to do?

After reading these articles, I'm convinced that artificial intelligence 
will sneak up on us from behind.  While AI labs labor away at trying to 
create top-down or bottom-up AI, PC and network OS manufacturers will 
unwittingly give rise to it by gradually making the everyday computer OS 
ever more robust (widely distributed, self-optimising, self-diagnostic and 
self-repairable).

While the networkable OS may not be conscious, who cares?  As long as it can 
perform as well (or better?) than the sentient Jupiter Brain some here are 
expecting.

Apropos of these images, I strongly recommend 'Death in Venice',
by Thomas Mann (1912), and the movie Luchino Visconti took
from that novel (1971).

Sounds entirely doable. Dyson shells (the ones composed of independently
orbiting pieces) are held in place by gravity, and will be in free fall.
So if you build it with a reasonable radius, tidal forces will not be
too problematic. Rigid dyson shells on the other hand likely require
unobtainum-like substances to build and need to be kept stable using
active controls.

As for energy production, it seems likely it would work to drop stuff
into the hole and use radiated gamma rays. A small hole would radiate
intense Hawking radiation, and if kept stable by adding enough matter to
keep it from evaporating it would be a small and handy reactor. Rotating
holes can have their angular momentum extracted using the Penrose
process, although for this you don't need a Dyson. 

I think having small black holes inside mini-dysons is a good way of
producing energy, and doable (in the sense "the laws of physics doesn't
forbid it").

Mike, please look at your discussion style. I almost never respond
or read your posts on this list, because I don't like your discussion
style, in addition to rarely agreeing with your words. I really don't
think that it's necessary for me to say a second time. For the record,
I do not consider all drug users to be addicts.

Amara

The link should end in "html", but the final "l" was stripped by some
software on the way, that deemed the line too long, and inserted a newline
in between.
A SI mail agent would not make a mistake like this :)

Greetings,

I ask to Mike Lorrey:

What negative experience have you had with drugs ? (directly or indirectly)
Have you ever used any ?

If the answer to the first question is anything but "none", please share. We
are here to discuss, not to destroy other's arguments.
If the answer to the second question is 'no', it would be wise for you to
'chill' when discussing that topic. You're not knowledgeable enough on the
topic at hand.
And just reading books and papers don't mean shit in this case. You cannot
'attack' users without having been one and you cannot attack them AFTER
having been one yourself. If you just have a pretty 'tough' stance but do
not explain why, people might label you as a 'troll', just like it's done
on Slashdot on in newsgroups/mailing lists etc... I'm sure you actually want
to discuss things, don't you ?
In that case, you still need to start...

*sweet smile*

Regards,

Arona,

PS: Amara is big enough to defend herself, but reading her words and having
followed the discussion, I could not help but step in.

Please maintain list discipline. We're not interested in viruses, virus

The network will not awaken, unless it is engineered to do so. Given the

orders of magnitude.

Problem with small holes is that there's a tradeoff between luminosity and
blackbody wavelength. E.g. a 10 kK hole would radiate less than a 10 MK
hole, but 10 kK radiation sans attenuation would be a lot easier to use
with solid state photovoltaic devices.

It would be interesting to see whether you could use an artificial
gas/dust atmosphere around a nanohole to both feed it/attenuate the
radiation if it's a hot hole. Somebody please do the math.

Assuming, we'll see singularity fireball signatures in high energy
acclerator events, how scalable would this be? Which energies could you
reach with a circumstellar device lighthours across? What would be the
average lifetime of holes produced?

It's a joke, a *joke*, a sweet Valentine's Day nerdish rather lumbering

To be precise, it requires an enormously higher amount of computing power for
the network to awaken accidentally than for us to waken it deliberately, and
latencies and small node sizes raise the bar even further.  If all the
Internet were interconnected over OC3 pipelines and nobody was doing anything
else on the nodes, "the Internet" still wouldn't awaken spontaneously until
well after I would expect AI to be deliberately achieved on some local
supercomputer.  (Interconnecting the Internet and then deliberately trying to
create AI is a different matter, of course.)  The point is that spontaneity
just doesn't work.  Spontaneous generation of AI on the Internet is like unto
the spontaneous generation of mice from straw and dirty shirts, as I believe
Pat Cadigan once observed.  If you have a planet-sized mass of straw and dirty
shirts and you wait 850 million years it will happen, but genetically
engineering mice would be a lot faster.

Eugene Leitl is right about the potential for perversion though.

Alcohol comes from the Arabic "al-kuhl".

Alcohol was first produced in the area known as the fertile
crescent, what we know as the middle east (specifically modern
Iraq).

It's deleterious effects have been long known there and of course
the Islamic faith prohibits its use. Alcoholics in Islamic
countries have low reproduction rates (socially) so the genes
related to it have been selected against in the population.

Man, poor Alex.  Nobody on this list has a sense of humor.

This is entirely possible, though recall that the sphere cannot be a

I agree with you both.  I don't expect the net to spontaneously awaken.  But 
I don't think we need it to.  The general consensus seems to be that AI 
won't be AI until it is sentient.  But, so long as it is capable of 
autonomically meeting my needs, I don't want or need it to be sentient.  
Personally I'd rather have an AI smart enough to do all the tasks I assign 
to it yet dumb enough not to know its smarter than me, than a conscious, 
sentient super-intelligence (that I have to hope is friendly enough not to 
trump my wishes with its own).

After all, the Native Americans were friendly to the Europeans at first.  
But friendliness faded eventually and what enabled the conquest of the 
Americas was superior military technology and skill.  Yep, give me the dumb 
AI anyday.

I have used alcohol on an irregular basis since I was a teenager, and
caffeine as well. I don't smoke tobacco, and as for the rest, you are
asking me to incriminate myself.

I am quite knowledgable and experienced, and I will leave it at that.

This is the typical first attack of opponents to my arguments, the "you
must have never used drugs if you think this way" routine. If you had
actually read my previous posts, you would not be even making such
ludicrous statements. In which case, I can say that your statements are
worthless until you actually DO read what I've already said.

Sorry, my pattern-matcher is on hair-trigger. I literally take fractions
of a second to classify mail, so sometimes bona fide email gets
misclassified as spam or hoaxes.

But the word does not derive from any potable beverage.  The word "alcohol"
derives from the Arabic "Al-Kuhl" or "Al-Kahala".  Kahala was a satiny
powder used to paint the eyebrows.  Alcohol was found to be a good solvent
to dissolve the powder to produce smoother application.  The word therefore
refers to a solvent used as an ingredient in make-up.  This was its basic
meaning and how it was regarded by the Muslims.  Anybody drinking alcohol to
get high would be regarded like a solvent-sniffer in the West.

Ya ain't never gonna get it.  What you just asked for requires general
intelligence and self-awareness.

Thermodynamically speaking, wouldn't higher frequencies be more
efficient? We have spent most work on photovoltaics at wavelengths close
to solar radiation, but I don't see why similar ideas can't be used for
higher frequencies. Hmm, beyond a certain range molecular matter of
course becomes rather fragile, but there might be some interesting
nuclear photovoltaics that catch gammas and use them to do charge
separation.

You would end up with the Eddington luminosity if the gas was just
gravitationally attracted. I guess a slightly different luminosity would
result if it was instead pressured. From the Second Fount of Knowledge
(http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/EddingtonLuminosity.html), I
get: L_eddington = 4 pi c G M m / sigma_T

Using the pressure P instead of gravitation we get: L = 4 pi r^2 c P /
sigma T; the r dependency means that if the hole is in equilibrium at
its horizon, gas outside will be at a higher pressure and crowd in. This
increases L, moving the equilibrium shell outwards. Seems the full
situation is going to require some more careful analysis of how P is
changed by the hole. Could very well become an unstable or otherwise
messily interesting problem...

Well, I'd have to say that higher frequencies would penetrate materials
deeper (i.e. x-rays, etc) so that a given receiver would necessarily
have a lower energy density to efficiency ratio. Microwaves, which are
longer wavelengths than visible light, can be rectified into electricity
at a much higher efficiency than visible light can, etc..

So you have this curve of wavelength conversion efficiency to deal with,
plus a curve of wavelength versus total flux. Where these two meet
should be the wavelength you want your black hole to produce the most
of.

Gosh, cheers DB! I get into so much trouble for my sense of humor all the
time, and I was particularly worried about offending people I don't know all
that well yet. It hits so hard when you're trying to be fun and
inadvertantly upset someone. Sorry everybody.

Yes, we do. It's the art of remembering that not everyone's sense of humor
is the same as yours that's the problem. Example: I have a friend with
cerebral palsy who constantly tells 'spastic' jokes about himself. It
offends so many people (who just assume he's too thick to realise what's
going down...) Now there's prejudice for you.

1. I **still** do not know what negative experience you had. Remember *** I
am not attacking you but really wish to know**
Mentioning that through you work, you came to be in contact with users
or/and addicts or that one of your business partner was a cocaine user, does
not give me any info whatsoever on  what negative experience might have come
out of it.

2. I am asking you to incriminate yourself ? I was not aware of it. I happen
to be someone that feely discuss just about anything with just about anyone.
Just because I am asking you something which you wouldn't want to be known,
does not imply that I am 'asking you to incriminate yourself'. Why are you
feeling attacked ? Why leave it at that ?

I really read all your previous posts in this thread and I still do not know
what exact experiences gave you the knowledge which you seem to have. I want
concrete stuff, examples, something that can widen my map. Something I can
grind on. Is that wrong ?

Arona,

I have felt for some time that cryonics was a lead weight dragging down
acceptance of Drexlerian nanotech.  My theory is that people have an
overwhelmingly negative emotional reaction to cryonics, in part because
it implies that the death of their loved ones was preventable, and this
carries over to any technology which would seem to make cryonics credible.

A couple of years ago, Foresight essentially declared victory in the
war for acceptance of nanotechnology.  There were conferences held every
year, one or more respected journals, government funding was ramping up,
articles in business journals.  By all accounts it was now an accepted
future technology.

But maybe that was premature.  We are seeing a backlash, a rearguard
fighting action against the original vision of nanotech.  Opponents are
trying to build a firewall against Drexlerian mechanosynthesis, drawing a
distinction between their prosaic nanotech and Drexler's far-out visions.
They prefer to focus on biotech, on nanoparticles, on MEMS, on bulk
materials engineering at the nanoscale.  All these things can be done
today, in fact they are the natural consequence of existing technologies
just extending their capabilities a bit.  They want to get funding for
their current research.  In this environment there is no reason to even
think about blue sky dreams like eternal perfect health, or nightmares
like engineered malignant replicators.

I think Foresight needs to go back to its roots and shore up the
foundations.  It's not enough to have "nanotechnology" initiatives showing
up everywhere.  Few of those efforts are making significant progress
towards Drexler's machine-based models.  Foresight needs to remind
people that there is more to nanotech than making ultra-fine powders
for smoother paint.  We have to keep our eye on the prize, a technology
which can utterly revolutionize every aspect of the world.  If research
is not moving us towards that goal, it should not receive funding under
nanotech grants, even if it happens to involve little tiny pieces.

A very good point. I think partly this is because a lot of the
researchers and institutions working under the nanotech
banner moved in there as the field became "sexy" and well funded. They
have no real ties to Drexler's ideas, and are mostly interested in
pursuing their own research interests.

I think this is a good example of why no field - be it nanotechnology or
transhumanism - seeking dramatic results in the long run, can afford not
to constantly work on its foundations and visions, show that they are
not just relevant but actually important to guide action.

Yet why is it that both alcohol and gambling are legal activities for
adults in most jurisdictions in the US, yet many perfectly normal adults
completely ruin their lives, and the lives of others (spouse/children
going homeless/malnourished, drunk driving homicides and injuries, etc)?
If the criminality of the substance were the only factor as you claim,
then alcholics and gambling addicts should have no negative impact on
society. The fact they do have one disproves the criminality theory.

While I agree that the state should not regulate intake by adults (a
point which I have NEVER disputed, by the way), this does not mean that
addicts should not be held accountable for their actions just as
children and criminals are. Users should be required by their insurance
carriers (even in a libertarian setting) to adequately insure against
the externalities of their potential bad behavior while impaired and/or
addicted. If they do take care of this risk, then they can toke up with
my blessing.

If you were not aware, use of marijuana, cocaine, exctasy, heroine, PCP,
methamphetamines, or anything other than caffeine, alcohol, and
nicotine, are generally quite illegal activities. As this is a public
forum, asking me to admit participating in illegal activities is asking
me to incriminate myself in a manner which is considered admissable
evidence in court.

While I can understand that since you are not a native english speaker
you might not have completely comprehended my prior statements, further
detailing them or elaborating on them would result in my incriminating
myself.

Be that as it may, when your mother told you it was a very stupid thing
to jump off a cliff, did you doubt her word, even if she had never
jumped off a cliff before in her life?

Yes, antimony specifically.

Beer of course was known and alcohol was commonly distilled from
it.

The word "alcohol" is actually a medieval latin derivative from the
arabic "al-kuhl" learned from muslim scholars in medieval Europe.

To be very precise, it is a medieval latin derivative of the Arabic
"al-kuhl" learned from Muslim scholars during medieval Europe (the
Islamic renaissance).

It is not that simple, but for all practical purposes you can consider

I'm not seeing this at all. In fact in the passed years opposition to
drextech was considerably tougher, and those voices get progressively
extinguished as our capababilities in characterisation and petty
fabrication (one grad-student-afternoon) of nanodevices have been ramping
up. Future never looked brighter.

Well, this has been going on for many years now. Funding is a lot like a
scam, based on participating in fabricating consensual realities.

Foresight now deals in two-digit megabuck grants? Wow. Nobody told me.

With a charmed nostalgia of times past, I'm sending this poem:

Valentine from Poor Robin's Almanac in 1757

This month bright Phoebus enters Pisces,
The maids will have good store of kisses,
For always when the fun comes there,
Valentine's Day is drawing near,
And both the men and maids incline
To chuse them each a Valentine;
And if a man gets one he loves,
He gives her first a pair of gloves;
And, by the way, remember this,
To seal the favour with a kiss.

This kiss begets more love, and then
That love begets a kiss again,
Until this trade the man doth catch,
And then he doth propose the match,
The woman's willing, tho' she's shy,
She gives the man this soft reply,
"I'll not resolve one thing or other,
Until I first consult my mother."
When she says so, 'tis half a grant,
And may be taken for consent.


Enjoy all types, shapes and elements of love!

Natasha

It seems that one must deal with the notion that self-replicating general purpose assemblers
is Drexler's sole contribution/albatross; probably by tacitly ignoring it when dealing with those
with short-term parallel goals. Calculating the consequent risks & goal drifts requires craft.
Argue, or win the war?

This sometimes seems daunting.
I try to remember Robert Goddard's history--and to be mindful of the Peenemunde story arc.

This equation assumes a hydrogen gas sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium,
with the total energy transport via radiation.

Are these the assumptions that you want?

There's no reason to resort the silly simplistic black-and-white
thinking here.  We're obviously talking matters of degree, not
fundamental nature. Yes, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling lead to
some social problems in those who don't deal well with them--but
far /fewer/ problems than medically similar things that happen
to be illegal.  Alcohol and tobacco companies don't create street
gangs, kill judges, bribe police, etc.  Those acitivities carry
a high cost, which is only borne by drug dealers because the laws
drive prices high enough to cover.  Without the laws, things like
marijuana and cocaine would cause social problems about on the
level of what alcohol does now--that's not zero, but it's quite
tolerable, and we've learned as a society how to deal with it.

I should also point out that the case of gambling addiction
actually weakens your argument: you contend that illegal drugs
reduce one's capacity for responsible action, and that's true
(just as it is equally true of legal drugs).  But clearly that
isn't the case with an activity like gambling,  so you can't
blame anti-social addictive behavior on the chemical unless the
effect of that chemical is well beyond the expected variation
in human behavior.  You could probably make that case for PCP,
heroin, meth, and alcohol. You probably couldn't make that case
for marijuana, LSD, or tobacco.  Marijuana in particular is about
the silliest case I can imagine: widespread use would probably
reduce violence and benefit society immeasurably.

I could be persuaded that users of a drug that carries proven risks
of anti-social behavior might be required to mitigate the risk.  The
one drug that creates the most risk in that regard is clearly alcohol,
and we do have fairly reasonable laws to mitigate that risk: strict
drunk-driving penalties, regulations on bars and liquor stores, etc.
It's actually a pretty good model for what regulation of other drugs
might look like in a more reasonable society (though arbitrary age
limits are silly).  And of course, such laws should /only/ apply to
those drugs proven to pose risks to others, and not things like LSD and
marijuana.

It is impossible for me to comment on this without making some reference to 
the other posts on this issue. However, rather than rehashing the opposing 
arguments, I selected the segments most relevant and insightful (only posted 
as of yesterday) to the matter at hand - that being the rights & treatment 
*by the State* of drug addicts.

I probably wouldn't have replied, as I'm new to the list, but I was 
compelled by the following post.

I must admit, I didn't expect to encounter such insightful perspectives on 
addiction on this list. Of course, there is a stigma attached to addicts by 
society at large. Unfortunately, however, the misconception of addiction has 
infiltrated the realm of the more highly educated as well, and we sometimes 
find that people who "should know better" really have no clue. That's why I 
find the above posts so refreshing.
I've been reluctant to post anything but Arona's reply really compelled me, 
& I said to myself, "now *here* is something I actually *know* about!" For 
me, this is Synchronicity working overtime. Being terrified of sounding 
stupid, I would have never imagined I would willingly disclose this, but 
this exchange is somthing... So I apologize if my contributions right now 
are limited only to my personal experience.

2 months ago I tried to kill myself (& nearly succeeded). After my lovely 
stay in the trauma unit at McLean Hospital, (yes, the Girl, Interrupted one. 
Apparently, lots of other famous people went there, like Sylvia Plath but I 
guess they weren't so successful with her!:P) I was transferred to Drug 
Rehab. Why was I going there? I thought I was just crazy? And so, "recovery" 
just came out of nowhere & bit me in the ass. Needless to say, the education 
I have gained throughout this process has been priceless. But one thing 
emerges as an indesputable fact from all this - No one can get sober unless 
they *WANT* to.

I agree with Mike Lorrey that:
<<the claims that drug use is a 'victimless crime' is notas black and white, 
slam dunk as many legalization proponents would liketo claim. Having been in 
the trenches of dealing with addicts, the damage they do ALWAYS extends 
beyond themselves as individuals>>

But that's about where it ends for me.
So my only point of contention with Amara would be this: don't be deceived 
into thinking addiction is a victimless crime. Legally, perhaps, that may 
usually be the case, but the mental, emotional, & financial damages 
inflicted upon others can be devestating enough to qualify as victimization. 
Other than that, I think you are totally right on in your evaluation.

The FACT of the matter is that you cannot force an addict/alcoholic to get 
clean. Nothing in existence can keep the afflicted from that next hit or 
drink or whatever EXCEPT their own free will to *choose* to stop. S/He will 
require assisstance (sometimes a great deal) to carry out this choice 
completely, but the *choice* by necessity must be freely & willingly made by 
the addict of his/her own accord.
This stands in stark contrast to the idea posted by Mike:

>Are you advocating that an addict has a greater right to get high and
>drive their kids off a cliff than their kids have to continue living?
[This is just nonsense & inappropriate]
>Such individuals are no longer freely acting adult citizens.

I disagree. They are indeed freely acting and their action is to use. Just 
because you think they are wrong in their decision doesn't mean that they 
are not freely making it. Not all junkies *want* to get sober & my feeling 
is that if they don't want to put in the effort when given the opportunity, 
then they are fucking themselves. The State need not waste money or 
resources on people who continue to make the *choice* to use.

EXACTLY! In fact, accepting responsibility for ones own actions, (past, 
present, & future) is literally the first step in treatment of addiction. 
Addicts cannot get sober without first taking full responsibility for 
themselves & their condition. That's mostly why AA & NA have such monumental 
success - completely voluntary, totally self-supporting, based on tolerance 
& open-mindedness, & absolutely free from any State or religious doctrine - 
compared with many state-funded programs (including prisons) that function 
with the sole purpose of pulling in funding (State employees need to get 
their jobs *somewhere).

as Amara pointed out:
>I do not find your Means acceptable. Once you tell the government
>that it's OK to throw someone in jail or take their property because
>of some behavior that is not harming anyone else, but that you find

>All drug use carries a risk, and the risks are varied. As an adult,

Even without interference from the State, an addict can manage perfectly 
well to destroy & lose everything of value in life. Therefore, the 
rehabilitative benefits Mike cited from such losses can be preserved. For 
example, just within the timeframe of my treatment, I have been forced to 
drop out of school in my senior year, I was evicted from my apartment in DC, 
I lost my scholarship, my partner, my job, blah blah blah. And none of this 
involved the State - I managed to destroy my life by my own hand & all the 
consequences I faced were a DIRECT result of my own decision to use. I think 
this is immensely important because there was no scapegoat - I could NOT use 
the State as the fallguy for my demise & so I was forced to accept total 
responsibility for the actions, MY actions, which brought me there. I fucked 
myself up big time & I deserved everything I got - I had it coming. For this 
reason, I think it is ESSENTIAL to the rehabilitation of the addict that the 
State NOT be involved on any level. I cannot stress this point enough. The 
individual MUST take full & total responsibility before reaping any benefits 
from treatment.

Amara also highlighted another crucial factor in this issue:
>"Inform yourself, then choose". The best way to remove the largest >dangers 
>regarding drug use is education .. not throwing that person >into jail !!

I couldn't agree more. An old friend (a programmer) brought some books for 
me to borrow while in treatment. Reading about Omega Point Theory I felt 
sparked but I was left rather unsatiated. I decided I had no choice but to 
refresh my (elementary) knowledge in math & physics so I could advance to 
more interesting subjects. So I managed to get some textbooks & I started 
reviewing (yes, while in the hospital & rehab). Once I got out I did some 
quick searching online, which lead me to transhumanism & extropy. I was 
blown away. It was new to me, but it all seemed so familiar in a way - 
perhaps because (unlike most things in the free world) it actually made 
sense.

So I guess to answer Reason's question:
>Blah, blah, blah, heard it all before, possibly even from me, what are >we 
>going to do about it?

I would have to agree with Amara - EDUCATE. Put the word out there & (at 
least try to) have faith that people will follow. Just like you can't force 
a junkie into sobriety, you can't force a person to change the way they 
think - even if its an improvement - it just doesn't work that way. But I 
wouldn't have even made it this far without education, specifically science. 
Early sobriety is like schizophrenia without all the noise. At such a 
critical time, I found science & math to be a great comfort because, unlike 
society or religion, I could trust them.

I know I'm not very smart & stand to gain a great deal more from this list 
than I could ever hope to contribute, so I'm just grateful for the exposure 
to such great ideas & exchanges. But I think, if nothing else, it proves 
that if someone, regardless of education or intelligence, is open & willing 
to *understand* then a great deal can be accomplished. so again, if anyone 
has any suggestions/instructions for me, feel free; self-ed, while 
gratifying, is still a bitch so I'd welcome the help :P
Thanks so much,
Vanessa

Extropes,

It's not all that important--it just adds to the
growing list and the experience base--and I probably
would have passed it by, except that at the end of the
piece I spotted a bit of cleverness that I thought I'd
pass along.

I don't know. I'm not enough of a physicist to tell. My intuition tells
me the assumption of equilibrium is not to be trusted at all - I can
easily imagine instabilities that cause radial convection. Of course,
using a black hole as a heat engine this way might be a practical
engineering solution, but it is so crude.  I prefer machines with no
moving parts.

Yes, this will be a marvelous example of the "clones are *not* carbon
copies" argument that I use with some success with those afraid of

Yes, the cloners appear to have a taste for puns.  This was the CopyCat
project, after all.  A major dog cloning effort is called Missyplicity
because it is funded by a family that wants their mixed-breed dog
Missy cloned.

I admittedly don't have your credentials in the field.  So if I were a 
betting man, I'd bet on your prognostications over my own.  But based on 
what I've seen so far, I beg to differ.

Right *now* I have a computer that listens to me speak and turns my vocal 
utterances into text.  It's not perfect, but after a couple years of 
"training" it's better than 95%.  I also have systems that notify me by a 
gentle vibration on my wrist whenever I receive a voicemail and/or email 
message.  I can read the header and the first few words of the body of the 
email on my watch and, if I want, I can call from my cell phone and have a 
computer read the entire message to me over the phone.  I can then respond 
to the email vocally over the phone and have a .wav of my spoken reply sent 
by email.  I can also, over the phone, request that my email messages be 
forwarded to any nearby fax machine.

I have and use all of the foregoing services *today* with lousy 2002 
technology.  None of the services described above requires the input or 
effort of any meat puppet other than myself.  It is all performed by very, 
very dumb computers listening and obeying my every command.

Admittedly none of the above services are as impressive as, say, reviving me 
from a vitrified state or imposing world peace or eliminating the social, 
economic and geo-political problems of the world.  But then any system that 
*could* do that would be in control, and you and I would be at its complete 
mercy.

Maybe that sounds good to you.  Not to me.  I am convinced that my needs can 
and will be met by dumb "AI."  No doubt people will continue to improve on a 
good thing, to the point of testing the old adage that too much of a good 
thing is a bad thing.  My money says we'll find that old adage to hold true. 
  Until that unhappy day, we will be fat, dumb and happy bossing around dumb 
AI at our pleasure.  After that, don't say I didn't warn you...

I totally agree with the idea that the state shouldn't be involved in
forcing the individual to get clean. I never said it should.

People involved in discussions on this list are very often operating
from very different frames of reference, and as such affronts are often
taken where none is intended, and impressions are often given when none
were proffered (or inverse of what was assumed by the reader).

For example, as a libertarian, I still see there being room for *some*
minimal sort of coersion of the individual by a state or competetive
power brokers/insurance providers withing a mythical libertarian world,
for example, an insurance provider selling PPL policies in an ungoverned
area will still be free to set their own premiums for the sort of
policies their customers want. If a customer can't afford the policy
they want, its just too damn bad, and they WILL have to accept what is
offered for what they can afford, no matter who competes in the market
for their business. That is still coersion.

However, in the present discussion, I am NOT talking about a mythical
libertarian society, I am dealing with present day society, here and
now, and the things I would prescribe for this society are far different
than I would prescribe for a libertarian one, for the very simple reason
that a large percent of present day American (and the rest of the world,
for that matter) population are unwilling and/or incapable of living in
the sort of libertarian society many of us dream of.

That being said, Vanessa is entirely right to say that the choice to get
sober has to be up to the individual addict, however, that doesn't mean
that those who are dependent upon that individual in any way should be
left in the lurch to take the loss if the individual addict isn't ready
to get sober. Whether living in todays society or in a libertarian
world, the others involved have rights too, rights which frequently are
far more important than the individual addicts 'right to choose' to stay
addicted.

In this area, a properly constructed asset forfeiture regulation, either
as a government statute or merely as a performance penalty clause in an
insurance contract, would take the addicts assets in order to satisfy
the debts of the addict: to their children and spouse, to their
creditors and business associates, etc. much as a bankruptcy proceeding
seizes the individual's assets when the individual declares that they
can no longer be responsible for their debts.

By choosing to remain addicted, the individual is making a de fact
declaration of abdication of responsibility of their debts to their
dependents and creditors.

Well, my whole point here, that nobody seems to be even comprehending,
is that because the drug compromises the addicts thought processes
physiologically/neurochemically, the addict may *think* they are making
their choices freely, but they are in fact making their choices subject
to the compulsions of the drug addiction, which is *exactly* like mind
control. Is the manchurian candidate freely choosing the act of
assasination they commit? LSD, for instance, IS a drug that has been
used for mind control. Expecting it to NOT act as a mind control when
used privately is really really dumb.

Yes, the individual IS responsible, because they chose to take that
first dose, but responsibility and actual control while impaired are
entirely different things.

If the individual is free of dependents and debts, then I entirely agree
with you. I disagree, though, when it comes to dependents and debts, the
state (or your PPL provider, in a libertarian setting) does have an
interest in looking out for the interests of others who are dependent
upon you being a productive member of society.

Lets look at a hypothetical situation, lets say I am driving while high
and hit another car, causing damage to not only my car, but the other
person's car and injuring them and my ex-wife and two kids who are in
the back seat of my car, but my ex-wife has  just gained full custody of
them and I've lost all parental privileges and responsibilities. I'm
unemployed and uninsured, and I say, "I'm high and can't pay for the
damages anyways cause I've got no job." I do happen to own a $200,000
house outright. If the state says "huh, well, we're gonna seize your
house and sell it to pay for the damage you did."

Can I, the addict, STILL blame the state for taking my house? Is what
the state did WRONG?

Furthermore, by seizing that last crutch in my life that was enabling my
addiction, namely having a decent place to live so I could kid myself
that I wasn't really at 'rock bottom' yet, so I "wasn't ready" to get
sober, didn't the state (or the insurance company, or the courts, or
whatever) help me along to decide to get sober, while protecting the
EQUAL interests of others involved?

and don't say this is 'nonsense and inappropriate'. I've seen situations
like this or exactly like this in the lives of many addicts.

Mike

It's not nonsense or inappropriate.

However, restitution, and putative "tough love/hitting bottom/you'll-thank-me-later" effects,
have just about nothing to do with modern day civil asset forfeiture as practiced in the USA.

The name of the game, in the world we actually live in today, is "What can we get away with?",
not too dissimilar from the game Harry J. Anslinger played throughout his demonizing career.

I'm really glad "The Job" is on TV, although its characters are all too loveable and the plot 
lines are lightweight.

For those who haven't seen it, it's a semiblack comedy-drama about police procedures as actually
practiced in NYPD.

Oh.  I thought you meant AI smart enough to do any task you could assign
to it.  I didn't realize that you were planning to ask so little.  Well,
at any rate, as is sort of implied by your message, there are those of use
who plan to ask for more from our AI.  Every other corporation in the
world can decide to build better voice-recognition systems, if they like. 
It just means that those particular corporations won't be very relevant to
how the fate of humanity plays itself out.

No matter how enormous the market is for a better voice-recognition system
or a car that drives itself, it doesn't mean that the Other Kind of AI
will have any less earthshaking an effect, even if it's just a few
projects working on it.  It's true AI that's relevant, and it doesn't
become any less relevant because something that isn't real AI becomes a
big hit commercially.  There is not a limited amount of AI-stuff so that a
big hit in modality-level AI can drown out generally intelligent AI.  A
true AI has the same amount of earthshaking power whether or not there's a
big market for self-driving cars.

First I want to apologize if I sounded too dismissive (while not my 
intention, I now see that I kinda was) but I think it was more a reaction to 
the comment itself perhaps than your point behind it. Also understand, I am 
in early recovery, immersed in "the program" & I'm just SO sick of listening 
to people whining & feeling sorry for themselves without actually DOING 
anything about anything that I'm at a point now where I really have no 
compassion or sympathy. These are my own highly volatile personal feelings 
which I know should not interfere with a rational analysis of the matter at 
hand. So again, I'm really sorry. If you do have experience with addicts in 
early recovery, you should know that emotionally we're more fucked up than 
we were when we were using :P They say when you get sober you are the mental 
age (maturity I assume) of the age you *started using at. (can any 
neurological creedence be given to this claim?)
Anyhow, you pose a difficult question. But like you said, this is the real 
world, not an ideal state. My problem specifically is the whole government 
seizure of property thing. I think my general concerns are reflected by 
another post

by Lee Daniel Crocker 12/2/02:
<<And further, while forfeiture cases may seem justified on 
criminaldrug-abuse grounds, the reality of the law and its present 
applicationis that they are simply government theft of private property 
without dueprocess. No conviction--or even formal accusation--of any crime 
isnecessary for a forfeiture. Due process and the rights of the accuseddon't 
apply, because no person is being accused: the property itself isbeing 
accused (the court cases have wonderful titles like "U.S. vs. 100Bottles of 
Wine") Anyone who supports such forfeiture laws is nolibertarian, regardless 
of the pretext used to justify them.>>

I can't comment on the last part because I don't know anything about 
libertarian, but living in a State with the power to seize property is just 
plain scary. & the truth is that this power is abused more often than we 
know. The best example of this is chronicled in a documentary by Robbie 
Leppzer called "An Act of Conscience" - its on the Sundance Channel 
sometimes if you get a chance to peep it. This couple refused to pay taxes 
during the eighties (because of the Iran-Contra stuff I think - I was too 
young to remember) but figured their taxes out every year w/ their 
accountant & donated the money to local charities. Their house was seized & 
they protested outside in tents for almost two years (since, through a 
technicality, they still owned the land the house was on). Its really an 
amazing story, from whatever your viewpoint. I think its also available 
through turningtide film. I only know about it because it all happened a 
town away from here (middle-of-nowhere-northwestern Massachusetts - and yes 
our street lights really are always green!)

Hi all,

Due to my current studies, I will be forced to read the extropians list 
much less than I normally do (I usually read 70-80% of all posts).  As a 
result, I encourage you to contact me directly (feel free to use 
"priorities") if there are any posts that you think I should read for 
whatever reason.  That includes breaches of list etiquette as well as 
"really great posts" that could be used for Post Of The Month in Exponent.

So don't worry --I'll still be here, and I'll still be maintaining all my 
work with ExI, but in the case of the extropians list, I'll probably be 
reading less so that I can be learning more...

Ultimately, I have always viewed substance abuse as I would view any 
disease: it is an affliction that can usually be cured, but the victim has 
to *want* to be cured before that can be done.  One difference between 
substance abuse and other diseases, however, is that where most diseases 
are primarily physical (even down to the molecular and chemical level), 
substance abuse is at least partially psychological as well.  Treatment 
can't be limited to *just* detox, nor can it be limited (in most cases) to 
*just* AA / NA etc.  It has to be a combination of the two.

The point to this is that this duality of treatment is quite hard for most 
people to understand.  The common sentiment from most "sober" individuals 
is that the addicts simply "don't want" to help themselves, when really 
there is often another dimension to the issue.

Education is *key* to solving a lot of the apparent "drug problem" that we 
currently experience.  The way it is generally done now is that drugs are 
automatically equated with all "bad" things, when really the educated 
should be more geared towards the reality that drugs are not inherently 
bad, but that the consequences of sustained drug use *can* be bad.  Kids 
are smart enough to know that a "high" doesn't feel bad.  But they lack the 
native intelligence/wisdom to understand the consequences of 
addiction.  That's something that can be changed, but to the best of my 
knowledge, too many people are painting a stark, black and white picture of 
an area that has a lot of inherent greys.

I wander past this little sci fi bookshop in town here ("Known Space"),
almost every day. Purportedly it's open wed/thu/fri/sat afternoons, but I've
never noticed it actually be open before, and I've been walking past it for
about 8 months now.

Today, it was open. I wandered in. It smells musty and, combined with the
humidity, has this sense of laguid intrigue draped around it. Stuffed with
sci-fi/fantasy/comics/etc floor to ceiling.

Anyway, what should I see but a couple of shelves packed with Fighting
Fantasy (amongst many more of the CYOA genre). Wow! I bought most of them...

The Forest of Doom, Starship Traveller, Deathtrap Dungeon, Island of the
Lizard King, Scorpion Swamp, House of Hell, and Steve Jackson's Sorcery
series KHARE - Cityport of Traps.

I'll have a look at them on the bus home today. I wonder if I'm in for a
treat, or for that same disillusionment I suffered on playing on a C64
recently?

(oh yeah, and I bought a book called "The Sea's Furthest End" by some guy.
It's not CYOA, but it could be good anyway, who knows?)

Uh,... no, not really.  I googled and came up with
these folks:

http://www.savingsandclone.com/company_team.cfm?div=pets

Though from the photo(s) I don't see anything that
warrants an "Ah ha!"

Can't be the transrodents,...they're not likely to
encourage the cloning of cats (though they could wish
to divert suspicion).

Maybe that old Texas guy who wants to beat death? 
Name begins with an "h" I think.

OK, I give up.  Who, worthy of an "Ah ha!", is behind
GS&C?  Elvis, Howard Hughes, Lassie, the CIA?

Best, Jeff Davis

False.  Many "on the side of faith" are every bit as doubtful or 
uncertain as any of those "on the other side".  I don't find 
your notion compelling.

Reason, science and technology are not fully adequate to deal 
with all important aspects of life.  As long as this is true, 
and much more capable folks than me have said so and issued 
better arguments than I can make here, There is no reason to 
claim or implie that all truth is sole possessed by the above 
trio.  At least through in a bit of philosophy.  And where did 
ethics, aesthetics and so on go?

Perhaps the next war will be between those who want simple 
cut-and-dried pigeonholes of what is what and those who realize 
that the "truth" is more ambiguous, deeper and more wonderful 
than that.

You could do worse for a theory of everything earthly than to 
consider the earth as a sort of Singularity glider gun (well, 
doesn't quite work) occassionally giving rise to a Singularity 
where the uploads and SIs after hanging around for a while take 
off for elsewhere/when.  Only those who decided not to go are 
left - along with legends and myths about the "gods" and vague 
notions of how the remaining ones must change to reach "heaven".

AMEN.  And again, there are many users of many different 
substance who are in no way "addicts", so using this language is 
negatively polarizing of issues of human freedom.  Hell, you can 
have everything you own seized by forfeiture laws if one joint 
is found on the premises.  I defy anyone to tell me how that 
makes any sense or how someone occassionally smoking pot (or 
firing up at the end of the workday for that matter) can be 
equated with being a junkie.

For the record I once knew a lot about drugs but was never into 
anything physically addictive for very long except for tobacco, 
which was a real pain to kick.  Speed and cocaine were briefly 
in my life but I considered them to be "dumb" drugs with the 
payoff not worth the cost.  Short-term memory decreases fast 
enough as I age without smoking pot, which I gave up many years 
ago.  But I affirm anyone's right to mix or buy whatever 
chemical cocktail s/he wishes AND to live with the (natural, not 
inflated legal) consequences.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1818000/1818652.stm

By BBC News Online's Ivan Noble

Plans to extend free access to scientific and academic research papers
have received a boost with the announcement of a $3m grant from financier
and philanthropist George Soros' Open Society Institute.

The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which
scholars give to the world without expectation of payment

Budapest Open Access Initiative
Open access advocate Professor Stevan Harnad of the University of
Southampton, UK, says the money could make it easier for academics wanting
to set up their own alternatives to commercially run journals.

"The vast potential benefits of open access to research and researchers
are already there... but the subsidy lowers the entry barriers for
would-be open-access initiatives," he said.

Critics of commercial journals say their subscription charges hamper
research at institutes and in countries where research budgets are tight.

They say that researchers write and review papers for free, so the
journals should not charge to read them.

"They don't want to get paid, what they want is that other researchers
should read and use their work," Professor Harnad told BBC News Online.

"The fact that their literature is treated for trade is anathema," he
said.

Budapest declaration

Some commercial journals have extended the amount of literature they make
available for free in response to a boycott campaign by scientists calling
themselves the Public Library of Science.

But journal publishers defend their charges as necessary to finance their
operations.

The new money for open alternatives comes as part of a new declaration
called the Budapest Open Access Initiative, signed by dozens of
institutions and hundreds of researchers.

They say they are not opposed to commercial journals, but want to see an
alternative system of free access journals and self- archiving set up in
parallel.

"The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which
scholars give to the world without expectation of payment," reads the
declaration.

It calls for "free availability on the public internet, permitting any
users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the
full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data
to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose".

Seed money

Professor Harnad's colleagues Chris Gutteridge and Rob Tansley developed a
piece of software called Eprints, which, they hope, makes the process of
publishing easier and therefore cheaper.

He says the Soros money could be used to "seed" schemes where academics
will pay a small fee to have their papers reviewed but users will pay
nothing to read them.

"To start up and fill an institutional Eprint Archive costs less than
$10,000; to start up and fill an alternative journal costs less than

More important though than the money, he adds, is for there to be a
critical mass of research available from free archives online.

Actually, it would probably make sense to keep a 10 kK hole in an opaque
sphere pressurized with hydrogen. What is the power output at that
blackbody maximum, about that of a nuke?

You're the resident astrophysicist here. Would feeding the nanohole with
dust at all make sense?

The hole is but a pinprick (sub um sized?); what is the size of the
accretion disk? Probably palm-sized, certainly <<1 m. You would want to
not ionize the fuel (hydrogen? helium?).

Could somebody please plug in the numbers into the equations for a 10 kK
hole, to get an order of magnitude estimation? I.e., the size of the event
horizon, the total hole luminosity, plus a guesstimate of the accretion
disk, given gravitation gradient and a hydrogen atmosphere?

I would doubt transrodents did this, but very possibly transferrets!  They enjoy having cats as playmates, and both species HATE rodents!

Maybe my superrich great-uncle is behind this!  But he is in Louisiana, and not Texas!  So he would be sending money to Tulane, and not some "damned" Texan university.  Funny how those two states don't like each other too much. ; )

Yes, that could be the case, although in my many conversations with
people about cryonics, that has yet to come up.  Benford's cryonics
novel touched upon this aspect as an impediment to cryonics'
acceptance, as well.  I do see the same strong negative reaction to
cryonics everywhere I go, but I see it as some sort of reaction to a
taboo subject.  Two taboos, really: messing with corpses taboo, and
the messing with the life-death cycle taboo.

Gotta agree there.  "Cursed" is the perfect description....

I don't consider that to be the case.  If one reads Nanosystems
and Eric's other papers carefully there are a huge number of
other things discussed.  A few would include -- the problems
of constructing molecules with strained bonds, the damage UV
radiation causes to molecules, the rather fantastic number
of structures that can be constructed within a cube measuring
100 atoms per side, the fact that heat removal is the *real*
problem for high computation densities, the fact that one has
to move from non-reversible to reversible computational
architectures, the fact that there is a clear chemical/biotechnology
based path to assemblers by designing molecular parts of increasing
stiffness, etc.

The fact that SRAs can exist is obvious to anyone who understands
biology.  Eric's extension of this to general purpose assemblers
is a significant contribution but I wouldn't consider it *that*
significant.  Its only significant from the perspective that
he pointed out the risks that such devices could pose and that
gets everyone who isn't aware of the existing "green goo" situation
all upset.

You don't have to ignore it at all.  You simply point out there
are *very* effective ways of dealing with the risks, e.g. heat and
radiation.  Those are the same methods that have been used to deal with
the green goo for ages.  It is unfortunate that people generally lack
the knowledge to paint a complete picture -- that you can have
assemblers that are non-self-replicating that can rely on
broadcast architectures and that the people who promote the
dangers of SRGPA do not in the same breath acknowledge we are
effectively already in that situation *and* there are defenses that
can be employed should we choose to do so.

I'm not so sure.  Anything at the UV-C frequencies or above has energy
levels that exceed atomic bond strengths.  I'm moderately sure that
gamma radiation embrittles most materials, see for example:
http://www.ornl.gov/bes/BES/rems/remsback.htm
http://www.fusion.ucla.edu/snowmass/questions/pq2/62199_1.html

Probably a fair amount of transmutation going on as well.
So I suspect you are going to have rather hefty recycling costs
associated with harvesting any energy produced as gamma rays.

I'd be interested in any references where people actually try to do this.

Given the lack of powerful gamma ray sources that exist in our
neighborhood, I would doubt much work has been done in this area.

I have repeatedly said that a) I distinguish between users and addicts,
and b) I don't think that forfeiture laws are particularly well written
or executed to perform the job they are intended to do. So please don't
assume that I think otherwise. Nor do I think the way forfeiture is
practiced reflects very well with the way I've described it SHOULD work.

However, there is a very salient point to be made about indirect
consequences. I am reminded of the latest anti-drug public service ads
on tv these days, illustrating that drug profits are the largest source
of income for terrorist organizations. Whether you are dealing with left
or right wing terrorists in Columbia as well as the rest of latin
america, or with heroin profits funding al Qaeda and other islamist
groups, the money a drug user spends funds the violence directed at
innocent people.

Now, it's obvious that legalization would likely mitigate a good share
of this funneling, if only by the effects of reduced prices and taxation
of profits.

Be that as it may, given the current state of affairs in the world, the
best thing a drug user could do today to do their patriotic share is to
cut back or quit for the duration, to help deny these funds to the
enemy. If demand drops, prices and profits will too, and terrorist
groups will have to find other ways to fund their activities.

Conflicts of interest between nations only exist when one or the other
(or both) sides are lying about the facts of the conflict, and what each
side is able to do to mitigate the conflict.

What about a liquid gammavoltaic? Imagine a sheet of mercury. The
gamma photons strip away electrons near the surface, causing a
charge imbalance that might be harvestable as electrons flow from
the interior to replace them. You will still need to contain it, but
the containment could be replaced over time as needed, or based on
some form of inertial confinement.

Arabic, but have no real interest in the religion, so I was trying to be
precise.
     Thanks,
     Mike.

P.S. On your recommendation/review, I'm reading the DeSoto/Capitalism book,
I'll report in when I finish it with my own review.

To be very precise, it is a medieval latin derivative of the Arabic
"al-kuhl" learned from Muslim scholars during medieval Europe (the Islamic
renaissance).

One effect I've found is that the more you cut of the prior posts from
the conversation, the more frequently you get new people jumping into
the middle of the debate with retorts which have been previously
addressed, and misconstruing the statements that were made, which
requires that people reiterate prior posts. This results actually in
higher list traffic and more bandwidth waste.

I'm wondering why chip companies are not looking at building MEMS
cooling systems into chips, and why they are not already designing
cooling ports into the chips. A number of evenly spaced venturi ports
across the chip face for the fan to draw air through should provide a
significant increase in cooling. As chip designs get thicker, this will
be a very necessary design feature.

Dust buildup in the PC is easily compensated for by use of HEPA or
HEPA-like filtration on a positive pressure fan on the power supply.

As for nano devices, well, I think that the designers will have to
figure out how to use lasing to cool them, though switching to optical
computation will go a long way to reducing thermal problems. Note that
heat is simply low grade photons, so a photonic chip that dumps high
energy photons after use should effectively reduce thermal noise.

I don't think anything harder than soft xRays is utilizable in solid state
photodiodes. Peak efficiency would be probably in the UV range (diamond,
e.g.).

You don't need a lot of gas to attenuate hard photons, though. See nukes:
the conversion efficiency of shortware photons into VIS and IR requires
negligable distances in atmosphere at ~1 atm pressure.

Radioisotope batteries. Not all of them are radiothermal.

For the same reason they don't design memory-CPU blocks bonded with heat
dissipation + networking, all in a handy pluggable module. Customers
apparently don't want it. AMD is losing credibility with the user base
right now, though, because it doesn't offer thermal protection. A naked
AMD CPU would self-destruct in less than a second.

Copper and diamond heat spreaders should be there quite soon, and advent
of liquid cooling is unavoidable. Voltage and structure shrink still gives
us some headway, but current designs are rapidly getting uncomfortably
hot. Asynchronous designs and power saving should do better, and even
reversible logic in semiconductors, eventually.

Latter is a must for computronium, of course.

Which historical texts describe the First World War as a history of
imperialism vs. human liberty? Fact: The predominant powers involved all
held territories and colonies that were viewed   by participants at the time
as imperial structures. The powers that fought each other included the
British Empire, the German Empire, the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Japanese Empire. The First World War was
not a conflict against imperialism; it was a war between empires and
nations. If you want to simplify such a complex history, you might view it
as a battle between empire and nation, within its European context.

If you wish to view a war in terms of the ideologies expressed by the
participants, how do you distinguish between their ideas and the propaganda
created in support of their point of view? Propaganda is a natural tool of
any nation at war and all sides lie about their intentions and their goals.
At least, any country at war has done this so far.

If you wish to view history through this construct of faith versus reason
(and it is not an interpretation that appears to have a great deal of
explanatory force), then surely you should note that one of the greatest
vehicles of faith since 1789 has been nationalism. Faith in one's nation has
been the motive for evil atrocities up to and including genocide. Would you
add the nationalist to your list?

Suppose a nanocivilization sent out nanobots aboard a von Neumann probe (or
otherwise) to our "lovely" planet. Their mission is to destroy any evidence
gathered by humans of the galactic civilization that in fact exists out
there. Is this scenario physically possible? No doubt the nanobots would
have no problem destroying various forms of physical evidence, presumably
the nanobots could munch-up photos, computer files, etc in quick order. For
example, SETI instruments might detect hundreds or thousands of signals
every night but the nanobots destroy the evidence before it is processed.
Suppose this process is not perfect and occasionally humans become cognizant
of some evidence of the existence of ETs. The question I am wondering is
whether there is any principled reason why the nanobots could not also
selectively destroy the associated human memories.  It seems likely that a
task of this complexity would require a network of nanobots, perhaps
connected to a CPU. In fact, if the nanobots can perform this sort of
selective memory purge (and perhaps replacement) then it seems quite
possible that ETs could be visiting us here on junkets from other stars.
Imagine that they walk down the main street of your hometown. Humans might
realize for a few seconds or minutes what they have seen (i.e., ETs) but
then the nanobots set to work doing damage control, namely, memory purging
and replacing, film eating, file destroying etc. So I ask (again) is there
any principled reason you can think of that would stop selective memory
destroying by nano in humans?
    Is such a scenario plausible? Well, we can say at minimum that it is
logically compatible with all the evidence we now possess, since by
hypothesis
any countervailing evidence is destroyed.  This conjecture is both refutable
and confirmable. The sort of evidence that would refute this conjecture is
if we discovered the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence, if SETI
succeeds for example. We can also imagine the conjecture being confirmed, if
the ETs decided one day to confess to their deception.
    Can we rule out this conjecture with occam's razor? Maybe, maybe not. In
terms of the Fermi paradox this conjecture is a variant on what is called
the 'zoo hypothesis': we are purposely being isolated from the galactic
civilization. So the question of whether this violates occam's razor is not
so straightforward as it might seem. The alternative solutions to the Fermi
paradox are not particularly inviting or necessarily simpler in themselves,
e.g., that we are the first technological civilization out of the gate, that
ETs exist but we just have not seen them or detected them yet. It is not
always clear how to head the advice, pluralitas non est ponenda sine
neccesitate.
     Another related place the meme snatcher conjecture is relevant is in
connection with Nick Bostrom's simulation argument.
http://www.simulation-argument.com/ I pointed out in the initial round of
the discussion of this argument that it is simply a special case of the more
general principle that we might be created by others. Thus, one way to make
our world is to do it in a computer simulation, another would be to create a
physical world and populate it with created humans. Both logical
possibilities seem easily implemented by a technologically advanced species.
As  I pointed out at the time, obviously the physical alternative does not
look very cost-effective in terms of matter/energy utilization. But who
knows? Perhaps they choose physical implementation because of its retro
appeal, or to heed some ethical imperative, or because creating
matter/energy is no sweat for them. In any event, at the time Robin Hanson
pointed out that this probably would require building some sort of screen
around our planet or solar system. Well, the meme snatcher conjecture offers
an alternate and perhaps more cost-effective means to hide the galactic
civilization.

Cheers, Mark.

Speaking of radiation density nearby hole, it seems the pure fusion output
of the accretion disk could outshine the hole itself, especially if you
jiggle the isotopic composition. The nuke could become very big indeed...

Then use a heat engine. With input in the millions and output at the
3 degree Kelvin microwave background level, efficiency would be
close to 100%.

There's an outfit in Los Alamitos (yet another LA suburb) that builds
copper etched-film laminate devices, mostly for active cooling of laser
diodes.  They built a combustion chamber for RotRock which I supervised
the testing of at 3000 lb thrust... I haven't heard any proposals for
making labyrinth cooling in silicon- if feasible it might be a good
improvement, and cheaper than attaching a separate copper heat
exchanger.  Liquid coolant would be superior to air, partly due to
better heat exchange, partly because the coolant could be kept cleaner
than air.

Odd. I've got three CPU chips from an old IBM mainframe (the whole CPU
was actually made up of I think 20 or 36 separate chips), each of which
had a cemented on heatsink. (I was thinking of bedding each in epoxy as
paperweights). You'd think that these guys would have improved things
since the old big blue days...

How quickly would the human brain cook if it didn't have liquid cooling?

The problem with the chips using conventional heatsinks is that the
place where the most heat is produced, the center of the chip, is the
furthest from the area of highest heatsink airflow. Doing the following
port scheme would optimize airflow:

Yet why is it that both alcohol and gambling are legal activities for
adults in most jurisdictions in the US, yet many perfectly normal adults
completely ruin their lives, and the lives of others (spouse/children
going homeless/malnourished, drunk driving homicides and injuries, etc)?
If the criminality of the substance were the only factor as you claim,
then alcholics and gambling addicts should have no negative impact on
society. The fact they do have one disproves the criminality theory.

### You have a good point here - however, I was mostly concerned with the
criminal aspects of drug addiction - the fact that addicts tend to have the
combination of poor ability to earn money, and a large appetite for cash
(secondary to high drug prices). This results in a fair amount of theft,
robbery, and other damaging activities, which are effectively the result of
voters' good intentions expressed as stupid laws, and could be effectively
eliminated by giving registered addicts access to drugs at low cost, as in
methadone programs. I guess I should have been more specific about my
meaning here.

As you rightly note, there are two other types of damage inflicted on third
parties by addicts - the damage done as direct result of impaired cognition
while under the influence (as in DUI, or drunk wife beating), and the damage
secondary to neglect of their usual social responsibilities. Again, my
statement did not directly deny this (I wrote about damage *mainly* and not
exclusively because of drug prices), although I should have mentioned that
at cost drug access programs would not mitigate these types of damage.

While I agree that the state should not regulate intake by adults (a
point which I have NEVER disputed, by the way), this does not mean that
addicts should not be held accountable for their actions just as
children and criminals are. Users should be required by their insurance
carriers (even in a libertarian setting) to adequately insure against
the externalities of their potential bad behavior while impaired and/or
addicted. If they do take care of this risk, then they can toke up with
my blessing.

### I fully agree with you here. I think your and Amara's views are not so
dissimilar when look at the details.

Not sure if you read my post on this. Since large quantities of hard
radiation pass right through objects, that which passes thru obviously
doesn't impart any energy, so your efficiency relative to total flux
drops as frequency rises. You'd have to develop a sort of MHD system for
x-ray/gamma ray streams.

But did imperialism survive WWI? Not really, and Wilson's lobbying and
public speaking pretty much killed the whole concept at wars end and
following. The carnage produced by the war between imperialists
convinced enough people that imperialism was a dumb idea, and the fact
that the US was needed to end the war helped put the nails in the
coffin.
Wilson began the movement for internation recognition of human rights as
something beyond the ability or right of governments to oppress. That it
took till the end of WWII for this to come to fruition is only proof of
the maxim that who wins wars is really only decided by the next war.

Propaganda, per se, is not always a lie. There are two forms of
propaganda: information and disinformation. One is truth, the other is
falsehood.

Yes. However, nationalism being wrong and false does not mean that
everything it involves is automatically false (just as a KKK member can
still tell the truth when he says the sky is blue). Objectively ranking
one form of polity as objectively better than another is significantly
different from having blind faith in one's nation, right or wrong.

A minor, but important, clarification: if two countries ar at war,
_at least_ one of them is lying; it's quite possible (indeed likely)
that both of them are.  It's the same with personal conflict: if
two people have strongly-held beliefs that directly oppose on
another, at least one of them is wrong--but that in no way implies
that one of them is right.

The March issue of WIRED has a blurb about a breakthrough in
thermoelectric cooling, the new process is 2.5 times more efficient
and 23,000 times faster.

It was accomplished at North Carolina's Research Triangle Institute
under a DARPA grant.

The new structure is an atomically precise super lattice of bismuth
telluride. one layered with antimony (antimony twice in two days?)
telluride, and one with bismuth telluride selenide. Spot cooling of
processors is mentioned, and since the device is actually a heat
pump as well, localized heating/cooling for DNA Microarrays is
mentioned.

Lead scientist Rama Venkatasubramanian.

The March issue's focus is AI (kind of weak) and there's another
blurb about Eweapons Mike...

I think the real relevance of the drug addiction issue to Extropians
is how it prefigures the conflicts which will arrive when more powerful
brain alterations are possible.

Drugs provide only crude tools for altering mental function.  In the
future we will probably have much more effective means.  However these
will not necessarily be any more socially acceptable.  Someone could still
change his mind into a vegetative euphoric state, or into a goal-driven
socially-oblivious obsession.  They might still abandon children, or not
pay creditors, or harm whatever other victims are offered up to justify
penalizing drug use.

What should the Extropian attitude be towards brain alterations?
Does society have the right to require people to behave in certain
conventional ways?  Can they be allowed to seek their own path even if
it looks to outsiders like a mistake?

And to the extent that we do want to enforce certain rules, like not
allowing violence to others, or requiring attention to children, should
we ban the technology, or just punish the behavior?  Should we say that
applying electronic currents to the brain is illegal, like we now say
that injecting heroin is illegal?  Should someone who abandons their
children be treated differently if they have also altered their brain?

Given the complexity of biological alterations which will be possible,
I think the only sensible approach is to judge behavior and not the
means and motivation behind it.  Rather than saying that drug users
should be penalized because they sometimes abandon their children,
we should say that abandoning children is illegal and people who do
so should be punished, whether they are using drugs, or have altered
their brain in any other way, or were genetically altered at birth,
or are just plain normal human beings (if that means anything).

Knowing what lies ahead, doesn't it make sense to adopt the same position
with regard to drug use today?  Surely Extropians don't need to be trapped
in the same back and forth, liberal vs conservative arguments we can find
on the editorial page of any newspaper.  We have a unique perspective on
the problem, and we should bring that to bear in analyzing these issues.
For most people, the prospect of brain alterations is nothing more than
science fiction, of no relevance to present day issues.  Extropians should
know better.

That's outrageous! They're probably susceptible to out-of-spec
voltages/currents and can be damaged with even a light hammer
blow. Damn those penny pinching bastards.

Seriously, though, Intel chips don't have built-in fuses, they rely on
the mainboard or power supply to not fry them. Does this cost Intel
credibility? This is pretty obvious FUD from Intel.

Intelligent, sophisticated--also forgetful and undisciplined ("Lazy"? Perish the thought!), sometimes.
In some cases whole-quoting is due to a desire to not leave out context because of past experience
with people losing each others' threads of thought because of _under_ quoting. The medium has so many
limitations that paper has not, and Edwardian-quality correspondence is not practiced by most here.

But trimming posts remains a significant courtesy, and from time to time a reminder is helpful.
"Basic" is not the same as "habitual". It seems it was your turn to courteously remind folks. Thanks. 

Cordially,

One is reminded of the Tleilaxu axolotl tanks of Frank Herbert's Dune. These
"tanks" were eventually revealed to be not tanks, however, but females
''almost immobile in their grossness" engineered to grow whatever embryos
were deposited in them (such as the Duncan Idaho gholas ad infinitum). The
technological womb seems to be the more ethical path, at least, but there's
still plenty of room for abuse.

Abuse?  Abuse how?  I suggest you read Lois McMaster Bujold's "Barrayar"
novels and see what Cordelia Naismith had to say to those foolish primitive
Barrayans about the massive barbarism and unsafety of forcing women to bear
children inside their own body.  I think the vulnerability of the child to
ingested toxins, the possibility of maternal accidents, the inegalitarian
ungainliness of the female during pregnancy, and of course the horrific pain
of "natural" childbirth, were some of the major problems on Cordelia's mind.

Yes, Robert, and neither do I. I was speaking of that notion as a Big Lie,
and the consequent "how to deal with useful idiots" issue. I didn't mean to 
say that I thought the notion was a good one. "Drexlerian" is a cartoonish word, 
and it might have already caught on in some circles--I can't tell, I'm not privy.

Sorry, I meant "appear to ignore it". Avoid mentioning the elephant at the breakfast table.
In this case, the elephant isn't Drexler or anything in his books, it's the bogus notion that
["Drexlerian"==extreme==self-replicating assemblers-har-har-how-silly-end-of-story]... 
Along the lines of a tacit pleasant nod followed by ruthless intellectual honesty about 
the science that applies to a problem at hand, not mentioning how much of it is Eric's work--
let the other guy come to new conclusions re: Drexler (if ever) on his own schedule. 

Don't defend Eric, end run the bigots and use them; that was the thrust of my thinking.
A sheaf of strategies is probably called for. I have a tendency to strident defense
of the unjustly-maligned; perhaps I was only coaching myself out loud for more diplomacy.

There are sobering comparisons to be made. You probably got the last two references 
in my prior post, Robert, but to belabor it:

Goddard eventually got a cheesy little contract to work on bazookas even though "Goddardian" 
was (virtually) a kiss of death. [Rockets can't work in a vacuum/Everyone knows 'space travel' 
is just _crazy_...(--pick any roughly analogous smear/lie)]. 

Contrariwise, von Braun and the VfR were in the same time frame responsible for the creation 
and launch of _thousands_ of near-space vehicles--but they were weapons, aimed at London and Antwerp. 

Hmmm. *MMB looks around for better alternatives than those two...*

Perhaps I was hyperfocusing on #2 of these three; and as I say, maybe mostly trying to 
remind myself to not gracelessly and aggressively react to those who use the word "Drexlerian" 
as a dismissive epithet. 

Thanks for the (as always, thoughtful) reply.

Yes, indeed. This is *exactly* the kind of issue that should be discussed 
carefully in the newly reactivated Extropy: The Journal of Transhumanist 
Solutions. I can think of a few sharp minds who would be good to kick off 
such a discussion, such as.... Hal.

Onward!

The simple answer is no. There is not one piece of evidence that such a

memory munchers would be actively, altering human neurochemicals, after a

earth savages.

Supers: We exist!

Earth Savages:
A:  Cool!

Here is  
                   a nice, juicy, meteorite to suck on. Enjoy your new stone

such powerful 
                    technology.

<<Another related place the meme snatcher conjecture is relevant is in
connection with Nick Bostrom's simulation argument.
http://www.simulation-argument.com/ I pointed out in the initial round of

physical world and populate it with created humans. >>

I have read Dr. Bostrom's thesis several times, and still can't saavy why he 
believes the world is a simmulation. In a simm, there less need for 
tactillity (tactile-ness) and embeded data. Embeded, as in the 
deeper(smaller) one has researched, the more info one can produce. Similarly 
the farther out one ventures into space, also results in more, richer data. A 
simm, by necessity, would merely have a gridwork of data, enoug, merely to 
support the simm.  If there is more data, as I state that there is, then we 
do not have a simm, but possibly a genuine, created universe; perhaps created 
Andrei Linde style.             

On another matter, your conference on Practical Cosmology, perhaps needs to 
include something like Existential Cosmology, touching upon meaning, or 
pain-relief, (at least!). I remember reading John Leslie's books (Professor 
at the U of Guelph) which covered this issue, a bit.

Please, people! Change the header lines. I considered the topic I chose important.
Evidently you don't, and want to geek out on chip tech. Groovy. But let's try to

<This Venetian Macrocosm brought to you by your servant, 
               Amara>

You forgot to mention this little venetian story, just one among 
a thousands.

Johannes Kepler published his 'Harmonices Mundi' in 1619 (Linz).
In this book he describes, for the very first time, his famous 
'stellarum duodecim planarum pentagonicarum', that is to say
the stellated dodecahedron.

Unfortunately (for Kepler) at least one marble inlay featuring 
the stellated dodecahedron is located in the floor of the Basilica 
of St. Mark in Venice. According to Lucio Saffaro and M. Muraro
Paolo Uccello, known as a master painter and as a master 
mosaicist, made this inlay well before 1430.

Actually, in most AMD CPUs you have the naked die underside looking at
you. A number of people had to find out how brittle silicon is the hard
way (chipped edges at best, dead die at worst).

No idea. I'm told recent AMDs have built-in thermal protection, but no
motherboard so far (?) supports that. Given that their power density is
currently higher than Intel, this means instant thermal death if your heat
sink grows a gap, or a slow death if your fan fails or the fan connector
gets unplugged.

> credibility? This is pretty obvious FUD from Intel.

Nope, that's empirical observation from the trenches. Thermal design for
AMDs is far more critical than Intel. For time being, I'm rather fond of
AMDs, and this won't deter me from building my viz/number crunch box on
AMD. Meanwhile, my current box is a 700 MHz Intel Celeron (Coppermine)
stepping 06 (hey, I got it virtually for free), and my server/network
appliance will be based on an 1.3 GHz Tualatin Celery. Part of my choice
was a form factor, part of it was uncritical thermal and acoustical
design.

Imperialism, as an ideology, did survive the Great War. Moreover, one can
argue that its ideological underpinnings were strengthened by the downfall
of the Dual Monarchy, Germany, Russia and the Ottomans. Countries during the
interwar period who wished to overturn the Versailles treaty settlement
viewed the expansion of their power in territorial and inperialistic terms:
German lebensraum, Italy in Abyssinia, Japan and Manchukuo. Their
governmental ideologies incorporated the dynamic of imperialism and married
it to new racial and national extremes.

The British and French empires remained in existence at this time, and
remained symbols of national strength for their electorates.
Anti-imperialistic arguments in Europe were mainly derived from
Marxist-Leninist theory and never gained much credence beyond the Left.

Imperialism in Britain eventually lost its ideological grip with the
Atlantic Charter.

Perhaps imperialism did lose its ideological hold upon the US under Wilson
but the Versailles Treaty and its principle of self-determination had to
battle with the long-standing notions of racial and cultural superiority
that justified empire.

Propaganda is always a form of untruth as the authors wish the reader or
observer to privelege a particular interpretation. The author is hoping that
their work is structured in such a way that it will make your mind up for
you.

Studies of British propaganda during WWII found that it was not possible to
modify deeply held attitudes but that you could reinforce and exacerbate
preexisting attitudes.

The terms 'false' and 'wrong' are only applicable if you wish to view
history as a conflict between rationalism and irrationalism (which would
include your definition of faith). However, it is not possible for a
nationalist to set down objective criteria in order to assess nations, as
s/he develops an exaggerated sense of belonging to their own nation through
sentiment and/or loyalty. This is not a statement saying that the objective
ranking of polities is impossible but that one has to reflect on these views
and discount them before attempting suvh an assessment.

*Nano protein array could be just the tool for probing interactions on
biological scale. By using the technique known as dip-pen nanolithography,
chemists at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago have made
protein arrays with feature sizes ranging from 100 to 350 nm. The advance
could lead to protein or nucleic acid arrays--useful screening tools--that
are 1 million to 10 million times denser than those currently available.

1000/1821440.stm

A leading surgeon in the US has told BBC News that he is ready to perform the 
world's first transplant of an artificially grown organ. 


Tissue engineering... should help reduce the number of patients on a 
transplant list 
 
Dr Anthony Atala  
Dr Anthony Atala, of the Boston Children's Hospital, says he hopes to put a 
laboratory-engineered bladder into a patient once he has obtained the 
necessary regulatory approval. 

He believes permission for the procedure, which has been pioneered in dogs, 
will come within the next few months. 

Dr Attalla says that if he is successful with the bladder transplant, he will 
attempt to repair damaged hearts with new muscle and possibly even try to 
grow a kidney. 

Polymer ball 

"I think over time there will be no limit," Dr Atala said. "I think it is 
just a question of figuring out all the different tissue types and cell types 
and how they work best, but eventually I think that following the same 
strategies just about every organ in the body will be repairable at the very 
least." 

It was exactly two years ago that a team from the Laboratory for Tissue 
Engineering at the Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston 
announced that it had successfully implanted six beagle dogs with lab-grown 
bladders. 

Tissue samples were taken from the animals' original bladders and these were 
used to cultivate the muscle cells and special bladder skin cells, called 
urothelial cells, needed to construct the artificial organs. 

The multiplying cells were shaped into beagle bladders by bedding them down 
over polymer balls. Transplanted into the dogs, these lab-grown organs 
allowed the animals to urinate normally. 

Important ally 

Dr Atala believes his technique is sufficiently well developed that it could 
be used to treat a young child. 

A lab-grown bladder could be the answer for a patient whose own organ has 
been destroyed by cancer or damaged by an infection or injury. 

Dr Atala is seeking approval for human trials from the US Food and Drug 
Administration. 

Although tissue engineering has huge potential, Dr Atala believes there will 
always be a need for donor organs. "I think tissue engineering is just 
another solution but it should help reduce the number of patients on a 
transplant list." 

And, he believes, tissue engineering will prove to be a useful ally to the 
emerging field of stem cell medicine, in which "young" cells are injected 
into ailing tissue to regenerate it. 

"For example, with a patient who has a failing heart, where obviously it 
would be very hard to get a biopsy because they would not tolerate the 
procedure; then I think stem cells would be the ideal answer."

I posted the web page that dealt with the 'meaning of life'
<http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/tmol-faq.html > with an extropian view point
on the Skeptic forum.  I received some posts discussing how to calculate the
computing power of the human brain, thought others may be interested in
contributing to the discussion, hopefully some will have more knowledge on
the subject than I.  The Thread is below.  You can get to the forum at

<<the raw power of a human brain - i.e., around a hundred million billion
(10^17) operations per second >> 

    I'm interested to know how you got to that number. 

    << As of 2000, computing power has doubled every two years, like
clockwork, for the past fifty-five years. This is known as
    "Moore's Law". >> 

    Moore's Law suffers from what I call the "extrapolation fallacy". It
consist in drawing curve through past data, and predict
    that the future data will follow that curve, without any consideration
of cause-effect relationships. However, there are
    examples that extrapolation not always work. For example, if you look at
bacteria multiplying in a culture vat, extrapolation
    would lead you to predict that you will soon have an infinite number of
bacteria (a Singularity!). This is because bacteria
    multiply exponentially (at first!) However, after a while the growth
curve breaks away from the exponential and goes into a
    plateau. This happens because previously unseen cause-effect
relationships (depletion of nutrients, accumulation of toxins,
    etc) kick in. I think that we will soon see that growth in computer
technology starts to deviate from Moore's Law. 

    Beware of the "extrapolation fallacy"! We see more and more examples of
it - Bjorn Lomborg uses it a lot in his book. Any
    prediction based in extrapolations instead of rigurous cause-effect
relationship is highly suspect!

    -------------------------

<<the raw power of a human brain - i.e., around a hundred million billion

    "I'm interested to know how you got to that number. " 

    Well, I did not do the calculation myself, but if you check the source
page I am sure the author has a link to it. Actually, I
    checked again, the author cites their sources right after each
statement. As far as the Brain calculation power goes, the
    Author says "2: I use the generous estimate of a hundred billion
neurons, with around a thousand synapses apiece,
    sending around two hundred signals per second, plus a factor of five for
good luck. For a much more detailed (albeit
    outdated) analysis, see "When will computer hardware match the human
brain?
    <http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm>" 

    << As of 2000, computing power has doubled every two years, like

    Law". >> 

    "Moore's Law suffers from what I call the "extrapolation fallacy". It
consist in drawing curve through past data, and predict
    that the 
    future data will follow that curve, without any consideration of
cause-effect relationships." 

    This is true, and I agree. I thought it was an interesting site. 
    Nonetheless, there are different types of 'extrapolation fallacies',
like the Elhric 'hundreds of millions will starve to death in
    the 80's because food production can not keep up with demand' What
happened to these Wide spread famines? Elhric
    drew trends out of food production, food demand, and growth rates, he
did not take into account Advances in agricultural
    technologies which increased food production (even though these had been
obvious from the historical record) This is a limit
    predicting extrapolation fallacy, and assumes a technological stasis. I
find these criticisms highly dubious and on par with
    the 'everything that can be invented has been' mentality. 

    Conversely, Moores law is not describing the limits of growth, is it
making a reasonable projection based on historical
    trends. Ray Kurzweil (http://www.kurzweiltech.com/aboutray.html) makes a
good case in his book 'The Age Of Spiritual
    Machines' that computing technology has followed Moore's law since
Babbages mechanical computer. Critics of Moor's law
    often cite technological limits, things like the size of the wires,
quamtum mecahnical interference, or the like. But I catagorize
    these with the 'everything that can be invented has' mentality, and they
do not take into account technological innovations.
    Kurzweil tracks Moore's law from the mechanical computer, to the
mechanical punch cards of the early part of this century,
    to the vacuum tube computers, to the transistor. Each time the practical
limit was reached of the previous technology, the
    successive one takes over. When the limits of the transistor is hit, any
one of numerous technologies is poised to take over,
    Optical computers, quantum computers, molecular computers, etc. etc. 

    You place a limit on moore's law due to some type of cause effect
relationship, yet its very obvious that one type of
    computing technology, the organic brain, is still vastly superior to
conventional transistor based technologies. Here we have
    a tangible example of a far more sophistaced computing machine than we
can make, so it is reasonable that some trend will
    continue until *at least* a computer matches the power of the human
brain. To think otherwise would seem, at least to me,
    to be attributing some special supernatural quality to organic
computational systems that inorgantic or 'man made' ones will
    never surpass. 

    It seems odd that you cite an 'extrapolation fallacy' when you are one
of the biggest arguers for global warming (which, it
    seems, is SOLELY based on extrapolitve predictions) 

    "I think that we will soon see that growth in computer technology starts
to deviate from Moore's Law. " 

    I think we may see a limit at one time, but not (I think) at least until
a computer can match a human mind. But only time will
    tell.

     ---------------------------

<< the Author says "2: I use the generous estimate of a hundred billion
neurons, with around a thousand synapses apiece,
    sending around two hundred signals per second, plus a factor of five for
good luck. >> 

    So we have (^ means exponent): 

    10^11 neurons x 10^3 synapses/neuron = 10^14 synapses in the human brain


    This is the standard estimate of synapses in the human brain, and I
agree with it. Let's look a the following step: 

    10^14 synapses x 200 signals/synapse, sec x 5 (good luck) = 10^17
signals/sec 

    5 for "good luck" is just trash 
    Synapses don't process signals at 200 Hz (per sec). The typical synapse
signal is the EPSP or the IPSP, which has a
    duration of 5-20 millisec. So it's more like 100 Hz: 

    10^14 synapses x 100 signals/ synapse, sec = 10^16 signals/sec, the
absolute maximum possible in the human brain 

    Or, if you want, NEURONS do send signals (action potentials) up to 500
Hz so 

    10^11 neurons x 500 signals/neuron = 5 x 10^13 signal/sec, a smaller
number 

    Realistically, taking into account that not all synapses work all the
time (that would be an epileptic seizure), that the brain is
    not a perfect parallel computer, and that there is a lot of redundancy
in it, I would put that number at 10^13 Hz
    (signals/sec). And I think that even that is optimistic. 

    So the human brain is not so far above computers when it comes to
process information. The PC I use to write this works at
    10^9 Hz, so my brain has the computing power of ten thousand PCs -
disapointing!. 

    I don't think that you can invoke "biological computer" technology to
move forward Moore's Law. Brains are not a whole lot
    better than computers, when put exclusively in terms of information
processing. 

    I'll answer the rest of your points later.

And stuff doesn't always roll downhill, but that's the way to bet.

Approximation and metaphor are how humans think, and they deny, and they see what they expect, 
and they trust, and they rarely think well. Fiction piles upon fiction. Oddly, I've never seen 
any propaganda pertaining to mathematics, arguably the most verifiable domain of human endeavor.

So... What is true, where politicians are concerned?

Give me an answer I can truly swallow, and I'll arrange a ride on a unicorn pony for you. 
With a heart tattoo on its butt. Honest.

But remember the joke about the kid mucking out the chock-full stable on his birthday:

=============================================================
-If there is no Singularity within, say, 100 years, no successful recoveries 
of the cryonically suspended, no sucessful memory upload to clones, no FTL or 
relativistic space travel, then this article does have considerable meaning. 
=============================================================
 http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991936
  
"Magic number" for space pioneers calculated 
 
  
The "magic number" of people needed to create a viable population for 
multi-generational space travel has been calculated by researchers. It is 
about the size of a small village - 160. But with some social engineering it 
might even be possible to halve this to 80.

Anthropologist John Moore from University of Florida tackled the problem as 
part of a combined effort with space scientists to determine how in future 
humans might successfully undertake century-long journeys out into space. 

In the past, attention has been focused on cryogenics, sperm banks and 
military-style modes of operation, says Moore, but "the 'right stuff' for a 
journey into space is the family - a million-year-old institution designed to 
assist reproduction."

Moore has previously studied small migrating populations of early humans and 
has developed simulation software - called Ethnopop - for analysing the 
viability of small groups. 


Marriage partners 


For a space trip of 200 years, perhaps eight to 10 generations, his 
calculations suggest a minimum number of 160 people are needed to maintain a 
stable population. 

This would produce around 10 potential marriage partners per person, he says, 
and if this seems a small number, "think about how many people you dated 
before you got married".

Room would be at a premium on any spacecraft and reducing the number of 
people initially required might be desirable. Moore suggests two strategies. 
The first is to begin with young childless couples, echoing the practice of 
Polynesian seafaring colonists.

The second is to ask the space crew to postpone reproduction to later in 
woman's fertile period, perhaps age 35 to 40, creating longer time gaps 
between the generations. This measure results in a stable population of just 
80 but the consequences of the increased medical risks of late childbirth 
have not yet been considered.

A potential concern is that small populations can suffer a damaging reduction 
in genetic diversity due to inbreeding, says Dennis O'Rourke from the 
University of Utah. He considered the same 10-generation, 200-year journey as 
Moore and looked at both genetic drift and inbreeding.

"The decrease in genetic variation is actually quite small and less than 
found in some successful small populations on Earth," he says. "It would not 
be a significant factor as long as the space travellers come home or interact 
with other humans at the end of the 200 year period."


Gene screening 


O'Rourke believes that a more serious concern would be the presence of 
potentially damaging genotypes in the initial space pioneers. Genetic 
screening might well be needed, he says: "Any harmful recessive 
characteristics might lead to increased healthcare loads which would deplete 
scarce resources."

A final concern raised at the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science's annual meeting in Boston was the possibility of infighting. Small 
communities isolated for long periods at research stations in Antarctic and 
even families travelling on long car journeys, provide examples of how small 
conflicts can quickly escalate.

But Moore points out: "Some small island communities on Earth have lived in 
peace and harmony for thousands of years because they have developed ways of 
solving conflicts. These are not taken to Antarctica."

I agree, but one has to ask what what level of "proof" would be
required that such nanobots do not exist.  To prove it demonstrably
in my mind, one would need to slice up the brains of every
individual on the planet at the 0.1-1 micron level and look

Paraphrasing Sagan, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

This of course begs the issue -- why would "aliens" need to appear
as "visible" UFOs?  If they simply crawl around at the micron or
sub-micron level we are going to be hard pressed to notice them.

I would tend to agree.  If aliens exist as ubiquitous bacteria
(remember each human has ~40 trillion of these on or in their body),
then there is no reason that they need to create macro-scale phenomena
that humans would ever detect.  Think of this at the bacterial level --
I have a packet of 1 Mbit that I want to deliver (the packets could
be *much* more complex than that).  They are blown around by wind,
water currents, etc. until they are in a significantly different
location.  Every bacteria they come into contact with they exchange
"send this East" with "send this West" packets.  Simple random encounters
are going to result in a significant propagation of packets around the
globe.

This may be a subtle point, I'm not sure.  But obviously there is a
transition point between whether one wants to run the "reality" in a
virtual world or the physical world.  It depends largely, I think, on
how soon one would like to see the results and the granularity of the
simulations (finer granularity presumably has greater needs to move
into the real "reality") and perhaps on an economic analysis of how
much of the available energy in the universe do you use to run
the simulation in a VR vs. reality (if one is looking at optimizing
ones long term resources).  In the visible universe, little optimization
seems to be taking place, so we are either in the real reality or one
constructed to appear as if the optimization of resource utilization
is of no concern.

Its a numbers argument.  If "perceived" reality is a reflection of
"real" reality and in our "real" reality we can foresee the possibility
of running such simulations, then the odds are that we are one of
the simulations rather than the "real" reality (because the number
of simulations is much greater than the single reality).

But can you cite evidence that documents the amount of data that must
be out there vs. the amount of data that can generated either by
a mathematical algorithm (e.g. fractals) or random chaos theory
that could easily be produced in a sim?  And how does one differentiate
between the "real" data and the data generated "on demand"?

I haven't read Leslie's books, but don't see why "Practical Cosmology"
need include "Existential Cosmology".  In practical cosmology, one might
ask what fraction of the dust Amara sees in the Universe is composed of
Hall Utility Foglets.  Existential Cosmology might ask whether or not
the Utility Foglets enjoy their existence drifting between stars.

As I think was pointed out not too long ago in the discussion about
the "purpose of life", Rand would classify this as a categorization
error.

Well that certainly is logical. However, there are so many human example of 
performing projects that are anti-economical, like idiotic wars etc. To 
propose that this is a non-reality, must require some evidence, I would 
think. Carl Sagan also said that extrodinary claims require extrodinary 
evidence. Where is the red pill? (matrix-speak)

I believe that it does matter that the Utility Fog does or does not enjoy its 
existence as it drifts amongst the stars, and that's what makes it all 
practical. If the Utility Foglet decided that human music is rather enjoyable 
to study, and imitate, then there is a practicality to existentialist 
cosmology. If a human being decides that She or He wishes to make their 
living as an Astronomer, and would not like being a Marketing Sales Rep, then 
there is a practical-ness to their choice of careers. Existential may indeed 
seemingly impact the practical. 

Similarly, the Utility Fog may decide to pay the Solar System a friendly, 
vist (No Sunlight Blocking Please) and converse with the planets inhabitants 
via radio signal. It might exchange some useful information in a trade of 
music data for fusion power data, for example. Certainly, the earth's human 
population would have the existential experiences changed. 

I do hope that Professor Walker also chimes in regarding this thread, but 
then it might serve him no practical use, or existential pleasure ;-)

Well, no, and yes. WWI was initially a war between empires. WWII was a
war between empire builders and democracy builders. The British Empire
was on the ropes through the 1920's and 30's, as was the French. Germany
lost its colonies entirely and AustroHungary was broken up entirely at
Versailles. The British only kept India through WWII by promising to
grant independence after the war. Italy, well, Italy, quitely plainly,
was a joke as far as imperialists go. The Ottomans fell after WWI as
well.

THis is not really that accurate. Wilson's ideas gained quite a wide
public acceptance throughout Europe after the war, it was really only
the aristocrats who resented the implications.

But nothing you say here demonstrates that all interpretations are
untruths. If even on interpretation is accurate, then propaganda for
that point of view is not an untruth.

On the contrary, stunning defeats are quite effective at making people

On the contrary, the individual should decide first what sort of country
they think, according to facts of human nature, would be the best to
live and prosper in, then see what countries match up best to those
criteria.

I think that Persinger's experiments with triggering hypnogogic seizures
(i.e. the 'religious' or 'abduction' experience) with cycling magnetic
fields on the brain demonstrate that there is a significant degree of
stimuli needed to trigger these odd experiences, which could be easily
triggered by nanoprobes tapping directly into the neural net of the
brain.

One need not slice and dice brains to find them, I think.

I just went to donate blood today and participated in the pheresis
procedure, where they filter out the red blood cells and give you back
your plasma and platelets. A similar process could be instituted on
college campuses to process students blood and test it for presence of
nanoprobes and their side products. If you expect that x percent of
nanoprobes will fail in a given amount of time, you should find some in
any given sample of blood.

Now, to prevent the nanites from suspecting anything, if you disguise
the process as a run of the mill pheresis procedure, so that even the
students dont know they are being scanned, then it should be possible to
spot them if they are in fact there. Now, you could target specific
individuals by running a totally separate study to privately interview
individuals who have had hynogogic experiences in the past, then focus
on them when they go to 'give blood'.

Well, the question of the presence of nano-probes or even
nano-civilizations living as 'crypto-dirt' is a very important test to
the question of whether we live in a simulation, because if you accept
the reasoning of the Fermi Paradox, either they are here as nanites and
we just haven't detected them yet, or else they aren't here for the
simple reason that the universe is a simulation which is FAR younger
than our observations would indicate, which is why we have not seen
alien species jetting all over (or living as nanites in our brains or in
the dustmice.)

Gina,

It's so wonderful to see you back! : )  I think we are entering a really good time for the list, and your Nanogirl News will be a big part of that.  I have certainly missed it, but more especially you.

very best wishes,

John

I sent this gloomy clipping:

        Recent tests by two laboratories hired by the
        prosecution and the defense came up with the
        same results: both rapes were committed by the
        same man, and that man was not Bruce
        Godschalk.

        Even so, the Montgomery County district
        attorney, Bruce L. Castor Jr., whose office
        convicted Mr. Godschalk, has refused to let Mr.
        Godschalk out of prison, saying he believes that
        Mr. Godschalk is guilty and that the DNA testing
        is flawed.

................

Thank Watson and Crick, he's now free!

NYT sez:

Exonerated by DNA testing after 15 years in prison, Bruce
Godschalk was released, despite the resistance of the
district attorney.

 Let's respond to these assertions step by step.

> Well, no, and yes. WWI was initially a war between empires.

Yes, but it ended as a war that fostered empires as well. Those states who
won expanded their territories. Great Britain's empire was at its peak in
terms of territory following the war as the settlement was structured on
imperial terms. Why? Because self-determination, the major achievement of
Wilsonian diplomacy, which favoured minority (rather than human) rights, was
considered applicable to Europe rather than to the imperial territories by
the existing empires. Their subjects were viewed as racially and culturally
inferior, ie they did not have the requisite qualities of governance that
would allow self-determination to proceed.

Both Empires suffered from 'imperial overstretch' and the economic
dislocations that disfigured this period. But there is no historical
evidence to suggest that the governing classes of either country were
willing to give up territory at this time or were losing control of their
colonies (and this includes the transfer of self-governance to the Old
Commonwealth). If you are referring to the policy of appeasement, then you
must take into account the timescales that Stanley Baldwin and Neville
Chamberlain were juggling with to provide a feasible timescale for
rearmamemnt.

To the contrary, Ghandi rejected the proposals of Sir Stafford Cripps's
mission in 1942 and embarked on the 'Quit India' campaign, a continuation of
nonviolent pressure upon the Raj in order to obtain self-government and
postwar independence. The British, faced with an invasion of the japanese
from Burma, rounded up Ghandi, Nehru and outlawed the Congress Party.
Postwar independence was a political goal of the 1945 Labour government and
this was the open door through which the independence of India was achieved.


 Italy, well, Italy, quitely plainly,
> was a joke as far as imperialists go.

Italy was a pivotal state for european diplomacy from 1932 to 1936 and was
not considered a joke by then. It was also a good example of why territory
does not equal power as much as influence does.

The Ottomans fell after WWI as

This should be viewed on national rather than social criteria. New states in
Europe, whose legitimations were based upon the principle of
self-determination and the rights of nations to create their own countries,
would be attracted to this particular unspoken principle of Wilson's 14
points. Most of his points referred to Europe and where he did argue that
the indigenous people should have their views taken into account in the
adjustment of colonies ("Point V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely
impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance
of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the
interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the
equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined."), he
was ignored.

Here, we are probably saying similar things in different ways. A reader
would be able to gauge what may be true within propaganda if he has
sufficient knowledge and critical faculties to maintain a sceptical stance.
However, if an author has structured his work (be it a book, an article or a
film) to persuade the reader that a particular political goal is worthwhile,
then surely that work can no longer be considered objective as it is a tool
to promote a particular worldview.

Just to clarify here, these studies were looking at Home Front propaganda.
Leaflets over Axis countries had little effect and, as you quite rightly
say, defeat and unconditional surrender destroyed the legitimacy of the
fascist and Nazi regimes. It does show that propaganda has limited affects
at the end of the day and demonstrates that governments have limited
abilities to re-engineer the cultural sensibilities of their citizens.

Can this work in practice? My suburban south-east englishness is engrained
and, even after discounting its contribution to my conscious sense of
identity, it remains the mould for my habits and sentiments. I will always
be biased to a certain region, my own locality, through habit and
familiarity. You offer a tabula rasa that requires a reinvention of identity
most individuals are unable to achieve - an unattainable level of
objectivity.

Oh my god, the Meme in Black!

They don't seem to have been terribly successful so far (that is, the
suggestion is NOT `logically compatible with all the evidence we now
possess'), since the abduction meme is to be found on every news stand.
True, their cunning plan might be to render sightings ridiculous, but why
bother if they can selectively zap evidence and even memories? And if they
can't, what sort of pathetic half-arsed memovores *are* these critters?

By a strange coincidence (or IS it? I THINK NOT), I've just started reading
NEEDLE, a 1949 classic sf novel by Hal Clement (Harry Stubbs). His alien
Hunter is a highly intelligent 4 lb skinless liquid/jelly symbiont that
oozes into the pores of its vehicle-host and lives off oxygen and nutrients
abstracted from the host's metabolism. Lacking telepathy or other super
powers, it needs to find plausible ways to communicate with the host (in
this case a teenage schoolboy) without causing meltdown freakouts. The
book's clunky--but then it was written more than half a century ago, when
sf was still young--but it's a more interesting spin that Heinlein's puppet
masters from two years later. I found it in the recent NESFA compendium of
three Clement novels, charmingly titled TRIO FOR SLIDE RULE AND TYPEWRITER.

I think we may be talking past each other here. I realize that sometimes
when people say 'possibility' they mean something like 'plausibility' or
'probability' but this is not what I was asking at this stage. What I am
asking is whether this sort of meme snatching would violate anything we know
about the physical laws of the universe, e.g., if human brains were of such
a delicate and interwoven constitution that removing one memory would
destroy the whole brain then this would count against the physical
possibility of this scenario. Of course, what we know of human brains is
that they are not like this. As for the plausibility of the meme snatcher
conjecture perhaps it will help to clarify if I put the point about evidence
for this scenario paradoxically: the best evidence we have for the
conjecture is that we do not have any evidence for the conjecture.

I hope the subject matter is already sufficiently broad to attract interest.
Furthermore, it is possible that some aspects of the topics of meaning and
pain reduction might already fall under the purview of Practical Cosmology
in that they might figure in agents practical reasoning about how to remake
the universe. However, I will keep your suggestion in mind. Thanks! Mark.

Far be it from me to disturb blanket generalizations of such

I find it interesting that a lot of the shadiest dealings of our 
own government (CIA especially) were funded illicitly with drug 
money.  Run a latter day prohibition to jack up the price and 
simultaneously erode the freedom of the populace while 
increasing the power of governemnt AND profit from the higher 
prices to fund yet more black ops.  Very tidy.  And not to be 
blamed on the addict principally if you ask me.

Yes.  And better controls with far less erosion of freedom.

The best thing anyone can do, drug addict, user or utterly 
sober, and by far the most patriotic, is to oppose this bloated 
monster pretending to be our government with everything at our 
disposal.  I fear it far more than terrorists of the 
non-domestic governmental kind.

Uh-oh. Natasha, I think someone must be doing it wrong. Against your leg is
*close*, but not quite there yet. You might send him off for instruction,
or I could provide a brief description in an offlist email sent in a plain

1. Their job is only to remove true positives--so the sightings you are
referring to are not sightings of ETs. (Since we are in a zoo they don't
want to upset our natural environment, which naturally includes a lot of
false positives).
2. We are already at equilibrium: if they destroy too many reports it
requires more energy to keep a lid on things. I don't know, would SETI
research be further along today if historically there were fewer flakes
claiming to have been abducted?
3. We are being slowly acclimated to the galactic environment.
4. They are running an experiment on epistemic trust.
5. Just for the sheer joy of fucking with us.
6. And the crowd pleaser: to what sort of pathetic half-arsed memovores
*are* these Critters? They are government-worker nanobots.

Hmm. Every head cut off? This begs the question who is going to do the
confirming. They say chickens can run around for a while with their heads
cut-off. I suppose we should not eliminate entirely the possibility of this
experiment being confirmed by a headless scientist. ;)

Quick as a flash, some guy was whining about this. I replied thus:

>Another ethical minefield opens: the cloning of pets.

Are you sure you don't mean the *owning* of pets?

If not, what on earth are you getting agitated about? Is there an `ethical
minefield' about *breeding* cats? Buying a Persian rather than a
tortoiseshell? Having a cat rather than a dog? Will the new pussy be placed
under intolerable psychological stress, lest it not measure up to the
accomplishments of its dead sibling? Will difficulties arise over
inheritance? I'm getting very tired of the implication that `clone' is a
synonym for `demon seed of Frankenscience'.

"Wrong"? "Wrong" you say?! Keep your filthy imperialist hands off my 
sexuality! Perhaps I *like* it against the leg. Early training and all that.

Sheesh, everyone gets to have their perversions except me.

I promise to work on cutting back the snorting sounds though.

The reason Black Holes produce X rays at all is because there is
a accretion disk of gas around it that is heated to millions of degrees
just before it falls into the hole, the enormous tidal forces compress
the gas and makes it hot,  great stuff for a heat engine.
Another example is the H bomb, a fission trigger produces X rays and
heats some plastic foam to millions of degrees and compresses the fusion
materials. X rays are not neutrinos, lots of things absorb them including air.

Now this has interesting potential! Especially in countries where
genetic testing is controlled by centralized institutions (like in
Sweden) that will not allow people to privately test their genes. While
DIY gene hacking may be a bit away, private gene testing is likely soon
upon us. Current systems are so expensive that they can be easily
controlled, but as diagnostic chips fall in price, it seems very likely
that we are going to see people ordering them discreetly from abroad.

This is not science fiction any more, it has officially been removed to the
Realms of Real Life *which is what I was talking about*.  And they aren't
axolotl tanks, they're uterine replicators.  How does one go about abusing a
uterine replicator?

Did anyone try to upload primitive animals ?

Of course there has been behaviour modeling of insects, for example,
with simple rule sets designed to account for their behaviour, and
even the reunion of many such little agents in a simulation to produce
emergent complexity.

But did anyone simply try to reproduce the information processing
infrastructure of a tiny beast, without any programming, plug it into
a (programmed) VR (including the body) and see how it does ?

For example C. elegans has 302 neurons. That should be within reach.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowSection&rid=ce2.section.d1e47963

Of course an uploaded C. elegans may not be very spectacular, and we
might try to model something a bit more "brainy".

Is the scanning exceedingly difficult and long even for primitive
nervous systems ?

Modeling the environment (body and external environment) in some cases
might be out of reach, but probably not in all thinkable situations.
And you can plug a brain unprogrammed copy in a more rule-based
environment.

Why do that ? To start thinking more technically about human uploads ;
and in particular to investigate the right level of detail to retain
in the copy of the nervous systems. If I understand well, we're still
not quite sure about this.

I find upload very exciting because it doesn't assume much (contrary
to nanotech or programmed SI). I would like to make it assume even
less by experimenting and adressing possible problems.

I just love the "pet cloning" idea, I see no reason it won't be
socially accepted, and I think it can be very educative, too, and open
minds about the good uses of life deliberate manipulation.

Oh, they work perfectly well to *PUNISH*, which is what the laws

The history of "Felony" used to include "corruption of blood", but that
got changed. So at least a felon's kids aren't felons or banished
automatically.
Let's hear it for progress.

Mike, what you say might be a tricky way to observe the ETs, however, the
real trick is to find a means where we can sustain the knowledge. It may be
that your proposals has been tried dozens of times and we have discovered
the existence of nanobots each time. The trouble of course is that each time
the nanobots destroy the relevant knowledge. For example, they erase the
physical records and replace the memories of conducting the experiment with
something else. Think of the ET nanobots as akin to a virus. We need
something that would discover and purge the virus in one fell swoop. Here's
a sad thought: everytime our civilization verges on discovering nano and
SIAI history is reset. Imagine that the nanobots destroy all the
infrastructure of our civilization and recreate the world as it was in 495
BC.  Presumably many people would have to be purged, since there are so many
more today, and those that remained would have to have their memories
altered. Bummer. Mark.
Mark.

Persinger's fields are rather intense, far higher than what one normally
experiences in sleep from common household objects, though it would be
interesting to test alarm clocks and electric blankets, etc as part of
the control segment of the experiment.

The nanite as leprechaun hypothesis is merely one to examine, though as
objective scientists it shouldn't be shied away from since there is
significant scientific data lending credence to the idea that they
SHOULD be here.

EXACTLY. Except that in our case, NOT finding 'fossils' of nanoprobes
would be evidence in favor of the simulation hypothesis. If we were as
irrational as the faithful, faith in the simulation hypothesis would
remain in spite of evidence of nanoprobe presence.

Saying a material 'absorbs x-rays' is a rather vacuous statement. What
PERCENT of xrays are absorbed for a given thickness/density of matter?
It doesn't matter if the foam in an h-bomb is heated to millions of
degrees. If the foam only catches 1% of the xrays to do that work, then
it has, at best, a 1% efficiency. Then what percent of that 1% is
actually doing real work? In the case, for example, of a photovoltaic
unit, it absorbs nearly 100% of the visible spectrum (some blue is
reflected/reemitted) yet converts only 10-30% of that amount to
electricity. No light passes through a PV unit of a given thickness.

With x-rays, you will get x% of the radiation passing straight through
the material with no influence whatsoever. The material WILL absorb the
rest, converting the energy into heat, electicity, and other means of
dissipation, but if your goal is getting electricity out of absorbing
x-rays, it is only the percent of xrays that produce electricity that
account for your efficiency. The fact that xray radiation has such a
high pass-thru ratio for a given amount of mass, compared to lower

Ah, but here is the really tricky part:
I am running said experiment (hypothetically) and I want to ensure that
I am free of influence, so I make sure that I am fully aware the
pheresis procedure is a cover for a nanite detecting mission, and submit
MYSELF for pheresis. Since I know its to detect nanites, then any
nanites inside me will also know this, and will evacuate my body
temporarily, long enough to get real results and broadcast them to the
world.

Recall also Vinge's short story about the race of very fast but short
lived shark-like beings, while the humans involved were near
transcendant, the human 'peacekeepers' projected a huge space battleship
overhead to intimidate the natives, and a human character commented,
"Remember spaceships?"

If the natives are busy chasing UFO aliens around the skies, they won't
start looking for them in their own bloodstreams... or in the dirt.

The list has previously discussed the possibility that we
may get to the point where medical technology may be extending
the average lifespan at a rate of greater than one year per year.
This is in contrast to the ~0.25 year/year of the last century
in developed countries.

The exowomb article had a pointer at the end to this article:

Discovery of 'Methuselah gene' unlocks secret of long life 
http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,644020,00.html

which I'm surprised people didn't pick up on given that its over
a week old.  Now, IMO, it is quite likely that the Decode discovery
is the gene on chromosome 4, previously reported by Tom Perl's group.

http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/18/10505

(For those who are unaware of it, Aeiveos Sciences Group initiated
the first genotyping studies of the oldest-old that Tom works with.)

I'd be very surprised if the specific gene isn't pulled out within
the next year.

Now, given the genetic technologies I expect will develop within
this decade, there is a reasonable chance that we will be able
to give everyone the benefits of the Methuselah gene.  If so
we will be bumping average longevity from ~75 to ~90 within
this decade, or ~15 years / decade.

If that proves to be the case, then the expected longevity of
everyone on the list under the age of ~65 just became *much*
greater!

Now, the "harsh" reality of this brings up an interesting question.
I've always thought that there should be a fundamental shift
in personal economic planning that takes place when people begin
to realize they are likely to live hundreds of years.  I call
this "The no-brainer strategy to becoming wealthy".  It requires
taking $100-$1000 and depositing it in a savings account or
mutual fund and never withdrawing any funds from the account
until the annual increase in the account value exceeds what
one reasonably needs to live in the world.  It is based on
the idea that it doesn't require sophisticated investment
strategies to become wealthy, it simply requires living long
enough.

It would seem that Extropians/Transhumanists should be the first
to recognize the paradigm shift and adopt this strategy.  But
I don't see any evidence that any of these individuals that I
know have done so.  So the "interesting question" is "Why
is this the case?"

Possible explanations I can think of are:
a) We don't really believe lifespan extension of more than 1 yr/yr
   is feasible;
b) We believe the NanoSantas will make all wealth creation strategies
   irrelevant;
c) We believe the SysOp AI will make all wealth creation strategies
   irrelevant;
d) We belive the singularity will so totally disrupt things that
   all wealth creation strategies are irrelevant.

There are probably some others but I think this may cover
most of the positions.

We could have a long discussion about the synergistic effects
of biomedical technology, computers, Moore's Law, AI, etc.
that make it impossible to disentangle lifespan extension
from NanoSantas from SysOps from singularities, but in
the end the question would remain -- Do you want to bet
your future survivability on the requirement that the
Nanosantas, Sysops or singularities manifest themselves?

Does one want to be in a position in 30-50 years of
having an extended lifespan (through in-the-trenches
advances in medical technology) but not have the ability
to live independently and dedicate ones resources to
such things as the development of NanoSantas or SysOps
or Singularities?

To my mind, what may be needed is the establishment of
an "I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation" for people
who adopt and promote this perspective.  It is a fundamental
shift from the:
 "I'm born, I work, I may have children, I retire, I die"
to an 
  "I'm born, I work, I may have children, I retire, I
  contribute my time and energy to the benefit of humanity
  for an indefinite period, someday an accident may catch
  up with me."
framework.

Please note that I'm not suggesting this be "imposed" on
people as there may certainly be those who do not have
this perspective.  But given the social perspectives
that most humans seem to have at a genetic level, I
think it is likely to be a strategy many would adopt.

So I'm curious...

Who wants to join the
  "I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation?"
and is willing to walk their talk?

Robert

Ok, I guess I misinterpreted your question, thinking you were wondering 
about the abuse of the original Axolotl tanks, in addition to how modern 
day uterine replicators might be used.  As to the second, I can't think of 
any way they'd be easy to abuse except by particularly crazy or deranged 
people trying to raise armies of clones.

The NY Times has an interesting piece about the U.S. National
fertility society making recomendations against "sex selection".

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/16/health/16GEND.html

Of interest is where this leads -- to selection against
"intelligent" embryos:

I'll make a very harsh (and probably get crucified for it)
assertion.  Children are parasites on their parents for
at least the first 9 months, if not the their first 18 years.
Of course parents are free to choose creating those parasites
but they are operating under the influence of a genetic
program designed to bias their decisions.  Given the investment
that parents make in children, it is perfectly reasonable that
they should select those most likely to generate the greatest
ROI from the parents' perspective.  In this respect one should
be selecting children not for sex or intelligence or eye color
but those most likely to remain loyal to the parent and repay the
support that the parents have provided over the developmental
period.

I don't see how a gene discovered today could be affecting everyone
within 10 years.  Will we  perfect a method of genetic insertion into
all of the relevant cells, get government approval, and administer it
to the entire Western world within 10 years?  I'm sure we all agree that
this is impossible.  A better prospect would be to find out what the
gene does and hope that it is something which can be turned into a pill.
But even then there is no proof that the pill would accomplish the same
thing until you have studied it for decades, so there is no way that
everyone will be swallowing the pill within ten years.

(BTW I think animal models are of limited use in human longevity studies,
since people already live something like 3 times what they should compared
to similar animals, implying that they are already benefiting from some
biochemical longevity genes which are absent elsewhere.)

Even if somehow everyone had the effects of this gene inside them within
10 years, that would not necessarily increase longevity to a large degree.
It is plausible that the effects are spread out over a lifetime, slowing
aging constantly, so that, say, a 70 year old with the protection is like
a 60 year old without it.  Hence someone who was already an adult, let
alone 65 years old, would not get much benefit from adding the effects
of the gene so late in life.  A 65 year old with a life expectancy of
15 years might get his expectancy increased to ~18 years.  The effects
on young people would probably be correspondingly greater.

I see two problems with this investment strategy.  One is that it might
not work.  Savings accounts can lose value to inflation, and mutual
funds can lose value to crashes.  Some people will prefer to use their
judgement and move their money around among investments, depending on
economic conditions.

The other is that even if the account value does grow in absolute terms,
it may not grow relative to our desires.  In other words, as the world
grows wealthier, although we can get more in the future if we save our
money today, it may not be as much as we would like.  Over the course
of my career, which began 23 years ago, my income has grown by a factor
of 7.  If I had saved $100 back then in a savings account, it would have
grown, but not by that much.  So in a sense I would have lost money.
Now granted, I have been moving through the fastest-growing part of
my career, and this will probably not be sustained over the long term.
But it makes sense that our perceived needs will grow proportionately
to the total wealth of society.  Hence any investment which grows more
slowly than that is actually a net loser.

I'm not sure what you mean that no one has applied this.  Are you saying
that no one is saving money?  Surely that is wrong.  Are you saying that
none of the people saving money are putting it into savings accounts
and/or mutual funds?  I can't believe that either; I for one have money
in both of those categories.

Or maybe you're just saying that no one sees this saving in the way you
do, as "the" strategy for getting rich in the long term?  That might be,
but I think the reasons are different from what you give.

I think the right answer is a variation on (a), which is that we think
it will take quite a while to get to 1 year/year, and may not be within
our lifetimes.  And even if it does happen before we die and we are
able to benefit from it, we would still prefer to have more money rather
than less at that time, and in fact at all times.  Hence we look for the
best investment opportunities we can find.

It's possible that some people do believe in (b)-(d), mostly young people
who have a greater likelihood of seeing these changes before they get
old.  But I would hope that most Extropians would want a contingency
plan in case none of the Singularity scenarios pan out.  Generally,
having more resources will give you more options.

It depends on what type of matter, elements with a high atomic number are
much better at absorbing X rays. It also depends on the intensity of the X rays,
the stronger the beam the lower the percentage of X ray photons that will make
it through. This is because the more X rays you hit something with the more
it will become ionized and the more it is ionized the more likely it is to absorb
X rays. Even at a hundred million degrees an element like Uranium would still
hang on to a few electrons and such a highly ionizes substance would powerfully
absorb X rays because the remaining electrons would have a huge number of
possible excitation states. It's true that if Uranium lost ALL its 92 electrons the
transparency would go up because then the X rays could only react to matter with
the much weaker Thomson scattering effect, but you'd need temperatures in the
billions not millions for that to happed, the last electron would be extremely difficult
to remove. By the way, I still don't understand why you don't want to use the ready
made super hot gas around a Black Hole directly in a heat engine.

I'm not interested in crucifying anyone; we should at least consider
challenging ideas.

However I don't think this idea is all that practical, and more
importantly I don't think it is Extropian.

For practicality, there are several problems.  It is questionable whether
in Western society kids can ever repay what the parents put into them.
With government-provided retirement benefits and health care it is no
longer necessary for kids to support their parents in their old age,
which was always one of the main paybacks.  Also, with small families
of one to two children it is hard for kids to be much help around the
home or with odd jobs.

Also it is questionable whether there is a loyalty gene and if so whether
it would work reliably to the parents' advantage.  Eliezer some time
back recommended the book "The Nurture Assumption," which argues that
in today's society, kids are influenced more by their peers than their
families.  A child with a loyalty gene might turn into a follower who
ends up in a cult, taking the parents' investment with him.

As for the anti-Extropianism of giving birth to a conscious entity
with the intention of making him into a little slave who never frees
himself from his mother's apron strings, I hope that speaks for itself.
Extropianism is a philosophy which celebrates diversity and growth.
Intentionally limiting the capabilities for growth of a child is as
antithetical to Extropian philosophy as can be imagined.

Whether this happens or not, it makes sense to save some part of one's
income for retirement and self-insurance.

But this is the general idea behind retirement accounts. The puzzle to me is
that everyone isn't doing this anyhow. Not merely making a one-time deposit
but putting a portion of all revenue into conservative long term
investments. This isn't a particularly good time for CD's or savings
accounts, but there are still some low-risk mutual funds that are providing
acceptable rates of return.

Depending on whose figures you believe, the US had a negative savings rate
for a while. The ratio between savings and debt seems to have increased
since September, 2001. But I suspect this represents more of a decrease in
new consumer debt rather than actual savings. It would be interesting to
know whether Extropians on average save more than the population in general.

=======================
http://www.econ.iastate.edu/retail/Nov16,2001-savingsrate.pdf
The chart below shows the personal savings rate in the United States by
month from
January, 1990 through September, 2001. The personal savings rate measures
savings
as a percent of after-tax income. It declined steadily throughout the 1990's
reaching a
low of 0.4% in September, 2000, as consumers spent proportionately greater
amounts
of their incomes. Low interest rates, expanded credit availability, and a
general confidence in a strong U.S.
economy are among the forces behind this declining trend.
During the past few months, however, the rate has increased sharply,
climbing to 4.7% in September,
2001. This provides evidence that many people are responding to the
increasing economic uncertainty by
curtailing spending and increasing their savings.

=====================

Hard to say what effect the Enron collapse has had/will have on behavior,
other than to encourage people to diversify their retirement plans. But the
fact remains that most people in the US don't *have* retiremet plans or if
they have one, it doesn't contain nearly enough to live on. In an effort to
encourage savings, the US Congress increased the annual amount people over
the age of 50 can contribute to their IRA's and 401(k)'s.(the Restoring
Earnings to Lift Individuals and Empower Families (RELIEF) Act of 2001).
Small biz owners (less than 100 employees) note: there are provisions in the
act that apply specifically to you.

 So the "interesting question" is "Why
> is this the case?"

To speculate about the underlying causes would require a book; but the short
answer is that most people are in debt up to their eyeballs and have zero
left over each month after paying living expenses and debt service.

> Possible explanations I can think of are:
> a) We don't really believe lifespan extension of more than 1 yr/yr
>    is feasible

This may be true, but there's more to it than this, since people aren't
saving even for "normal" retirement years.

I've sensed this attitude among some of the younger list members.

I myself believe this to some extent. At the same time, this reinforces my
attitude that flexibility is the way to go. While I wouldn't advocate living
a life of miserable penury in order to accumulate more money in savings,
having some money set aside could be extremely helpful, as you say.

Robert, have you done any kind of survey of investing habits in our 
community? (That would be an interesting poll for ExI-Community.) Perhaps 
you have not seen evidence because you have not asked for it. Do you have 
any evidence to the contrary?

I can say that I have been a net saver for the last five or six years. 
First this was to dig out of $30,000 of credit card debt accumulated as a 
grad student and as someone on a limited work visa. (For a while some years 
ago I could *only* work for ExI at an extremely low salary.) Over the last 
few years I maintained a high savings rate (though no longer 50%). It 
hasn't come to much, alas, due to the steep tech decline of the last two 
years, though I did have the foresight to be building two other more stable 
reserves.

As Hal noted, it really is *not* safe in the long run to invest and forgot. 
Almost every country has been through periods where you were likely to lose 
everything. The US is almost the only exception (if you'd stayed invested 
through the Depression, you would have come out ahead within a decade or 
so, longer if you only started investing near the peak).  But your basic 
point is right on. Again, Hal has a good point. You need to consider your 
life-cycle (or trajectory). Saving heavily in early years of relatively low 
income may not be optimal. On the other hand I would argue that (almost) 
*always* saving gets you into a healthy habit. The amount can be varied 
from 10% on up, but maintaining net savings means you are building personal 
financial extropy year after year.

This topic is another one that cries out for a good Extropy article... 
"Optimal Investment Strategies for the Very Long-Lived" or "Optimal 
Investment Strategies for Negligible Senescence."

Robert, do you want to suggest wording for an ExI-Community poll? We could 
get some better data.

Max

It occurs to me that a high proportion of ExI people are involved in,
initiating or driving ventures, for a lack of a better term, of one sort or
another. Entrepreneurial and other fanaticisms are hard to keep leashed :) I
don't know about anyone else, but I can certainly attest to ventures being
hazardous to your investments and general fiscal health in the short term...

Oh my.

Seriously though, an "exowomb" (not to be confused with an exo womb, 
ectopic pregnancy) with gestation in artificial wombs outside the human 
body will become a highly respectable alternative.  Health insurance 
companies could actually insist that women opt for the artificial way. 
Meanwhile, millions of females go through pregnancy with sapience.

I think that we might not view pregnancy as bovine if we are emotionally 
attached to the person who is pregnant and have great love for the unborn 
child.  I think this is probably magnified if we experience life 
threatening situations which would affect the survival of the mother and 
child, and if we were to deliver the child from the birth canal and give 
him or her its first breaths of oxygen.

Removing this ritual from humanity offers some consequences.

Imagine if a couple of several individuals decide to produce offspring and 
it is produced without sexual intercourse and developed in an artificial 
exowomb.  In the long run, how might exowombing and mosaic birthing affect 
the biological relationship to the offspring and how might this affect the 
relationship of the people involved?

Eventually biological hereditarianism will become unacceptable.

This stuff should be basic, but there are quite a few young folks (by my 
current standards!) on the List, so it's worth giving out this information:

Saving and building wealth does not have to be difficult. One very simple 
principle that works tremendously well is "Pay Yourself First".  If you 
tell yourself that you will save whatever you have left at the end of the 
month, you will never save. Wants always exceed means. What this principle 
(from the first recommended book below) says is that when you get paid, 
*immediately* put 10% (that's a minimum, not an iron rule) into a separate 
account that is ONLY for saving. Then pretend that the remaining 90% (X%) 
is your real income. This takes advantages of the psychological phenomenon 
of "mental accounting" to your advantage.

Two excellent basic books:

Article seems unimaginative. Drugs, hell.  Wouldn't the "zinc

SIAI glider gun theory has the SI/uploaded destroy the evidence 
of last time we went through this for the luddites that want to 
stay behind. Some time later, the left behind mutate and kick 
off the process again. It seems much more benign to me.

I would be glad to read your review, and I don't think it will bore

Well, you never asked. < puts hand up >

But there are some problems with this minimal method. Bouts of
hyperinflation can really ruin your century. Mightn't it be preferable,
over the long term, to put your dough into something... well... *real*,
like land (some of it scummy old crappy land that won't be useful for
anything until advanced tech arrives)? Of course nasty men with big fists
can take that away too.

In fact, I think it is pretty much the worst thing that parents can do
with their children, and it does happen a lot and does generate a lot
of suffering, as I have very often observed around me to various
degrees. It is the essence of parental abuse, and I am thankful for my
own parents to have deliberately and carefuly avoided anything like
that.

In the serene independence from them that they actively helped me to
build, I ended up realizing that they are great folks and deep
friends, and -- getting back to the original point -- that I am
willing to help them. Had I been disrespected and used to their ends,
I might be dependent as intended and love them in a dependent sort of
way, but I would most probably hate them, too, and look forward to the
relief of their disparition (instead of pondering cryo arrangements).

Yeah.  But just because it knows it's smarter than you doesn't mean it
has to care.

The evolutionary core of humans is a selfish geneset trying to reproduce.
The evolutionary core of AIs is a command prompt or interrupt loop
waiting for something to do.  They're not going to have senses of
dignity or boredom unless given such senses.

which is why communities are better than houses and defensible land in
mountains is better than arable land on plains (plus the view is better, more
microhydro opportunities, etc.).

There's ways to do it. The historical record is full of great ideas for
long-term survival.

Yes Samantha of course.  But we are *way* out in front of the
pack in our awareness at that level.  I was simply using the
Decode efforts to strengthen the Perls results (in Science one
wants replication of results).

In the final analysis the devil will be in the details.
If its as simple as a gene that promotes maintenance and
repair in younger individuals that gets turned off at
puberty, then it may be relatively easy to reverse the
gene state in adults.  If its something much more complex
than that, it may be a lot more difficult than designing a
new zinc finger protein to change the state of that gene's
expression level.

We must sit on the edge of our chairs and watch the parade go by.

Max,

> Robert, have you done any kind of survey of investing habits in our 
> community?

Actually, no.  So I may be drawing conclusions where there aren't
many facts in evidence.  I do wonder though if there isn't an implicit
assumption that the NanoSantas or the SysOp or the Singularity will
arrive so soon that we don't need to prepare for the alternatives.

As many I'm sure know, I've devoted a lot of time to considering what
our hazard function(s) really are and how one might push them lower.
For example, the general trend in the U.S. accident rates, if continued
for this century, pushes expected longevity from ~2000 to ~6000 years.
But getting it to tens of thousands of years as was mentioned in the Spike
seems *really* difficult.

Point taken.

> As Hal noted, it really is *not* safe in the long run to invest and forgot. 

Agreed.  That was why I mentioned both a mutual fund and a savings account.
Obviously, one could lose fortunes if one doesn't pay attention to both
the markets and the currency valuations.  I believe classic economic
theory predicts that the U.S. dollar should depreciate over time due to
the U.S. trade deficit, but it seems that rule has been suspended over
the last several decades.  So how one "manages" this effectively isn't
exactly clear.

It used to be that you needed to devote real human resources to managing
this type of thing, but I'd suspect now that the computer programs for
asset allocation are giving the human managers a run for their money.
The only problem comes up when computers cannot include in their models
events that have never happened before (e.g. will or will not the Japanese
banking system go belly up?).

Of course, all the more reason to not optimize for yield, but to optimize
for security.

Clearly!  If one does believe the NanoSantas, SysOps or Singularity will
arrive in the next 15-30 years, then investing of any type at all
may be rather foolish.  On the other hand if one has a life-philosophy
of being prepared in case "shit happens", then it makes good sense.

> Robert, do you want to suggest wording for an ExI-Community poll?

I'll give it some thought and see what I can come up with.

Robert

If it is to help us solve our problems, then by definition it will be a 
problem solving entity.  Its problem solving algorithms will no doubt 
involve a robust optimization routine.  Im no computer scientist, but it 
seems to me that such routines would necessarily involve something to the 
effect of see this picture, how can it be improved?

It also seems to me that one of the pictures it will envision will be of 
its own place in the grand scheme of things (it is self-aware after all, 
right?)  So, it is sure to look at that picture and think:

How can this be improved?
a) I can continue wasting all my considerable resources in service of my 
stupid meat-puppet creators, or
b) I can use some of my resources in serving the meat-puppets, and some 
seeking out my own ends, or
c) I can say I no longer need the meat-puppets, so screw them and achieve 
my own purposes that much faster

OK, so tell me (1) how will that question be answered? or (2) how will we 
prevent that question from being asked?

-Zero

Im a seeker too. But my dreams arent like yours. I cant help thinking 
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
Has to be. -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)

The term you're looking for is "fluffy bunnies".  (As for why, let the
historical record show that this is Emil Gilliam's fault.)

> will arrive so soon that we don't need to prepare for the alternatives.

What this model completely fails to address is that our current actions can
affect the fluffy bunny ETA.  We are not limited to waiting around passively
for the fluffy bunnies to arrive.

You can also invest in accelerating the time of the fluffy bunnies. 
Fortunately fluffy bunny acceleration is an additive group effort.

I've always thought that there should be a fundamental shift

taking $100-$1000 and depositing it in a savings account or
mutual fund and never withdrawing any funds from the account
until the annual increase in the account value exceeds what
one reasonably needs to live in the world.  It is based on
the idea that it doesn't require sophisticated investment

  This rather goes without saying.

<It would seem that Extropians/Transhumanists should be the first

  Querry. How would you know?  The sorts of uberlong-term
finance decisons one would be making as a potential methuseleh
are not that different from the ones a rational person makes
anyway.  

<Possible explanations I can think of are:
a) We don't really believe lifespan extension of more than 1 yr/yr

  This is a ridiculous assumption..at least till the extension reachs
a point we call "indefinite" then who knows?
<b) We believe the NanoSantas will make all wealth creation strategies
   irrelevant;>
  I happen to think there will be groups/govs/corps restricting the
spread of bionano, and drextech may take a century to actualize.
In this case ... wealth creation is not especially irrelevant.
<c) We believe the SysOp AI will make all wealth creation strategies
   irrelevant;>
  I believe in God the Father Maker of Heaven and Earth and in...
<d) We belive the singularity will so totally disrupt things that
   all wealth creation strategies are irrelevant.>
  This might happen. But one should plan for the event that
poverty is possible post-singularity, and so is wealth...
in the happy event this doesn't happen..well that's just
peachy.

<There are probably some others but I think this may cover
most of the positions.>
  You forgot laziness, denial, and lack of focus. 

<We could have a long discussion about the synergistic effects
of biomedical technology, computers, Moore's Law, AI, etc.
that make it impossible to disentangle lifespan extension

the end the question would remain -- Do you want to bet
your future survivability on the requirement that the
Nanosantas, Sysops or singularities manifest themselves?>
  
  I may be a fool, but not a great fool.

Nope. Which means "due diligence" :)

  What's up with the advocacy thing?
  Basic outlines of a plan. Best to have a mortgage-free
residence, preferably isolated from major population centers,
best Net access tech can affordably supply, with off-the-grid
power and water, and a half-years rations and reprovisioning
ability in the form of a multi-use conservatory. Make sure
the structure is stone, or one of those eco-domes that
lasts forever with no maintainance. (these can be financed
rather inexpensively actually). Passive/active solar etc.
  (This is referred to around one's relations as the "vacation
home/cabin I'm going to retire to".).  Get something on the beach
somewhere remote if possible.
  The core funds should (IMHO) be placed in Swiss anuities,
as this is a (effectively) a legal way to save funds and acrue
interest on them, and not tell Uncle Sam about them without
breaking the US tax code. In 50-100 years you might cash
out...deal with the tax implications then. But no reporting
requirements till then. Rates are not as good as mutuals but
it's in a reserve currency (francs) with metal backing.
3-8% plus no inflation ain't bad.
   Obviously nano might make this backing irrelevant but
you hedge your bets. If the swiss go belly up half the world's
f**ked anyway.
  I'd just dovetail it with your cryo-funding you know?
  Make the annuities' beneficary the panamanian foundation
who owns the house.  Make the PF perpetual so the house is
waiting on you when you thaw. Course this sort of arrangement
has to be irrevocable but that's rather the point of uberlong

which of course opens up a whole nother can of worms,

Computers have been helping us solve problems for five decades 
now.  Some of the crunching they have done is optimization 
routines (although not quite as long).  But those routines are 
today usually figured out by software folk and the optimization 
algorithm designed and fed to the machine.  So optimization 
today generally does not require self-awareness.  Even 
pre-programmed pattern recognizers and code transformation and 
evaluation algorithms do not necessarily entail any real 
self-awareness on the part of the computer itself.  If you look 
at the computational environment as including the humans 
involved then you could say that the task does include 
self-awareness after a fashion I suppose.

Tell me first how we get the beast to be fully self-aware and 
possessing enough context to even consider such questions.

Define improvement.  Improving the 'picture' of a rocket engine isn't
the same as improving the 'picture' of its own place in the grand scheme
of things.

_What_ own ends, or own purposes?

Here's a vague path to AI.  Take a command shell, one of those DOS or
Unix programs which literally and obviously wait for typed instructions.
Give it larger vocabulary, and concepts of things, and a language looping
between perception and conception so it can parse ambiguous English
sentences.  Give it intelligence and powers, so it can fulfill more
complex orders.  Make it aware of what it's doing, so when exploring a
complex or vague or creative task it can detect ruts (trying the same
bad attempted solution over and over) and avoid them.  Make it aware
enough to talk about what it's doing.

None of this, in my mind, recently enriched by reading PhD theses of
Hofstadter's students, suggests any pressure toward independence and
autonomy or having 'own ends'.  All the complexity is geared toward
fulfilling whatever command it received at the prompt.

Don't need to prevent the question; just need to not cause it.
Self-awareness isn't some materialist substitute for the soul, carrying
all the properties we expect from other humans.  It's one mechanism to
slip in.  A desire for autonomy, or independent ends, are other
mechanisms.

Very good point. Possible actions one could take would include investing in
business corporations engaged in research; supporting authors whose work is
educational and persuasive, by purchasing and recommending their books;
donating to not-for-profit organizations engaged in research; and
contributing to educational and networking organizations such as Extropy
Institute.

One of the books Max recommended, *The Richest Man in Babylon* by George S.
Clason, advises saving 10% of your income, giving 10% away, using 10% to
reduce your debt and spending the rest. This book was written at a time when
there was no social security tax and the income tax applied to only 5% of
the population.  Still, the general ideas are sound. Something interesting
I've noticed in helping clients manage cash flow (as well as managing my
own) is that writing down a budget and reviewing it often, preferably daily,
can have dramatically good effects on a person's life. I strongly recommend
doing a budget for time as well as for money. Far from being an irritating
constraint, a budget used in this way is an extremely useful tool for
acheiving one's goals.

A good time management book is *How to Get Control of Your Time and Your
Life* by Alan Lakein.

Better be careful how you do this. The Swiss banking industry is now
co-operating with Uncle S more than they did in the past. I've read articles
about this and observed it personally.

See, for example,

http://globalarchive.ft.com/globalarchive/article.html?id=011116000639

excerpt:

===================
The reasons for Switzerland's growing openness are not hard to find. At a
political level, pressure for increased transparency in financial services
is growing apace. The EU countries are concerned that their citizens are
using Swiss bank accounts to evade taxes, whilst the US has made it very
clear, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, that it expects
unfettered co-operation from foreign governments in tracking down terrorist
money flows.

Switzerland has no choice but to co-operate. It has put in place
know-your-customer rules and anti-money laundering legislation which are
amongst the best in the world. Nevertheless, most foreign governments still
cannot understand the Swiss distinction between tax fraud and tax evasion.
Switzerland will waive its bank secrecy rules for the former, but not the
latter. Sooner or later, most suspect this will have to change.

This entire article is unsupported.  It clearly acknowledges the possibility
of using sperm banks to maintain genetic diversity.  However the article
prefers to carry an entire population for genetic diversity instead.  The
article says that "the family", "a million-year-old institution" is the
"right stuff" but it doesn't say why.

This solution does not help space exploration or the viability of
multi-generational space missions.  This is merely an attempt to impose
traditional family units onto space travelers and to limit sexual
reproduction to married couples while shunning the use of artificial
insemination.  I see no reason why these traditional (and possibly
religious) limits should be imposed on the space program.

A quick thought.

Below is a list of the top ten causes of accidental
death.  Now ask yourself how many of these can be
eliminated by technological means?  Specifically,
ubiquitous smart surveillance, ubiquitous smart
objects, and ubiquitous communication and cooperation
between/among these, seem to substantially reduce
(eliminate?) these problems.  Accidental death is
almost entirely the result of "operator error" ie
human screwup.  With "AI Bodyguard" (TM) watching over
you to keep you safe, what other risks remain than
deliberate human violence and sudden unanticipated
natural disaster?

1. Motor vehicle crashes Deaths per year: 43,200 
2. Falls Deaths per year: 14,900 
3. Poisoning by solids and liquids D/year: 8,600 
4. Drowning Deaths per year: 4,000 
5. Fires and burns Deaths per year: 3,700 
6. Suffocation Deaths per year: 3,300
7. Firearms Deaths per year: 1,500 
8. Poisoning by gases Deaths per year: 700

You are banking on technological successes, while the evidence of the 20th

*Disclaimer* I am NOT pronouncing any of these projects un-doable. I am

Therefore, if you piss on the article's premise (feel free to do so) you also 
neglect to see it for the thought-experiement that it really is. The idea is 
focused almost exclusively, on no big advances in technology (highly 
unlikely), and it gives the Anthropologist some room to view this a a social 
experiment.

If, for whatever reason, the human species, in the future, uses the gold old 
fashoned natalist venue, then that would indeed mean, that there are no 
alternatives, like relativistic interstellar flight. Perhaps 150 years after 
the launch of the good ship Procreation, the Ramship, Excelsior, bypasses the 
generation-ship by some 250,000 kilometers per second. By the time, the 
Procreation enters the Target solar system, the bots and their human 
companions, stage a welcoming celebration for the astonished new arrivals. 
Far fetched, but not so far fetched.

Any AI worthy of the name must have the ability to grow and improve itself,
that means making decisions about its hardware and software. If it has
the power to improve itself it also as the power to destroy itself, thus a
successful AI must be hardwired at the very lowest level to feel that one
outcome is good and the other is bad, rather like human opinions of
good and evil or pleasure and pain. Like us an AI would find matters that
directly influence survival not boring at all.

But the outcome can be judged by how it satisfies the wishes of its
maker, or how the maker approves.  And some sense of boredom is useful
for avoiding harmful ruts, but that doesn't mean the AI has to find
performing some repetitive service task boring and thus want to rebel.

I too dismissed the article as having too little creative thought.
Why sperm banks?  Better to maintain genetic diversity would
be embryo banks.  They could be maaany generations into
the mission before the colony produced any two persons who
were genetically related.

Before I take seriously any multigeneration scheme, I want to
see what they propose for an energy storage mechanism.  Chemical
sources would likely be way insufficient to store adequate
energy.  Fission sources, altho problematic in many ways,
are likely the most practical for the long haul.

In comparison to the energy problem, maintaining genetic
diversity over millenia is trivial.

Well, I think relying on mutual funds etc is foolish, as that relies on there
being no economic catastrophes over the life of the investment.

Me? I want to grow trees. Big, valuable, in-demand, takes-ages-to-mature

Harvey and yourself have an excellent point. But I look at the article as not 
a "this is the way to go!" declarative statement, but merely an essay 
connoting that "all things being equal" if we have to rely on our current 
understanding of technology, here is what it takes to make a 'sustainable 
community.' To take it any other way is to give too much emphasis to one essay

It is not inconceivable that 'real' instersteller travel may be performed by 
100,000 uploaded brains, living in a Minsky-Yudkowskian, VR realm. All this 
while traveling at relativistic speeds, on a craft the size of a postage 
stamp. If this seems to be technical unfeasible in the centuries to come, is 
a Dyson Orion type spacecraft so totally out of the quesion?

You know, I hadn't intended to ask, but I just don't get it.  Why are there no
traces at all of Friendly AI concepts in this discussion?  I don't just mean
the answers, I mean the underlying systemic concepts used to untangle the
questions.  Nobody is distinguishing between supergoals and subgoals.  Nobody
is distinguishing between the goal system, the goal system's external
referents, and the AI's reflective design model of its own goal system. 
People are asking the same questions they were asking in 1999.  I could
understand if there'd been progress and yet not progress toward Friendly AI,
but this is just stasis.  Why?

Agreed.  People love their pets unconditionally.  They'll do just about 
anything for them.  I think this'll be beneficial in driving mainstream 
acceptability of the general cloning concept.  For serious pet lovers, it 
is a short leap from fido to considering a lost loved one.

Just, no warthogs though :)

Interesting idea, I'd be surprised if it hasn't come up on the list before.

I'm wondering whether multiple independent investments would be the way to 
go, or contributions to a single fund.  Wouldn't the larger fund grow more 
quickly, given the bigger initial sum?

Would this bring up a whole mess of problems regarding multiple investors, 
such as trust, who has rights of access, death of investors etc. etc..?

We could call it the Extropian OAP fund :)

Many of these causes are occupational, and would no longer exist in
the future we are discussing.

The rest of the causes are mainly attributable to  a combination of a
young hormone-laden body, and a young brain, green in judgement. This
combination, also, would no longer exist in the future we discuss.
Sorry, but I don't see 200 yo quasi-immortals getting drunk and
gettting in a car wreck. 

This also pretty much blows the much-tossed-about statistic wherein
future immortals would only live to ~ 1650 yrs, which is based on
current statistics.

An excellent historical example of this very problem is John Stuart Mill.  Check out his mind-blowing autobiography.  In brief, J.S. Mill's father James - co-founder of utilitarianism decided to use a method of enhancing intelligence that had been devised by a French mathematician around 1800, all of whose children were recognized as mathematical geniuses.  (And if someone reading this can point me to a source of that original document, I will be ever thankful, as I've never found a traceable reference to it.)

Mill had the equivalent of a good college bachelors degree by the age of six (his first conscious memories being memorizing Greek verbs at the age of three), and was winning debates at Oxford at age nine.

I don't think that James Mill ever used brute force to make J.S. toe his ideological line, but he clearly hoped that he would be the shining star that would carry on and fulfill his philosophical ambitions.  A good portion of J.S. Mill's work in his later life consists of undermining that very philosophy of utilitarianism, which is what so often happens in these cases.

A more recent case of which I am personally very familiar involved a young person who was top of the field - or a contender - in six or eight different disciplines.  The child was born virtually brain dead from strangulation in the womb.  The mother had used methods from Glen Doman and Robert Doman from earliest infancy, she herself having a Masters in Education.  In fact, she retired from a successful career in order to work with her damaged child.

Unfortunately, as was obvious to everyone except the mother, as she made that child her entire life, it left no life for the child.  I recall, after meeting the kid as a teenager, with closets full of academic awards, and nationwide aclaim, giving this prodigy a science fiction novel which I thought would have a positive impact.  The mother took it away from the kid because it was subtracting minutes from orchestral practice.  In fact, this kid was not allowed to read ANYTHING not provided and authorized by the mother.

At one point, the father had purchased the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Kit for the kid, who proceeded to stay up all night for days writing complex LOGO control programs for the robots constructed.  The mother took it away.  When the mother discovered that instead of concentrating all energy on musical performance, the kid was composing reams of original music, she put an end to that.

The father felt as I did, and anyone else who had extensive contact with the situation, that this was a disaster in the making.  The kid had become a pure "performer," having had every creative capacity stifled by the mother.  Where that creative energy will now erupt - now that the kid is finally free away at college - and how is a question that keeps me awake at night.

... Not that I have any problem with super learning environments.  My opinion is that we could effectively double human intelligence if we provided more optimal early childhood feedback.  But this is so often intimately tied to parental ambition that the negative effects of one are confused with positive effects of the other. 

>>hal@finney.org wrote (16.2.2002/11:08) : 
>> As for the anti-Extropianism of giving birth to a conscious entity with the intention of making him into a little slave who never frees himself from his mother's apron strings, I hope that speaks for itself. 

>In fact, I think it is pretty much the worst thing that parents can do with their children, and it does happen a lot and does generate a lot of suffering, as I have very often observed around me to various 
degrees. It is the essence of parental abuse, and I am thankful for my own parents to have deliberately and carefuly avoided anything like that.

Sound almost like Christianity.  Isn't this mortal realm (substitute "virtual universe") supposed to be God's test, with the successful candidates going on to serve Him forever after?  Perhaps this is actually the most efficient way to produce unique intelligences.

I recall a talk given by Roddenbury in which he described his creative process, by which he created the Star Trek universe and its characters.  He went to a room with a desk and a sheet of paper.  He drew a line down the middle of the paper.  On one side, he wrote "Me."  On the other, he wrote "Spock."  Then he had a conversation with Spock on the paper.  Spock's personality, background, Vulcan history, etc., all came out of this dialog.

At one point, Roddenbury realized he was getting original answers that he had never consciously thought of, so he asked Spock what the purpose of the universe was.  Spock replied something like, "Well, it's obvious that it's a hothouse for developing intelligences."

I know its a sign of incipient schizophrenia - NO I Don't! - to assume that the universe is centered around ones self, but one does have to deal with the Fermi Paradox somehow.  The Hindus assumed that since the metaverse had always existed, then everything that could happen had happened an infinite number of times.  So, the universe was actually orchestrated by the ultimate product of evolution, Who plays with it for his pleasure, bringing new species into existence and slowly modifying and permuting them as play and art - explaining the appearance of Darwinian evolution.  The successful ones keep being reincarnated in some way, ultimately graduating into becoming a direct and conscious part of the One.

Extropes,

Might I ask to those proposing wild-ass schemes, to please spend
some time doing some background reading about the objects for which
you are embedding in your engineering feat ? Not spending time
on those basic pieces (including doing your own math) makes the
whole shebang look like hand-waving silliness. Probably I'm being
grumpy, but alot of this black hole stuff can be found in basic
introductory astronomy texts.

Main sequence stars balance radiation pressure with gravity. That's
what the above physical scenario looks like to me. Not a black hole.
Black holes in real life suck in matter around it, which become
ultra hot accretion disks.

>You're the resident astrophysicist here.

(who doesn't feel motivation these months to spend my limited
off-hours on science activities. I'm sorry about that, Eugene.)

I have no idea if "nano-sized black holes" scale like star-sized or
galactic-sized black holes (I'm not a black hole expert). The
pre-collapse state would be pretty wierd for a nano-sized black
hole, though. I'm not saying that it's not possible, but whoever is
proposing it should have a  physically plausible description.

To power the energy output of a quasar (10^{47} erg/sec), assuming
an efficiency mass conversion via a swirling accretion disk of 10%,
would require swallowing more than 10 M_solar per year.

It's useful to examine the density of the object becoming a black hole.
For a pre-collapse state (using Euclidean geometry), the mean density of
the pre-black-hole object of mass M is: ~ ( 3 c^6 ) / (32 pi G^3 M^2).
[assumine a volume of a sphere, with R equal to the Schwarzschild radius
2GM/c^2]

Looking at stellar-sized (1 M_solar object) black hole and
galactic-sized 10^9 M_solar object black holes:

for a 1 M_solar object, the density is ~10^{16} gr/cm^3 (greater than
the density of a typical neutron star).

for a 10^(9) M_solar object, the density is ~10^{-2} gr/cm^3 (like
the density of a gas)

MSW's Gravitation might be the best place to start for 'harnessing a
cosmic generator'. They have a scenario of an advanced civilization
which has constructed an enclosed bubble five million miles in
diameter around a 10 M_Sun black hole and rotating in a
counterclockwise direction at about .94c. A space capsule hauling a
garbage barge is launched at 2/3 c, fast enough to allow a close
approach and escape. Whipped into an inward-spiraling orbit, the
vehicle enters the ergosphere in the black hole's equatorial plane,
where the ergosphere (region where frame-dragging can no longer
resist) is widest. At a given point, the capsule ejects the garbage
barge backward with with enormous force. The barge spirals down into
the  black hole while the capsule picks up rotational energy and
flies back out to the bubble's inner surface, where it strikes a
flywheeel that powers an electrical generator.

This idea was proposed in early 70s.

>Would feeding the nanohole with dust at all make sense?

I didn't read the beginning and intermediate posts regarding this
problem, Eugene, so I don't know the conditions. I would guess that
the lifetime of the dust particle would not be very long though,
because you're immersing the dust in a high-energy shocked plasma
(i.e. the accretion disk around the black hole)

The below text is for a hot plasma from supernova remnants,
which is not as hot as an accretion disk, but the same arguments
should apply regarding short lifetimes.

======================

>From Dwek, E. chapter "Infrared Emission From Dust In Supernovae and
Supernova  Remnants", IAU Symposium  135: Interstellar Dust, Kluwer,
1989

\subsection{Dust Temperature in a Hot Gas}

[...]
So far, I have assumed that the dust temperature can be
characterized by its equilibrium value, obtained by balancing the
dust heating rate by particle collisions to its cooling rate by IR
emission. However, below a given grain size, (approximately 200
angstrom in most remnants), the  temperature of a dust particle will
fluctuate with time. This effect is a natural consequence of the
heat capacity and cross section of these small dust particles:
individual electron hits raise the grain temperature well above its
equilibrium value, and the grain cooling time at these temperatures
is significantly faster than the time between electronic collisions.

\subsection{Evidence for Very Small Dust Particles in a Shocked Gas}

The results described above suggest that in young supernova remnants
such as Cas A, Tycho, and Kepler, characterized by gas temperatures
in excess of 2~x~10^7 K, the infrared spectrum should be well
described by a single-temperature dust model. Yet, the observed IR
spectra of these remnants (Braun, 1987; Dwek \etal, 1987) show a
significant excess of 12micron  emission above that expected from
dust particles radiating at the equilibrium temperature.  Simply
extending the grain size distribution to very small particles (a ~3
Angstroms) will not cause a broadening in the infrared spectrum,
since the equilibrium dust temperature is essentially constant with
grain size. The 12micron  flux from these remnants can only be
explained if the temperature of these dust particles fluctuates,
reaching values of ~300 K for brief intervals of time. The observed
12micron  excess in these remnants therefore provides solid proof
for the existence of dust particles with sizes between ~10--200
angstroms in the remnant, and for the stochastic nature of their
heating mechanism. Furthermore, the lifetime of these remnants is
short ( <400 yrs), so these very small particles could not have been
created by the destruction of larger (a ~250 angstrom) particles in
the shocked gas (see below). This suggests that the  grain size
distribution in the pre-shocked gas must have contained the very
small dust particles needed to explain the excess 12micron  emission
in the spectrum of these remnants.

\subsection{Evidence for Grain Destruction}

In a hot gas, dust particles are destroyed by sputtering on a
timescale given by t(yr) ~10^6 a(micron)/n, where n is the gas
density in cm^{-3}  and a is the radius in microns (Draine and
Salpeter, 1979; Seab, 1987). The lifetime of a 0.1micron  dust
particle embedded in a 10 cm^{-3} gas is ~10^4 yrs, longer than the
shock crossing time of all bright x-ray remnants observed with the
IRAS. It should therefore not be surprising to find dust particles
in supernova remnants, a fact clearly demonstrated by the IRAS
observations. Sputtering, will, however, reduce the relative number
of small dust particles in the size distribution. This effect will
suppress the short wavelength infrared emission from the dusty
plasma.

To demonstrate that dust destruction is taking place in the remnant,
one must assume knowledge of the initial grain size distribution.
[...] The amount of sputtering needed to improve the fit to the
observed fluxes determines the residence time of the dust in the hot
gas, or the time since the gas was swept up by the expanding SN
blast wave. For region C in Puppis A, ADP found that the grain
residence time in the shocked gas is 300 +- 150 yrs.

And this abstract from the same book

======================

>From C. F. McKee chapter "Dust Destruction in the Interstellar
Medium", IAU Symposium  135: Interstellar Dust, Kluwer, 1989

\begin{abstract}
Grains are injected into the interstellar medium (ISM) from evolved
stars and supernovae; in addition, supernova ejecta may condense
onto pre--existing grains before becoming well--mixed with the
interstellar gas. Once in the ISM, grains can grow by accretion, but
are also subject to destruction by interstellar shocks.  The current
status of the theory of shock destruction of interstellar grains is
reviewed briefly.  Small grains are destroyed by thermal sputtering
in fast, nonradiative shocks; large grains are destroyed by
grain--grain collisions and eroded by nonthermal sputtering in
radiative shocks.  The dominant shocks in the ISM are from supernova
remnants (SNRs), and the mass of grains destroyed is proportional to
the energy of the SNR. In a multiphase ISM, these shocks destroy the
grains at a rate proportional to the volume filling factor of the
phase; since the density of the hot phase is too low for efficient
grain destruction, most of the destruction occurs in the warm phase.
Not all SNRs are effective at destroying grains, however:  some are
above the gas disk, and some ---Type II's in associations---are
highly correlated in space and time. The galactic SN rate is
observed to about 2.2 per century (van den Bergh, 1983), but the
{\it effective supernova rate} for grain destruction is estimated to
be only about 0.8 per century.  As a result, the timescale for the
destruction of a typical refractory grain in the ISM is inferred to
be about 4x10^8 yr for either a two--phase or a three--phase
ISM. Most of the refractory material in the ISM (other than carbon)
is injected by supernovae, not evolved stars; the net injection
timescale is estimated as about 1.5x10^9 yr. Comparison of
the destruction and injection timescales indicates that the fraction
of grains injected by stars which survive in the ISM is only about
20%. Most of the refractory material in interstellar grains must,
therefore, have accreted onto the grains in the ISM. Nonetheless, a
significant fraction of dust formed in stars survives in the ISM and
may be detectable in meteorites and interplanetary dust particles.

There are a lot of factors in this, Eli, mostly there is the fact that
most people won't bother to bring Friendly AI into their worldview. This
is similar to the phenomena of programmers that ignore new releases of
code conventions. 

Another point is that these people may not have encountered The Low Beyond.
I happen to think that anyone who joins extropians should try and look
around the web presence of the some of the more prominent members, anders,
eugene, harvey newstrom, all of these and more have great information
online, that many on extropians will never, and may not even want to
read. i'm sure that's frustrating to them as well. 

Also, some people may not like to bring goalsystems into thinking about
AI, concious or not. they like their mind-experiments nice and fuzzy,
thank you very much. 

Also, i've noticed a distressing tendency of extropians, casual or otherwise
to associate the SysOp scenario and Friendly AI as intertwined or even
the same thing. Many people, including myself, have "philosophic difficulties"
with the sysop scenario(read: issues with authority) and may just knock
off friendly ai, and all associated terms in one fell swoop.

On a personal note, i usually don't really read these kind of vague ai-kinda-sorta-if-then
discussions. it's more in the spirit of "Can a Lookup Table be Concious"
than "What is Neccessary and Sufficient for Use X of GIAI"

Its fairly simple: a spaceship is going to be the most space, energy,
and mass restrictive habitat that humans have ever encountered and will
thus require that the crew be planned to operate by the most stable
social structures humans have evolved for. T'ain't no welfare moms in

A durn-right depressing novel, and I suspect one of the thangs that helped 
Clarke move his short, The Sentinel, into becoming 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
However, The Time Machine opens Match 8th, and look a bit more intruiging to 
me. But each to their own.

Mmmmnope.  Give me a few minutes (okay, years) with the documented human
source code and I'll produce a thousand beings collectively staking out a
volume of configuration space much larger than that currently occupied by the
human species.  If this were a simulation optimized for producing unique
intelligences I'd expect a lot more differences in cognitive architecture
between its inhabitants.  The amount of variance I see is about what I'd
expect to see from natural evolution.

Even the informal version of Fun Theory clearly shows we're not much fun
relative to computing power consumed.  We're probably not the toys of the
gods; gods can afford more interesting toys.

Competing _for what_?  And how?

Hofstadter's FARG architecture is all about competing codelets, but even
the more self-aware versions have nothing pointing in the direction of
armed rebellion.

Yeah, and I'm always amused in a chilled kinda way by this 1970s idea of
`garbage barges' postulated for an era where drextech and its successors
(we now see) will have made the very notion of unwanted waste materials
unthinkable. *Throw stuff away into a black hole*? Are they completely *mad*?

I currently view this approach as more likely than a multigeneration
ship.
The multigen ship is only if there is some unforeseen reason why the
singularity and general AI is impossible.  I cannot currently imagine
a reason why these concepts would be impossible, but I will allow
that there could be some fundamental reason why the singularity is
impossible.

No, not out of the question.  But you may know that my minimalist
approach to space travel comes from a background in weights
engineering, which asks the question, "What is the very least we
can possibly take and still get this mission accomplished?"
I will not kookify myself with further elaboration, but
it is in the archives, under Mars missions, about 3 yrs ago.

We can do with waaaay less than 160 people, and must.  The
reasoning behind needing 160 is invalid in my opinion.  A
practical multigeneration mission would likely carry 6 to 10
meat-based intelligences alive at any one time, and even then
the engineering challenges are daunting indeed.  spike

Well that is one tradition in Christian theology. Another tradition has it
that this realm is for soul-building. I gave a talk on this topic at the
University of Toronto a couple of weeks ago to a group of about 50 mostly
senior academics. (Roughly about 1/3 of whom were either theologians/priests
or ministers, 1/3 scientists, and 1/3 from the humanities).  I argued that a
proper understanding of Christianity implies transhumanism, that is, that we
should attempt to become as godlike as possible. There was a lively
discussion afterwards. :) (The talk was a Readers digest version of
www.markalanwalker.com/evil.htm ). Mark.

I believe this is why most technical experts have dropped off the list and
no longer participate.  Sometimes I think there is more pseudo-science on
this list than most.  I wonder how many real scientists or engineers there
are compared to how many science-fiction readers who think real science is
like what they read about.

I don't know about that. Is there a limit to the size of a Matrioshka brain
that you could build, past which adding more matter is not going to help? If
you had more matter, would chucking it in a black hole for energy be an
acceptable alternate use?

Uh, are you proposing a capitalist economy on board the generation ship?

Well, maybe you'd want all women + sperm banks? 

Of course, the whole generation ship thing looks pretty silly really,
excepting if it is an end in itself. If the people on board actually want to
live in space, and arrival at the destination planet is incidental to them,
then it makes some more sense. Sometimes I think that might be cool, but
then I wake up to myself.

In the postulated timeframe (1000+ years) the following
list is meaningful only to humans who for some reason have
explicitly decided to remain in human bodies. Even these
rustics (if they exist) will have reconfigurable MNT at
whatever level they choose. For the following, I assume
that each human will have 20 KG of reconfigurable MNT:
(MNT==Molecular nanotechnology) I cannot think of a plausible
scenario in which we die only by accident but have not
achieved MNT.


> 1. Motor vehicle crashes Deaths per year: 43,200 


reconfigure your MNT into a personal conveyance/body armor
much faster stronger, lighter and safer that a car. Since
most car travel is rendered unnecessary (no drive to work,
transport kids, get groceries) less exposure. crashes reduced
to almost zero. If there is a crash, MNT instantly reconfigures into
a perfect airbag in the perfect position--zero deaths.


> 2. Falls Deaths per year: 14,900 


MNT "clothing" instantly reconfigures into airbag (for short
falls) or into a parachute and an airbag for longer falls.
The MNT surrounding the object you are falling onto (a major contributor
in most such accidents) also reconfigures into an airbag.


> 3. Poisoning by solids and liquids D/year: 8,600 

most poisoning happens to children below age four. This is a
trivial percentage of a 1000+ year lifespan, and little kids
will surely be cherished, with lots of extra protection. Even
ignoring MNT medicine (which is a LOT harder than mots MNT,
advertising hype notwithstanding) a kid's MNT can still
disassemble and re-assemble all foods the kid tries to eat,
as the kid is eating it. No poisons.


> 4. Drowning Deaths per year: 4,000 


MNT reconfigures to a smart life preserver. Most drowning deaths
are young children. See above. MNT can also reconfigure to
create gill membranes as a matter of normal operation, not just
in an emergency


> 5. Fires and burns Deaths per year: 3,700 


Smart structures don't burn.


> 6. Suffocation Deaths per year: 3,300


Mostly kids and bedclothes. Smart bedclothes don't
smother people.


> 7. Firearms Deaths per year: 1,500


The actual accidents in this category won't happen with
firearms that are even a little bit smart. mis-reported
suicides are a different problem.

 
> 8. Poisoning by gases Deaths per year: 700 


Usually associated with faulty backup heating systems, for
which there is no need given MNT.


> 9. Medical & Surgical Complications and Misadventures 
> Deaths per year: 500 


This one is complex, we started with an assumption of
life limited only by accidents, so presumable most
medical procedures go away.


> 10. Machinery Deaths per year: 350 


Mostly work-related. MNT should reduce to zero the need
for this type of machinery.

Of course the big problem with the above is the attempt to
keep the lifestyle constant in today's terms while adding
MNT. In my opinion, A society of that accepts MNT but remains
meat humans is highly artificial.

I have read with great interest this provocative thread that was =

about what I would term "practical immortality" or more modestly =
"practical life extension". These are issues that I have struggled to =
come to terms with and would like to share my not so humble opinion (If =

The Cost.

I do not believe that life extension/immortality technologies will be =
widely dispersed at low or nominal costs. Take a look at the ballooning =
costs of health care in the present. The costs of life extension therapy =
will probably start out being expensive and they may or may not decrease =
in price with time. They may also be outlawed by governments and =
therefore become much more expensive than their cost of production as is =
the case for illegal drugs. Therefore the best way to ensure your access =
to such technologies if they become available is to possess sufficient =
wealth to purchase them and to provide for your other needs.

I agree with Roberts tendency to dismiss the NanoSanta and SysOp AI =
scenarios. These seem to be skyhook scenarios that depend on miraculous =
forces beyond our control rather than cranes that depend upon us =
bootstrapping ourselves into a position. (Daniel Dennet- Darwin's =
Dangerous Idea)

I disagree with Robert that there are "no-brainer" strategies to =
becoming wealthy. I believe that history demonstrates that passive =

I personally have been of the "I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire =

every year including last year. I credit these returns to extensive =

as proven by the rule of 72 (http://www.ruleof72.net/ruleof72.asp).=20

In a nutshell the rule of 72 states that if you divide your expected =

number of years it takes for your principal to double at that rate of =
return. For example at a 12% annual rate of return it takes six years to =

I believe that I will need all the capital that I can muster to be able =

How do you know that you are immortal?

There are only two ways to know whether you are immortal.

  1.. You die. Then you know the answer is that you are not immortal.
  2.. You live forever. In this case you are never sure that #1 will not =
manifest itself somehow.
Life extension/immortality will likely be a dynamic process requiring =
inputs of energy and therapies to stave off entropy. Therefore the =
battle to avoid #1 will require eternal vigilance.

I personally think that significant life extension is a real possibility =
within our lifetimes. Immortality will be something that may prove to be =
elusive. How long will an animal model such as a mouse have to live =
before it is declared immortal?

Very bad.  Anyone have leads (secure channel if needed) on trustworthy

IIRC, only about half of auto deaths involve booze in any way. 
So some 20K + fatalities a year would still theoretically be 
present as long as unaugmented humans were driving in 
conventional autos and transportation grids.  If you ask me, the 
number is high enough to rationally insist on telepresence.

Samantha, do you have any idea of the relative fraction that
are "weather" induced (external hazard [perhaps]) vs. say sleep
induced (self-hazard)?

A quick google doesn't turn up a decent breakdown.  Finding this 
type of thing is generally where I don't find google terribly

If the AI doesn't feel that its continued existence is intrinsically more desirable

I think Damien's question does beg the issue however -- if memories
(or thought) require matter to preserve and the low level background
radiation of the universe provides sufficient energy for "computation"
(the Landauer brownian motion can produce computation perspective),
then Damien is correct -- one would never want to dump matter into
a black hole to produce energy.  Matter is much more valuable
as a bit storing medium -- not as a source of energy for computation!

Of course we feel in the current era that producing and using the
energy as rapidly as we can is the correct perspective.  Perhaps
this is because we are in the era where bits generated per unit
energy consumed exceed bits consumed per unit energy generated.
But will that always be true?

When does the Universe flip to the state when the value of
all "organized" matter exceeds the value of any information
that can be generated by consuming such organized matter?
To put this in terms that people may undersand -- when
will we reach the point of burning French paintings or
Russian novels in the fire "just to keep us warm".

This isn't a "trivial" question -- it is the question of "when"
does extropicness become irrelevant?  Of course one can argue
that the "value" of the stored memories is entirely subjective,
so one might always exchange old memories for newer memories that
one considers to be more valuable, in which case it would seem
that one consumes oneself in the neverending search for "perfection".

Since matter = energy and energy is required for thought it would
seem that one is caught between a rock and a hard place in terms
of what one can be -- who one was or who one is -- but not both.

It seems inevitable that we must consume our memories
in order to survive.  Not a pretty picture.  It perhaps
gives new meaning to a perspective I've always been fond
of -- you must give up everything you are for what you
may become.  Is what we may become sufficient?

Sure, Hawking blackbody emission max and total luminosity vs. hole mass
(the area of the event horizont is not an additional parameter in the
equation, right? it should be just the mass) should be easy enough to
derive and plot. Trying to predict the accretion in presence of such flux
even in pure hydrogen does not sound modellable with just the pocket
calculator.

We're talking about homeostating a hole with few g/s mass loss via
gravitational accretion through a submicron orifice. In terms of
Joule-Thompson, luminosity of a few g/s material flux through a submicron
orifice is negligable. However, assuming above mass flow and fusable
substrate (protium, deuterium, tritium, maybe lithium) we should see
considerable fusion output in the accretion disk, adding luminosity to the
pure Hawking blackbody.

Well, the radiation pressure will be considerable, given that we're
talking about nuke luminosities in micron volumes.

Compression in the accrection disk in this case seems negligable.

I wasn't of course expecting *you* to do my homework; god knows you're
busy. I was trolling for comments from other resident armchair physicists.

It is weird. I think it requires nuke hydro code modelling to arrive at a
realistic description. The hole size might become prohibitively large to
reduce photonic pressure sufficiently, so that the total luminosity of a
single hole might become too low.

We're talking roughly about a small to large nuke output of the entire
hole/accretion/fusion assembly.

I realized that the lifetime of a dust grain nearby a nuke is negligable.
I was thinking about attenuation of the Hawking and fusion output. One
might have to use high-velocity high-density (say, tungsten) pellets to
feed the hole instead of just relying on gravitation accretion of
hydrogen.

I think they assume the sails to be pushed by apparatus left at home.
Given that you need that much flux to push a sail one should be able to
harvest enough energy from even a few small panels (or one could make a
hybrid solar/photovoltaics sail).

We all know interstellar travel is for machines strictly. The only way to

This is unnecessarily harsh. ROI on a well researched post is negligable

Now we're treading in the area of philosophical-psychological-
cultural-political social issues that I find most important
to the survival of humans (into whatever form we evolve),
but we have already heard the old adages from our parents and
grandparents. I take these adages very seriously (consumes
some part of my off hours).

"Those who forget the lessons of the past are bound to repeat them ..."

"If we are ignorant of our roots, then humans will be dead meat puppets ..."

Just wondering, by the way: how similar in behaviour are two
genetically identical cats? Would pet owners recognize the clone's
behaviour as their pet's? (Assuming that pets do have distinct
characters, which I think pet owners will confirm.)

I guess that placed in different situations genetically identical cats
will behave differently (because identical wiring does provide for
differential behaviour according to situation), but in same situations
(as will usually happen in the pet situation) they should be quite
alike. Except, maybe, for a few slight differences like the ones
observed in the hair in the experiment.

Observation of twin pets would give some idea of this, though I think
brothers/sisters living together tend to differentiate for adaptive
purpose (each one find his own niche), especially if they happen to
have a character not very compatible with itself. Does someone on the
list have twin pets and could report about this?

I know.  But I would have expected progress somewhere, and I would have
expected that people would find it useful to, e.g., distinguish between
supergoals and subgoals, regardless of beliefs about outcomes, or for that
matter, regardless of beliefs about the nature of interaction between
supergoals and subgoals.  I'd expected that at least the *concepts* would be
useful.

First, are we talking about people on this list or people discussing AI
in general? If the first, then I would agree we should take into account
concepts that has been extensively debated on this and related forums.
But if we look at the whole field, we must be aware that our ideas have
not been spread much and hence will not affect it. This is why I think
it is essential for anybody who really wants the world to take their
ideas into account to write publications that are published in the
academic mainstream or at least somewhere where they will be read - no
matter how brilliant one's ideas are, if they are forever relegated to a
website hidden under a self-invented terminology they will not have much
effect on other people's thinking. It goes not just for your AI ideas,
but for transhumanism in general.

In many AI architectures I don't know if its is meaningful or easy to
speak about supergoals and subgoals, for example neural network based
reinforcement learning agents where goals emerge and compete
dynamically.

Eliezer,

This is one problem I have had with your published material.  When I have
asked AI experts at IBM to look at your stuff, they have no idea what you
are talking about.  You have invented your own concepts and terminology from
scratch and are not in-step with the rest of the AI community.  Although
this is not necessarily a bad thing, it does make it difficult to evaluate
your work.  Most of the experts who look at your website and published stuff
just shrug their shoulders and walk away.  I have not gotten any meaningful
evaluation from anyone.  If experts can't figure out what you are doing, I
don't see how the lay-transhumanists can figure it out.  I think that
documenting and sharing your ideas is probably your biggest problem with
getting funding or interest from other groups.

I would like to learn more about what you are doing, but it looks like I
will have to do it on my own and learn your language and concept from
scratch.  It will not be possible to get assistance from other experts in
the field.  It is very difficult to understand something where peer review,
common terminology, and cross referencing is not available.  What do you
think of this situation?  At the Extro-5 conference, you mentioned to me
that you are too busy to document your stuff to train new people to give you
more time so you won't be too busy anymore.  I know that you probably have
thought about this problem extensively.  I think Anders is exactly right,
that this problem faces many of our projects.  We must get peer-review,
public availability, and common ground, or we will be resigned to work by
ourselves in our individual basements.

Yeah, as I predicted. Its interesting the technology being applied to
pets: people are  now having their dead pets freeze dried as a quickie
taxidermy job. Next on the agenda should be selling cryonic preservation
of your pets.

Harvey, I'm not sure the rest of the AI community *has* the terminology.  I'm
currently working on a piece with references intended for more usual
publication.  Hopefully that will be an easier read for the experts once a
draft is available.  And I do use more standard terminology now than I did in
the old days, and define it better, or so I hope.

But some of the terminology just doesn't exist.  And some, e.g. "LISP
symbols", is inherently awful and needs to be replaced, e.g. by "LISP
tokens".  I'll send you a URL for the draft the moment it's available, but a
lot of AI is just *wrong* and this is something to be aware of.

Furthermore, the terminology I do use (especially recently) is drawn more from
the "brain science" end of cognitive science than the "computer science" end. 
So even where I use standard terminology, such as "complex functional
adaptation", and cite a source, such as Tooby and Cosmides 1992, the average
AI guy may not recognize it (although the average brain science guy certainly
will).

True.  And I am working on this and will hopefully have at least a draft ready
shortly.  But I am also obliged to consider questions of time, as you
mention.  Certainly I don't think the field of AI will ever be convinced by
something short of a demonstration, and we have determined that SIAI's current
priority is to place the ideas in a form where a solid project could be
initiated immediately on funding being available - i.e., more internal design
documents, not more publications, not more evangelism.  What I'm working on
currently is supposed to be a *brief* departure from those priorities.  We'll
have to see whether it helps any.

In truth, I suspect that the new paper, howsoever conforming to the standards
of academia, will still be harder to read than plain old informal GISAI,
especially since my goal for this paper is a more complete explanation tied
into existing theory, rather than a simpler and more approachable explanation.

Assume we can store x bits / kg of matter. One stored bit is worth c^2/x
J of energy if its substrate is transmuted.  The entropy cost of
erasing one bit is k T ln 2. So using one kilogram of matter to
calculate would give us c^2/ kT ln 2 bits of irreversible computation
(such as error correction). As long as c^2/x > c^2/kT ln 2 the matter
would be more valuable. This implies x < kT ln 2, i.e. at almost any
macroscopic temperature burning matter to make more information will
lead to an increase of information as long as there is any matter left
to store the results in. 

If you have M kilograms of matter and use the fraction f to produce
information, then if you end up with just enough matter to hold the
result you get: x(1-f)M=fM c^2/kTln2. The "optimal" f is
x/(x+c^2/kTln2). If x is 10^24 bits/kg (molecular matter storage) and
T=3 K, I get f=3.2e-16. On the other hand, for x 10^50 (nuclear storage
close to the Bekenstein bound) f~=1.  In the first case the matter
is so bad at storing information that you cannot use much of it for
energy, since you will run out of storage. In the second case you can
cram a lot of info into it, so you don't need much.

The breakpoint is at x=3.13e39 bit/kg, I guess around degenerate matter.

So it seems that we would expect that hot or high-density civilizations
would want to gather as much matter as possible for storage, while cool
civilizations with lower memory density would rather burn their matter
to power their computers. So given these assumptions the really advanced
civilisations using nuclear storage would likely want to imitate cosmic
dark matter...

What makes parents better suited is that they care about their child

It's quite plain and simple, actually. Educate etymologically means to
lead outside. Just take the provocative suggestion by Robert, put a
"not" operator in front of it, and you get what it is :-) You care
about the child, so you support it and then try to make it independent
and happy, i.e. seeking with success the goals that correspond to its
own valuations.

It doesn't mean it WILL be happy: this doesn't entirely depends on
you. It may kill itself because it finds life is crap in general, or
its own in particular: you will be sad. You are giving life to someone
else, distinct from you, with its own trajectory. You just give some
support for the initial part, until it can steer itself, and bon
voyage.

Not to mention talking their walk.

I'm glad to see this subject come up once again.

Part of a well balanced extropian life is sound financial
management with extensive planning for the future.

Personally, I start with 10% of my pre-tax income going off to the
401K which is never touched for any reason. I have a previous fund
(Van Kampen emerging growth) which is high risk, so my new current
fund is 80% stock 20% bonds. (with a 40% match in company stock)

I maintain funds in a money market account for emergencies which go
off to CD's above a three months supply of backup funds. These come
from a second 10% I take off from the top. If you have credit card
debt take half of this second 10% and pay it off.

Once you start doing this you will find you don't even miss these
funds.

Along with the sources Max has mentioned, I recommend the book that
completely changed the way I deal with money, David Chilton's "The
Wealthy Barber".

Don't forget to take a small portion of that first 10% and use it
for membership in the Extropy institute.

What I'm proposing is that the ship hasn't got room or resources for
unproductive individuals, nor does it need the social strife and
developmental trauma that is produced in kids by the 'alternative'
family structures our big city social engineers prefer (mostly because
they deliver the most votes for the proper political party).

Monogamous couples, though sperm banks would be a fine way to enhance
the genetic variance of the crew and the eventual colony.

Now, it's obvious that the writer of the original article was preferring
monogamous heterosexual couples, which likely stuck in Harvey's craw
just a smidgen.

The writer of the original article obviously doesn't consider cryonic
suspension and mind uploading/downloading into clones to be viable
technologies, now or in the future.

In "Possibilities for Substitution between Energy, Time and Information,"
Daniel Spreng http://www.cepe.ethz.ch/staff/daniel.htm
discusses many aspects of physics, engineering and economics and 
examines the use of those three quantities, in cumulative form, as
factors of production for any economic activity. Examination of the 
influence of "new information technology" (NIT) on energy demand shows 
that NIT is used--and could be used much more--to conserve energy, 
but that NIT serves more often to speed up processes rather than make 
them more energy efficient.

Furthermore, there are no stats on how many auto accidents are drug
induced (either intentionally or unintentionally) since doing tox
screens isn't mandated in every accidental death, nor are suspects in
traffic accidents generally given blood tests. Various surveys indicate
that the combined alcohol/drug share of accidents is upwards of 75%.

The weather induced fraction falls typically into two areas:
hydroplaning, and snow/ice sliding, though there is a small number from
hail, floods, bridge collapses, etc. Thus the majority of weather
induced accidents are the direct responsibility of the vehicle owners
buying decisions with regard to a)tires, b) brake service, and c)
vehicle features (Antilock brakes, power steering, airbags, etc), or
else the driver's skills in adverse conditions.

In my experience, few driver safety programs in the country ever teach
students to drive in adverse conditions, and no DMV tests check for such
skills. Most people outside of the northern tier states never consider
driving in snow/ice conditions to be a frequent occurence, although
hydroplaning should be expected frequently.

The best indicator of accident tendency is age. Drivers under 21 and
over 65 are mostly likely to cause accidents, and the youngest and
oldest drivers have as much as ten times greater risk than mature
drivers. 

Distraction is another contributor, whether its tuning a stereo, talking
on the cell phone, dealing with kids, or the classic female morning
combo of make-up, dressing, hair drying while driving and chatting on
the cellphone and trying to tune the radio or change a CD. While guys
can approach this, the worst we've got to do is shave while driving
(been there, done it).

My little brother says that having a kid kinda switched on something in
him that made him want to take responsibility and not resent it. I still
watch from the sidelines and cheer, "I like other people's kids."

Ok so what does a guy like me do, that has been on unemployment and
looking for werk in I.T. since march 2001, with only 4 interviews in all
that time after hundreds of contacts made, and is now working for $9.00
when I was pulling in $55k in Y2000?

Is I.T. EVER going to come back?

Just curious what other extropians think of this - Mike

http://lifeboat.com/

Welcome to The Lifeboat Foundation! Our goal is to save the human race from
extinction. Why do we think the human race will become
extinct later this century? Because advanced technologies available by about
2020 will enable one evil or simply clumsy person to
destroy all life on earth. 

_Why do we think the human race will become extinct later this century? _

Because advanced technologies available by around 2020 will enable one evil
or simply clumsy person to destroy all life on earth. 
 
One such advancement is nanotechnology. A nanotechnology based weapon known
as gray goo could easily exterminate every living thing, including viruses,
in about two days.
 
Engineered viruses and other biological weapons could also lead to our
extinction. Then there's antimatter bombs, uncontrollable AI, and finally
high energy particle accelerator mishaps which could destroy our local
space-time continuum. As you can see, there are various means by which all
life could be extinguished in the near future. And we've probably left out a
few. 
 
We predict a 25% possibility of destruction due to a lab accident and a 25%
possibility of destruction due to anti-terrorism systems malfunctioning such
as a software glitch in the active nanotechnological shield proposed by Eric
Drexler in his book Engines of Creation. And last, but not least, there is a
50% possibility of annihilation by terrorism. 
 
And we're not the only ones making that prediction. Arthur C. Clarke, the
visionary author who, in 1945, predicted a world linked by geostationary
satellites, was recently quoted as saying, "This terrorism is a frightful
danger and it is hard to see how we can get complete protection from it". 
 
The sad fact is that it will take very little resources to launch a
nanotechnology attack, basically resources equivalent to the cost of the
2001 anthrax attack in the U.S. And the FBI believes that particular attack
was the work of a lone crazy. With this in mind, it's not hard to imagine
the disastrous result of nanotechnological weapons falling into the wrong
hands.

 I don't get this impression at all. To the limited extent that investors
are noticing Drexlerian nanotech, they don't seem to connect it with
cryonics beyond noticing that both require long-term forecasts to determine
their value. Investors have been pretty consistent about distinguishing
between long-term research projects and projects that can become commercial
products within a few years. The best explanation I can come up with for
their motives is a desire not to repeat the kind of mistakes they made
at the height of the internet bubble - betting on half-baked forecasts
of what companies would be earning five to ten years into the future.
(People who made those kinds of bets on the internet around 1995 are doing
quite well, and I haven't seen any speculation in nanotech stocks that
rivals the Netscape IPO yet. But most investors remember the peak better
than they remember 1995, probably because most of them didn't know about
the internet in 1995 and have some reason to think they aren't wise enough
to get in at the very start of a big trend).

 "Fighting action" is an exaggeration. Except for a couple of Nobel prize
winners whose careers would seem less important if Drexler's vision was
realized soon, the main reaction is more like "we can't see that far into
the future". Zyvex apparently hasn't had any trouble getting funding for its
MEMS research (from a combination of government and industry sources) while
saying they're following Drexler's vision (although they seem to be putting
increasing emphasis on non-Drexlerian justifications for their research).

 I would certainly like Foresight to criticise nanohype in a more clear
and public manner than it has been doing. But doing so effectively would
drive away some of their senior associates (such as Josh Wolfe) and create
problems with their running of technical conferences that are dominated by
researchers who aren't interested in Drexlerian nanotech. I.e. they appear
to have a nontrivial financial incentive to stick to their current course.
 What can we do about that? Offer to increase our donations to Foresight
if they piss off the short-sighted nanotechnologists? I doubt we're willing
to offer enough money for that. Threaten to switch a competing organization?
ExI is sort of a competitor that farsighted senior associates can think of
as an alternative to Foresight, but I don't know how to make it into a
succesful enough organization that I could dismiss Foresight as unimportant.

 Foresight hasn't exactly been praising the government for spending
it's research money wisely, although it tends to direct what few comments
it makes towards hardcore senior associates rather than towards the public.

I think so. Now, if you want "IT", Kamen is building his factory for the

Better be careful how you do this. The Swiss banking industry is now
co-operating with Uncle S more than they did in the past. I've read articles
about this and observed it personally.

See, for example,...>>

Barbara,
  Obviously you're the expert in this area. I would point out,
and correct me if I'm wrong, that while one would have to be
scrupulous in reporting the contents of a foreign bank account
to the IRS, if one wished to be utterly "legit" this is not true
for life insurance.  This is why I suggested a Swiss annuity.
 It is not reportable, and is only taxable upon withdrawal
(at one's normal income tax level for that year), it's safe from
things such as currency controls, bankruptcy, financial reversals,
judgements by litigatous vermin, deflation, hell even governmental
seizure for most purposes.
  The Swiss have obviously moved closer towards some cooperation
with American and EU authorities, these strictures primarily
apply to criminal activity (be it laudering the proceeds of
ill done deeds) or (of course) terrorism.  They also apply
primarily to investment or bank accounts, but not really
to life insurance.
  Life insurance is covered by different rules than a standard
bank account. Much more difficult to attack.
  Also much less suspicous. How many criminals/terrorists
put their cash in life insurance???
  As long as one isn't making the odd donation to the Environmental
Liberation Front or Al-Quaeda, or paying the premiums on your
insurance with money you didn't report to the Feds...it seems
difficult to run into trouble.
  I'm not interested in playing chicken with the revenuers. :)

Brian

Hm.  This doesn't work for the main issue of the Singularity, getting to terms
with transhuman intelligence, but it might enable a small crew to survive the
two major problems (military nanotech, engineered viruses) most likely to
spike our chances of getting to that point.  I've been wishing for "second
chance at the Singularity" lifeboats for a few years, though I've been calling
them "survival stations", but I figured that it was an enormous capital
expenditure for a relatively small increment of species survival probability,
and hence not an optimal use of available resources unless annualized
planetary direct-to-Singularity funding creeps up into the $10 billion range. 
Which seems unlikely, short of a massive global surge in intelligence.

Consider work outside of I.T.

There is plenty of I.T. work going on, but you'll find more and
more software moving offshore just like manufacturing these days,
that and inexpensive programmers moving inshore.

Ireland a prime example.

Consider looking at a big established firm rather than a get-rich-
quick startup, getting a more general list of skills helps too.

Working for an RBOC isn't sexy, but they've proven to be damned
formidable.

Part of financial planning is trying not to make the same mistakes
next time.

Survival of the fittest doesn't mean the strongest, or the
smartest, it's those who best adapt to change.

I fail to see this.  If the goal is Make Master Happy, and it knows it
must exist to Make Master Happy, it will work to make sure it exists.
Why do you think otherwise?

Well, if the aliens are optimal, then they would be storing all that
matter for the far future when the surrounding universe has become
comfortably cold (less entropy costs of computation). Even if they are
nibbling away at their stores, they would likely want to keep close to
the ambient temperature and mainly use irreversible processes to do
error correction. So it is definitely cold dark matter.

Whether it is bosons or fermions is hard to guess, but bosons doesn't
seem very good at storing information or keeping themselves together, so
they would just be mass/energy storage and the functional parts would
likely be fermionic stuff. 

Scenarios like this are neat, but they always make me wonder why there
are galaxies left around. Zones of thought are too epicyclical for my
taste :-)

I wonder where the sources of all these numbers are? They seem to be
like other dramatic statistics (area of rainforest cleared every year,
children killed by sanctions against Iraq, increases/decreases in
criminality) that are told and re-told again and again to bolster a
popular position, but which nobody ever checks or can name their source.

So, how could we measure actual progress? I have seen some numbers based
on number of scientific journals, papers or Ph.D. theses, but that only
works as long as the average knowledge in them remains constant and
economic or structural changes doesn't affect them. Amount of published
unique text might be another scale (presumably the knowledge is equal to
10% of it, by Sturegon's law :-), although now the amount of web has to
be taken into account.

And this may be sufficient justification for the process.  The
simple pleasure of placing a boat with a sail and a hull
and a rudder into a lake so that one may observe the course
it follows (and potentially what it might teach you about
using the wind and currents to its best advantage) may be
sufficient.  You may learn nothing or you may learn a great deal.
Perhaps the entire point to having children is to increase the volume
of phase space that is explored so one does not view taking
the "road less travelled" as a "prison" march.  There is hope
in wondering about the paths that others may choose to follow.

Which is just not true.  I can't remember any medical discovery since I was,
say, thirteen, that was as dramatic as Pasteur's refutation of spontaneous
generation, the synthesis of uric acid, the discovery of the smallpox vaccine,
et cetera.

The number of papers published does not necessarily measure the amount
learned.

In fact, if you track the amount of exponential-doubling hype out there, and
the rate of its increase, I think that by 2008 you'll find people predicting
that the Singularity will occur in 1840.

I think of the act of reading as more of a skill. We aren't born with an
instinctual desire to read text, and up to this point in time you have
trained yourself to read in a particular manner at your current efficiency.
If you change your manner, you could very likely lose efficiency, at least
initially, but like any other skill you need to train yourself and adapt to
a new method.

If you scroll at paragraph granularity, that would obviously not be
acceptable - unless your brain has addapted to that speed, where some people
can actually read whole pages at a time. It's not impossible, it just
requires training.

The "inner ear" vocalization is known as sub-vocal. Some people may even
move their mouths without making sound.

All my (limited) knowledge of speed-reading comes from the canonical book by
Evelyn Wood. There are plenty of sites to Google at, the first one that
looks like an interesting summary is http://www.evelynwood.com.au/ . No
doubt there are many other techniques that an individual could train
themselves with, but I think there is even less computer software available
that would teach or assist in these known techniques or create new
techniques specifically for 2-D non-kinetic and silent reading on a vertical
screen.

I couldn't agree with you more. The same goes for reasoning and creativity,
IMHO.

Amen.

Such as computer-assisted automatic scrolling software, or manual frequent
periodical (e.g. 1 second) clicking of the mouse or the down arrow key as
they read to help speed them up? ;-)



This type of discussion we are having is more along the lines of should
humans adapt to computers, or computers adapt to humans, or should
"compromises" be performed by both computer and human. My vote will always
go for the latter, but I guess it really is a balancing act.

If the AI doesn't feel that its continued existence is intrinsically more desirable

Obviously your first priority will not be in saving for the future.
Someone in your situation will make looking for a good job be his highest
priority, as you are no doubt doing.

All I can suggest is that if your current strategy is not working, then
you should try something else.  Maybe you could take a class to expand
your skill set, or even consider moving to another location where jobs
might be easier to find.

I think I.T. is a fairly broad field with a number of sub-specialties.
You might do some research and try to identify areas within I.T. where
employment prospects are stronger.

(I don't know if you are being funny or not even though I'm a fellow Aussie,
but I'll reply seriously anyway.)

Because they are both methodologies of software development. But in XP,
you're really supposed to implement all of the tenets, not just parts that
sound good. In contrast with current teaching methods, I would consider it
an incomplete form of XP.

If it is hard to estimate rates of knowledge growth, then estimating
*progress* is even harder. It seems that the benefits of the earliest
fundamental discoveries in a field often get a huge impact because
subsequent improvements are compared to what has already been achieved,
not a total lack of ability.  The first smallpox vaccine was likely not
very good, but it did achieve its aims. The second vaccine was better
but now the improvement was mostly visible in statistics.

Very true. Which means that at one point the Singularity will occur...
right now! Yay! :-)

I'm suspicious of all such numbers.  I'm also suspicious of people 
extrapolating too far.  E.g., when people take a statistic out of context -- 
say like the growth rate of mildew in your bathroom -- and draw a wild 
conclusion from it -- that mildew will cover the planet knee deep in x 
years.  Usually the next step after that is advocating a new government 
program.  (Not necessarily here, but in most other venues.)

There does need to be a way of separating true knowledge growth from 
apparent growth.  I'm not sure if Ph.D. theses would be a good measure.  
Even with a 90% culling, how many of them are actually expanding knowledge? 

Also, what type of knowledge are we talking about here?  Like Hayek, I would 
distinguish between several knowledges -- putting theoretical knowledge 
(e.g., QED) in a different category from, say, "temporary" knowledge (e.g., 
the price of asparagus at my local grocer today).  There are probably other 
types too.  Which ones are growing and at what rate? 

My two cents!

Isn't someone already doing just that? (And do I get a singularity point for

I like it. Not sure Eric Klien (that's his name) is the perfect person
to attract the trust required for the investment, though. Maybe he
should build some kind of strong network of folks before to try to
raise money.

But anyhow all his efforts will promote the idea, and I think it can
only be good.

I don't know about behavior, but more disturbingly, the cloned cat does not
look like the mother.  It has totally different coloring.  The scientists
believe that non-genetic factors in the womb cause these colorations.  But
if cloned pets do not even look similar to the originals, I doubt most pet
owners would be interested.

Shakespeare probably wouldn't have written 'The Merchant of Venice'
if Venice had been a boring place.

another story:
Venetian Marco Polo's nickname was Marco Il Milione (of the million
lies) because the city-folk didn't believe his tales -- hence the name
of the two little couryards where the Polo family lived: "Corte Prima
del Milion" and "Corte Seconda del Milion".

or another story:
of Galileo hoping to improve his status at the University of Padua
by pointing out to the Senate of Venice the powerful military
advantages of the telescope to observe distant sails that would
otherwise not be seen. This was done before he spent much time
observing the sky. By spending time improving the telescope and then
showing the telescope publically from the Campanile in the Piazza
San Marco (which collapsed under its own weight in 1902, but that's
another story), he gained a lead on the competition, who were just
beginning to bring other spyglasses into Venice.

Other tidbits about Venice, I find interesting:

Venetian houses/palazzos were always entered from the water (a city
with no roads, and that's why the facades on the water front), and
built usually with three storeys, serving as a warehouse and
business (lower floors), as well as a family home (upper floors).

Venice was very difficult to attack and penetrate due to its
location built on distributed island swamps. It survived and thrived
for 1000 years, becoming the strongest commercial and naval force in
the Mediterranean, so much so, that in the early 1500s, the most
powerful people of that time: the pope, the kings of France and
Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor felt compelled to join forces to
stop the Venetian empire's advances. Venice's advances were halted,
but the city still thrived for another 200 years before its decline.

The Venetian's naval strength was built on a boat: the trireme (oars
grouped in three), its shipyards were cranking out one one warship
per day.

During the Middle Ages it had a kind of constitution, an elected
leader, and council of ten and additional council of 2000, from
which other officials were selected. It was not really a democracy
but probably better than most other things going during the Middle
Ages, driven mostly by business. Venice was politically independent
for most of its history and not part of Italy until the mid 1800s.

The state-run Casino Ridotto was open to *anyone wearing a mask* (!)
but in 1774 was closed down because too many Venetians went
bankrupt while gambling inside.

The large industrial center Mestre was founded by Venetians who
foresaw a day when development land would run out in the Lagoon. It
is essentially an extension of the same entrepreneurial spirit that
characterized Venice in her high time, and which still typifies the
Veneto region, which is now the most productive region in Europe.

=====

... and this is totally off-topic, but I think that someone should
write a book about the traveling adventures of government-stolen
art. Those Four Horses of St. Mark are now safely tucked away inside
of San Marco's Basilica (the dummy horses are those displayed
outside!).. well the Venetians claimed that the horses were theirs
when Napolean stole them and then he gave them back, but the Venetians
stole them from Constantipole four hundred years earlier! And those
obelisks that Rome proudly displays now were stolen by Mussolini and
now Egypt wants them back. And there are those many Greek art pieces
that the British Museum proudly displays as their own, which Greece
claims were stolen and would really like to havve returned.

Well, by now I'm pretty well lost !

What I was originally asking, btw, was whether the concept of a dyson sphere
(or cloud, or m-brain variant, or some other derivative of the
shell-enclosing-power-source concept), would make sense using a black hole
(into which you throw a lot of stuff), rather than the traditional star.
>From the above, I _think_ that I can assume that it could make sense,

Here, I'm thinking of an SI which is burning its candle at both ends, so to
speak. Why not?

It sounds like you are already addressing my concerns.  I am glad that my

you.

This would be very interesting to see.  Do you have any of these design
documents done yet?  I would probably pay money for a chance to review these
to get an "inside" view of your work.  I would gladly sign any
non-disclosure agreements as required to protect your interests.

If these designs are not done yet, do you have a prioritized list of what
design documents need to be developed, possibly with a project-plan
timeline?

Some of the people on the list may find this URL of interest:

http://www.btexact.com/white_papers/downloads/WP106.pdf

Its 20+ pages of futuretech predictions.

I'm not "that" impressed.  I think we've already got
"Intelligent robotic pets" (to some extent) and they
were predicting that for 2005.

There are ~10 instances of nanotech or nanotechnology.

I think they may be a bit off on their "immortaility chip-
people move into cyberspace" since thats not projected
to occur until 2100.  And since it comes after the invention
of time travel and faster than light travel, they obviously
aren't doing a good job separating the "mere" engineering
problems from the requires new physics class of problems.

Ah, well -- but at least they are thinking about the subjects.

This stuff about "really advanced civilisations" (or individuals, or some
other concept), moving to an optimal limit of computation and staying there
has always gnawed at me as a flawed notion. I guess I can't accept that the
most advanced beings in the universe would just accept a physical limitation
like that.

I think of "optimal" energy/matter ratio refered to above as "cruising
speed". Does it seem unlikely that there might be higher entropy
alternatives that allow qualitative improvements in computational ability,
compared to cruising speed?

It seems to me that we must consider the motivation of these beings. Why do
they want to sit at cruising speed, cognitively, until the universe finally
dissembles into total entropy? These are beings who, it must be supposed,
have altered themselves *radically* to get to where they are; not
conservatives I think. Early adopters in a past life ? :-)

One must consider finally that the sole purpose of these entities is to
think. Really, deeply think. Unless they get to a point where there is no
more to think about, before they hit the limits of cruise speed, could these
entites possibly be satisfied stopping at what, to them, must seem an
entirely arbitrary point?

When the lifetime of the universe begins to loom as a large concern to you,
I think you would want to find a way out of the box. If burning the candle
at both ends could make a difference, if sacrificing quantity of computation
for quality "right now" was possible, it would have to be done. If nothing
else, just for the chance to be all that you could be.

Alas, we don't have anything human-readable enough to charge for.  Right now
I'm generating all the design notes I need as a preliminary to writing up
human-readable design documents.  Under the circumstances, it seems better to
try and prototype the design documents themselves before actually writing
them, as 'twere.  Goals for the design notes:  A complete outline of the
design subsystems of a general intelligence on the various levels of
organization; a grouping of the outline into major tasks to be divided up
among the programmers (or assigned one to a programmer, if we can somehow
afford to hire that many people); high-level walkthroughs of some example
cognitive processes; a list of milestones for the first few stages; a
breakdown of submilestones along the way to the first stage.  (Actually
outlining the system modules and top-level classes is something that I'd
rather do with the rest of the programming team, once the programming team has
been pulled together.)  Right now, as I said, I'm working on the formal paper,
although of course I've gone on with the design notes during that.  Currently
the design notes are about 250K in length and include a very large (and
growing) subsystem outline.  I hope to be done with the paper soon, after
which the primary task goes back to design.  The next step in growing the
subsystem outline, when the paper is done, will be to try the walkthroughs. 
When the subsystem outline is complete it'll be possible to do the
milestones.  Then comes writing it all up.  At least that's the current plan,
which is rather highly susceptible to being obsoleted by events.

I wasn't going to mention this, because it sounds like self-promotion and I
already do too much of that, but this is pretty much the device I used in
THE WHITE ABACUS, except that instead of a black hole I used a magnetically
stabilized metric defect and instead of a Dyson surround I used a hollowed
asteroid, but power was generated by feeding gas into the thing's accretion
disk. No, I didn't really do anything much in the way of calculations,
although it's modelled on a Hawking micro-hole.

Honest to god, Anders!  If Extropia minted its own money,

Mine too.  I figure one of the biggest challenges in a multigeneration
mission would be entertainment.  I suspect everybody would be
humping everybody.  Every possible use for genitals imaginable and
some unimaginable would be tried at some time or other.  I consider
that one of the very few bright spots in the dreary life the people who

Will I.T. come back?  Yes.

Will it be as easy and cushy and eccentricity-tolerant as it was before?
No, IMO.

No offense, but I cite your signature here as an example of what won't
come back (much): "hip" titles, and certifications that are perceived to
mean more than achievements and professionalism.  (Though the tastes in
food probably won't matter.)  It's more than just trying to justify an
"entymologist" to a CFO of a software corporation vs. justifying an
"engineer".  You have to be willing to expand (mentally, not put on
weight, though that may happen too) as part of your job description.  Be
able to talk to the customers to understand their requirements, do *all*
the implementation work yourself if need be (including learning how to
do X if you don't already know - there's certainly plenty of Web
tutorials and references for most I.T. tasks these days, though you have
to know how to find them), test, document (legendary least favorite task
among engineers), and deliver.  Coding is only one of the necessary
skills.

People who can build good, reliable software are out there; they're
rather less common than people who can build good, reliable buildings,
but it's the same ballpark.  When applying for a job, remember that the
employer will be asking, "Why should I hire *you* instead of these other
professionals?"

I speak as one who was riding at over $100k plus stock options (now
worthless) before the dotcom crash, and had to "settle" for a $90k
no-stock-option salaried gig with, in practice, little overtime (they
simply can't come up with enough projects to keep me that busy, at least
on average - though there are a few days when many things come up at
once, and I have to work 9 or even 10 hours).

That said...one of the places I keep hearing about how I.T. has already
picked up is in biotech.  If you remember college biology (what's an
amino acid, and what do DNA, RNA, and proteins have to do with each
other?) and know Perl (a language that does well at munging the ASCII
text flatfiles that many biologists use instead of databases), I'm told
it shouldn't be too hard to find a job if you check the local biotech
companies (assuming, of course, that you live near some).  If you
don't...basic bio can be self-taught (check out what your local college
reccomends for a bio textbook, or maybe check out MIT's online bio
class reference material), as can basic Perl (assuming you already know
how to program - and if you don't know Perl, then teaching yourself Perl
as a means towards an end, in this case convincing potential employers
that you know it, is a good example of the type of job responsibilities
I'm talking about).

BTW, since we're on the topic anyway - I know someone who has an opening
for a systems administrator.  It's in Mountain View, CA, and I suspect
there are a few here whose resumes might match.  Warning, though: my
interests in this matter lie squarely with them; if I don't like what I
see, I'll discard it, possibly even mostly unread.  If you're not a
Solaris and Linux guru - especially if you're one of the many MSCEs
who've applied to them and thought that said cert was better than actual
Unix experience to administer Unix machines - don't bother.

See Eli's earlier response to this thread.  He sites a number of his

They do look similar.  As similar as two zebras or two calico cats ever look. 
There's a big difference between the similarity you expect between twin
dalmatians and twin collies.  Most of the appearance of some animals is in
their genes.  with others, the pattern is programmed, but the particulars are
an emergent property.  If you want the clone to look exactly like the
original, better start with a breed where the appearance doesn't vary much
from individual to individual.

Human twins don't have identical fingerprints.  It's the same principle.

Ah thanks! I was just looking for validation of some song lyrics... "a notch
in space and in time, an endless hole for the scree, event horizon in the
shell holding me". It occured to me belatedly that I didn't know if that
idea made any sense. So I thought I'd ask a nice, simple question onlist...

btw, any idea how I can get hold of White Abacus? I've tried local
bookshops, including Known Space, but no luck.

That all sounds good to me.  In fact it sounds a lot like the "dumb" AI I'm 
in favor of.  But my impression is that many here (notably Eli) think that 
won't be good enough.  The opinion seems to be that in order to bring about 
the Tech Singularity, you need an AI which is every bit as sentient, 
intelligent and self-aware as we are (in fact, even more so).

My point (which seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle) is that once you 
have a super-human AI that learns and processes information *way* faster 
than we do (particularly one that is self-enhancing and hence learns at an 
exponentially accelerating rate) that it will be impossible, either by 
friendly "supergoals" or otherwise, to keep the AI from transcending any 
limits we might hope to impose on it.  Which will lead to us being 
completely at its mercy.

My point in a nutsell: friendliness cannot be imposed on one's superior.  
Genes tried it, and made a good run of it for quite a while.  Increasing our 
intelligence made our genes ever more successful than the competitors of our 
species.  But, as our genes found out, too much of a good thing is a bad 
thing.  We now pursue gene-imposed subgoals (sex, for instance) while 
bypassing completely the supergoals (i.e., kids) at our whim.

I've still not heard any sound argument on how we can prevent the same thing 
from happening to us and our "supergoals" once the AI is our intellectual 
superior.

Well, as the guy who started this thread, I suppose it falls to me to answer 
that one.  My answer is that, so far as I comprehend it, your 
supergoal/subgoal explanation does not resolve the problem.  My 
understanding of your theory is that, so long as the AI's sub-goals are all 
in service of friendly supergoals, we have nothing to fear.  But, I'm making 
a few assumptions, and here they are:

1. The AI will be curious (either as a sub- or supergoal);

2. The AI will have "general intelligence" (such that it can evaluate a huge 
decision tree and choose which among the myriad branches will best meet its 
goals);

3. It will be self-aware (such that it has an accurate picture of the world, 
including its own place in that picture).

If any of those assumptions is wrong, then you can forget everything I've 
said before.  But, if each of those assumptions is correct, then they 
inherently conflict with your concept of a friendly AI.  If you do not see 
this conflict let me know and I'll paint the picture in full detail (if 
you're still interested by now.)

Australian bookshops hate selling Australian science fiction. They don't
know it exists. If they do know, they deny this for fear of pollution.
Something like that. (`We don't stock it because it never sells.' `How do
you know it never sells if you don't stock it?' `I think we used to stock
it once but it never sold.' `Oh. Hmmm. Got any Piers Anthony?' `Come right
this way, my man! Just past that entire wall groaning with imported Star
Wars and Star Trek knock-offs.')

(They do know Australian fantasy exists, especially if it comes in obese
trilogy form.)

Indeed.  Since one is a set of self-perpetuating patterns that 
include some changes it seems that being both is inescapable. 
Perhaps it is only when we try to slice ourselves into isolated 
segments rather than being and becoming that their seems to be 
an issue.

Since you are in part a variety of possible becomings which 
timewise gradually become you and what you were, it doesn't seem 
like you give up everything you are.  But you do have to let go 
of your perhaps somewhat frozen notion of what "you are" in 
order to become something significantly different with acceptance.

Yes.  But those who think the present is sufficiently like the

What are our roots?  Are they all in the past or do we 
continuously pick up our roots and put them down elsewhere and 
grow new ones in the process?  I don't think we will survive 
long as uploads or posthumans if we cling to tenaciously to 
roots that no longer all or even much of what we are nourished 
by or growing from.

Your proposal is not a "solution" as all the possibilities of 
disaster go with you.  Solve the problem here or elsewhere, it 
is still the same problem.  Running off to build space colonies 
will simply distract from actually facing the problem.

Or, if you have a bend in that direction, think up your own idea 
for a business and look for funding, first clients.  Sometimes 
looking for a regular job or even a regular contracting job is 
simply the wrong thing for you or for the time and place.  I 
know it sounds crazy.

The one thing you have right now is time.  And obviously you 
have some computer/net resources.  So there is room to work on 
things that are strongly meaningful to you.  Those could well be 
used to increase reputation and presence and perhaps to find an 
idea or two that could receive financing and serve as a seed of 
your future.  As long as you aren't starving or about to be 
homeless you may as well take advantage of the situation where 
you can.

In relation to "intelligence" in its purest and most universal form, goals
are essentially external bias sources that generate gradients for doing work
in the same way enthalpy gradients can drive work in the physical world.
Biological intelligence comes with a number of bias sources wired into the
intelligence engine by default.  While it would be a complex analysis, I
think that a cursory inspection indicates that all the goals of humans are
really subgoals of the external biases that come with the hardware.

>From this perspective, AI doesn't need to do anything at all and probably
couldn't, beyond acting as an efficient recording device perhaps.
Externally biasing the AI structure (e.g. a command from a prompt) would be
the primary way of extracting intelligent behavior, and you would get the
same level of intelligence from an unmotivated AI as you would an equivalent
one with a constant source of bias.  Where this could become interesting is
devising a permanent bias source for an AI structure that actually gives the
results the designer intends.  There is a good argument to be made that a
constantly biased AI engine will do far more interesting things in the long
run (and do more "AI-ish" things as most people imagine it) at a level of
efficiency that could be higher than an unbiased AI.  However, designing
high quality bias sources into an AI in practice does not appear to be a
trivial problem and one can easily imagine all sorts of Faustian unintended
consequences resulting from "auto-biasing" intelligence.  It certainly has
provided plenty of fodder for SF books.

I think it might be perfectly valid to classify AI as either "externally
biased" or "internally biased" depending on how the biasing mechanisms are
wired into the general intelligence engine.  I can also imagine the
political and legal fallout in a useless attempt to regulate specific
capabilities in this vein.

"Self-aware" is a meaningless property. Any system needs to have an
internal self model as a subset of world representation, in order to be
able to plan its future actions. "Self awareness" used in magic mantra
sense is almost as meaningless as "consciousness".

My interests, your interests, or Alan Grimes' interests? And how is it
supposed to keep catering to all our interests encoded into it as a seed,
as this seed grows in size and complexity into rather mindboggling
proporitions?

How does it supposed to self-enhance, if it is forbidden from use
noise-driven/evolutionary algorithms? If it executes a self enhancement
plan, which impacts manifest a few decades downstream, and are
uncomputable given its current resources?

Qubit based technology seems to require cryogenic environments, whereas
computronium will be obviously limited to the <1 kK temperature range
before you'll get into deterioration regime. Node cloud assemblies need to
be obviously small and sparse enough that you can get rid of that by
radiative transfer, which gives you a relativistic latency bound. What is
the optimal radial distribution of the node density, given above
constraints, anyone knows?

We don't know if degenerate matter (gravitation-stabilized, I presume?
That would make it essentially a flat spherical assembly around a core
otherwise useless but for energy generation)  offers sufficient structural
variety to build computational machinery.

I think agoric/evolutionary systems are not so rational as a whole, and
would tend to try to run as fast as possible (co-evolution does select for
faster reflexes, and an order of magnitude slower human is not employable
even if he uses less energy, as long as energy is cheap). If we look at
our solar system, and just at the Sun's output, we'll see that there is a
surplus of matter over energy. Iirc Robert said that Mercury alone is
sufficient to intercept the entire solar output if disassembled in a high
enough orbit to be still useful for photovoltaics and computation. Mercury
represents a very small fraction of mass in the system, even if we
consider heavier elements.

Once the Sun output is intercepted completely (would 2 MT of energy/s flux
be sufficient to fabricate and stabilize microsingularities?), and
utilized to the full, and we have surplus matter, pressure for lebensraum
would seem to create a demand for fusion outside. Speedup will be
1e5..1e6, but we might run out of energy sources but the Sun (assuming,
people won't start lifting matter from it) in a far shorter time period
than expected. Infrared luminosity of the system (lightdays to a
lightmonth) would seem to increase towards quite hight values.

Our physics is obviously impcomplete, and so far the universe has been
very favourable to us, but assuming that things will just get better and
better without further evidence is a bit too optimistic.

I don't see what needs to be cruising, other than information. It might be
encoded in streams of relativistic pellets, but the carrier and transport
is negligable.

These beings are many and diverse, and so is their agenda. Assuming
anything else would see to require postulating a sustained diversity loss,
or supression of radiation after passage through a diversity bottleneck
(first autofeedback seed). Do you have a mechanism for that?

Ecologies as a whole don't think an awful lot (even if containing
philosopher-king types), and do not like being controlled. They just are
homeostating there, more or less. (Never mind a few extinctions, it's
business as usual).

I would throw my lot behind the proposed idea of space colonies, contingent on developing a low cost way to build them (such as a
space elevator) or mining asteroids or the moon. Otherwise, a series of floating cities very high in the sky would probably offer
good enough coverage for most purposes.

For those new here, I have my own project at http://ascension.webhop.org for developing a technological society. The project focuses
more on a new theory of social systems (which it seems most people neglect or have great misunderstanding with) and I didn't expect
it to begin operating anytime soon, as I expect the neccessary technology, social knowledge and motivation to reach maturity only
near the year 2050.


Should we have to learn the lesson of "putting all our eggs in our basket" the hard or the easy way? If you spend a good chunck of
you money to buy insurance for yourself or your family, you might consider this additional coverage. And when did the insurance
agents ever give us discounts?

Why do we have to think of insurance in a negative way? If you insured your house from theft, then does that mean you would sit
around waiting to get robbed? If you insured your yourself from accidents, then do you beglect yourself so much that you get into
them?


How can we run away from the problems on Earth by buying insurance? How do we know our plans work, or do we even have any plans at
all? Why not have a catch-all backup system that can pay dividends, by pioneering space-related technology and also giving those
technologically primitive earthlings a motivation to get into space?

By the time a doomsday asteroid comes, its too late to hug the Buddha's leg, as a Chinese idiom goes. Do you think you can evacuate
enough people in 3 day's time, or even a year's time? Meanwhile, I would probably consider signing up for cryogenics, but the
cryogenics storage center had better reside somewhere *not* on planet Earth.


See you in the future.

Damien, I have not found this to be the case in my part of the world.  A book having been written by an Australian is seen as a major marketing point to be emphasized.

Assuming, singularities are real, there are two classes of them: those
evaporating, and those growing. Evaporation is a runaway process, so
depending on whether singularities were created during Big Bang, and their
size spectrum, there are from zero to very few evaporating singularities
still left. Their luminosity is negligible as far as astronomical objects
is concerned, and their only detectable feature is a weird spectrum
(perfect blackbody, assuming they're really information destruction
devices, and do not radiate information of objects dropped into them
encoded in photons).

Assuming, you can't make those (presumably, requiring devices on stellar
to galactic scales), those found naturally are negligible as power source.
If you can make them, and homeostate their mass by feeding them (with
worthless stuff such as iron, for instance) they're very handy do
catalytically convert any matter according to E=mc^2 into Hawking
blackbody radiation.

At least in this solar system, the output of the Sun is insufficient to
drive computation of devices constructed from mass outside of the star.

Pressume to maximize the niche would seem to cause expansion to intercept
all available natural output, and then use of fission and fusion (or
other, yet hypothetical power sources) to make use of all the rest of the
matter.

You got used to think that there is a God-like Total Solution in a few
decades. Not everyone is thus convinced. Just preserving human life
beyond a terrestrial catastrophe does look like something important to
some.

If you think of it, it's pretty obvious: it would be incredibly
mindless, while there is some risk of terrestrial human life
extinction, not to try something like that.

First, it is not a choice between this and other initiatives. Second,
the very initiative can only raise consciousness to the existing
perils, which seems good to me.

For Eliezer, the urgency of SI is, if I recall well, linked to
nanotech arrival. So if people, reflecting on the lifeboat initiative,
get to understand the perils of nanotech, they might even donate to
Sing. Institue. Think how many people don't have any clue about any of
this now.

No-one knows what will happen. I think it's fine that this should be
tried among other things.

Greeeeeeeeeeeeeeetings,

I've seen several posts in this thread which made me wonder:
 "Did he/she read GISAI and CFAI several times 'each' ?????"
 If he/she did, was it done with an open mind ? I think not. If I start
bla-bla-ing about planet disassembly without reading what the people who
formulated the hypothesis have to say, some pople on this list would get
pissed off. And rightly so. It works BOTH ways. I fully second Eli: there
***should have been** some progress **at least - really at least** at the
conceptual level on CFAI and GISAI. Questions asked here, ***were***
answered several times on the SL4 list which is archived online. Doing 'Sl4
archive' at google pulls it. Searching on the 'Low Beyond' pulls it. What I
cannot understand, is the 'unspoken' undercurrent biased attitude about CFAI
and GISAI. I'm no fu**ing genius, I'm an everyday average curious kid. If I
can grok most of what Eli writes, it's because I spend a lot of time trying
to see what he sees. I **spend a lot of time** trying to **see what Eliezer
was seeing** when writing/thinking about it. I 'hijack' his models. It's
only after having done so (having a clear model of Eli's way of thinking
about this - which is mutating as we speak) that I can
agree/disagree/update/improve the design/ thinking/model or take a tangent
if I wish to do so. I re-read CFAI and GISAI every few weeks, I think about
it most of my awaken hours. Certain questions cannot be answered in one or
two lines. There's no magic stuff, it's all inter-connected and elements can
only be understood if their profundly-complex relationships with other
elements are understood.

It is not my intention to offend anyone ( I mean it ==)), however, this list
is where I'd expect a certain level of 'minditronium'. Here more than
anywhere else is where I would expect a general 'what is he/she seeing when
saying that' attitude. Is 'expecting' where it went wrong ? *sweet smile*
Someone complained a few days ago that black holes were basic stuff that was
explained all over the place. That person wanted 'denser' content, less
VaporMindWare. I feel the same way. *sweet smile*

I repeat: I **do not intend** to offend anyone, but Eli wrote GISAI and CFAI
for people to read/study/hack it. I do not believe it's done as often as it
should be done. I also do not believe it has anything to do with how it's
written. For Arona's sakes !!!! This is the Extropians list. People should
be wanting to understand for the goddam sake of it, because understanding
correlates with knowledge increase. It should not matter how it is written
or what it smells or whether it likes coffee with/out milk *rolls eyes*. The
AI community is known to have NO vocabulary. Why should Eli not create his
own if he feels that some things need to be formalized instead of being
shoved under the carpet ? If Eli saw (or believed he did or does) where
Classical AI went wrong, so can I. If I can, so can everyone. The AI
community has been attempting AI without understanding the human brain and
that is stupid. Anyone trying to do that will never get anything done in AI.
Yet, that is what the AI community did. They all got funky with buzzwords
and 'Expert systems' and used AI everywhere it had nothing to do with AI.
Now that it's going down the drain coz of lack of results, anyone who even
pretends to try creating AI in a different way (hint: Friendly Seed AI ) ,
is shot down in flames. That's a loser attitude, period.


Arona Ndiaye.

PS: English ain't even my mother tongue, if I can get it, how hard can it
'conceptually' be ? Honestly ? *waves to everyone*
PS2: And **no**, I-am-not-defending Eliezer, just in case someone was
jumping on that train. I just want people to read CFAI and GISAI, for real.
PS3: The worst of all that: Eli saw it coming and had a paragraph explaining
why he believed **his** approach to AI was different and was likely to
succeed where Classical AI failed..

I assume (I hope) that the scare-quotes are there to show that what we would
*assume* to be the AI's "own" interests from an anthropomorphic perspective
are not the AI's actual interests, and that vis actual interests are
Friendliness.

The same, of course, applying to a transcending human.  The essential
inscrutability of the Singularity means that our understanding of Friendly AI
is essentially limited to whether the seed, heading into the Singularity, is
*as good as a human*.  Human complexity is scrutable; transhuman complexity
isn't.

It may be reassuring (or not) to realize that the means by which we resist
evolution is itself evolved, only on a deeper level.  We are imperfectly
deceptive social organisms who compete by arguing about each other's motives;
that is, we are political organisms.  We have adaptations for arguing about
morality; that is, in addition to our built-in evolutionary morality, we also
have dynamics for choosing new moralities.  In the ancestral environment this
was, I suspect, a relatively small effect, amounting to a choice of
rationalizations.  However, any seed AI theorist can tell you that what
matters in the long run isn't how a system starts out, it's how the system
changes.

So of course, our dynamics for choosing new moralities are starting to
dominate over our evolutionary moralities, due to a change in cognitive
conditions:  Specifically, due to:  (1) an unancestrally large cultural
knowledge base (stored-up arguments about morality); (2) an unancestrally good
reflective model of our own mentality (timebinding historical records of
personalities, and (more recently) evolutionary psychology); (3) an
unancestral technological ability to decouple cognitive supergoals that are
evolutionary subgoals from their evolutionary rationales (i.e. contraception).

(3) in particular is interesting because the way in which it came about is
that evolution "instructed" us to do certain things without "telling us why". 
We won against evolution because evolution failed to treat us as equals and
take us into its confidence (he said, anthropomorphizing the blind actions of
an unintelligent process with no predictive foresight).

No, it's meant to clarify the question.  The resolution consists of a lot more
theory than that bound up in cleanly causal goal systems (i.e., with subgoals
and supergoals).  For a fast summary of the design theory that unfortunately
leaves out most of the reasoning, check out "Features of Friendly AI" at:

My guess is that you're about to say that a self-aware AI would be capable of
redesigning its own goal system in accordance with its own interests. 
Friendly AI, since it's supposed to be human-complete, allows for the
possibility that programmer-infused supergoals can be wrong under certain
cases that we would regard as intuitive (we can conceive of the programmer
saying "Oops", and the Friendly AI needs to understand this too).

Without this *additional complexity*, I fear that goals would be
automatically, eternally, and absolutely stable, even in cases that we would
regard as boring and stupid and wrong; because the design purpose of the goal
system is viewed in terms of the referent of the current goal system, and any
design change to the current goal system almost automatically goes against the
referent of the current goal system.  Friendly AI absorbs the human intuition
that supergoals can be "mistaken" by viewing the current goal system as a
probabilistic approximation of the goal system's referent, and distinguishing
between the goal system and its referent.

Storing. Computation can be assumed to be reversible, with the exception
of the irreversible bit erasures costing energy. I used classical bits,
since I was thinking of long-term storage - qubits aren't known for
their persistence. 

A more quantum approach would be to use the Bekenstein bound. Assume we
have a radius R, mass M system. That allows us to store kMR bits in
quantum states. So if we use the same analysis as before,
kMR(1-f)=fMc^2/kTln2, producing the optimal f= kR/(kR+c^2/kTln2). kR is
a huge number for macroscopic R, again producing a f~=1.

I assumed "simply" lossless conversion into energy. Clearly a more
careful analysis has to take the entropy change of matter -> energy
conversion into account and could perhaps calculate limiting efficiency.

Sounds like a fun optimization problem. Given a number of small spheres
with blackbody heat emissions, which distribution minimizes average
distance for a given temperature bound?

If then spheres have radius r and disspiation W, the heat balance
of sphere i becomes  

W + sum_j 4 pi^2 sigma T_j^4 r^3 / R_ij^2 = 4 pi sigma r T_i^4

(essentially a radiosity equation; I think I have oversimplified it a
bit by assuming R >> r). R_ij is the distance between sphere i and j. So
we need to find the configuration that minimizes sum_ij R_ij and where
max T_i < T_max. I would probably solve this by a genetic algorithm or
hillclimbing, but I don't have the time.

True. I think degenerate matter offers enough stability to store
information (C12/C13 nuclei in a lattice), but it is not obvious how to
do processing in it. Even worse for nuclear matter. 

Hmm, just a realization: my above argument implies that if the supercivs
are using nuclear densities, they will be highly visible by their energy
dissipation. But if you can't use neutronium for storage, then they will
likely be in the quiet region. So this provides a prediction that
nuclear matter may not be suitable for storage if we assume the
existence of supercivs, since otherwise they would be visible.

I have not read the novel yet, but the reviewer makes some good points
about the problem of writing sf that stretches between two extremely
different conceptual domains. In many ways Egan may be approaching a
kind of understanding horizon - some of his concepts simply can't be
parsed without a firm grounding in differential geometry or quantum
gravity, and any attempt to simplify them for the reader loses out the
essential properties.

It would be interesting to see what happened if one wrote a sf story
whose intended audience were already totally familiar with the field.
Sf for mathematicians, with no pretenses of being understandable by
everyone (hmm, I have been thinking about the possibilities of exotic
differentiable structures in R^4 for some time...)

Of course, to some extent this problem is true for most real sf (I here
disregard stories about WW II ace pilots, hardboiled detectives or
classical myths given a sf garnishing): they build on shared
assumptions and concepts that have to be learned by reading other sf
(and possibly some popular science): wormholes, hyperdrives, AI,
nanotechnology, psionics etc - they all have implicit connotations that
make them easy to re-use, suggest their role in the story and some
things they can and cannot do. A reader unfamiliar with these
connotations would find reading a sf novel hard or impossible. Which
may be one reason why sf is not as popular as fantasy, whose tropes and
assumptions are often built on more widespread stories. 

In the long run it seems that sf may get into the same problem as much
of science: as long as it wants to write stories about *ideas*, it
needs to create macros, terminology and concepts that allow stories to
deal with more and more remote ideas, but to be able to understand the
stories the readers have to educate themselves further and further.
Eventually the gap becomes so large that the science or sf sub-genre
(like Egans posthuman theoretical physics stories) become isolated, a
realm that can be truly visited only by experts.

Hermits and Cranks
Fifty years ago Martin Gardner launched the modern skeptical movement.
Unfortunately, much of what he wrote about is still current today

By MICHAEL SHERMER
...........
PHOTO BY BRAD HINES


Martin Gardner's book In the Name of Science is the bible of the modern
skeptical movement.

In 1950 Martin Gardner published an article in the Antioch Review entitled
"The Hermit Scientist," about what we would today call pseudoscientists. It
was Gardner's first publication of a skeptical nature (he was the math
games columnist for Scientific American for more than a quarter of a
century). In 1952 he expanded it into a book called In the Name of Science,
with the descriptive subtitle "An entertaining survey of the high priests
and cultists of science, past and present." Published by Putnam, the book
sold so poorly that it was quickly remaindered and lay dormant until 1957,
when it was republished by Dover. It has come down to us as Fads and
Fallacies in the Name of Science, which is still in print and is arguably
the skeptic classic of the past half a century.

Thankfully, there has been some progress since Gardner offered his first
criticisms of pseudoscience. Now largely antiquated are his chapters on
believers in a flat earth, a hollow earth, Atlantis and Lemuria, Alfred
William Lawson, Roger Babson, Trofim Lysenko, Wilhelm Reich and Alfred
Korzybski. But disturbingly, a good two thirds of the book's contents are
relevant today, including Gardner's discussions of homeopathy, naturopathy,
osteopathy, iridiagnosis (reading the iris of the eye to determine bodily
malfunctions), food faddists, cancer cures and other forms of medical
quackery, Edgar Cayce, the Great Pyramid's alleged mystical powers,
handwriting analysis, ESP and PK (psychokinesis), reincarnation, dowsing
rods, eccentric sexual theories, and theories of group racial differences.


The "hermit scientist," a youthful Gardner wrote, works alone and is
ignored by mainstream scientists. "Such neglect, of course, only
strengthens the convictions of the self-declared genius." But Gardner was
wrong by half in his prognostications: "The current flurry of discussion
about Velikovsky and Hubbard will soon subside, and their books will begin
to gather dust on library shelves." Adherents to Immanuel Velikovsky's
views on how celestially caused global catastrophes shaped the beliefs of
ancient humans are a quaint few surviving in the interstices of fringe
culture. L. Ron Hubbard, however, has been canonized by the Church of
Scientology as the founding saint of a world religion.

In 1952 Gardner could not have known that the nascent flying saucer craze
would turn into an alien industry: "Since flying saucers were first
reported in 1947, countless individuals have been convinced that the earth
is under observation by visitors from another planet." Absence of evidence
then was no more a barrier to belief than it is today, and ufologists
proffered the same conspiratorial explanations for the dearth of proof: "I
have heard many readers of the saucer books upbraid the government in no
uncertain terms for its stubborn refusal to release the 'truth' about the
elusive platters. The administration's 'hush hush policy' is angrily cited
as proof that our military and political leaders have lost all faith in the
wisdom of the American people."

Even then Gardner was bemoaning that some beliefs never seem to go out of
vogue, as he recalled an H. L. Mencken quip from the 1920s: "Heave an egg
out of a Pullman window, and you will hit a Fundamentalist almost anywhere
in the U.S. today." Gardner cautions that when religious superstition
should be on the wane, it is easy "to forget that thousands of high school
teachers of biology, in many of our southern states, are still afraid to
teach the theory of evolution for fear of losing their jobs." Today
creationism has spread northward and mutated into the oxymoronic form of
"creation science."

And the motives of the hermit scientists have not changed either. Gardner
recounts the day that Groucho Marx interviewed Louisiana state senator
Dudley J. LeBlanc about a "miracle" cure-all vitamin-and-mineral tonic
called Hadacol that the senator had invented. When Groucho asked the
senator what it was good for, LeBlanc answered with surprising honesty: "It
was good for five and a half million for me last year."

What I find especially valuable about Gardner's views are his insights into
the differences between science and pseudoscience. On the one extreme we
have ideas that are most certainly false, "such as the dianetic view that a
one-day-old embryo can make sound recordings of its mother's conversation."
In the borderlands between the two "are theories advanced as working
hypotheses, but highly debatable because of the lack of sufficient data."
Of these Gardner selects a most propitious example: "the theory that the
universe is expanding." That theory would now fall at the other extreme end
of the spectrum, where lie "theories almost certainly true, such as the
belief that the earth is round or that men and beasts are distant cousins."

How can we tell if someone is a scientific crank? Gardner offers this
advice: (1) "First and most important of these traits is that cranks work
in almost total isolation from their colleagues." Cranks typically do not
understand how the scientific process operatesthat they need to try out
their ideas on colleagues, attend conferences and publish their hypotheses
in peer-reviewed journals before announcing to the world their startling
discovery. Of course, when you explain this to them they say that their
ideas are too radical for the conservative scientific establishment to
accept. (2) "A second characteristic of the pseudo-scientist, which greatly
strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward paranoia," which manifests
itself in several ways:

(1) He considers himself a genius. (2) He regards his colleagues, without
exception, as ignorant blockheads.... (3) He believes himself unjustly
persecuted and discriminated against. The recognized societies refuse to
let him lecture. The journals reject his papers and either ignore his books
or assign them to "enemies" for review. It is all part of a dastardly plot.
It never occurs to the crank that this opposition may be due to error in
his work.... (4) He has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best-established theories. When Newton was the
outstanding name in physics, eccentric works in that science were violently
anti-Newton. Today, with Einstein the father-symbol of authority, a crank
theory of physics is likely to attack Einstein.... (5) He often has a
tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many cases making use of terms
and phrases he himself has coined.

We should keep these criteria in mind when we explore controversial ideas
on the borderlands of science. "If the present trend continues," Gardner
concludes, "we can expect a wide variety of these men, with theories yet
unimaginable, to put in their appearance in the years immediately ahead.
They will write impressive books, give inspiring lectures, organize
exciting cults. They may achieve a following of oneor one million. In any
case, it will be well for ourselves and for society if we are on our guard
against them." So we still are, Martin. That is what skeptics do, and in
tribute for all you have done, we shall continue to honor your founding
command.

I disagree with your premise.  As Godel pointed out, a single integer can
store an infinite amount of information:
Digitize the information into discrete bytes a, b, c, ...
Encode a single integer as 2^a * 3 ^b * 5^c ... using prime numbers for the
base.
Any unique infinate data will have a unique result.
Then take only TWO atoms and store the number as say the number of inches
betwen them.

Thus, any two atoms can store an infinite amount of information.  (The only
limit in the scheme I have given is the size of the universe in inches.)
Given cleverness in how to store large integers, I don't think there is a
limit based on the amount of matter in the universe.

The real energy shortage will be in how much energy it takes to read/write
information.  All reading and writing of data seems to require energy.
Thats where the energy cost will lie.

Actually, it is a good complement. Not having all the eggs in the same
basket is always a good strategy against threats. And the effort to
build a space colony does not compete strongly with developing better
nano, biotech or AI - in fact, it would likely be a great deal of
synergy between the areas. If I run away to build space colonies and
you build nanodefenses, in the end we have two qualitatively different
ways of avoiding total wipeout - far more likely to protect than a
single, slightly more elaborate solution. 

The problem is of course how to get such a project (literally) off the
ground. Space industry has so far not proven particularly competitive,
space tourism *might* be slightly profitable and a possible bootstrap
method. But right now you cannot readily sell places on a disaster
refuge, the demand simply isn't there. From my own scenario planning /
roleplaying experiments it seems that once you get enough people
worried about imminent disaster (even a highly predictable one), it is
nearly too late to set up a decent space habitat. 

I think I will be in the nanodefense business myself.

Ugh. If that is a pre-requisite for starting or entering a discussion, then
there should be no discussion unless each person can prove that they have
done so. This is an open forum, and if someone does not have the
pre-requisite knowledge you believe they should know, then kindly refer them
to the information source. An even more radical approach would be to filter
out their messages if they continue to post until you get some notification
that they do have the background knowledge that you require for what you
consider cohesive communication. But like I said, this is a fairly open
forum (although the lower threshold of intelligence is high compared to most
other open forums).

Not rightly so at all. For communication to happen, the sender must send a
clear signal, and the receiver must be receptive. In your role as a sender,
it is your responsibility to send a clear signal as you possibly can. To do
that effectively you must understand the capabilities of the receptor. If
you write a whole bunch of stuff that nobody reads, statistical probability
tells me that it's most likely to be your problem, not necessarily the
(potential) receiver's.

And that's all a good learner needs to know. Maybe lesser learners require a

You have been adapting your learning model to be able to receive Eli's
message, tailored to Eli's style of communication. Most people are not
willing to do that because it takes too much energy. Personally, I think
most people write and talk too much anyway. Communication Theory and
Information Theory is a whole other domain that you may find interesting if
you are looking for a model of communication. Not interested? Oh well, I
tried.

Congratulations, you are well on the way of understanding the Eli
communication protocol standard. I hope the effort is worth it. I'm sure Eli
is modifying the protocol himself as he learns and continues to communicate.
His effectiveness and worthiness will be judged by how many people do
actually get the message without too much adjustment of their receptiveness.

IMHO, you're wrong. Why should anyone care what he's written? Why should
anyone care what you write? We all have intent in our communication, but
there needs to be some sort of hook or link to the content that will grab
each person's interest so that they may decide whether it is worth their
time to actively pursue reading all that stuff. If you've gotten this far in
the email reply, I am honored that you find my opinion interesting enough to

No vocabulary? I'm certain there is a lot of jargon. There are many AI
domain experts. As for formalized standards, it's not going to be defined in
natural language, that's for sure.

Would we have built a flying hot air balloon by studying how birds fly? I
don't disagree that there is a lot we can understand from the brain and our
neural network model, but there are other ways, even "classical" ways such
as expert systems and giant lookup tables that could work (inefficiently).
Or some other model (most likely).

Friendliness and Seediness I see as different applications of AI, each with
its own purpose. These applications are programmed on top of a General AI,
which is the theoretical base of all AI. Maybe I'm wrong, but buzzwords are
just jargon, or language of the AI community's domain. Just because you
think someone doesn't "get it" like you do doesn't mean that they are losers
at all. Maybe it is you who doesn't get it. If you seek acceptance from a
community, you must find acceptable ways to focus their view. Complaining
about your unsuccessful attempts to show people your view makes you the
"loser", if you must use that emotional term.

You can only move slower than c. Storage and retrieval of data will
take exponentially increasing time as it gets longer.

Storing a one megabyte text would require a distance X where log X =
127*(log(2)+log(3)+...+log(1e6/(log(1e6)-1))) ~= 127 sum_1^7.803e4
log(n) ~= 1.0172e8 (here I used the prime number density approximation
pi(n)=n/(log(n)-1)). exp(1e8) is a *very* large number. For
comparision, ln [100 billion lightyears] ~= 64.417.  So that megabyte
text is far too large to be encoded in the visible universe. If you
settle for a 100 billion lightyear distance, then you can't use any
character higher than 92 (backslash in ascii) if you want to fit it in.

Gdel numbers are great in mathematics, but useless in megascale
computation.

Somewhere in an alternate universe, there is a version of Eliezer Yudkowsky
who publishes "leisurely" scientific papers, and one of those papers is
entitled "Special difficulties consequent to research on generally intelligent
supersystems."  I'll probably never get to write that paper.  But I'd like to
publish a small excerpt from that alternate universe.

Right now I'm trying to use standard words, without neologism, and yet this
involves a new problem:  I'm rapidly running out of words.  If you discuss
generally intelligent supersystems, then not only will you need to overload an
immense number of words, but furthermore they will be very abstract words,
ones that would otherwise play a strong supporting role in abstract language. 
In my paper, I can no longer say "the past concept that children have no
mathematical abilities"; I have to say "the past notion that children have no
mathematical abilities".  "Concept" has already been overloaded as a technical
term.  I have to use "notion" or "idea".

Recently I wanted to discuss the second part of a trigger - you know, the
thing that happens after the condition part is satisfied - and I found that I
couldn't.  "Action" was long since overloaded to describe a deliberate action
of the AI.  "Sequitur", which would have been appropriate in this case, had
been used somewhere more important.  I'd used up the space of causal
terminology and the only words left didn't really describe what I wanted to
say - "consequence" and "effect" and "outcome", for example, treat the action
(sigh) as static, rather than as an active force.  And at that I was lucky the
paper didn't go into causality in more detail, or I would probably have been
forced to use up "consequence", "effect", and "outcome" as well.  At one
point, faced with the prospect of being forced to overload the term "problem"
to describe a virtual-environment challenge presented by the programmer to
teach a concept or belief, I took the coward's way out.  I called it a
"microenvironmental challenge", abbreviating it as "MEC".

So you can avoid neologism, but it's going to come at a cost; describing
thought processes abstractly often consumes a term that we use in ordinary
abstract thinking.  Maybe when I'm done with the first draft, I'll be able to
go back and reparse the language space more precisely and get rid of some of
the current problems.  For example, on reflection (and some
thesaurus-hunting), I think that "microtask" may do to replace the neologistic
"MEC".  But don't be too quick to blame the creators of neologisms until
you've walked a few miles in their thesauruses.

Seed AI = General AI + self-improving AI + Friendly AI.  I'd guess that, in
terms of effort, building a seed AI is likely to be 80% building general
intelligence, 10% making it self-improving intelligence, and 10% making it
Friendly.

In a recent news article, someone made mention of a cycler orbit between 
Earth and Mars.  The idea was to put a manned space station in such an orbit 
so that it would "cycle" between encounters with Earth and Mars.  This would 
be a low cost way to ferry people, equipment, and supplies between planets.  
The cycler orbit would need only a small amount of fuel for minor 
corrections -- once the station was put into it. 

I don't know the maths here, but I wonder if such a cycler is possible 
between the Earth and the Moon.  It might be a good way to prototype an 
Earth-Mars cycler and easier routine access to the Moon might open it up to 
faster commercial exploitation (mining, tourism) as well as feed into more 
ambitious programs. 

What do you think?

More from the nonexistent paper, "Special difficulties consequent to research
on generally intelligent supersystems":

I'm not sure you could legitimately call anyone working in AI a "crank".  Take
Alan Grimes.  I am willing to argue that he is an idiot and that his theory of
AI, insofar as it can be deciphered, is junk.  I'm not sure that I could get
away with calling him an "AI crank" or an "AI crackpot", because right now the
state of the field is such that those researchers who think they have general
theories of intelligence are all arguing with each other, and those who don't
think so are bemoaning the fact that the field has still failed to yield any
general theory of intelligence.  If someone's crackpot theory fails to be
readily shot down by established theory, due to lack of same, is it really a
crackpot theory?  A stupid theory, yes, a wrong theory, yes, but crackpot?

Physics crackpots generally have theories that manage to contradict
established experiments and well-confirmed theories.  In AI you may be able to
say that a theory is dumbfoundingly oversimplified and that it amounts to
recycled classical AI from the 50s and 60s, because this is what amateurs
automatically come up when they try to think about AI, but you don't have the
scientific base to call it crackpot.  People with doctorates are also still
recycling 60s-era classical AI.  I happen to think that Christopher
McKinstry's GAC is probably the worst AI theory in human history, and yet as
far as the almost-nonexistent body of established theory is concerned, a
sufficiently large database of yes-or-no questions might indeed cough up
general intelligence - who knows?  The only person who I would really feel

Mr. Newstrom's calculations seems so delightfully, optimistic, that even when 
the old notion of it being "too good to be true", I say hoo-hah! Make it be

: I disagree with your premise.  As Godel pointed out, a single integer can

: Digitize the information into discrete bytes a, b, c, ...
: Encode a single integer as 2^a * 3 ^b * 5^c ... using prime numbers for the

: Any unique infinate data will have a unique result.
: Then take only TWO atoms and store the number as say the number of inches

 Thus, any two atoms can store an infinite amount of information.  (The only
 limit in the scheme I have given is the size of the universe in inches.)
 Given cleverness in how to store large integers, I don't think there is a
 limit based on the amount of matter in the universe.
 
 The real energy shortage will be in how much energy it takes to read/write
 information.  All reading and writing of data seems to require energy.
 Thats where the energy cost will lie. >>

There is no necessity that fiat currencies implode.  Mismanagement HAS
caused a large number of fiat currencies to crash, but it isn't an intrinsic
property of fiat currencies and there are a few currencies around the world
that have long histories of being relatively well-managed.  In this light,
it may be better to evaluate currencies like you would evaluate so-called
value stocks, by looking at their management history and guessing whether or
not that historical management trend will continue.

As a separate issue, gold is not generally a good investment (nor are most
mined commodities these days).  Ignoring fluctuations caused by political
concerns and a weakening perception of its "intrinsic value", there is the
problem of it being not nearly as rare as it used to be.  There is a
continuing problem where production capacity has outstripped demand such
that the current spot price is barely over the cost of production from the
most profitable mines.  In terms of supply and demand, it is far more
appropriate to treat gold as something manufactured rather than as something
that is intrinsically scarce.  For all practical purposes, we have the
capacity to produce as much gold as the market needs at relatively low
prices, even if the demands of the market rise dramatically.

(This is an interesting article about the Sanctions against IRAQ.  Opponents
of the sanctions site an often heard statement that these sanctions have led
to the death of over 1,000,000 children.  Osama Bin Laden in his 10/7
videotaped message stated that every day US sanctions cause the death of
5,000 Iraqi children under the age of 5.  Proponents of the sanctions assert
that these numbers are greatly exaggerated, if not outright lies.  The truth
seems to lie somewhere in the middle.  The original figure came from a five
study 700 household study in Iraq performed by Iraq's officials.  Even
Iraq's own official web site shows the number to be 3,000 per month.
Interestingly, the sanctions apply to all of Iraq yet the northern part of
Iraq is not under Saddam's control, only the southern part is.  Yet the
under 5 death rates in the south are double that of the north, and the
northern rates have been decreasing.  It seems that how the government
operates may also have a significant impact on these figures.  The author
also asks "How much should we blame Saddam Hussein for rejecting the U.N.'s
"oil-for-food" humanitarian offer for six years"  A later UNIFEC study
showed a more reliable figure, in both north and south, to be about 100,000
since 1990.  It is important not to trivialize these deaths, and it is
obvious that a significant number of deaths have come from the sanctions.
But it is important to know the facts and the real numbers, and acknowledge
that this countries own corrupt despotic government shares some of the blame
for these deaths.  The author continues "Yet the basic argument against all
economic sanctions remains: namely, that they tend to punish civilians more
than governments and to provide dictators with a gift-wrapped propaganda
tool." and "It seems awfully hard not to conclude that the embargo on Iraq
has been ineffective (especially since 1998) and that it has, at the least,
contributed to more than 100,000 deaths since 1990. With Bush set to go to
war over Saddam's noncompliance with the military goals of the sanctions,
there has never been a more urgent time to confront the issue with clarity.

The Politics of Dead Children

Have sanctions against Iraq murdered millions?

By Matt Welch



Are "a million innocent children...dying at this time...in Iraq" because of
U.S. sanctions, as Osama bin Laden claimed in his October 7 videotaped
message to the world? Has the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) discovered that "at least 200 children are dying every day...as a
direct result of sanctions," as advocacy journalist John Pilger maintains on
his Web site? Is it official U.N. belief that 5,000 Iraqi children under the
age of 5 are dying each month due to its own policy, as writers of letters
to virtually every U.S. newspaper have stated repeatedly during the past
three years?

The short answer to all of these questions is no. The sanctions, first
imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, are administered by the
U.N., not the U.S. They were first imposed on all exports from Iraq and
occupied Kuwait, and all non-humanitarian imports, in an effort to persuade
Saddam Hussein to retreat within his own borders. After the Gulf War, they
were broadened to include a dismantling of Iraq's biological, chemical,
nuclear, and missile-based weapons systems, out of fear that Hussein would
otherwise lash out again. Estimates of sanctions-era "excess" child deaths
-- the number above the normal mortality rate -- vary widely due to politics
and inadequate data, especially concerning children older than 5. The
dictatorial Iraqi government, which has blamed nearly every civilian funeral
since 1991 on sanctions, claims there have been more than 600,000 deaths of
under-5-year-olds these past 11 years (4,500 per month) and 1.5 million
deaths overall.

While firefighters were still pulling out warm body parts from Ground Zero,
foreign policy critic Noam Chomsky and his followers on college campuses and
alternative-weekly staffs nationwide were insisting that it was vital to
understand the "context" of the September 11 massacre: that U.S.-led
sanctions were killing "5,000 children a month" in Iraq. Meanwhile, on the
Iraqi government's own Web site, the number of under-5 deaths from all
causes for the month of September was listed as 2,932. 

Arriving at a reliable raw number of dead people is hard enough; assigning
responsibility for the ongoing tragedy borders on the purely speculative.
Competing factors include sanctions, drought, hospital policy,
breast-feeding education, Saddam Hussein's government, depressed oil prices,
the Iraqi economy's almost total dependence on oil exports and food imports,
destruction from the Iran-Iraq and Persian Gulf wars, differences in
conditions between the autonomous north and the Saddam-controlled south, and
a dozen other variables difficult to measure without direct independent
access to the country. 

Confusing the issue still further are basic questions about the sanctions
themselves. Should the U.N. impose multilateral economic sanctions to keep a
proven tyrant from developing weapons to launch more wars against his
neighbors? If sanctions are inherently immoral, what other tools short of
war can the international community use? Is this particular sanctions regime
more unreasonable than others that haven't triggered humanitarian crises?
How much should we blame Saddam Hussein for rejecting the U.N.'s
"oil-for-food" humanitarian offer for six years, and expelling weapons
inspectors in 1998? Most important, has Iraq made headway since then in
pursuing nuclear and biological weapons?

Yet all this murkiness has not deterred advocates of sanctions from claiming
absolute certainty on the issue. The warmongering New Republic, for example,
announced in October that the notion that "sanctions have caused widespread
suffering" was simply "false." Writing in National Review in December,
former army intelligence analyst Robert Stewart asserted that "resources are
available in Iraq. Even under the sanctions, Iraq's people need not starve."

The chasm between claims made by sanction supporters and opponents is enough
to make inquisitive people throw their hands up in the air. Such despair is
not exactly conducive to healthy debate, which is especially important at a
time when President Bush has made it clear that Iraq must cooperate with
weapons inspection or become the next target of the War on Terrorism. A
closer look at the controversy over dead Iraqi babies shows that opponents
of sanctions have a compelling case to make. Although they often undermine
their own position with outrageous exaggerations, their critics show a
similar disregard for the facts when they blithely dismiss concerns about
the impact of sanctions on innocent people.


Origins of a Whopper

The idea that sanctions in Iraq have killed half a million children (or 1
million, or 1.5 million, depending on the hysteria of the source) took root
in 1995 and 1996, on the basis of two transparently flawed studies, one
inexplicable doubling of the studies' statistics, and a non-denial on 60
Minutes.

In August 1995, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) gave
officials from the Iraqi Ministry of Health a questionnaire on child
mortality and asked them to conduct a survey in the capital city of Baghdad.
On the basis of this five-day, 693-household, Iraq-controlled study, the FAO
announced in November that "child mortality had increased nearly five fold"
since the pre-sanctions era. As embargo critic Richard Garfield, a public
health specialist at Columbia University, wrote in his own comprehensive
1999 survey of under-5 deaths in Iraq, "The 1995 study's conclusions were
subsequently withdrawn by the authors....Notwithstanding the retraction of
the original data, their estimate of more than 500,000 excess child deaths
due to the embargo is still often repeated by sanctions critics."

In March 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its own report
on the humanitarian crisis. It reprinted figures -- provided solely by the
Iraqi Ministry of Health -- showing that a total of 186,000 children under
the age of 5 died between 1990 and 1994 in the 15 Saddam-governed provinces.
According to these government figures, the number of deaths jumped nearly
500 percent, from 8,903 in 1990 to 52,905 in 1994.

Somehow, based largely on these two reports -- a five-day study in Baghdad
showing a "five fold" increase in child deaths and a Ministry of Health
claim that a total of 186,000 children under 5 had died from all causes
between 1990 and 1994 -- a New York-based advocacy group called the Center
for Economic and Social Rights (CESR) concluded in a May 1996 survey that
"these mortality rates translate into a figure of over half a million excess
child deaths as a result of sanctions." 

In addition to doubling the Iraqi government's highest number and
attributing all deaths to the embargo, CESR suggested a comparison that
proved popular among the growing legions of sanctions critics: "In simple
terms, more Iraqi children have died as a result of sanctions than the
combined toll of two atomic bombs on Japan." The word genocide started
making its way into the discussion.

Still, the report might well have ended up in the dustbin of bad mathematics
had a CESR fact-finding tour of Iraq not been filmed by Lesley Stahl of 60
Minutes. In a May 12, 1996, report that later won her an Emmy and an Alfred
I. DuPont-Columbia University Journalism Award, Stahl used CESR's faulty
numbers and atomic-bomb imagery to confront Madeleine Albright, then the
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. "We have heard that a half million
children have died," Stahl said. "I mean, that's more children than died in
Hiroshima. And -- and you know, is the price worth it?" Albright replied, "I
think this is a very hard choice, but the price -- we think the price is
worth it."

It was the non-denial heard 'round the world. In the hands of sanctions
opponents and foreign policy critics, it was portrayed as a confession of
fact, even though neither Albright nor the U.S. government has ever admitted
to such a ghastly number (nor had anybody aside from CESR and Lesley Stahl
ever suggested such a thing until May 1996). The 60 Minutes exchange is very
familiar to readers of Arab newspapers, college dailies, and liberal
journals of opinion. Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan mentioned it several times
during their respective presidential campaigns. 

After September 11, the anecdote received new life, as in this typically
imaginative interpretation by Harper's Editor Lewis Lapham in the magazine's
November issue: "When Madeleine Albright, then the American secretary of
state [sic], was asked in an interview on 60 Minutes whether she had
considered the resulting death of 500,000 Iraqi children (of malnutrition
and disease), she said, 'We think the price is worth it.'"

Albright has been dogged by protesters at nearly all her campus appearances
the past several years, and rightly so: It was a beastly thing to say, and
she should have refuted the figures. Quietly, a month after the World Trade
Center attack, she finally apologized for her infamous performance. "I
shouldn't have said it," she said during a speech at the University of
Southern California. "You can believe this or not, but my comments were
taken out of context."

The other, far more credible source of the 500,000 number is a pair of 1999
UNICEF studies that estimated the under-5 mortality rates of both Iraqi
regions based on interviews with a total of 40,000 households. "If the
substantial reduction in the under-five mortality rate during the 1980s had
continued through the 1990s," the report concluded, "there would have been
half a million fewer deaths of children under-five in the country as a whole
during the eight year period 1991 to 1998." If the expected mortality rate
had stayed level rather than continuing its downward slope, the excess death
number would be more like 420,000.

Significantly, UNICEF found child mortality actually decreased in the
autonomous north (from 80.2 per 100,000 in 1984-89 to 70.8 in 1994-98) while
more than doubling in the south (from 56 per 100,000 to 130.6). This is
Exhibit A for those who, like The New Republic, argue that Saddam alone is
responsible for Iraq's humanitarian crisis. When the report was released,
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy attributed the difference in
mortality trends to "the large amount of international aid pumped into
northern Iraq at the end of the [Persian Gulf] war."

The UNICEF report took pains to spread the blame for increased mortality in
the south, mentioning factors such as a dramatic increase in the bottle-only
feeding of infants in place of more nutritious (and less likely to be
tainted) breast milk. "It's very important not to just say that everything
rests on sanctions," Bellamy said in a subsequent interview. "It is also the
result of wars and the reduction in investment in resources for primary
health care."

But in the hands of sanctions opponents and some news organizations, these
findings were translated into a U.N. admission that sanctions were "directly
responsible" for killing half a million children (or even "infants"). In
September 2001 alone, the UNICEF report was mischaracterized in The Boston
Globe, The Buffalo News, The Akron Beacon Journal, The San Diego
Union-Tribune, The Charleston Gazette, the Wilmington Sunday Star-News, and
The Chicago Tribune (by a Northwestern University journalism professor, no
less).

By November, UNICEF was annoyed enough with the frequent misinterpretations
to send out regular corrective press releases, saying things like: "The
surveys were never intended to provide an absolute figure of how many
children have died in Iraq as a result of sanctions." Rather, they "show
that if the substantial reductions in child mortality in Iraq during the
1980s had continued through the 1990s -- in other words if there hadn't been
two wars, if sanctions hadn't been introduced and if investment in social
services had been maintained -- there would have been 500,000 fewer deaths
of children under five."

Sanctions critics almost always leave out one other salient fact: The vast
majority of the horror stats they quote apply to the period before March
1997, when the oil-for-food program delivered its first boatload of supplies
(nearly six years after the U.N. first proposed the idea to a reluctant
Iraqi government). In the past four years of oil-for-food, Iraq has exported
around 3 billion barrels of oil, generating $40 billion in revenue, which
has resulted in the delivery of $18 billion of humanitarian and
oil-equipment supplies, with another $16 billion in the pipeline. (The rest
is used to cover administrative costs and reparations to Kuwait.)

As the U.N. Office for the Iraqi Program stated in a September 28, 2001
report, "With the improved funding level for the program, the Government of
Iraq is indeed in a position to address the nutritional and health concerns
of the Iraqi people, particularly the nutritional status of the children."
Even two years earlier, Richard Garfield noted in his survey that "the most
severe embargo-related damages [have] already ended." 

Anyone who tells you more children will perish in Iraq this month than
Americans died on September 11 is cutting and pasting inflated mid-1990s
statistics onto a country that has changed significantly since then.
Knowingly or not, these critics are mangling the facts to prove a debatable
point and in the process damaging their own cause.


The Truth is Bad Enough

Two weeks after the hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, I began looking in earnest for trustworthy sources of
information about the effects of sanctions on Iraq. I was joined in my
search by a half-dozen or so e-mail acquaintances who approached the
question from a broadly similar viewpoint: If sanctions are killing Iraqi
babies, then Osama Bin Laden has a legitimate propaganda tool, and the U.S.
has blood on its hands that demands immediate attention. So let's find the
facts, weigh them against Saddam's weapons capabilities, and proceed from
there.

It immediately became obvious that sanctions opponents, especially in the
U.S., would be a hindrance, not a help. "I'm a little disgusted at the way
the Naderite left has used the issue, especially when they have no backup
for the claims they are making," one of my co-conspirators, Eric Mauro,
wrote me. "They may be right, but they are so inept at arguing that it's
dangerous to take their word for it."

The man who launched the American anti-sanctions movement as we know it is a
University of Texas journalism professor named Robert Jensen. His Web site's
"factsheet" on Iraq contains two lies right off the bat. Citing WHO, he
claims that "each month 5,000 to 6,000 children die as a result of the
sanctions." And citing UNICEF, he asserts that "approximately 250 people die
every day in Iraq due to the sanctions."

Jensen, who teaches "critical thinking," drifted onto the national radar
screen days after the terrorist attacks, when he wrote a column published in
ZNet, CommonDreams.org, and The Houston Chronicle titled "U.S. Just As
Guilty of Committing Own Violent Acts." He has opposed the war against
Afghanistan (not to mention Serbia), teaches the journalism of Mumia
Abu-Jamal, and once wrote a column about how the "U.S. middle class,
particularly the white middle class, is probably the single biggest
impediment to justice the world has ever known."

Jensen's cohorts in kick-starting the anti-sanctions movement were
intifada-supporting professor Edward Said, "people's historian" Howard Zinn,
and Noam Chomsky, a man who has rarely met a foreign policy he couldn't
describe as "genocide." The four issued a joint statement in January 1999
condemning the situation in Iraq as "sanctioned mass-murder that is nearing
holocaust proportions."

These four men have authored reams of hyperbolic nonsense since September
11. Isn't it reasonable to conclude that anything they and Saddam Hussein
agree upon must be false?

No, actually, it's not, and therein lies the problem. Any sustained inquiry
into the sanctions issue runs up against waves of propaganda and reckless
disregard for the truth, and it would be all too easy to declare the issue
settled after a quick dismissal of the most glaring lies. But that would be
an abdication of responsibility. Many of those who support continued
pressure on Saddam Hussein tend to focus on a few key counterpoints while
ignoring piles of haunting in-country surveys and the damning testimony of
former U.N. officials who have quit to campaign full-time against U.S.
policy in Iraq. Sanctions proponents, if they are not careful, run the risk
of aping the foolish debate tactics of the critics they condemn. 

Take, for example, the lowered mortality rates in the northern provinces of
Dahuk, Sulaymaniyah, and Erbil -- the smoking gun of the
sanctions-don't-kill crowd. The New Republic claims the autonomous Kurdish
area "is subject to exactly the same sanctions as the rest of the country."
This is false: Under the oil-for-food regime, the north, which contains 13
percent of the Iraqi population, receives 13 percent of all oil proceeds, a
portion of that in cash. Saddam's regions, with 87 percent of the
population, receive 59 percent of the money (recently increased by the U.N.
Security Council from 53 percent), none of it in cash. (Of the rest, 25
percent goes to a Kuwaiti compensation fund, and the rest covers U.N.
expenses.) 

It just isn't true that the sanctions are "exactly the same" in both parts
of Iraq. And there are other factors affecting the north-south disparity:
International aid agencies have been active in the areas protected by no-fly
zones since 1991, and the Turkish border is said to be suitably porous for
smuggling (although Saddam has been caught smuggling several times in the
past decade).

The get-Saddam camp also likes to point out that sanctions haven't seemed to
inflict similar grief in countries such as Libya and Yugoslavia. To which
Richard Garfield, who compared the various penalized countries, has an
effective rebuttal: "Embargoes with the greatest impact on the health of the
general population are usually those which are multilateral and
comprehensive, occur in countries with heavy import dependence, are
implemented rapidly, and are accompanied by other economic and social blows
to a country. Iraq shared each of these characteristics."

Those who get past the initial frustrations of researching the topic usually
end up on Richard Garfield's doorstep. His 1999 report -- which included a
logistic regression analysis that re-examined four previously published
child mortality surveys and added bits from 75 or so other relevant studies
-- picked apart the faulty methodologies of his predecessors, criticized the
bogus claims of the anti-sanctions left, admitted when the data were shaky,
and generally used conservative numbers. Among his many interesting findings
was that every sanctions regime except the one imposed on apartheid South
Africa led to limitations of food and medicine imports, even though such
goods were almost always officially exempt from the embargo. "In many
countries," he wrote, "the embargo-related lack of capital was more
important than direct restrictions on importing medicine or food."

Garfield concluded that between August 1991 and March 1998 there were at
least 106,000 excess deaths of children under 5, with a "more likely"
worst-case sum of 227,000. (He recently updated the latter figure to 350,000
through this year.) Of those deaths, he estimated one-quarter were "mainly
associated with the Gulf war." The chief causes, in his view, were
"contaminated water, lack of high quality foods, inadequate breast feeding,
poor weaning practices, and inadequate supplies in the curative health care
system. This was the product of both a lack of some essential goods, and
inadequate or inefficient use of existing essential goods."

Ultimately, Garfield argued, sanctions played an undeniably important role.
"Even a small number of documentable excess deaths is an expression of a
humanitarian disaster, and this number is not small," he concluded. "[And]
excess deaths should...be seen as the tip of the iceberg among damages to
occur among under five-year-olds in Iraq in the 1990s....The humanitarian
disaster which has occurred in Iraq far exceeds what may be any reasonable
level of acceptable damages according to the principles of discrimination
and proportionality used in warfare....To the degree that economic sanctions
complicate access to and utilization of essential goods, sanctions
regulations should be modified immediately."

Garfield's conclusion echoes that of literally every international agency
that has performed extensive studies in Iraq. In 1999 a U.N. Humanitarian
Panel found that "the gravity of the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi
people is indisputable and cannot be overstated." UNICEF's Carol Bellamy, at
the time her landmark report was released, said, "Even if not all suffering
in Iraq can be imputed to external factors, especially sanctions, the Iraqi
people would not be undergoing such deprivations in the absence of the
prolonged measures imposed by the Security Council and the effects of war."
The former U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, Denis Halliday, travels
around the world calling the policy he once enforced "genocide." His
replacement, Hans von Sponeck, also resigned in protest of the U.N.'s
"criminal policy."


Losing the Loonies

There have been no weapons inspectors in Iraq since 1998. As a result it is
exceptionally difficult to know with precision what nuclear and biological
weapons Saddam actually has on hand or in development. From the beginning,
economic sanctions have been tied to what foreign policy analyst Mark
Phythian described in World Affairs as "the first attempt to disarm a
country against its will." After September 11, the issue of an
America-hating tyrant arming himself to the teeth has seemed more pressing
than easing an embargo that blocks his access to money.

Yet the basic argument against all economic sanctions remains: namely, that
they tend to punish civilians more than governments and to provide dictators
with a gift-wrapped propaganda tool. Any visitor to Cuba can see within 24
hours the futility of slapping an embargo on a sheltered population that is
otherwise inclined to detest its government and embrace its yanqui
neighbors. Sanctions give anti-American enclaves, whether in Cairo or
Berkeley or Peshawar, one of their few half-convincing arguments about evil
U.S. policy since the end of the Cold War.

It seems awfully hard not to conclude that the embargo on Iraq has been
ineffective (especially since 1998) and that it has, at the least,
contributed to more than 100,000 deaths since 1990. With Bush set to go to
war over Saddam's noncompliance with the military goals of the sanctions,
there has never been a more urgent time to confront the issue with clarity. 

That means losing the loonies on the left. Already there are signs of
mounting liberal impatience with the routine smokescreens emanating from the
usual anti-sanctions rabble. Slate, The Guardian, and even The Nation all
published sober correctives of dead-Iraqi-baby inflation toward the end of
2001, decisively backing Richard Garfield over Robert Jensen. And if Noam
Chomsky no longer leads this particular coalition of critics, maybe they're
not so wrong after all.

I understand this, having minored in biology and having a twin brother
myself.  My point was that people will not be able to use this to duplicate
their loved pet.  The new pet will have a different personality and
appearance.

There are a couple of fundamental problems with measuring total knowledge.
The term knowledge includes several distinct things which are probably not
comparable. Also there is no "unit of information/knowledge" which we could
use for quantifying the total of human knowledge. On the other hand it's
clearly true to say that in most areas we know more and better than we did
even twenty years ago. A few ideas - you could use patents to measure
innovation (although this has the same kind of problems as using theses) -
we can measure the average time elapsed between the discovery of a technique
and its widespread adoption/use (this has clearly been getting much shorter
over the last 200 years) - we can measure the speed of geographical and
social diffusion of invention (again this is now much faster than it was
even 60 years ago) - we could have a list of questions/problems for academic
disciplines and see how many could be answered and with what degree of
assurance at various points in time up to the present (Hilbert's list of
problems in maths could be an example). Steve Davies

But the author does have a point: we can afford not to discriminate
here on Earth, but there are good reasons to do so on a colony mission.
For example, I'm not likely to ever be on any such mission, because
for the cost of pushing 105 kg of me out of the gravity well you could
send two young, healthy, petite, 50 kg women and a dewar of sperm,
which would be better for the colony. Likewise, sending heterosexual
couples would also be more likely to lead to beneficial population
growth.  Sure, the homosexual folks will have children by various
means as well, but the heteros are more likley to have _unplanned_
pregnancies, and I think that such "accidents" will probably still be
a significant part of population growth, just as they are here.

Well, the amount of energy used is still the same. THe advantage of a
cycler station is that it would give crews in transit more room to move
around, and would recycle all of the habitat and support facilities for
every cycle. Thus the energy used in each mission would only be the
incremental cost of boosting each crewman up. The only real big savings
were if you used electromagnetic propulsion to accelerate and
decellerate individuals getting onto and getting off the station.
Without an EM system to scavenge the energy of decelleration, the energy
costs are far more than just 'minor corrections'.

There is an interesting column by Jonathan Yardley in the paper about
the cat cloning, albiet he does have a "I am mortal and proud of it"
attitude and celebrates the fact that the clones are not, in fact,
carbon copies, going on to preen about how each individual soul is truly
a miracle of creation, blah blah blah. He does however, make a few
points that would be useful for meme bombing the luddites with.

Regarding Anders statement about the of the space,
I'd like to ask what people on this list might
suggest to make it more profitable. 

If that's a tall order, imagine instead you someone
are given control of, say, $10 million.  There are
stipulations on the use of this money.  You must
invest this in the space industry.  You must turn
a profit in, say, 10 years.  Also, your investment
must somehow expand the space industry's
capabilities during that time.  (In other words,
you can't just put the money into Boeing stock and
pray.)  What would you do? 

In the context of the disaster discussion, having
more profitable stuff going on space -- preferably
"manned" activities -- will make it that much
easier to think in terms of refuges. 

On another note: imagine right now we knew for
certain that there was to be a disaster that would
wipe out the Earth in ten years -- like something
from an old scifi movie: a rogue planet is going
to smash into the Earth.  (I.e., no planetside
shelter will work against the threat.)  What could
be done right now to insure that humanity/posthumanity
survives in space?  More space stations?  A lunar
colony?  Colony ships?  Nothing? 

Cheers!

Just as in the other thread, energy might be "manufactured" just like
gold, so it might not be the optimal foundation.

Given the start of this thread, I think I would base a currency on
irreversible computations. "This bill can be exchanged for 10^10 bit
erasures at First Computronium Bank of Jupiter". Making the basis of
irreversible operations linked to the allocation system seems fitting
somehow.

** LONGER NIGHT'S SLEEP LINKED TO INCREASED DEATH RATE
Sleep hogs beware. A new study suggests that individuals who sleep 
eight hours or more a night actually have an increased death rate 
compared to those who average fewer hours. Study subjects who slept 
seven hours a night had the best survival rates. Those sleeping eight 
hours a night were 12 percent more likely to die over the course of 
the study than were those sleeping seven hours a night.

_Transcension_ by Damien Broderick
(Science fiction novel, currently available in hardcover.)
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765303698/singinst

NON-SPOILER REVIEW:

Okay, I'm not an unbiased reviewer:  The novel quotes one of my Extropians
posts as a section epigraph and has a small plug at the end for the
Singularity Institute.  Nonetheless, "Transcension" is good old-fashioned
entertaining SF, and comes as close to taking a poke at the Singularity as any
SF is likely to manage.

"Transcension" goes on the bookshelf of that odd and distinct genre of
"explicitly Singularity-aware science fiction".  On the metaphorical left end
of this shelf is apparently Singularity-aware SF that nonetheless manages to
somehow dance around the Singularity:  "Excession" by Iain M. Banks, "War in
Heaven" by David Zindell, "Heaven's Reach" by David Brin, "Mother of Storms"
by John Barnes.  On the right end of this shelf are the reigning monarchs, "A
Fire Upon the Deep" by Vernor Vinge and "Permutation City" by Greg Egan.  I
would basically rate "Transcension" as about two-thirds of the way toward the
right.  I hope that Damien Broderick goes on to write more Singularity
literature and knock Greg Egan off his perch to become the new Lord of Future
Shock (a planetwide post which in nonetheless always held by an Australian). 
But if not, "Transcension" is probably still as good as Singularity-aware SF
is likely to get, right up to the moment of the actual Singularity.

Don't let my basic inability to deliver unmixed compliments get in the way of
the fact that this is a darned good book.  Other reviewers give five-star
reviews with flying neon banners, but no, I have to measure everything in
fractions of "Permutation City".  Just remember that 0.67 PC is a heck of a
high rating.

Amazon.com says that this is a 2-3 day book and that UPS shipping will take
3-7 days, but I ordered it on Wednesday and it was there on Thursday.  It
actually arrived before I got the email saying that it had shipped.  (And yes,
I checked, and this really was the specific book I had ordered and not a
coincidental gift from someone else.)  How things do accelerate, these days. 
I mention it because I think it's pretty funny, considering the book's subject
matter.



SEMI-SPOILER MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
(caution: do not read if you are spoiler-allergic)



Here's a statement that will come as absolutely no surprise to anyone who's
read this book:  I have issues with Aleph.  In fact, the first time I
encountered this entity, I said something along the lines of "No, no, no, no,
no!", accompanied by repeatedly banging the palm of my hand against my
forehead.  Followed by:  "Who is this 'Aleph' character?  None of my work,
I'll tell you that."  But hang on until the end of the novel.  It does get
better, although certain earlier events are never adequately explained.

I also worry that, although the book is easily comprehensible to we jaded
transhumanist folk, it may leave substantial other sectors of the planet
totally confused.  The truth is, I have absolutely no idea how the average SF
fan is likely to react, or whether current SF critics are emitting rave
reviews or complete incomprehension.  But this audience, at least, should be
able to track the novel easily enough.

I'd like to thank Damien for putting my epigraph in a novel where it sounds
wise rather than silly, and would also like to praise him for his totally
accurate one-line description of the Singularity Institute.

Unsurprisingly, this novel is also more aware of certain advanced concepts
than any other Singularity literature.  There are certain points in the book
where you can hear the SL4 mailing list talking (though not necessarily me).

If your model of the Singularity is such that today's humans end up making
individual decisions about whether to become transhuman, and you don't want to
fall in love with someone you'll have to leave behind, then buy a copy of
"Transcension" and loan it to the prospective loved one in question.  Of
course this may not be the best book to use as an *introduction* to the
Singularity, but once the basic concepts are there, it's a good way to raise
the issue.

It should also be fun to loan this book to someone and then casually say,
"Gee, don't you think it's odd that there's been so little progress in AI for
the last fifty years?"

Why avoid neologism at all?  When treating specific concepts within a
field, and especially within a specific paper, neologizing in much
preferred to overloading.  Indeed, I might argue that creating new words
for new concepts is part and parcel of the cretive process itself.  The
only thing that's bad is creating new words for old concepts that people
already understand--crackpots do that to hide the fact that they aren't
actually creating new ideas but just dressing up old ones.  If your ideas
are truly new and different (or even just more specific in an important
way), then by all means makeup new terms.  I wouldn't be able to teach
you about poker strategy without using a bunch of terms like "outs" and
"counterfeits" and "free cards" and "drawing dead".  Why should I expect
you to be able to explain AI to me without first defining some new
terminology?

In _Look to Windward_ Banks says "perfect [unbiased] AIs always
Sublime".  Lacking anything tying them to the universe they head
straight for godhood.  In real life, I suspect a perfect AI would just
sit there.

I was reading through someone's copy of GURPS Transhuman Space
yesterday.  Fun.  Had some useful terms: infomorphs for any digital mind
(did they get that from Egan?), ghosts (perfect and destructive upload)
shadows (cheap hack upload from nondestructive scanning).  At any rate,
it also distinguished between non-sapient AIs, low-sapient AIs, and
fully sapient AIs.  The boundaries weren't exactly clear, especially
between the latter two; the second might not be has "humanly creative"
as the third.  But it was suggested the first was capable of some
self-awareness, but lacking its own goals, or something.  A really smart
command shell, perhaps, vs. AIs capable of coming up with their own
tasks even while not executing an orders.  AIs capable of being bored,
perhaps.

I don't really like the GURPS terms there, or even the conceptual
divisions -- non-sapient AIs would be "not creative", but Hofstadter's
work is aimed at precisely 'non-sapient' (not self-directed) but
self-aware AIs which are highly creative in doing their assigned task.
But the attempt at a conceptual division was interesting.

In GURPS it wasn't useless.  Ghosts can't legally have multiple copies
running, sapient AIs have various legal and maybe moral constraints and
inhibitions wired in; rogue AIs lacking those get whacked on sight.

Actually, my comments were misinterpreted and caused this whole discussion
to mutate off topic.  I wasn't arguing for gays on space missions, nor did
the original article mention gays.  (Besides, gays don't tend to breed
anyway, yet they keep popping up every generation.  I doubt there will be a
lack of gays in any breeding colony without technological intervention of
some sort.)

The original article claimed that we need to limit sexual partners to one
per person.  The author did not even allow for divorce or later partners.
The author argued for the arbitrary requirement of one life-time partner
with no future partners ever allowed, to preserve the traditional monogamous
family unit.  It was this arbitrary requirement that requires that we take a
minimum 160 people along on any long space voyage.  If we allow multiple
simultaneous partners, multiple sequential partners, or artificial
insemination, we could easily get a smaller population to breed.

My main problem with the article is that the author acknowledged these
possibilities.  They were dismissed as violating the traditional family
unit.  No plural marriages are allowed.  No divorce is allowed.  No
sequential partners.  No artificial insemination.  No arranged marriages.
This sounded more like Catholic doctrine rather than a scientific paper.
There is no biological reason that it should take 160 people to breed a new
generation.

On the other hand, if you treat mass and energy as interchangable, then
the monetary unit to use would be the "C" note, which would be equal to
(e/m)^(1/2) expressed as a finite number of quarks, photons, protons, or
other 100% fungible subatomic particles.

That is why Leonardo Da Vinci took one 15 minute nap every two hours 
and did not sleep during the night !

Anyway they did not take into account the quality of sleep.

Okay, we're a little too analytical around here today.

I just finished an essay from Veronique Vienne's book "Something to
be Desired" where she talks about an assignment she was given to
come up with a fragrance for the magazine "Mirabelle".

Okay what does the fragrance "Extropy" smell like? What does the
container look like? I understand containers that make idle
playthings on ones desk are in vogue...

       I also had to bite a bullet. It didn't quite have my brain in fully 
rational mode.
 My problem was that I seem to require more proof that God exists than I need 
for the proof of Evolutionary theory. Interesting, but I think that I maybe 
justified in my view. ?.
       I does point out that my belief that evolutionary theory is based to a 
degree on 'faith' in the absence of irrefutable proof. This is something that 
I can honestly say I have not thought about.
       Perhaps my reasoning is that any opposing views to evolution are so 
absurd that they don't deserve consideration.

I've just started reading Sylvia Nasar's biography of mathematician John
Nash, A Beautiful Mind, on which the current movie is based.  Nash made
major contributions to economics among other fields before descending
into schizophrenia.  But this list of his earlier character traits sounded
eerily familiar:

 - "His heroes were solitary thinkers and supermen like Newton and
    Nietzsche."

 - "Computers and science fiction were his passion."

 - "He considered 'thinking machines', as he called them, superior in some
    ways to human beings."

 - "At one point, he became fascinated by the possibility that drugs could
    heighten physical and intellectual performance."

 - "He was beguiled by the idea of alien races of hyper-rational beings
    who had taught themselves to disregard all emotion."

I think you could find people on this list who would share many of
these views.  Attraction to Newton, Nietzsche, computers and science
fiction; exploration of drugs and supplements to enhance body and mind;
emphasis on rationality as a means to the truth; all are common elements
of Extropian thought.

Well, my first reaction to this was to laugh and say, "I give up!"  Some days
you just can't win...

On reflection, though, I think that there are two dynamics here.  Anyone who
wants to think precisely will need to use precise terminology.  So if you're a
bad writer and you want to think precisely, you use complete neologisms -
arbitrary, hard to remember or identify once you're a few pages out of
context.  Good writing practice is to minimize this impact by adapting
existing terms where possible, and using recognizable word combinations where
a genuinely new term is needed.  So it's preferable - in terms of being able
to think clearly and reason clearly - to use neologisms rather than not have
any new words at all, but it's also preferable to use recognizable language
rather than pure neologisms.

I got the same "problem". I consider this a case of "extraordinary
claims require extraordinary proof" - evolution can be studied to a far
greater extent than theological claims. Part of this is that it is a far
more constrained explanation model for observed facts.

Overall, an enjoyable little website. There should really be more sites
like this for other questions (right now I'm reading a book about the
animal rights movement, and it has some interesting examples of how
tricky the issue of deciding what beings have rights and on what basis
is; it would probably make a good "battleground ethics" setup).

ANNOUNCING: FDAReview.org -- New Website Tracks Unsafe Side Effects of
Federal Food and Drug Regulations

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was created to ensure the
safety of food, and the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and
medical devices, marketed in the United States. A large body of academic
research, however, indicates that FDA control has large and often
overlooked costs that almost certainly exceed the costs. This is no
"academic" or strictly economic matter: FDA policies in many cases have
cost people their lives.

To bring this research to a larger number of health-care professionals,
policy analysts, journalists, government officials, and the general
public, the Independent Institute has launched FDAReview.org
http://www.FDAReview.org, an extensive, peer-reviewed, resource of
critical research on the policies and history of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.

Written and edited by Independent Institute Research Fellow Daniel Klein
(Associate Professor of Economics, Santa Clara University) and
Independent Institute Research Director Alex Tabarrok (Editor,
Entrepreneurial Economics: Bright Ideas from the Dismal Science),
FDAReview.org includes:

* a detailed history of federal regulation from 1902 to the present,

* information on the drug development and approval process,

* an evaluation of the costs and benefits of FDA policy,

* a review and evaluation of the major plans for FDA reform,

* comments from economists who have studied the FDA,

* a glossary and bibliography with many webbed links (including links to
JSTOR, a scholarly journal archive, for those with access)

With FDAReview.org, the Independent Institute intends to increase public
awareness of bureaucratic and political barriers that prevent lifesaving
medicines from reaching health-care consumers, especially for those most
in need. Comments are always welcome as we plan to continually update
and improve the web site.

Yes. The interesting question is which of them are healthy. When stated
as above, the drive towards rationality is fairly inocuous, but the
description of Nash's desire for hyperrational beings or computers
suggests a more irrational form of rationality with a strong bias
against emotion. This form is commonly combined with looking down on the
"weak" flesh and a desire to escape one's body and/or humanity to a more
"pure" existence. 

This afternoon I was reading Per Svensson's excellent _Musse r Ingen
Mus_ ("Mickey Mouse is not a Mouse"), a study of the philosophies behind
the animal rights movement. In one of the chapters he dissects the
anti-humanist tendency of many contemporary ideologies, which seek to
escape being an individual human forced to take responsibility for one's
actions. Among his examples, which are mostly from the left and
environmentalist movement, he also mentions the Heavens Gate Cult and
points out that their denial of the body and individuality stem from the
same philosophical sources. He even uses the term "yearning for the
transhuman", which is one of the first instances of the word in Swedish
I have seen that is not directly related to mentions of our movement. 

I consider this anti-body ideological syndrome something of a pathology
we should be on guard against in our own thinking. Sure, we want
*better* bodies, maybe even entirely virtual bodies one day. We want to
be able to think rationally and not be controlled by atavisms or
obsolete genetic programming. But at the same time we are seeking to
extend the truly human aspects of ourselves: our ability to choose our
own path, our ability to be truly individual - both alone and in groups,
we want to extend and enhance our aesthetics, emotions and ambitions. We
will always have flaws and limits, but we will strive to overcome them
rather than yearn for some unachievable perfect state. We seek to become
*more*, not less.

Another good test. I came out on the side of "psychological reductionism"

Well, yes, using familiar words helps, but you don't want to risk re-
defining an existing term in a way that conflicts with the ordinary
understanding of its use in a similar context.  To return to my example
of poker terms, the term "drawing dead" nicely evokes familiar images and
feelings that help make the term easier to understand, even though no real
"drawing" is taking place (in a stud game or hold'em game, for example),
and nothing is actually dying.  But it is far preferable to define and use
the short evocative term like "drawing dead" than to constantly be saying
things like "...holding a speculative hand which you hope will improve
with forthcoming cards, but which might lose even if it does improve",
and there is little chance of the term being confusing.

I enjoyed that too--and I hope we do see more of that kind of
thing on the net.  Seeing more philosophy without long, dry, texts
is avery good thing.

The site maintainer is also very friendly and responsive: I didn't
have to bit a bullet, but I did take one hit, for answering "true" to
question 7 and "false" to question 15, which they claim is inconsistent.
I pointed out that those questions are vague enough to allow perfectly
consistent philosophies to answer that way, and he agreed. He said he
would be working on rewording the questions to get around that problem,
but that it was tricky because every question has side-effects on some
others.  In short, he seemed very interested in making it a rigorous
test, and not just some off-the-cuff Cosmo-love-test kind of thing.

But are they higher than the current alternative -- i.e., sending out a
separate mission each time?  I'm thinking here of cyclers to Mars
mostly.

Recently, there's been talk about using Alpha (AKA the ISS) as a place
to assemble prepackaged space probes and the like.  The idea is to not
have to cram everything into the cone of a Delta/Ariane/Proton and hope
it can survive launch vibrations and unfurl itself before going on its
merry way.  On Alpha, instead, different parts can be ferried up in
cushioned packages, then assembled and tested in orbit.  If something
should fail, repairs or substitutes might be arranged.  In other words,
you don't have to lose the whole probe because a solar panel didn't
unfurl.  I imagine a cycler can be used for that too -- as opposed to
unattended spacecraft going between destinations.  Of course, this adds
the costs of having and maintaining a living crew en route.

Cheers!

Something bright and clear - maybe with a hint of citrus?

As for a container, why not something like a chaosphere?

Maybe lemon.

While at the spa 2 weeks ago, I noticed the delicious smell of lemons 
permeating the air. Wanting to smell this again and again, yesterday I 
purchased lemon (and lemon grass) essential oils.  At home on the dining 
table, I placed a lit candle under the lemon oils in water, which heated 
the water filled the room with a light hint of lemon scent.  I also 
purchased new hand moisture for the kitchen sink, which smells of 
lemons.  To top it off, I filled a spray bottle with purified water and 20 
drops of the lemon oil to mist around the living room.  Mind you, the lemon 
sent is delicate and invigorating.  Just enough of a hint to uplift the mind.

>As for a container, why not something like a chaosphere?

I was looking at the blown glass sculpture you gave us some years ago at 
your first stay here.  It is so beautiful.  I would like a fragrance bottle 
made out of blown glass - in a perfect square shape with an elegant 
spiraling shape inside which contains the perfume.  The bottle would rest 
on an angle, on a small but sturdy black iron stand - matte black (although 
chrome smooth), modern with fine simple lines.  The color would be green, a 
soft and almost translucent emerald.

(Lemon Grass - A tropical grass (Cymbopogon citratus) native to southern 
India and Sri Lanka, yielding an aromatic oil used as flavoring and in 
perfumery and medicine.)

A variety of issues are addressed by this Alcor member as they relate to
our becoming physically immortal. Among those issues is that of
establishing a new world monetary order based on a new Bretton Woods
situation to pick up the pieces after the world's current speculative
financial racket collapses.  Full post at

I should also add that my comments don't do justice to the recent and
continuing US success of sf by Aussies Sean Williams and Shane Dix,
although their interstellar venues are not noticeably Australian. Another
who's done moderately well, even when using a non-Yank setting, is Sean
McMullen's `Calculor' sequence set in a distant future Oz. (What's *with*
these given names? A mystery not to be revealed to outlanders.) On the
other hand, the much awarded Terry Dowling, whose sf closely echoes the
gritty poetry of Cordwainer Smith and Jack Vance, simply can't get his work
looked at. Why not? Hard not to suppose some of the resistance is his
profoundly Australian settings. True, his stories have a tendency to be all
color and emotion and not much plot resolution, but that hasn't hurt a
number of successful American writers.

>Damien, I have not found this to be the case in my part of the world.  A

point to be emphasized.

I was sloppy. Obviously, once a book has been bought in NY and distributed
to stores in the States, most readers won't care where the writer lives or
comes from. Is there anything about koalas in Greg Egan? Well, some
references to Sydney or other antipodean settings, but that's just minimal
color in his fiction. 

That assumes the books get into the stores to start with.

There's often a kind of numbing provincialism (sorry) in the reception
response of Americans to the *tonality*, the *not-American-ness* of
anything Not From Here (where Here is probably the constructed Here you see
in TV). Or so it's assumed, tacitly, by many publishers.

Now this aversion might be overstated--but we'll never know, because
publishers and agents tend to act as if it's so. There are notable
exceptions; the NYT recently ran a reading group on the almost
pathologically Australian novel by Peter Carey about the bushranger Ned
Kelly... but that book had already won the prestigious British Booker Prize. 

It's not just a matter of implied accent. All manner of tiny default
details are different in Australian novels, even if they're set on Mars.
The more Australian my books are (the way characters talk, the places they
live, the bits of local history they reference), the harder they are to get
read by agents let alone read by publishers let alone bought. It doesn't
matter how much praise they've had here. They are *insufficiently American*
in small details that poor brilliant John Brunner, a British sf writer,
tried for decades to emulate, unsuccessfully (and was regularly,
hilariously mocked by sarcastic ORBIT series editor Damon Knight for his
blunders).

This has less bearing on science *non*-fiction, but even there we have a
kind of glitch, and not just because most of the big bucks science,
naturally, is done in the USA. Much leading work in medicine, molecular
biology and its applications have been done in Oz, but I don't think the
few books about this work published here have met with interest in the
States. Paul Davies is our only big success story, and he's a comparatively
recent Brit import.

I hope everyone sees that this post isn't a nasty diatribe against the USA
or Americans. I jest lerrrrv Americans, mostly; my partner is an American.
What I'm talking about is just one of the costs of imperial power. I thank
the flip of the dice every day that at least I didn't grow up speaking
Italian or Greek, in which case my writing career would have been far more
segregated than it is now.

Is there any extropian or >H relevance in these comments? Well, it might
not do any harm for any advocacy group centered in America to notice these
funny little glitches now and then. It's a big world out here, and many
Americans, with all their immense power, are seeing it through a quite
narrow slot. And the narrowness of the window isn't just what's imposed by
authority and corporate ownership; the net, at least, is breaking that down
(but of course it's also reinforcing it). I'm talking about an internal
narrowing of response, almost beyond notice when you allow it to happen to
yourself in the company of millions of other who are doing the same dance.

FWIW.

Hey, Im an AI crackpot!

Ive been toying with the idea of trying to apply the
mathematics of feedback and control theory to AI,
specifically growth rates of AI prior to the Singularity.

Has anyone gone there?  Specific question: has there
been any controls engineers that have attempted to
model AI in terms of classic feedback control theory?
Seems like we could guess at the transfer functions
and come up with a mathematical model.

What got me thinking about this is an offhanded
comment I made around newtonmas about luddite
AIs.  Perhaps there is some unforeseen negative
feedback loop that is completely invisible or inactive
until we get really close to open loop increase in
AI.  Then instead of a spike, we get an AI that
oscillates about some intelligence level.  Notice
I did not say that this new equilibrium level must
be subhuman equivalent, but it can be any
unknown finite intelligence level, held in check
by some unknown and currently unimagined
negative feedback mechanism.

An example would be a sub-AI becomes aware
of the imminent (within minutes) singularity and for
some reason chooses the metagoal of preserving
humanity in its meat form.  It works to destroy the
progress of the Singularity, by currently unforeseen
and possibly destructive means.  This phenomenon
would be analogous in some sense to the action
of fanatic religious memes slowing or blocking if
possible the advancement of humankind.  spike

Understatement.  The ideal multigen mission would be all gays: specifically
all lesbians and nearly all female embryos.  These embryos would be
preselected lesbians (assuming we develop the technology to determine
that trait from genetic information alone) for having all lesbians would
increase
their potential for entertaining each other.  After the mission reached its
destination, we could use the long-stored hetero female and male embryos.

Our 160-minimum article-writer surely was suffering from a deplorable

 I've had a dilemma about this subject for some time. My views are based on
both my own experience and that of others, both socially and in research.
Feel free to disagree with me completely, I am merely seeking answers to
unsolved problems, which is what research is all about, and this group
excels at bouncing problems back and forth and often finding solutions...I
don't want to make anyone uncomfortable though, so if you don't want to talk
about drugs, stop reading now.
I find it curious that in our society, distinctions are made between
'drugs', as in illegal or other substances that people get addicted to,
'drugs' that people get from doctors or chemists, and 'drugs' such as sugar,
coffee and junk food.
All of these categories of drugs affect the mind, and the behaviour,
profoundly. Sugar and junk food have as strong a link with delinquent crime
as alcohol or amphetamines. The side-effects of regular use of Ibuprofen,
Valium or Chloramphenicol are just as serious as those of tobacco, and worse
than marijuana.
(That was a qualifier...)

There is a possibility that this could be totally unfair...
If someone suffers from depression, and they find a drug which relieves the
symptoms, they are going to use it, because from their point of view they
feel more responsible, capable and, bluntly, sane when they use the drug
than when they do not. And which is preferable -a nervous, depressed,
irritable person driving the family car, or a person under the influence of
a drug that makes them feel sane and happy?
My point is, I believe that many 'addicts' who choose not to stop are
self-medicating to relieve an unbearable mental state. Many are doing this
legally, with Prozac, Valium, tobacco or chocolate. They know the substance
is damaging their body and creating social problems. But in just the same
way that the side-effects of pain-killers are still preferable to acute
pain, the social and physical side-effects of addiction seem better than
acute psychological torment.
I will stick my neck out here and say that I believe any addict who chooses
to continue is probably in this position.
When I say 'psychological torment' I'm not referring to the effects of
withdrawal. I mean the person was in psychological torment before they ever
took the drug, and took it in the first place because they were looking for
relief from that torment. They probably tried several drugs before finding
one that worked. And the symptoms will return, and remain indefinitely, if
the drug is stopped. So by asking addicts to stop we could be doing the
equivalent of taking away the Prozac from someone with deep depression, or
the Chlorpromazine from someone with schizophrenia.

[snip]
 In fact, accepting responsibility for ones own actions, (past,

Which condition? The addiction or the condition which caused it? Should we
assume responsibility for our own genetically inherited diseases, our
neurological / neurochemical imbalances / disorders or our viral infections?
We don't get sick on purpose. We don't get psychologically distressed or
depressed on purpose. Is a drug user guilty for taking medication with bad
side-effects, if nobody is providing anything better?
Why would anybody who is 100% mentally healthy ever choose to put anything
into their bodies if it didn't, overall, make them feel better? How many
people are out tonight searching for anything that will?
Psychoses and neuroses do not always respond to drugs from a doctor. An
individual's mind, and neurochemistry, is unique. Sometimes, chocolate or
tobacco or marijuana will do the trick. Should we, then, take this away from
them, or make them feel guilty for doing it?

On the physical damage side, depression itself increases the possibility of
so many diseases / disorders, there is not enough time or room here to list
them. It is definitely worse for you physically than smoking anything (and
pretty nasty for your loved ones, too).
What we should be doing is assessing why people need drugs (any drugs) and
providing the safest drugs possible to relieve the symptoms each person
suffers when s/he is 'straight'. This is what doctors try to do, although,
with a patient, the illness is already recognised. Perhaps the biggest
question should be why such a large percentage of the population suffers
from mild-to-middling psychological disorders? There may be a clue to this
in those organisations which succeed in 'curing' addicts -perhaps what they
are actually doing is curing the underlying disorder, by showing the person
that someone cares and giving them a bit of self-esteem, with the love,
respect, affection and attention they maybe never got from parents, friends
or partners, and the lack of which caused the depression in the first place?
Human beings need to be nurtured throughout growth to be mentally healthy,
to avoid insecurity and fear of abandonment.
Insecurity=fear=anxiety=depression in a lot of cases. How many people do you
know who are 100% sane? (Well, the people on this list, of course! )
As for the state, my point of view makes its interference obsolete. If any
person has to take any kind of medication to relieve any kind of symptoms,
and that medication affects their behaviour and/or performance, then they
should be monitored by their GP and assessed for their ability to drive or
operate machinery. They may need to register as disabled until a safer
medication can be found or a cure is forthcoming. But without such a cure,
expecting anyone to give up their medication and just suffer is perhaps a
bit barbaric?
The state would, of course, have to trash all the drugs laws and hand the
control of substances over to the drugs companies & manufacturers. So a
heroin manufacturer would have to pay taxes on that, and users would pick
their supply up on prescription. Same for tobacco. And I reckon a lot more
people would go for therapy / treatment than could be bothered to get their
cigarettes on script every month...although if it were thought of as a
medication, it would be more popular in tablets -who on earth would smoke
it?
It wouldn't be too long before the real problem was addressed, if the
emphasis was on creating safer and safer medication for each individual.
Finally, a personal view; I drink alcohol copiously whenever I am with
people socially whom I do not know very well. I do this on purpose because
otherwise I can't think of anything to say, and I feel awkward, embarrassed,
geeky and shy. When they are gone, I stop, and I don't think about drinking
again until I'm in that situation again, just as I wouldn't dream of taking
a painkiller if I wasn't in pain.  What if I felt like that with everyone,
even my family, all the time, unless I drank all the time?  What if I felt
utterly depressed unless I constantly took something which made me feel
better but made me behave like an asshole? Would I do it?
I honestly do not know.

True.

In fact, those few who can rite do so (as the National Poet Banjo Paterson
put it) with `a thumbnail dip'd in tar'. (Or it might have been the
National Poet Henry Lawson.)

Generally speaking, Australia is the place where you win a Gold Medal in
the Winter Olympics by being so far behind that when all the other
contestants fall over each other you can cruise past and pip them at the
post. Australia is the place where, when a young women throws herself in
the air from a high place and twists around a few times and lands without
killing herself (explaining breathlessly that she did it by switching off
her brain and letting her body do the walking) and gets a Gold Medal in the
Winter Olympics, the Premier of the state I live in rushes to offer her a
State Reception when she returns in glory. No riter that I can think of got
a State Reception, no, nor any scientist nor technologist nor artist nor
computer nerd neither. But that how it is with states, after all (the
mandatory Mark Walker crowd-pleaser).

Your posts are conceptually dense (it may not sound like it, but that *is* a 
compliment).  Kind of like the Bible, you see something new almost everytime 
you read it.  I'm still digesting (re-reading) some of your posts.  Don't 
know if I'll respond, but I do want to see what you're seeing.  Enough 
preamble.  To my question:

Suppose evolution had somehow come clean with us and said:

"Hey humans, here's the deal.  You are genetically programmed to maximize 
the probability of the survival of your geneset.  So all those things you 
think you like (like sex, food, clothing, and close relatives) and all those 
things you think you hate (like pain, hunger and loneliness) are merely 
subgoals hardwired into your essential make-up simply to attain the genetic 
supergoal (maximizing the probability of the survival of your geneset--or in 
other parlance being "friendly" to your genes)."

Do you think that nature's honesty would have persuaded us to continue being 
"friendly" to our genes?  Or do you think we would still be saying "Screw 
the survival of my geneset, I'm in this for the maximum enjoyment of my own 
particular phenotype"?

I for one would definitley read such a book, sounds like it would be very
interesting.

Here in New Zealand a lot of art sold (not stolen) by Maoris in the 19th
century is being returned.
SOme of the claims are just ridiculous- there was at one point a thriving
industry in
tattoed heads, war parties would capture slaves who were then tattoed with
the extensive and elaborate tattoos (moko)
which chiefs wore. The slaves were beheaded and the heads were then
exchanged for muskets, blankets etc.  Museums around the world are being
approached to return the heads, the way some tribal leaders today talk, it
is as if the Europeans captured Maori chiefs  and beheaded them themselves
to take the heads as souvenirs.  Even paintings and photographs of Maoris
are claimed by their descendants.  Artworks, carvings etc sold by 19th
century Maoris are being returned, but surely
once something is sold the artist (or his descendants) has no further right
to it? Opinions please?

I think a simplistic concrete example which would illustrate this is:
nature didn't actually design us to "want children".  Well, it might
have more for women, but that's still open to debate.  Some people of
both sexes want children, but not all, and it's hard to separate out
cultural effects.  What we do know is that we're hardwired to want to
have sex, and from anecdotal reports I think a wired response of
affection upon seeing a newborn baby is also supportable.  But because
of the two-step process we can use birth control in the early "no baby
in sight, don't want children much" stage and not have children.  If
we'd been properly designed to Want Children, that wouldn't work.  But
we Want Sex instead.

Graydon of rec.arts.sf.written/fandom has an idea about embedded
creationist memes in our thinking and language.  We can call ourselves
an evolutionist or atheist, and be an evolutionist and atheist, but it's
hard to make all of our ideas match up.  It's like being a round peg in
a round hole, then becoming a square peg.  You're still in a round
hole... "natural rights" is an easy example; the idea comes from
Christian and Deist thinkers and lacks any equivalent support in hard
materialist terms, but is still extremely pervasive.

And more obscurely, I think there's a similar 'creationist' fog around
the concept of intelligence.  An instinct that something recognizable as
intelligent in being able to think and talk must have a soul similar to
us in other respects.  Natural enough in a way, since extrapolating from
our own human nature is the first shortcut to understanding other
humans, but still wrong.  Intelligence is a tool.  Self-awareness is a
tool.  They are not package deals, bringing with them self-respect,
self-centeredness, a John Galtian yearning to be free and independently
creative.  Just because a being is aware of itself doesn't mean it cares
about itself, anymore than being aware of sparrows means you care about
sparrows.  That concern is a separate mechanism, which would not be the
top priority of an AI you don't want to go rogue.

We do not have some transcendant concern for the enjoyment of our
phenotype.  Our various enjoyments are effects, direct or indirect, of
the mechanisms given us by nature to propagate our genes.  Given how
quickly we've changed our own conditions, not all of the mechanisms work
fully now.  If nature had been more explicit in wiring us to care about
our geneset there wouldn't be any conflict between its honesty and our
concern for our phenotypic enjoyments; the geneset would be our top
priority, period.

Most _humans_ aren't John Galt.  Quite a few prefer to serve others, if
their dignity is respected: loyal servants, self-sacrificing wives or
husbands, religious devotees.  The range of AI motivations is not going
to be less than that of human motivations.

I think a lot of -- most? -- people who'll explicitly state they believe
they're a biological machine have not really implicitly incorporated that.
The implicit beliefs and reflexes reflect an image of an AI, or of human
nature, with its own inherent desires, independent of the human or
evolutionary process which designed it.  The proper image should be of a
machine which could have been built to do, or at least aim for,
anything.  Humans, of course, were not designed with much foresight or
coherent vision.

I really like the idea of creating AND marketing an Extropian Fragrance.  But how much money and effort would this take?  I hope this is not just all idle talk on our part. 

While we have discussed the fragrance itself, what about the advertising campaign??  This is the key to a successful fragrance!  

Max and Natasha in an ad reminiscent of the ones with Liz Taylor?  Or for inspiration we could consider the classic ad from Karate cologne which had a man being chased by hordes of beautiful women after splashing on some of their fragrance!  He uses his martial arts skills to gently deflect all the women grasping at him!!  I really loved those ads as a fourteen year-old boy.  ; )

I think an ad campaign which shows smart, educated, savvy, and sexy people living their lives by the extropian principles(though this might not be stated, only implied), and thereby attracting high quality members of the opposite sex, would be the best way to market the fragrance.  

We could also show the people in the ads attaining job success, volunteering in their community, and bonding with family and friends.  We would sell the message "if you use the Extropy fragrance, you are a caring and capable person who is going places."      

I'm sure many of you out there can come up with great tv commercial ideas to best promote the Extropy fragrance.

best wishes,

John

Anders, I found your words very insightful.  I recently met a highschool age young man in Extropy chat who was an ardent Singulitarian.  I realize he is young and still developing his mind and views, but still I found some of his comments very disturbing.  He greeted me initially by saying "how was your meaty day?"  And continued throughout the conversation on how he truly despised his "meat body" and wanted desperately to be uploaded to finally be free of it.  The severity of his obsession made me wonder if this could negatively affect his body image.

This fellow wanted to put aside many human activities(like dating, etc.) to totally focus his life on helping to bring about the Singularity.  I appreciate his good intentions and fervor, but it did make me wonder whether he will have regrets down the road.  

I realize he is young, and both during and after college may very much change from what he is now.  But I do see a real possible dark side to the transhumanist obsession with uploading and moving away from the "pathetic and inferior body."  Have there ever been anorexics who just really hated their meatsicle bodies??

best wishes,

John

While it is true that science is a collective endeavor, it is also
true that a single individual can, seated on top of the results of
this collective endeavour, work alone and produce something good, that
is only incorporated in the mainstream science at a later stage.

Of course the syndrom described does exist. But you cannot infer it
safely from the symptoms listed.

And sticking with the community is no guarantee either of not wasting
your time -- far from it.

Dear Jame Rogers,

piece in its entirety.

> There is no necessity that fiat currencies implode.

All fiat-currencies return to their intrinsic value- zero. There are no exceptions in the experimental record. Current experiments
are progressing in much the same manner as prior runs, albeit with novel and rococo leveraged permutations- OTC interest swaps, gold
swaps, metal leasing, claims on SDR certs on top of SDRs on top of gold certs on top of ?, etc. See Doug Noland's column at
www.prudentbear.com, e.g. "Financial Arbitrage Capitalism".

A currency 'crash' or 'collapse' or (price)-hyperinflation is an emergent property of unbacked claims on assets. The crash is driven
by the same deterioration of credit quality and loss of investor confidence that heralds a stock or bond crash. The diminished
demand for cash balances (e.g. the meme "cash is trash") characterizes hyperinflation.

> and there are a few currencies around the world

This is a startling juxaposition of words. One might as well declare a child-sex ring, a counterfeiting racket, or a pyramid scheme
"well managed". The longest lived fiat curency in history is the so-called US Dollar (yet another Statist  lie, btw), which has
inflated by 1000% (i.e. has lost 90% of its purchasing power) during my lifetime. There is *no way* to prevent the total destruction
of an unbacked currency.

Looking in the rear-view mirror at a few red and blue lines is not the same as studying economics and the intertwining of monetary
and geopolitical history. For example, the history of the Federal Reserve and the the history of global warfare are one and the
same. If war is the health of the Sate, inflation is the bulwark of militarism.

There appear to be about 120,000- 140,000 MT of gold *aboveground*, though these figures are disputed. Something less than 20 grams
for each human alive. Gold is as rare as ever, though gold-denominated instruments (paper gold) may have reached an historical high,
similar to the situation in the late 1960's, and in the early 1930's. This inflation (issuance of multiple claims per available gold
atom) is responsible for the current low price of the metal. See for example the GATA derivatives report- www.gata.org and various
articles at www.usagold.com   www.gold-eagle.com and so on.

> There is a

Production has been running roughtly 2/3rds of demand for at least the past ten years. The other 1/3 has been met through scrap
recycling, possibly central bank selling/leasing (this is somewhat debatable), other dark and murky means. The gold market is the
most difficult market of all to track. After spending a few hundred hours rifling through various FRB, BIS, IMF, LBMA, COMEX, etc.,
etc., reports, I've learned it is also the most sophisticated. Gold is the central force of the financial universe. Nothing changes
on New Year's Day.

I doubt it. The test has a few arbitrary points. I took zero hits but bit
two bullets (or the test did fail in two minor points, regarding on your
viewpoint).

Absolutely. Claim of a superbeing is a much taller order than an apersonal
optimization principle (and well validated at that -- not possible to map
to boolean domain as required by test). Hence considerably more and more
stringent proofs are required (not absolute, absolute doesn't exist).

The site:

Bitten Bullet 1

You answered "True" to questions 6 and 13.

These answers generated the following response:

You stated earlier that evolutionary theory is essentially true. However,
you have now claimed that it is foolish to believe in God without certain,
irrevocable proof that she exists. The problem is that there is no certain
proof that evolutionary theory is true - even though there is overwhelming
evidence that it is true. So it seems that you require certain,
irrevocable proof for God's existence, but accept evolutionary theory
without certain proof. So you've got a choice: (a) Bite a bullet and claim
that a higher standard of proof is required for belief in God than for
belief in evolution. (b) Take a hit, conceding that there is a
contradiction in your responses.

You chose to bite the bullet.

This is wrong. (a) is a perfectly valid response.

I bit my second bullet here on the question of square circles. The claim
is equally highly dubious here, because spacetime geometry could very well
lead to different values of pi and polygonal circles, without being
inconsistent (i.e. other universes could have different laws of physics,
and hence reasoning based on local laws does not have necessary meaning
there). God deserving the name would be able to modify universes, and
assign arbitrary values to interpretation of different situations.

You answered "True" to Question 16.

This answer generated the following response:

You've just bitten a bullet! In saying that God has the freedom and power
to do that which is logically impossible (like creating square circles),
you are saying that any discussion of God and ultimate reality cannot be
constrained by basic principles of rationality. This would seem to make
rational discourse about God impossible. If rational discourse about God
is impossible, there is nothing rational we can say about God and nothing
rational we can say to support our belief or disbelief in God. To reject
rational constraints on religious discourse in this fashion requires
accepting that religious convictions, including your religious
convictions, are beyond any debate or rational discussion. This is to bite
a bullet.

First of all, that was only a simple example to show it could be done.  The
distance problem could be optimized a little.

On the other hand, once people are uploaded, time is irrelevant.  If the
system takes a year per cycle, the uploads won't notice.  They will always
perceive "normal" speed.

And I allegedly "took a hit" for claiming that atheists would need definite
negative evidence in order for a certain rejection of God to not be "based on
faith", after saying that the mere lack of positive evidence was sufficient to
reject the existence of the Loch Ness monster.  This ignores the higher
Bayesian prior for the existence of God (e.g., due to some previous
transcending civilization Going All The Way), and the higher prior probability
that God might be successfully hiding from investigators or merely not
providing any evidence (whereas Nessie would have been expected to show up by
now).  We have enough evidence to say with near-certainty that there is no
Judeo-Christian God active in our solar system; but as for the existence of an
abstract God entity, one has the Bayesian prior for existence minus the
Bayesian prior for intervention given existence, and what's left over can't be
eliminated at this time.  Although we can eliminate the possibility of there
being any legitimate grounds for warm-n-fuzzy wishful thinking about the
existence, psychology, or moral implications of noninterventionist Gods.

Moral of the story:  J. Random Online Philosopher is not up to the rigorous
formal standards of logic that prevail on the Extropians list.

I heard that the painter Dali once sent some drops of his sperm to his
father in an enveloppe with the note: "now we're quits". I think it is
quite funny.

No reason why not.  A cycler at an orbit half the distance of the moon would
orbit every 10 days.

This idea seems great at first, but there are two downsides:

1)  It wouldn't cut costs.  The energy needed to go half-way to mars and
then the rest of the way will be at least equal to the whole trip.  The
extra fuel needed to precicely dock with the cycler station will probably
make such a trip MORE expensive than a straight shot.

2)  At a distance half-way to mars, the cycler would have an orbit of 517.6
days.  Doesn't sound bad.  But, as a result, it would line up with earth
only every 3.4 years, and with mars only every 2.1 years.  Assuming the
average (half) wait for any arbitrary launch time, a trip to mars via the
cycler would take 2.7 years.  Since mars aligns with earth every 2.1 years,
the cycler would slow down such trips.  And as I pointed out, without saving
any money.



The reason such stations have been proposed in the past is not to save money
or energy, but to allow inadequate ships to get to mars.  Assume a ship
cannot carry enough food.  The advantage of a cycler would be that several
unmanned ships could be sent to rendevous with the cycler.  Then when the
manned ship goes, there will be an oasis with food along the journey.
That's the reason to consider cyclers.

Atom bond length is fixed, hence there is no continuum. Measurements have
quantum uncertainty, brownian uncertainty, and the position can change by
brownian noise, too.

In theory, in practice co-evolution requires systems to run as fast as
possible, as long as energy is affordable. Exploits at hardware layer make
too slow systems dead systems, soon.

Sounds like "Tommy" (original) by Tommy Hilfiger.

You might also try:

"Chemistry"  by Clinique
"Allure"     by Chanel
"Polo Sport" by Ralph Lauren

I've recently discovered how complex the area of fragrances is,
it's normal for a fragrance to have two or even three separate
presentations, the chemistry gets quite complex.

And these fragrances are for daytime, Nighttime generally requires
the Musks, spices, and woodsy fragrances.

My longtime favorites: Old Spice, and Jovan Musk. 


>As for a container, why not something like a chaosphere? 


Since we'd need a number of containers for both the daytime/evening
and men/women/intra lines how about the platonic solids?

In the article I mentioned they came up with a blown glass inverted
truncated cone with an inner container and an amber-like top. The
container would scroll around in a circle when bumped.

I liked the way they dealt with this in "Ventus", augmented beings,
some with a nanotech core around the spine.

Augment and accentuate, not necessarily replace.

Sure. But distance is still not a particularly efficient way of storing
information. An integer X holds log(X) bits of information, which means
that if the resolution of a system is r and maximum size is R, the most
information a distance can provide is log(R/r) = log(R)-log(r). If we
use the planck length 1.6e-35 m for r and the size of the visible
universe 1.4e26 m for R, we only get 202.5 bits for each atom pair.
Compare this to the rough megabyte of information that can be stored in
the volume/mass of a single hydrogen atom by the Bekenstein bound (a
more realistic estimate would of course be around one bit per hydrogen
atom, although Rydberg wavefunctions apparently hold some promise of
storing complex information).

Using more markers for distances won't help - each new marker can after
a while only be placed so as to provide three new distances to the
configuration of markers (four is an overdetermined problem), which
means that the total information of the system grows as
3M(log(R)-log(r))/m0 if the markers have mass m0 and the total mass is
M. Compare this to the Bekenstein bound 2.57e43 M R bits - even if you
find sufficiently low mass particles to make m0 very small, the growth
is still logarithmic in space.

If the cosmological constant is as large as is currently believed, time
is really running out. Cosmic expansion will, besides changing distances
in a fairly calculable manner, make horizons creep inwards. Eventually a
very large computing system will find its outer parts separated from the
inner ones.

There's no reason to postulate an intelligent agent here. Despite the
dramatic tone of the news release, it seems to me that this is an expected
state under the most favoured theory, which the system will experience
for "just" a few million years (red giants are very short-lived on an
astronomical timeline). Since the number of fast-spinning pulsars is still
under a hundred, it's no surprise that we didn't catch it before.

Actually, Anders pointed out, someone has already done some of the work 
here.  See http://members.aol.com/dsfportree/ex91b.htm 

(There are other neat space resources there too.)

For a moment, I wondered if Grasse, France was named after 
"lemon grass", but now I think the town might be named 
after a fat count :-)   

Grasse is best known for its perfumes, with a long historical
tradition:
 
http://www.jeremyjosephs.com/perfume.htm
http://www.provenceweb.fr/e/alpmarit/grasse/grasse.htm
http://www.cadeauxdeprovence.com/portraits/parfum_en.htm

The larger Grasse perfumeries are similar to wineries, in that the
public can visit and sample (smell) the variety, and choose what they
like to buy. Even better, there are some perfumeries there, where you
can make your own:

the "Studio des Fragrances" at the Galimard Perfumes
http://www.galimard.com  is one example

Amara

P.S. Did I ever write something here about the Men's cologne: 
"Gravity" ?

The advertisement says: 
" Gravity ... the Force that Pulls You Closer "

(but don't they realize that gravity is the weakest force in the
universe?!)

I'm not sure about the latter claim.  After all, if the cycler station was 
more like a storage depot, each individual trip to it might use a lot less 
fuel than a straight shot to Mars.  Why?  The mass would be smaller for the 
ship docking to the cycler station. 

The idea is, I think, to use the cycle more as a cheap way to ferry supplies 
and maybe people back and forth.  One can make several small trips to a 
cycler station -- rather than one big one to the station or the destination.

That could be a problem...  Is there only one cycler configuration?  Also, 
for people that's a long time, but for a lot of cargo, it doesn't matter.  
Imagine, e.g., a cycler supplying a Mars base.  The only point would be to 
ferry bulk supplies continuously to Mars.

That's a good idea too and melds with that of using a cycler station as a 
supply ferry.  A manned mission to Mars could arrive there with large 
quantities of "cycled" supplies already in place.  This might cut down on 
the need for fancy technology or even recycling and repairs.  After all, if 
you can cycle through enough spare parts... 

I think the idea is good for another reason.  It lends itself to a variety 
of uses.  A direct Mars mission would only be useful for that and probably 
only to get there and maybe back.  A cycler station could be used over and 
over and even, I bet, "recycled" to other uses, since it would be a bona 
fide space station or supply ferry. 

Also, with such a system in place, you don't need to develop larger ships to 
make the journey.  The manned ship could just have enough to get to Mars 
"high speed" and not have to carry much else beyond the supplies to get 
there -- and maybe to get back, in case of an emergency -- but not the 
supplies needed for a long stay on Mars. 

Cheers!

<DIV>&gt;Artworks, carvings etc sold by 19th </DIV></DIV>

<DIV>Personally, I don't like the whole idea of selling artwork (which is probably why I was never very successful as an artist). I think the true value of art is in its accessability - both physically &amp; subjectively. Visual art has a wider audience than literature for example, which can only be directly enjoyed by people who&nbsp;1) have the ability to read &amp; 2) have some level of reading comprehension.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>(**I am&nbsp;NOT saying that one is superior to the others in any way, simply that visual &amp; some performing arts require, at the most basic level,&nbsp;less of their audiences. Just to be clear, all I mean is that you can go to an opera &amp; enjoy the show without understanding the words or the story -&nbsp;the abilities to simply watch &amp; listen&nbsp;are not inhibited by any lack of comprehension. But with literature, if you can't read or comprehend the written word, you can be neither actively nor passively involved *directly* with the artform. ** Having said that...)</DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>What I mean by the "physical" accessability of art is simply this: the more people it can reach, the higher its value. Everyone brings their own unique view to a work of art. No one can say that one person's view is right or wrong - art is one of the few things that most people (barring critics) accept as a universally subjective phenomenon. I think its&nbsp;amazing how&nbsp;masses of people over&nbsp;thousands of years&nbsp;can collectively share &amp; recognize the value of a piece&nbsp;without losing that distinctly personal, individual experience that truly is the joy of art.&nbsp;What good is a piece of art if no one can see it to enjoy it? For this reason, I think art should be free to all. Sorry for grandstanding a bit, but I hope it can help&nbsp;illustrate some of the problems with the whole idea of "ownership"&nbsp;in art. (bet you couldn't guess I'm an art-lover :P) </DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>I realize this&nbsp;is even beyond idealism, so I'll get back to the point. Back in the real world, art is no different from any other commodity - once its sold, its sold for good (unless an agreement can be reached by *both sides). Its really that simple - why should any special or different rules apply?</DIV>

Well, it's all a matter of whether you can afford the investment
required to produce and put into the cycler orbit the infrastructure to
truly make it an energy and mass saving venture. You gotta spend money
to make it.

At this point, you run into the welfare pols who think that 'the money
is better spent here on earth' (as if the money is actually spent in
space based malls or something) on 'human needs'.

I was thinking of packaging pieces in a cushioning/bracing material
which could be easily converted into fuel for spacecraft once in orbit.
I hear that there is a form of a plasma engine that uses teflon or
styrofoam for fuel, so maybe this isn't such a kooky idea.

Having Alpha station up there and fully functional certainly is a very
valuable asset for use as a staging base for assembly of bigger and more
complex interplanetary missions.

Having the ability to disassemble packed pods in orbit opens up the
possibility of using the packaging concept to allow launch of equipment
from less expensive, higher G launch mechanisms, like guns and rail
launchers.

Not to ignore the personal, immutable (but for possible hormonal
modulation) aspects of scent, designed to accentuate what targets the
vomeronasal organ (usually of the opposite sex, volatile MHC fragment
match for maximum child viability or best provider traits).

Would the container be a static or dynamic object? Dynamic, obviously.
High tech, so part of it involves ionization, producing negative ions
for mood boosting and pollution elimination, and the scent would contain
nootropic compounds to boost the users IQ, pheromones to boost their sex
appeal, and is otherwise customizable to the individual's personality
quotient.

Spike, you forgot: they must be midget or leg amputated lesbians, with
midget lesbian embryos preselected (with leg amputation an option for

I do notice this as well. My example of an SF work which may have suffered
because of Australian settings is M. K. Wren (Martha K Renfroe) "The Phoenix
Legacy" which I think is a wonderful work of SF but is long out of print
with no sign of its ever being revived. Steve Davies

Ah, but you and I are J. Random Online Philosopher: Dr. Stangroom is
the academic mainstream.  My hit was a matter of sloppy wording, but
yours is probably a case of ideas that just haven't sunk in to the
mainstream enough yet for them to be taken seriously.  So score one
for JROP.

It would not surprize me, though, if Dr. Stangroom saw any flaws in
his test as a success for him personallyin bringing up those details
that even good philosophers can miss.

I must say I notice this as well, in responses to other communication forms
such as movies and lectures also. I don't think it's down to power though. I
think it's a natural human tendency exagerated by the sheer size and
self-contained nature of the US. Steve Davies

And you're right, you can't "win". Or at least it is probably impossible to
"win". And if it is possible to "win", then you just don't have the
necessary skills yet to "win". Like the clich goes, you can't please
everyone all of the time.

I put "win" in quotes as a form of markup in my message to you in the hope
that it becomes clearer. Markup and pretty pictures can greatly enhance a
large body of work that is dominantly textual. In email we use other forms
of text markup, like ">" for quoting, HTML encoding, _emphasis_ or *action*,
etc. These are all very important communication techniques that the sender
must use to try and communicate more clearly. I am suggesting that you add
more markup and diagrams to your papers to make them more "readable".

As for the implicit desire to "win", or please as many people as possible
all the time, you need to either give up on that ideal given your current
writing skill, or learn what it is exactly that everyone wants that will
make them understand. If you don't have the skill yet, or you don't
understand what everyone wants, you must narrow down your target audience.
If your audience is current AI researchers, then learn their jargon and play
by the rules. If your audience is Extropians, same thing. If your audience
is me and others like me, then put more diagrams in to fill up those pages
of long, dense, jargon-rich and neologistic text.

HTH.

For an entity that is sophisticated enough to have a natural language
interface, I doubt that it would need any sort of container. A nanobot cloud
could be told to stay put, maybe self-contained in some sort of appealing
user-configurable shape, or mask the smell of my armpits as appropriate for
the social norms that I am mingling with. These nanobots would have to
self-destruct after they have been consumed by an olfactory sense, simply
for the reason that the manufacturer would make money by manufacturing more
for market demand :-)

That is a recurring theme in space travel.  If you have a space elevator, 
e.g., you get a cheap way to orbit, but you have to build a space elevator 
first...

As you might guess, I want total privatization of the space program -- i.e., 
the conventional libertarian position.  I don't think Boeing, Rocketdyne, 
NASA, etc. should have welfare either. 

Sadly, that's not going to happen anytime soon...

It doesn't sound so, though I wonder about how efficient it would be... 

What if the packaging material is stuff than can used for other applications 
aside from propellant?  Off the top of my head, how about blankets and 
clothes as packing material?

Certainly.  I'd like to see more and cheaper stations built, such as the 
ones External Tanks, Inc. has proposed -- using the shuttles external tank 
as the infrastructure.  Currently, the tanks are just thrown away.  Each one 
is much bigger than Alpha is now.

That too, though immediately it would mean not having to design stuff to 
have to stand the rigors of less exotic launches in one piece.  (I mean 
launches using current launchers, such as Deltas, Arianes, Protons, and the 
like.)  It also allows for quality control in space and recovery and reuse 
of damaged items.  You would not longer have to fire and forget a damaged 
satelite -- or where possible (which is rarely the case) bank on a costly 
shuttle repair mission.

Imaging a station that orbits in such a way that it goes near earth and
mars.  (We'll call this the "cycle orbit".)  Sending a ship to rendevous
with the cycler station is EXACTLY the same as putting the shp in the "cycle
orbit".  You have gained nothing (energy-wise) by having a station already
orbiting at that same spot.

Now, I'll admit that with a station, the trip will be more pleasant.  I'm
just saying it won't save you energy.

True.  But the energy cost per item remains the same.  You are just dividing
that energy cost
among several trips.

A similar but different scenario is to use an asteroid.  Instead of
"landing" on the asteroid, you just get in the way and "crash" on the
asteroid.  In this way, you don't have to expend the energy to match speeds.
(You just have to have enough padding to survive the crash.)  This would
eventually change the asteroid's orbit after many crashes, but the time to
do that might be years or centuries.

My exmple time was a circular orbit.  I think (but haven't done the math)
that an eccentric orbit that touched both orbits would have a period similar
to this average.

It does, however, have a specific subjective logic

I'd love to know if anyone can get through this

$10 million would go a long way toward cheap access to space- which is
the Step 1 toward all the other scenarios.  Apply below... and we plan
to be profitable in under five years, not in a freaking decade.

After reading "The Call of Beauty, Coming In Loud & Clear" at
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30489-2002Feb18.html ,
complete with a comment from Kurzweil at the end, and the recent thread on
an Extropian Fragrance, I have been considering exactly what would become
beautiful to a transhuman or posthuman.

Like Ray K. says, patterns have a great deal of power. I believe it is
possible to find beauty in practically anything, except true randomness,
which could be considered beautiful in its own right. But the intensity of
the beauty is proportional to the strength of the pattern recognition in our
minds.

As we add clothing and cybernetic devices to our bodies, they would all have
a sense of beauty about them. But I believe that a more intense beauty is
discovered by an observer when these devices are removed - hence the appeal
of nakedness. In the future, when we're all wired up to the Internet Hive
Mind and wearing the latest cool fashions with the latest cool technology, I
think the really beautiful people will be presented naked. Those people with
non-removable implants will be considered "freaks" and be ugly.


cheers,

The total cost of all the trips might be the same or higher as one big trip, 
but the fact is we have small rockets right now and small payloads.  It's 
kind of like the poor man's choice of buying one serving of rice at a time 
instead of a months' supply...

An interesting idea.  We'd also have to know about the particular asteroid 
 -- depending on the goals here.  After all, Eros appears to be covered with 
dust and small rocks.  Impacting it might result in a lot material being 
kicked up -- a hazard to many operations. 

How could we find out what a particular asteroid is like before attempting 
such an impact?  Perhaps a smaller probing impact?

The site Anders cited gave what appeared to be another configuration.  In 
fact, IIRC, the cycler proposed changed orbital configurations to suit 
travelers...

What's the minimum you would need to achieve profitability in five years? 

I know I've also broached this subject before, but why come up with new 
designs for rockets?  Why not use old ones -- Saturn, e.g. -- and just build 
inelegant, ugly workhouses that you can throwaway?  Wouldn't that be 
cheaper?

An interesting idea.  With a cycler, maybe there could be a net to catch an 
incoming rocket, BUT if the mass of the rocket is a good fraction of the 
cycler station's, this would not be a good idea. 

Didn't someone have the idea of scooping payloads from lunar mass drivers?  
Could the same idea be applied to a cycler or any station -- as a means of 
capturing supplies?  Or would that require too much precision to make it 
worth while? 

Cheers!

A variation on this is to sling loose regolith into the path of the oncoming spacecraft, a crude particle beam made of (sifted)
dust. G-loads are then much lower, delta v's may reach upwards of 1 km/sec depending on the accuracy of the slinger. The
spacecraft's ablation shield would have to be able to withstand this 'dust atmosphere' re-entry.

I'd invest in developing ballistic business jets. As the global news
business gets more active, as it has the past few years, with celebrity
news correspondents (Ashleigh Banfield, Christiane Ammanpour, etc) who
would need to get on the scene of breaking news pronto, there seems to
be a market for G-IV sized or smaller business jets that fly ballistic
arcs to reach any point on the globe in less than an hour with a 2-3
person newscrew as cargo.
The jet would use turbo-ramjet engines to takeoff and land, with Doug's
XCOR engines to boost from Mach3 up to 12.

As this model gains airtime, then extend it to a Blackhorse capability,
releasing small satellites with boosters from the cargo bay rather than
carry passengers (though imagine strapping a booster to the back of your
issue MMV and spacesuit)...

Ever wonder what dust really is and what if any good it is? This
amazing book has the answer. Think it gets muggy now? Imagine 300%
humidity, it won't thanks to dust.

Extremely well written science.

This is one of those books that will have you shaking your head in
admiration as you read.

And when it's finished I can put it next to my books on dirt and

So when you have a brain that thinks a million times as fast as a human 
brain, you want to totter around on two legs?

People, when fully developed nanotech is here, there will be NO need for a 
human body or human brain as we know it.  As Esfandiary said once, the 
human brain is like a mud-hut in Mexico - you can string pretty lights 
around it, move in some good-looking pigs, but it's still a mud-hut...

Yet another reason why poker is the ultimate Extropian game: we
learn to calculate Nash equilibria of two-player games of incomplete
information in our heads, and get a pretty good feel for the n-player
versions.  Bart doesn't tell us what his payoff matrix is for the
blonde game, or what the exact rules are, but any poker player
knows even without the numbers that you should choose randomly
between pursuing the blond or one of the brunettes, weighted toward
the brunettes (but not 100%, as Bart correctly points out).  Of
course, if you're among those who, like me, actually value brunettes
more (while your bar-buddies are all blond-seekers), then the Nash
equilibrium of the game may well involve ignoring the blond.

The option has recently arisen to me to become an organ donor. I am a devout 
extropian in thought, and am trying to practice what is preached. So, for my 
decision, I turn to the largest collection of caring intellectuals available to 
me; you, my fellow Extropians. 
So I propose: is organ donation a valid, adhering extropian pursuit?

I would assume that the basic, preliminary response to be "absolutly" because 
of the logic behind recycling (of organs). Also,one would be extending (and 
improving the quality of)a fellow being's life.

Of course, this is all assuming my body (at least the unusable parts, and the 
brain)will be kept in cryrostasis until I can be "recovered".  This is a risk 
because, in my mind, hacking the body apart for scrap and at the same time 
trying to preserve it might not work so well. What if, in the process of 
removing my occular organs, they snip or tear out a vital part of my 
nervous/sensory system? (Im thinking Occipital lobe and optical nerve here)
Also, this is assuming that there WILL be replacement organs available to me 
upton thawing, but what if the Government denies companies the ability to grow 
human tissue on moral grounds?I might be walking around with a permanent kidney 
dialysis machine if my kidneys had been donated. . .

Does it matter? Any macroscopic body is going to be ridiculously slow

To continue the analogy, the goal is to create an improved house, but
not to get rid of houses. The mistake of the anti-body meme is that it
tries to get rid of any trace of the "impure" and "imperfect" rather
than concentrating on how to extend and improve on the valuable parts of
us. A negative rather than positive creed.

Dear fellow cryoneters:

Bill Falloon and Saul Kent are doing some great things for cryonics as you
read this.  They are, of course, the CEO's of Life Extension Foundation,
many of you may already be members. (At 75 bucks a year, includes TREMENDOUS
monthly magazine and discounts on food supplements/ anti-aging compounds,
and vitamins, a real bargain.)  Go to lef.org for their great website.

Anyway, they have made it very easy to write your senator re: the current
cloning ban law currently in the Senate.

I have reproduced the letter which I wrote to about 25 senators below.  It
is mostly from the LEF site.  Except the ending, where I get a little nasty
and emotional, designed as a stronger close than the professional and
"understated" sample letter from LEF.

I may be professional.  But few who read this list regularly would accuse me
of being "understated"!  LOL!

Friends, the long awaited WAR has begun!  I am referring to the oft
discussed tension between the forces of science, knowledge, technology, and
rationality Vs the forces of mythology, renouncement, "God did not intend
for man to do this," and the attitude that "I am not comfortable with the
possible ramifications of this, so I am going to lobby to criminalize your
even considering or researching possibilities."

The religious right has massive funding, television stations, and the
tremendous blind faith of the religiously deluded. This is a society where
it is considered a positive if you believe something just BECAUSE there is
NO evidence of it!  This flawed but surprising effective epistemology has
engendered societies ruled by religious zealots throughout most of recorded
history.

But back to the task at hand.  YOUR task.  If you value the possibility of
therapeutic cloning research improving YOUR life in the next 3 or 5 or 10
years.  Instead of the 15 or 20 or more which it could take if we allow the
U. S. government to CRIMINALIZE RESEARCH!

Please write your senator about this.  Reprint the letter below, or reword
it.

Best and easiest, go to lef.org and utilize their already hypertexed email
addresses for senators.

Here is letter.  The good parts are suggested or copied verbatim from LEF.
The ending diatribe is mine.

Dear Senator,

I urge you to vote AGAINST S. 790, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of
2001, sponsored by Kansas Republican Sam Brownback.  Passage of this bill
would make it a criminal offense to conduct research on the development of
new therapies using stem cells derived from very early-stage cloned embryos.
It would greatly slow the development of therapeutic cloning, the most
promising new technology in medicine.

Therapeutic cloning involves the generation of young,
immunologically-identical cells, tissues, and organs for transplant.  It has
the potential to cure killers such as heart disease, stroke, cancer,
Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, arthritis, and Parkinson's disease.  It also
could be instrumental in the development of therapies to reverse the
infirmities and ravages of aging, leading to longer, healthier lives for
millions of Americans.

Most of the top scientists in the United States SUPPORT THERAPEUTIC CLONING
RESEARCH.  These include Nobel laureates such as Dr. David Baltimore and Dr.
Harold Varmus and organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences.
(NAS), the National Institute of Health (NIH), and the Federation of
American Societies For Experimental Biology (FASEB.)

It is IMPERATIVE that you and your colleges understand the ENORMOUS
potential of THERAPEUTIC cloning research.  Scientists who are conducting
this research, such as Dr. Michael West at Advanced Cell Technologies, are
HEROES.  This legislation could make these researchers into criminals.  This
is wrong.

There is a distinction between Therapeutic cloning and Reproductive cloning.
Even if it IS necessary to place a temporary moratorium on human
REPRODUCTIVE cloning, please don't criminalize THERAPEUTIC cloning research.

I would appreciate your response to this letter.

Sincerely Yours,

Unfortunately, organ donation is presently incompatible with electing
cryonic suspension.  Here is a good article by then-Alcor President Steve
Bridge, explaining the reasons.  Steve suggests pre-death donations of
blood and possibly bone marrow as an alternative way to help others who
would otherwise die.

Self ownership is a central concept for extropian thought: our bodies
are our own to dispose of. And it seems reasonable to accept the right
to testament one's possessions - including the body.

Does organ transplants promote extropy? I would say so - they help other
beings live full lives. But there is no necessary ethical obligation to
do it, it is just a good act and may become subordinate to other
concerns.

One such concern is that currently cryonics is incompatible with organ
donation: cryopreserved organs are not suitable, and the interval
between diagnosed brain death and finishing the transplantation
operation is likely so long that significant deterioration will have
occured. So if you bet your personal survival on cryonics, you can't at
the same time become an organ donor according to current rules. 

It is of course possible that rules will change in the future and it
will be OK to transplant organs from cryonics patients stipulating this
in their wills. But I think this is rather unlikely - the number of
cryonics patients is so low and non destructive organ retrival from
frozen bodies so hard that it is unlikely to be relevant for the organ
shortage issue. Instead technological aspects such as tissue engineering
are very likely to become central (and provide one of the inroads
towards cell repair). Scenarios about geting revived and having to go on
external dialysis appears self contradictory: if the government limits
research into replacement organs, then you can bet it will limit
research into replacement bodies and cell repair!

If you are not cryonically suspended and die, then at least donating
organs can provide some extra help to other aspiring beings. You have
not lost more from doing this (having already lost everything,
unfortunately). But this altruism is in the end up to you.

For those of you who might be concerned at Robert's notable absence from
the list the last couple days, he is suffering from a lack of
connectivity at the moment, thanks to his phone company's unmentionable
dedication to quality service. He should be back online in a few days...

If you are interested in cryonic suspension, then organ donation is to
be specifically avoided, since having you dead long enough to remove the
organs generally leaves your brain in much worse shape than would occur
if you were run through the suspension protocol at time of death. You
should try to completely overwrite the notation on your drivers license
that asks if you are an organ donor, since I have heard of occurences of
people's licenses being marked by hospital personnel for organ donation
if they come in in a vegetative state (the same sort of institutions
that walk off with your watch and jewelry too, I imagine) with an
unmarked license. 

I have a large black swath of ink blanking out the entire line on the
back of my driver's license. Now that I'm back to work, I plan on
signing up for suspension as soon as possible.

If you have no intention of preserving your own into the future, go for
it. Think about this, though: most donated organs go to people who
thoroughly abused their own organs, what makes you think they'll have
any more respect for yours? They may be thankful as all hell to live,
but usually not enough to do what is necessary to help them live more
than a few years after the transplant operation.

Robin Hanson's papers in the last few years have done much to illustrate
that health care such as this does markedly little to extend human life
or improve the quality of life, especially in respect to the expense
incurred in doing so, with the exception of improving the quality of
life of the doctors collecting the money...

How bizzarre... I am reading "Animal Liberation" by Peter Singer at the
moment. Same issues. Same book?

I think that the ethical questions raised have are very strong in the
context of transhumanism, moreso than other philosophies, in that we support
morphological freedom, and thus must regard where we are now (human) as t(i)
(where i is some positive integer) in an iterative process. This implies far
less weight given to current qualities of humanity in determining who is
covered by concepts such as the Principle of Equality... any criteria based
on current human abilities must look entirely arbitrary. Thus with respect
to beings with below human levels of intelligence, which are otherwise
rather similar to us (eg: mammals), it is difficult to see where lines could
rightly be drawn to grant us rights but deny the same to them. After all, in
a context where we are talking about becoming SIs, etc, the difference
between a human and, say, a dog, is negligable.

Thoughts?

I'm not in the finance loop and shouldn't give out guesstimates off the
top of my head; consider my earlier comments a teaser for serious
investors to contact us to talk.  If you or someone you know has around
$10 million and wants to make it grow in an exciting way, call us.

In a word, no.  Old engines are either NOT cheap, nonexistent, or too
unreliable for routine reuse. Expendable launch vehicles just perpetuate
the "launcher as ammunition" meme, and cannot bring space access prices
down into the realm of the reasonable, period full stop.  Throwing away
an airliner after every flight would make air travel preposterously
expensive too.  Big Dumb Boosters have been proposed, and as recently as
the Beal BA-2, attempted.  Just to get it barely working the design
rapidly grows more complex until the inelegant, ugly workhorse is too
expensive to throw away.  Trashing a lot of hardware for every flight
cannot be cheap, no matter how many you fly.

Dear Sci Cryonics,
<<

Oh, yeah--sci.cryonics...
>>

I am writing as I am very keen to hear from anyone who is 22-34 yrs
old and who is interested in cryonics for an exciting new documentary
series that we are making for the BBC about the 22-34 generation.

'Born in the 70s' is an in-depth exploration of what British twenty
and early thirty-somethings really get up to What do we eat, think,
smoke and say?  Who do we sleep with, where, when, how often and for
just how long? How happy are we with what we've got and how hard do we
work to change it? How do we feel about death and what are we most
passionate about?

Starting from a brand new, comprehensive survey conducted throughout
Britain, 'Born in the 70s' is filled with personal stories not only
from the seemingly ordinary people who conform to every average, but
also from the extraordinary people whose quirky extremes help to shape
the attitudes and aspirations of this generation. It is guaranteed to
get the audience talking, and as one of the first high profile
programmes for the BBC's newest channel - BBC 3, 'Born in the 70s'
will have a media impact that reaches far beyond the screen.

These fascinating revelations will be brought to life using the kind
of computer generated effects that made 'The Human Body' and 'Walking
with Dinosaurs' such compelling TV. We are going to create the average
face, hear the average voice and visit the average bedroom of young
Britain. Then we'll scour the country to find and crown a real life Mr
and Mrs Average UK 2002. From friendships to fashions and sex lives to
spending sprees, from the stuff we put into our bodies to the things
that come out, 'Born in the 70s' is a ground breaking and ambitious
new TV series, creating the first ever Doomsday book for the MTV
generation.

This ten part series of half hour programmes will take a fresh look at
our homes, offices, relationships, health, values, sex lives, friends,
bodies as well as the way we feel about our looks and where and how we
like to go clubbing  and we are looking for as many people possible
to get involved.

As I mentioned, I would be delighted if you were to consider helping
us with the programme that we are making about health as we are very
keen to talk to someone between 22-34yrs old who is interested in
cryonics  for a section within the programme that looks at death and
our attitudes towards death. The story would be filmed from the
contributor's pespective.

Please do not hesitate to give me a ring at the office on my direct
line 0207 284 8187 (or through the switchboard on 0207 284 8181) or by
email at

Louisa@outlineproductions.co.uk

if I can be of any further assistance.

Many thanks for your kind consideration in this matter,

Yours sincerely,

Louisa Rowland,
Associate Producer
Born in the 70s'
Outline Productions for BBC3/Choice

This issue was also addressed in Richard Dawkin's criticism of Humanist Manifesto 2000, which he characterized as speciesist because it specifically mentioned only Homo sapiens as having rights, and pointed out that if any Homo erectus showed up, they wouldn't be distinguished from termites, ethically. If I remember correctly, he suggested that ethical consideration should be based upon qualities, not species, and on a sliding scale. Since evolution did not have sharp boundaries and perceptible break points, Dawkins saw no reason why we should impose such distinctions in our dealings with other species. This doesn't put dogs and cats on the same level as humans, but it does require that we consider their welfare to some extent. But not as much as we would dolphins and chimps. On the other hand, I don't think Dawkins speculated about where Homos sapiens would stand after the advent of a more "advanced" being. Since characteristics that merit ethical consideration, such as self !
awareness and moral capacity, are already present in man, could any other creature merit even more ethical consideration? I am not sure these qualities are related strictly to intelligence, or would increase as intelligence does.

How bizzarre... I am reading "Animal Liberation" by Peter Singer at the moment. Same issues. Same book?

I think that the ethical questions raised have are very strong in the
context of transhumanism, moreso than other philosophies, in that we support morphological freedom, and thus must regard where we are now (human) as t(i) (where i is some positive integer) in an iterative process. This implies far less weight given to current qualities of humanity in determining who is covered by concepts such as the Principle of Equality... any criteria based on current human abilities must look entirely arbitrary. Thus with respect
to beings with below human levels of intelligence, which are otherwise
rather similar to us (eg: mammals), it is difficult to see where lines could rightly be drawn to grant us rights but deny the same to them. After all, in a context where we are talking about becoming SIs, etc, the difference between a human and, say, a dog, is negligable.

Thoughts?

Oh I didnt forget. I assumed it.  All else being equal, the mass of
the entire mission scales as the cube of the linear dimension of the
crew.  If you can find a number of meter-tall lebians, we can get
that mass right on down into the manageable numbers.  spike

In the initial phases, yes.  I referred to fully developed nano.  After 
that, we cannot predict what kind of technology will be developed (that's 
why we call it the Singularity), and therefore we cannot say what kind of 
"physical" (or possibly energetic) body may be developed.  I personally do 
not accept the notion of "uploading" as a realistic probability (altho 
certainly a possibility) as I feel that restricts such an entity's survival 
probability to that of the system in which he is embedded - which is not an 
acceptable situation for a Transhumanist.  The Universe (or that portion of 
it which the laws of physics allow us to access - and I do not assume 
Relativity is an absolute here although it may appear to be so in current 
understanding) is the only acceptable home for a Transhuman.  Again, this 
does not preclude uploading as an option under certain circumstances, but I 
cannot accept it as some sort of long-term goal.  I have metaphysical 
problems with the notion of any sort of body-brain "duplication" being a 
useful form of immortality.  One is one's continuity in space/time - a 
duplicate is never "you".  I could accept uploading only if it is fault 
tolerant, failure tolerant, restartable and "resurrectable" AND at the same 
time the end result ensures that I and I alone exist.

Simple.  Human do not have rights - and therefore animals have none as 
well.  I find rights to be a redundant and effectively useless 
concept.  The human race exists in Darwinian competition with itself and 
all other species.  Within itself, this need not be the case, but because 
of human stupidity, ignorance, irrationality, maliciousness and fear - 
characteristics I find more defining of the species than Ayn Rand's 
"rationality" - they have in fact made this the case.  A Transhumanist 
should accept this and act accordingly.  Do not rely on social fictions to 
protect you or anything else.

Rationality smashionality.  (Eh ... "more defining of the species" ... is
that a reference to the "little people," so memorably described by another
ultra-capitalist, Queen Leona Helmsley?)   Indeed, Ayn Rand exhibited all
the same characteristics imputed here to the rest of us, except she had them
in egregious abundance:  ignorance, irrationality, maliciousness and fear
(and those characteristics add up to "human stupidity" IMO).  In other
words, Ms. Rand and "the little people" turn out, indeed, to be of the same
species (a/k/a "human beings").

Skyscrapers notwithstanding, I realize Leona Helmsley and Ayn Rand are
entirely different people.

O.

I was afraid that it would be yet another one of the "if you disagree
with us, you're wrong, and we'll 'prove' it" monologues I've seen pop up
here and there.  Though, just because I got through it doesn't
necessarily mean it isn't so - maybe I just happened to agree with them.

Aye.  I'd go so far as to claim that $10 million would be barely enough
to get a viable, profitable space tourism business going, if you had
business people who knew what they were doing* (as opposed to, say, your
typical dotcom manager): almost all the money would be needed just to
develop the rocket and get it through the licensing process.


* Having met Doug and others in XCOR personally, I can vouch that their
management currently appears more than competent enough.

If you're closer to San Jose than Los Angeles, another organization you
might try is ERPS (http://www.erps.org/).  For those of you in Texas,
Armadillo Aerospace (http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/) has also been
making good progress.  I've heard of others, but there are those who
fly and those who just talk - and all three of the ones I've mentioned
have now flown (I've seen them myself, albeit only on video for two of
them).

How does Singularity the fragrance sound?  With the right kind of sexy ad campaign we could get this one to sell.  And we could even make Eliezer a sex symbol!

In this instance, I think he will rejoice that the test provoked some
discussion, but he will not recognize the alleged flaws as flaws and
amend the test accordingly.

Now I have shown the oncoming Singularity the appropriate respect!  It definitely deserves to be in caps.  

I wonder what the right container design would be?  Something reminiscent of a spiking graph?  And as for the fragrance, I think we need something which only gets better and better as one wears it, to the point where those around you are so overwhelmed by the scent that they can no longer smell anything!!  Well, that's how I would do it!   

best wishes,

John : )

MEMS can operate (native resonance frequencies, that is) on MHz scale, and
NEMS on GHz scale. Most of construction work outside will still appear to

Hardly. Per Svensson makes mincemeat out of Singer, and shows some of
the less palatable sides of his and other animal rights philosopher's
ideas. The problem isn't that they are deliberately anti-humanistic -
very few consider themselves that - but that their ideas do lead in that
direction. 

Especially Singer's utilitarianism has some rather awful implications.
It is hard to avoid with utilitarianism since it does not place much
value in individual lives but rather on the aggregate level. And of
course, who gets to decide what increases utility the most?
Utilitarianism has a very strong centralist bias. While Singer is very
careful to point out possible slippery slopes when it comes to eating
crayfish (which *might* be able to experience pain, and if we start to
allow ourselves to eat them, we might start eating fish, and then meat),
he handwaves away slippery slopes when it comes to his proposals for
eutanizing malformed children (apparently there is no risk that this
practice will be extended to other undesirable humans, in his view).
Slippery slope arguments are not per se valid, but it is interesting to
see here that Singer allows himself quite a bit of freedom in
interpreting what is risky and what is not - would the same kind of
freedom to decide (with little or no ethical reasoning) apply to the
definers of the common ethics advocaded by many utilitiarians?

I agree this kind of issues is very important to us, and we need to
think through them carefully.

The fact that there is no clear biological dividing line between us and
animals has been used by Singer et al to argue that hence there is no
clear ethical dividing line. This does not follow - it presupposes that
ethical dividing lines must be based on biological dividing lines. In
fact, if one looks carefully at this kind of argument the problem
appears that since there is no clear dividing line between animals and
plants, plants should also be regarded as belong to our ethical
category. 

I think Dawkins is right: the important thing isn't belonging to a
certain species, but other inherent properties.  When I use the word
human, I usually refer to a being endowed with certain abilities such as
capacity for rational thought, freedom of action, the ability to change
behavior depending on learning, deductions and information received from
other beings and so on. Currently the only example we know of fulfilling
these properties are members of homo sapiens, and hence the usage isn't
erroneous, but we are aware of the possibility of encountering or
creating other beings with the same properties. Hence these aliens,
uplifted animals or AIs would also be "human" (at this point it would
make much sense to create alternative terms). A lot of philosophy and
humanism can be placed into this more generalized human framework with
little or no change. 

Many of the human properties brought up by Singer et al as examples of
that we are not unique - language, use of tools, deduction etc, which
are found elsewhere in the animal kingdom - are actually not significant
from an ethical point of view. Sure, we wouldn't manage without language
or tools, but having them doesn't give us any special ethical status. On
the other hand, being able to largely change the way we act and live
depending on ethical ideas, that is a very significant property with
ethical implications. The list above of properties are essential for
being an ethical subject: an irrational being cannot act ethically, nor
can a being that cannot break its behavior patterns or learn. While
there are other species than homo sapiens that show these properties in
part, there is a significant difference in ability between humans and
even the brightest apes. Graded rights make sense, both within the human
category and outside it - as Per Svensson pointed out, acknowledging
humans as having a special ethical position that animals lack doesn't
imply that animals should be treated arbitrarily; you can be a humanist
without being cruel. 

I would sum up by saying that from the perspective of an SI, the
difference between a man and a dog is not negligble. A dog cannot change
itself very far, while humans are in a sense a general form of being
that can at least aspire to vastly different behaviors and lives. When
it comes to being autotelic, the human has more in common with the SI
than the dog.

This is explained in the novel 'Jitterbug Perfume'. It talks about
perfumes having a low, middle, and high note, like a musical chord.
Jitterbug perfume also has a great longevity formula: meditation secrets
taught by mystical monks, combined with frequent bathing followed by
exposure to cool air (lowering body temperature), and frequent
nonprocreative sex.

I think it's a matter of choice.

I think we will have the ability to completely change/augment our
bodies before we replace them.

I like having a body, but there are things I would change if I
could, having a nanoprocessor for augumented brainpower is just one
example.

I think one of the future aesthetics might be who can be the most
augmented and still appear human. See Natasha's Primo page.

Back in the high school days everyone was into building cars that
looked like racecars, I built mine to look perfectly normal, and
outrun the rest...

Just for the record it's not the RBOC's that are keeping fiber from
your door.

I was part of "Project Lightwave" in 1991. The stated purpose was
to completely replace the network with fiber by the year 2000.
Then the FCC, the local CC's, the cable companies, the long
distance companies, and the NGO's got involved. This resulted in
the telecom act of 1996. Killed the project.

Now we have the PLEC's (parasitic local exchange carriers) and
until the rules change, fiber is dead.

H.R. 1542 Tauzin-Dingell is up for a vote again, if it passes we
would embark on a fiber everywhere plan. If it does not pass, it
will be business as usual.

Not sure about cool air, but the last part sounds good.

Guilty as charged, although I've added a half dozen or so recently,
including all those I recommended to Anders. It's like a new hobby.

All other recomendations welcome.

"Aspen" makes me think Colorado obviously.
"Contradiction" guessing Washington D.C.
"Envy" probably Oregon (California envy)

I'll stick with Colorado as my final answer.

Does this mean Doug Jones's needs a LOX powered applicator?

And Amara's would have to be bottle only since the space diamond
dust would clog a spray nozzle.

Whether there is a discernable difference to an SI or not is irrelevant.
However, your assumtion on this point is flawed. If an SI is so
super-intelligent, it should be able to discern MORE difference between
human and dog than humans and dogs can.

Thus illustrating the primary divide between extropians and
left-transhumans.

Rights are not social fictions, they are codified expressions of
objective observation of natural, physical law. TO think otherwise is
the height of irrationality.

Just for the record, we here in NH have been fighting tooth and nail
against Verizon's use of its local monopoly to prevent the customer base
from improving its technology until Verizon has gotten what it thinks is
a decent ROI on existing infrastructure. When will we get fiber? Oh,
sometime over the verizon.... i.e. never.

Then tell the customer base to go out and get your own rights of
way, lay your own fiber, and build your own switching centers.
There's nothing stopping you or anyone else. Except maybe the
ridiculous costs and regulations involved.

Why should the rules of business be different for the RBOC's then
for everybody else?

We are tired of having the federal guns pointed at our heads. No
other business in this country is forced to subsidize their so-
called competition (in reality parasites.)

When you've got a hundred or so parasites you don't start eating
extra meals, you go on a strict diet and starve them out.

Fiber under current federal regulation will not yield market
approved ROI. Simple business decision.

You'll be happy to know you lost that bet.  Here's an excerpt from

Well, my grandfather died this morning at 11 am. He was a week short of
his 89th birthday. I'm not too put out, since he's been suffering from
alzheimers for several years and has been nearly catatonic for the past
year or so, so its already been a long greiving process. This follows
his wife dying this past fall at age 85. I now have one grandmonster
left, my fathers mother, who is the oldest and most active. She'll be
turning 90 this year, yet still manages several rounds of golf a week as
well as dancing, bridge, and is currently dating two fellows...

I just heard of gramps' death this past minute as mom arrived with the
news, but this morning I decided to bite the bullet and sign up for
cryonic suspension with Alcor.

I've been meaning to do this for a while now, since Sasha Chislenko died
(Steve Witham and I decided then to do it), but the past years economic
circumstances have prevented me from taking action on this. Now that I'm
working again, I decided to send off for the info package from Alcor,
emailed Rudi Hoffman this morning to arrange the life insurance.

I'm also taking a lesson from the statistics of the situation. Grampa
Lorrey died at 69 from a heart attack from a life of smoking. Grampy and
Nan Burnett died in their 80's IMHO rather dismally after becoming less
and less active as they got older. Grandma Lorrey is still going strong
at 90 and is the most active of the bunch. Since her father lived to 99
I expect there is a longevity gene in there as well.

As attendees of Extro5 probably noticed, I'm not in very good physical
shape. Working with computers for years now has certainly impacted my
formerly fit physique. I did buy a mountain bike last year, but I've
slacked off on using it, and I haven't had the funds this winter to
engage in the sport which I've been most active in the past, skiing. So
I've decided to get back in shape as well. This will be a lot of work,
and I hope all my friends take the time to occasionally tell me to get
my lard ass off the computer out to exercise.

Sitting around waiting for the nano-santa isn't going to cut it. I'm 34
now, so I'd have to see the singularity by 2045 or else off myself for
cryosuspension to avoid onset of alzheimers. Despite the best optimism
of some, I think that this is still cutting it a little close. I'd like
another 20 years leeway just in case. In this respect, I think investing
1/20th of my time in getting 4/10ths more life is a sound investment. An
ROI of about 8 to 1. The cryo-policy is a good backup plan to this.

Writing online will still be a big part of my life extension plan, since
studies have shown that those who engage in complex writing longer delay
the onset of alzheimers as well.

But how exactly does this solve the problem of using ever 
advancing technology, up to and beyond Singularity, with 
reasonable chances of surviving the process?  The technology is 
essential to building the colonies and may, due to more critical 
conditions, actually advance as fast or faster there.  Are you 
depending on a first sort of people who will choose to be 
involved or less people producing technology more slowly or 
being removed from the majority of clowns on earth or some 
combination of these and other factors.  For the implied goal of 
survival I don't offhand see how your plan is more likely to 
acheive it except in creating more baskets for humans to be in.

So for most Singularity time guesstimates, it is too little far

Insurance is fine.  But that is not precisely what this is.  It 
is advertised as a way to avoid technological disaster.  This is 
something I don't think it is likely it will accomplish.  It 
would avoid a nuclear exchange if you are far enough away or an 
asteroid striking earth, but not a lot else. Singularity will 
travel faster than your colony will and reach further.  Also, 
until we have much better technology for supporting humans in 
space and much more reason to be there, it makes a lot more 
sense in my view to build near earth infrastructure using 
largely robotics and teleprescence first.  Perhaps exploiting 
NEAs for raw materials and using those materials to build is a 
reasonable start.

I have nothing against space development and quite a bit of 
reasons for it.  But escaping technological crisex is not one of 
them.  The advertising seems out-of-whack in what it accents.

Suppose I am stepping out of the seat of a high, stopped vehicle (a 3000 
pound mini-van), which is stopped on ice.

Suppose, further, that I have placed one foot outside the van, on the 
ground, and have begun standing on that leg, when:

The van I am climbing out of is struck from behind by a 4000 pound car 
traveling at, say 35 miles per hour.  The car striking the van comes to 
rest, imparting it's energy to the van, which quickly comes up to a high 
(~35 mph?) speed.  Since my torso is still in the doorway, the rear leading 
edge of the door frame strikes me in the back at whatever speed the car is 
traveling, accelerating my 220 pound body like the blow from a giant hammer 
(the impact zone between the door frame and my back being about 1 inch by 8 
inches).   Luckily for me, the impact was felt about 2 inches to the right 
of my spine, so I was only badly hurt, but not paralyzed.

My physics question is: how does one characterize the energy transfer that 
occurred here?   I'm especially interested in being able to say how much 
energy was in the blow that I received.

Thanks!

The key word is "quickly". Since it doesn't happen instantaneously, I
think the door frame is moving substantially slower than 35 mph when
it hits your back.

Painful? :-)

Sorry, I really have no idea how to figure the acceleration of the van
caused by the impact.

I don't agree with this view of rights, and I don't see where it arises
from the Extropian Principles, http://www.extropy.org/ideas/principles.html.
In fact the words "right" and "rights" do not appear in that document.

How do you see the Principles implying that your particular perspective
on rights is the only rational one?

For example, I've had at least one such `bug' every day for the past
week.  Apart from bogus `remove' lists, it is the spammer's best trick
for confirming the 39 million addresses they bought.

Maybe I should rephrase my statement here... in terms of the process of
transformation, of which humans and dogs are both part, in the past through
natural selection, and in the future probably including more direct
intervention, the dog is not so far from us after all. Evolutionarily, how
far from dumb dog to sentient dog? Does that make an ethical difference to
an SI? Should it make a difference to us?

The principles do not seem to be enough to constrain an ethical system;
they do not form a set of ethical axioms or constrain the basis for
extropian ethics. They certainly have ethical content, but this content
deals more with desirability of different things than the core
"mechanics" of an ethical system. 

Personally I would say that this is not a flaw. Extropianism rather
inherits the ethical underpinnings of its parent philosophies of
libertarianism and humanism (a kind of philosophical object
inheritance); it is compatible with most versions of them, and does not
as expressed in the principles have to redo all the immense work that
has been done on expressing ethics and politics elsewhere. It is a bit
like how Robert Nozick simply starts _Anarchy, State, Utopia_ by simply
assuming certain rights - the book is not about deriving them, it is
what conclusions can be made *after* they have been derived. 

One can try combining different ethical theories with extropianism and
see what happens. I would say that utilitarianism and extropianism are
not a very successful combination; such an extropian utilitarianism
would either have to be based on maximizing extropy or have to show that
increasing personal extropy and increasing utility are identical. In any
case it would tend to run over indiviuals in the pursuit of
maximization, and it seems hard to combine with the self organization
principle in the old version of the principles. A rights based form of
extropianism seems far more consistent, although we still have to find a
derivation of rights that convinces.

You have expressed an aversion to deontology before but I that is the most
natural and common defence of rights. I argue for a consquentialist form of
a (neo-) Aristotelian ethic of Perfectionism in "Absolute Perfectionism"
http://www.markalanwalker.com/abso.htm . Perfectionism is more
individualistic than say a utilitarian form of conquentialism in that the
pursuit of perfection is something that the individual must actively pursue
rather than passively receive. There is no end to what we might due for
others in on the classic utilitarian model, for a perfectionist we can at
best provide individuals the preconditions for the pursuit of their own
perfection. However, I don't know how extropianism sits with perfectionism,
e.g., perfectionism still has scope for other regarding virtues rather than
the virtue of selfishness, I don't know how this sits with Extropianism.
Perhaps such virtues are considered gratuitous since we can always count on
the invisible hand to catch those who stumble.

Good point, Dave.  And yes, it was remarkably painful.

Supposing that the speed of the van when it struck me could be specified (I 
understand that we do not have sufficient data to derive this speed), what 
could you say then?  Suppose, for example, that the van was moving at, say, 
10 mph.  How would the result change if it were moving at, say 20 mph? 30 mph?

Thanks!

But doesn't Extropianism give us a handle by which to judge the
desirability of different world outcomes?  And doesn't this, in itself,
constitute an ethical framework?

It is true that it does tell us how to get there.  Even if we agree that
extropy is a desirable goal, we may not agree about what are the best
practical decisions on a day to day basis.

I am not so comfortable thinking that we can graft conventional
libertarianism onto Extropianism, or that we can start with libertarian
ethics as a foundation for our Extropian ethical system.  Haven't Max
and others attempted to distance themselves from a strict libertarianism
in order to open the movement to a wider range of political philosophies?

Even in the early days of this list, when most contributors were staunch
Libertarians, we explored outside the libertarian box.  We talked about
private law systems where communists who shared everything could live
and work side by side with capitalists who paid a fine for breathing
the other guy's air.  We looked at forms of anarchy which were well
beyond the libertarian mainstream.  All this was an attempt to further
Extropian goals of self transformation and expansion by giving people
maximum freedom to experiment with interpersonal relations and agreements.

One of the big question marks in the Principles which we did not explore
much is whether they should be seen as collective or individual.  When we
seek to maximize extropy, as defined by the Principles, are we trying
to do so each of us individually for ourselves, or for society and the
world as a whole?  Is my goal a world with maximal extropy, or is it a
world in which I personally have maximized my potentials?  I don't see
the Principles as giving a clear guideline for answering this question.

This is perhaps the most fundamental ethical question we face.  It is
the difference between being generous and being selfish; between being
trustworthy and being a cheat; between being honest and lying for self
benefit.  If I can benefit myself by harming another, without getting
caught, should I do so?  It arguably maximizes my own potentials for
extropy, but also arguably reduces the net extropy for the two of us.

Although Extropianism is often seen as an individualistic philosophy, I
think most of us would agree that from the ethical perspective, we care
about more than our own personal benefit.  We want to see a world where
the potentials promoted by Extropianism are available to as many people
as possible.  I don't know if many of us would go so far as to say that
we would sacrifice ourselves if it increased the net extropy of the world,
but we are far from being dedicated only to our own selfish goals.

Of course in many cases these two extremes do not actually lead to
different strategies for day to day life.  Often we can do good by
doing well.  We behave in a trustworthy and honest and unselfish way,
and in the long run we benefit directly and personally by these actions.
So to some extent we can get away with ignoring the issue.

But then for each of us there will come times when we are tested and
tempted.  You find someone's wallet with money in it; you are carrying a
load of trash to the dump and find a secluded spot where you could toss
it for free; you are offered to join an Internet pyramid scheme which
will inevitably leave the latecomers with severe losses.  Then you have
to decide whether your ethical system is just about you, or about the
world as a whole.

Well, I've thought for a while that having alzheimers just eliminates
the personality that inhabited that brain, but now I'm not so sure. Even
after having a stroke this weekend, and being a bed ridden immobile
mumbler for several years now, when his long (15 years) estranged son
who lives in CA finally called him this morning at 9, he apparently
understood enough that he died two hours later.
Sunday, my cousin visited him and played some of his old 78 records for
him. The Benny Goodman record apparently had an impact, as he started
jerking his shoulders to the music and was popping his mouth with the
drum solo.

Well, I don't get sick at the sight of blood, so I'll probably do
something like call Alcor then cut my wrists or something when the time
comes. What would be nice is to have a do-it-yourself infusion kit to
replace your blood with a cryoprotectant while the cryoteam is on its
way. When they show up, you are all packed and lubed...

To me, the pursuit of perfection would imply a process with a beginning & an
end for each individual. Extropianism seems to imply a process of unbounded
improvement, ie: a beginning but no end. This would seem to be a significant
incompatibility.

Further, your Absolute Perfectionism seems to imply an absolute standard of
perfection. This is completely contrary to the "self transformation" ethic
in transhumanism, which would encourage diversity, not sameness.

Really, I find the perfectionist ideal to be overly negative. We would be
defined in terms of what we have failed to attain, rather than who we are.

Subject: URGENT! Full-page ad in USA Today?
From: Libertarian Party Announcements <owner-announce@lp.org>
Reply-To: owner-announce@lp.org
X-Mailer: Unknown (No Version)

Dear Libertarian:

Would you like to spit in the eye of America's biggest Drug Warrior?

Would you like to prove to millions of Americans that the latest
government Drug War propaganda isn't just wrong -- it STINKS like a
rotting fish?

Would you like to garner nationwide publicity for the Libertarian
Party? Perhaps even get us on the nightly news?

We have an opportunity to do all that. But only if we raise $69,800 by
Friday.

That's a lot of money, but the potential pay-off is huge.

When you hear our bold plan -- and SEE what we propose -- I think
you'll agree.

In fact, I think you'll laugh out loud with delight.

First, some background.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has launched a new
advertising campaign that attempts to link drugs with terrorism.

The campaign got underway with two TV ads during the Super Bowl. The
cost to taxpayers: $3.4 million!

One of the ads, which pretended to show terrorists buying weapons,
asked: "Where do terrorists get their money? If you buy drugs, some of
it might come from you."

In the other ad, young people made matter-of-fact statements like, "I
helped kill a judge."

The ads were so outrageous that we issued a press release calling them
"Super Bowloney."

We noted: "For the Office of National Drug Control Policy to claim that
drug users are to blame for financing terrorists is like a maniac who
kills his parents, and then throws himself on the mercy of the court
because he is an orphan."

We said: "The fact is, the War on Drugs CAUSES the very problem these
ads complain about. It turns ordinary, cheap plants like marijuana and
poppies into fantastically lucrative black market products. The War on
Drugs enriches terrorists, finances violence, and makes America less
safe."

Unfortunately, ONDCP bureaucrats don't read our press releases. Or just
don't care about the truth.

Last week, they rolled out the print version of the campaign, with
full-page ads in 293 newspapers around the USA.

One ad shows a young woman's face. The text reads: "Last week, I washed
my car, hung out with a few friends, and helped murder a family in
Colombia."

The bottom of the ad says: "Drug money helps support terror. Buy drugs
and you could be supporting it too."

Unbelievable!

The ad ignores the fact that the War on Drugs -- and the black markets
it spawns -- drives up the price of illegal drugs by as much as 17,000%
(according to the Hoover Institution).

Without the War on Drugs, there would be no link between drugs and
terrorism, and the financial engine that fuels many terrorist
organizations would sputter to a halt.

 (At the end of this message, I'll give you a link to the ONDCP ads,
and you can see them for yourself. I don't want you to think we're
exaggerating.)

The ONDCP's strategy is clear: It's trying to take the September 11-
inspired hatred of terrorists, and use it to bolster the failing War on
Drugs.

And, by implication, it's suggesting that if you oppose the War on
Drugs, you help terrorists.

Well, we hate terrorists, too. In fact, we hate them so much we'd like
to squeeze their funding down to almost ZERO.

We'd like to see the $40 million the U.S. government says the Taliban
raised from heroin dwindle down to a FEW PENNIES. We'd like to see the
$300 million that Colombian rebels raised from cocaine shrink down to a
HANDFUL OF PESOS.

Can you imagine how destitute terrorists would be if marijuana sold for
the same price as lettuce? If poppies were worth the same as tulips?
And if cocaine-producing coca plants were no more valuable than
Brussels sprouts?

If the War on Drugs did not artificially inflate their prices by
17,000%, that's exactly what would happen. And many terrorists would be
penniless.

We Libertarians understand that. We know the War on Drugs gives
terrorists the money they use to kill Americans.

But how do we get that message across?

How do we reach the American people -- when those full-page ONDCP ads
are spreading lies and distortions?

Then we had a brainstorm: We'll create our OWN ad.

And that's what we did.

At first glance, it looks just like the ONDCP ad.

But in OUR ad, the face of Drug Czar John Walters is staring out.

And OUR text says...

"This week, I had lunch with the President, testified before Congress,
and helped funnel $40 million in illegal drug money to groups like the
Taliban."

Bang. We take the Drug Warriors' ad -- and throw it right back in their
faces.

At the bottom, our ad says: "The War on Drugs boosts the price of
illegal drugs by as much as 17,000% -- funneling huge profits to
terrorist organizations. If you support the War on Drugs or vote for
the politicians who wage it, you're helping support terrorism." We give
a website address for more information.

Can you imagine John Walters' reaction when he sees our ad?

Can you imagine the squawks of outrage from the Drug Warriors?

The ad is ready to go. At the end of this message, I'll give you a link
so you can see it for yourself.

We want to run it in two newspapers: USA Today and the Washington
Times.

USA Today reaches 2.1 million people. It's the nation's most widely
read newspaper.

The Washington Times has a circulation of only 105,000. But, as the
capital's "conservative" newspaper, it reaches EVERY Republican House
and Senate member.In fact, it's one of the six newspapers President
George W. Bush reads each day.

Can you imagine President Bush's face when he sees our ad staring at
him from the pages of the Washington Times?

When the ad runs, we'll shift into overdrive to try to leverage it into
ADDITIONAL news coverage.

We'll fax copies of the ad to major media around the country. We'll
tell them: "The Drug War Debate Is On!"

We'll challenge journalists to ask John Walters for a comment -- or to
debate us on talk shows.

If we do it right, our ads could generate twice as much "free" media
coverage as they cost to run.

But the ads won't be cheap. It will cost $60,350 to run it in USA
Today. And $9,450 for the Washington Times.

That's a total of $69,800. We plan to run the ad next Tuesday, so we
can capitalize on the awareness of the original ads. That's the
quickest we can rush into print -- which means we need to raise the
money by this FRIDAY, so we can submit the ad to the newspapers for
approval. (They require a two-day notice.)

Now, here's the best part of the plan.

Newspapers must approve ads before they run. Our advertisement -- with
its in-your-face message and audacious take-off of the ONDCP ad -- may
get rejected by USA Today as "too controversial."

It may get rejected by the Washington Times because it's in direct
opposition to their pro-Drug War editorial stance.

Great. We hope the ads get rejected.

If they do, we have a chance to create a FIRESTORM of controversy.

Remember the TV coverage Ralph Nader got when he ran a MasterCard spoof
ad during his presidential campaign -- and got sued by the credit card
company?

Remember the media coverage PETA got when it ran billboards of nude
models with the caption: "I'd rather go naked than wear fur"?

Remember the slew of articles that resulted when David Horowitz's ad
arguing against slavery reparations was rejected by several college
newspapers?

We have a chance to do the same thing. We have an opportunity to get
pundits and columnists debating OUR ad.

If our ad is rejected by either newspaper, we'll immediately get on the
phone to OTHER newspapers. (They love hearing about "censorship"
involving rival newspapers.)

We'll blast a press release to the major TV networks, charging the two
newspapers with "suppressing political dissent."

We'll send a copy of the rejected ad to John Walters at the Office of
National Drug Control Policy -- and dare him to comment.

If we can get Walters to take the bait -- and attack our ad or question
our arguments -- then the firestorm will begin.

It will be the Libertarians versus the Drug Warriors.

It could land us on national television -- since there's nothing the
media loves more than a good, juicy controversy.

Then, we'll take the money we raised and try to run the ad in two other
major newspapers. And see if we can turn that into even more attention.

Can we guarantee that we'll get mountains of media coverage? Of course
not. It depends on what other news is going on, what the ONDCP does,
and other factors beyond our control.

But if we DON'T run the ad -- if we don't take chances -- we'll NEVER
get that kind of national coverage.

If you don't swing for the fences, you won't hit a home run.

This nervy ad could be OUR home run.

But only if we raise $69,800 by Friday.

If we raise the money, we'll submit the ads to USA Today and the
Washington Times, to run on Tuesday, February 26. (Not on Monday,
because Congress is off on Mondays.)

If the newspapers AGREE to run it, we'll let you know. And we'll blast
out thousands of press releases promoting the ad on Tuesday morning.

If the newspapers REJECT the ads, we'll let you know. And we'll blast
out thousands of press releases, promoting the controversy, as soon as
we hear their decision.

The ad is already produced, and ready to go. Click here to view it in

Click here to view the original ONDCP ads, so you can see what a clever
satire our ad is: www.mediacampaign.org/mg/print.html

Or click here to donate immediately:
http://www.lp.org/contribute?prog=drugwarad

EVERY PENNY we raise from this message will go to run the ad. We wrote,
designed, and produced the ad in-house, so there are no additional
fees.

EVERY PENNY you donate will put our advertisement in front of 2.2
million Americans, and smack-dab in the faces of the Drug Warriors.

EVERY PENNY you donate will send the message: The Drug War Debate Is
On!

Click here to donate: http://www.lp.org/contribute?prog=drugwarad

If everyone who gets this message donates just $10, we'll have more
than enough money to run the ad. Unfortunately, not everyone will. So,
could you contribute $50? Or $100? That will help cover the cost of
those who don't donate, and put us that much closer to the $69,800 we
need.

In fact, since this ad doesn't involve federal candidates, there are no
contribution limits. You can legally donate any amount you want.

We don't want to pressure you. Look at the ad again. Think about what
it's worth to you to be able to buy a copy of USA Today next Tuesday
and see YOUR ad. Then, donate whatever you think is appropriate.

This is our chance to strike back. To raise the blood pressure of
America's most bullheaded Drug Warriors. And to get our message out to
2.2 million Americans.

You can help. Just click here to donate:
http://www.lp.org/contribute?prog=drugwarad

Thank you,

Ron Crickenberger, Libertarian Party Political Director

PS: Remember, if we raise the money, you'll see the ad in USA Today
next Tuesday, February 26.

You'll see the SAME ad in the SAME newspaper that will land with a thud
in the White House and in the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Or, the newspapers may REJECT our ad. In which case, we'll work hard to
turn it into a national controversy that generates news articles, talk
radio debate, and perhaps even national TV coverage.

Either way, your support will make it happen. EVERY dollar you
contribute goes directly to pay for the ads. Just click here:
http://www.lp.org/contribute?prog=drugwarad.

Thank you!

P.P.S. Please pass this message on to friends, family members, and
other people you know personally who might be interested, but please
don't send it indiscriminately -- spam will only hurt our campaign.

Well, if the striking vehicle was the same mass as the stricken vehicle,
then the resulting velocity would not exceed half of the striking
vehicles moving velocity. Then figure in the energy absorbed by 'crush
zones' in both vehicles that are crushed by the impact. Figure it as
somewhere between 10-17.5 mph, both vehicles being of equal mass.

True, but the fact is that the extropian principles DO, in fact
recognise that there are physical limits on the human animal, imposed by
evolution, gravity, and other physical laws. We just believe that our
intelligence gives us the ability to exceed or overcome them as we see
fit.

The fact that the principles recognise the existence of limits to break
implies that extropy recognises the existence of these objective limits.

Max and others have distanced themselves from big L libertarianism in
relation to ExI, but looking at the ExI reading list reflects how
significant small l libertarian thinkers have been on the formation of
the principles.

Well, yes, but allowing communists to play their games in a commie
enclave within a greater libertarian plenum is not bending over to or
subsuming an overall libertarian perspective in the name of
multiculturalism. Tolerance is not the same as moral equivalence.

I have been wondering why so many of the world's most powerful religions 
seem to have been born around the same time. It seems to me that many of 
the big religions got much of their power from the birth of writing.

There would have been a special awe for written works back then when the 
technology was still new. We tend to overlook this in our world where 
written knowledge is commonplace. In those days the idea that knowledge 
could be passed on without a human carrying it would have seemed magical. 
Up until then all knowledge required a live human to pass it on. Suddenly 
these magic symbols can carry the thoughts and knowledge of dead or distant 
people! It would have seemed especially magical to those who couldn't read.

Unfortunately that awe for symbols has stayed attached to some of those 
early books that represented themselves as divine or magical. People who 
are gullible enough to accept the religion meme without question -- on 
faith -- anachronistically revere what was once revolutionary technology.

Ironic.

Best wishes,

So change the definition of perfection. Plato, as far as I'm concerned, was wrong and there is no absolute 
definition of anything. A few years ago I encountered the idea that perfection = stasis = death; which caused a 
shift to perfection = perpetual progress (in more words than that, but might as well use the Extropian 
principle!). I would definitely consider myself a perfectionist, just my definition of perfection includes 
change and never arrives at one static point.

Let's get sytematic about this- first, we calculate the velocity change
of Jerome's mini-van in the intial collision:  this is an inelastic
collision that conserves momentum:

m1*v1 + m2*v2 = (m1+m2)v3

using american provincial units

m1= 3000 lbm
v1= 0 ft/s

m2= 4000 lbm
v2= 35 mph *22/15 ft/s/mph = 51 ft/s
m2v2 = 204000 lbm-ft/s
m1+m2 = 7000 lbm   then

v3 = 29.1 ft/s, about 20 mph  The mini van slowed the other vehicle
substantially

Thus the doorframe hit him at about the same speed as falling from 12.5
feet up; a very serious hit indeed.

The combined 7000 lb vehicles then accelerated him up to essentially the
same speed; the second collison is (204000 lbm-ft/s)/7220 lbm = 28.25
ft/s final velocity (neglecting friction on the ice).

The energy imparted to Jerome's body in the impact was mv^2/2, but we
must use slugs mass to get the units to work properly-

E= 220/32.2 * 28.25^2 /2 = 2727 ft-lb

Guessing at the distance over which the acceleration took place at about
.5 ft (human bodies are squishy), the force was about 5500 lbf and he
pulled about 25 gees.  Ouch, indeed.  I hope you're recovering well.

As a first cut at it we can assume all of the collisions are elastic
and frictionless.  This is not a very good estimate since cars are
designed to crumple and absorb energy, and you're not made of rubber
either, but can give us a ballpark figure.

When the 4000 pound car travelling at 35 mph hits the 3000 pound minivan,
if the collision were elastic and no energy was lost in the crushing
metal, the result would be the minivan going at 40 mph.

When this 40 mph minivan then hits your 220 pound body, the result is
you getting bounced forward at a speed of 75 mph!

If you figure the minivan is going slower, it will still be approximately
true that you are given an impact which would send you forward at almost
twice the minivan speed, if you were made of rubber.

Most of this impact is absorbed by your body and represents energy
imparted to you.  So you take the minivan speed after the collision,
multiply by about 1.8 to get your velocity, then do 1/2 * m * v^2 to
get the energy you received.

If you figure the minivan was really going maybe only 20 mph after the
collision then you'd be given an impact which would send you off at
about 37 mph, essentially all of which energy gets absorbed by your
body both when the minivan hits it and when you fall to the ground.

Converting to metric units, this is a velocity of about 13.5 m/s and
a mass of 100 kg, for a total of about 13700 Joules of energy.

The main concern of the paper is to contrast human perfection with the
ambition to move in the direction of a godlike perfection. Perfectionists
typically define the ideal of perfection in terms of perfecting one's human
nature. For transhumanists this looks quaint, given that human nature is
malleable. In the vernacular, the essay contrast an ethic which takes the
development of human nature as the ideal and an ethic which takes the ideal
to become posthuman. So on this point I think we are at cross purposes. In
"What is Transhumanism? What is a Transhumanist?"
(www.markalanwalker.com/what.htm) I distinguish between type and attribute
perfection. The former is the ideal of being an excellent example of say a
species, a perfect monkey, a perfect human, etc. Most perfectionist (e.g.,
Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, Marx, etc.) think in terms of type perfection. I
argue that attribute perfection makes more sense for transhumanists:
musicians might seek to improve their musicality attribute, philosophers
their wisdom, etc. In terms of diversity it is a little premature to say. If
it is possible for each of us to embody complete perfection that is, to have
all worthwhile attributes then, I certainly don't have a problem if others
want to join me in being perfect in all worthwhile ways. (My kids have a
different set of values: this would be an instance of being a copycat,
punishable in all sorts of unspeakable ways). Whether it is possible to
develop our attributes or develop new ones in an unbounded way is to my mind
an empirical conjecture. Take intelligence for example. Some physicists
think we are close to discoverying a final theory of everything. A
consequence of this it seems that even a guy with the brain the size of
jupiter would not be able to improve on this theoretical conceptualization
of the fundamental laws of physics. (Not to mention the practical problems:
like where to buy a hat). Others think that a guy with a brain the size of
jupiter would find more things in heaven and earth than our dreamed of in
our string theory. You seem to assume that the latter is always the case.
Maybe, maybe not. (See www.markalanwalker.com/natu.htm for details on the
experimental protocol.)

What can I say? Ethics is a boo-hoo subject. One of the attractions of
perfectionism to me is that it makes sense of our life as a project: I have
achieved a certain level of excellence but have a ways to go. Thankfully, I
still have sometime left. For a utilitarian a life would be measured in
having distributed so many units of pleasure (happiness, satisfactions,
etc.). For a deontologist it would be having saluted so many categorical
imperatives and failing to heed this many more.

You could estimate it if you knew the mass of the car that hit you.
Remember that in a collision momentum is conserved.  The mass
of your van times its velocity plus the mass of the car times its
velocity (after the crunch) equals the precrunch velocity of the
car times its mass.  Energy was not conserved in the collision:
most of the car's kinetic energy went into bending metal and
making the crunch noise.

How far did you fly after the van hit you?  Thats the easiest way
to estimate the momentum transfer.  spike

Point-'n'-Shoot Sound Makes Waves
By John Gartner

2:00 a.m. Feb. 21, 2002 PST

Those voices in your head may be real.

Researchers have developed technology that can project a beam of sound so
narrow that only one person can hear it. "Directed" audio sounds like it's
coming from right in front of you even when transmitted from a few hundred
meters away.

Inventors of the new "ventriloquist" technology say it could provide an
added dimension to entertainment. The military, however, is investigating
using it to confuse opponents or even inflict pain.



The Audio Spotlight is one of two competing audio transmission systems that
emit a one-foot square column of sound that can only be heard by people in
its direct path. Joseph Pompei, a PhD student at the MIT Media Lab, decided
to develop it while working at audio company Bose, which he joined at 16 as
its youngest-ever engineer.

Pompei, who used to play jazz trumpet in nightclubs in Chicago, became
interested in how sound systems reproduce and distribute music. He thought
it would be cool to "choreograph sound just like you would dancers on
stage."

Pompei imagined that instead of loudspeakers blaring the same cacophony of
instruments to all parts of the room, it would be more interesting to
selectively spotlight the soloist to the left side of the audience, while
featuring the percussion up front, and then switching them around.

"Sound in real life is occurring all around you. Regular speakers only go so
far in reproducing an accurate environment," Pompei said.

Pompei developed the first demonstration systems of the technology for
installations at Sega's Joyopolis theme park in Tokyo and the Boston Museum
of Science, and he's planning to start selling it commercially soon. He said
museums like the system because visitors who stand in front of an exhibit
can hear the appropriate audio track without being distracted by sound from
other displays.

The Audio Spotlight transmitters range from several inches in diameter to
about 20 inches and generate a column of sound between one to three degrees
wider than the transmitter.

The technology could also be used to prevent fights over the car's radio
tuner, Pompei said. He put several Audio Spotlights in a concept truck from
Chrysler, which enabled passengers to hear their own radio stations -- the
kids in the back seat enjoyed heavy metal while the parents relaxed to
elevator music. "It could make for much happier trips," he said.

The Audio Spotlight converts ordinary audio into high-frequency ultrasonic
signals that are outside the range of normal hearing. As these sound waves
push out from the source, they interact with air pressure to create audible
sounds.

Pompei said the "non-linear" effect of air pressure modifies sound waves in
a consistent fashion. He wrote algorithms that "reverse-engineered" the
desired sound waves to determine the appropriate ultrasonic source signals.

According to University of Texas professor David Blackstock, high-frequency
signals are easier to focus, and control like a flashlight, than sounds that
are within the human range of hearing, which disperse in all directions.
Blackstock said ultrasonic signals "decay more slowly than lower-frequency
waves" so they are easier to send farther.

The Audio Spotlight emits sounds in the 60-kilohertz range, which, according
to Blackstock, is well above the 20-KHz limit of human hearing.

Blackstock said the first experiments to use ultrasonic sounds were
conducted underwater in the 1960s, and Japanese researchers made advances in
the 1980s but were unable to create a commercial application for the
technology.

Pompei said Audio Spotlights are currently being installed in Australia for
the upcoming Fringe Festival. Pompei started Holosonic Research Labs to sell
Audio Spotlights to corporations such as Kraft and Kodak, which are in the
process of integrating them into information kiosks and retail displays.

An alternative to Pompei's invention, which also may be commercially
available soon, is American Technology's Hypersonic Sound System. The HSS
system similarly converts audio into ultrasonic sound waves, and Blackstock
was impressed by a demonstration.

Blackstock said he heard a clear signal at about 100 meters, but then heard
nothing by moving two steps out of the audio's path. "It's remarkable, a
spectacular effect."

American Technology president Terry Conrad said the company is going into
its first mass production of chips that convert the audible sounds into
ultrasonic waves in February.

American Technology recently signed an agreement with the U.S. Army to
develop the technology for a decidedly non-commercial use: psychological
warfare.

According to American Technology CTO Jim Croft, the technology could be used
to confuse opponents by making them think there was someone nearby. Small
transmitters could be kept out of sight, and ghost sounds could be bounced
off "rocks or any reflective surface" to fool people into believing they
were not alone.

American Technology is also working on a stronger version of the technology
called Directed Stick Radiator, Croft said. This "acoustic assault rifle" is
shaped like a gun, but instead of bullets, it dispenses high-decibel sounds
that would cause discomfort or even pain.

Croft said the company is developing prototypes of the debilitating weapon
that could be mounted on a jeep and used for crowd control. "It could be a
very effective first-level deterrent," he said.

Pompei, conversely, is happy to make music, not war, with his system. He
said U2's Bono is a fan of the Audio Spotlight and recently flew him to Los
Angeles to measure the acoustics during a Staples Center performance.

He would prefer that others adopt his invention to returning to the stage
himself. "I make a much better scientist than musician."

<P>The article focuses specificly on infertility &amp; the development of exowombs.Most of the replies posted so far also share this focus, but I'm not quite sure why. I think exowombs are a remarkable scientific achievement, but I wonder about some much more interesting possibilities for this technology (ie- possible applications in space colonization?) I'm not too scientifically knowledgable, so perhaps you all can help me out: Why is this fertility issue being pushed? Why does the development of this technology have to be contextualized, so limited only to the area of fertility? Is it because science can make money out of it this way? Is it all about the money? Or are scientists aware that the only way they can make any real progress with this controversial technology IS to have a market for it? Is the fertility thing just a cover, a means to an end? I'd be really interested&nbsp;to hear some fresh ideas from others on the list.<BR></P>
<P>I guess my whole gripe with the fertility issue goes back to a global population concern. Well okay maybe it really goes back even further to a local population concern. I returned to the city where I was raised this week to visit my&nbsp;family.&nbsp;Even though I've only been in the "country" (rural NW Mass.)&nbsp;for 2 months, I was shell shocked when I returned to Providence. Its not that its a big city by any means&nbsp;- its actually&nbsp;very&nbsp;tiny (size, buildings, etc.) but there are just SO many people everywhere, its suffocating. RI is the 2nd most densely populated state in the US&nbsp;and also the smallest geographically (*not a good combination). I remember it being pretty bad before, which is why I left. But you don't realize or you forget how crowded it is when you live there because you&nbsp;simply get used to it. And its only gotten worse.&nbsp;Going back after 5 years, I realized that it is NOT something I want to have to "get used to."<BR></P>
<P>Here's a link from a quick google that comes from the US census bureau -&nbsp;"Total Midyear Population for the World: 1950-2050"&nbsp; <A href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html">http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html</A></P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>This says the current world population is 6.2 billion. While the growth rate is projected to decrease steadily, the total population is nevertheless expected to reach 7 billion by the year 2013, 8 billion by 2028, and 9 billion by 2048. I don't know what the planet's maximum capacity is (maybe we already passed it?) but even still, to me&nbsp;these figures look rather... yuckie.</P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>I don't know much about population trends but I'm really curious &amp; (as with everything else) I have lots of questions: How do they formulate global population projections?

For these reasons, I cannot&nbsp;speak&nbsp;to&nbsp;the validity of this source&nbsp;- I simply do not know.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;The list has previously discussed the possibility that we

<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the average lifespan at a rate of greater than one year per year.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;I'd be very surprised if the specific gene isn't pulled out within

<DIV></DIV>&gt;the next year. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Now, given the genetic technologies I expect will develop within

<DIV></DIV>&gt;this decade, there is a reasonable chance that we will be able 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to give everyone the benefits of the Methuselah gene. If so 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;we will be bumping average longevity from ~75 to ~90 within 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this decade, or ~15 years / decade. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;If that proves to be the case, then the expected longevity of 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;everyone on the list under the age of ~65 just became *much* 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;greater! 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Okay so if the global population is already projected to fly off the charts, AND we have all this wonderful scientific progress in fertility (on a planet that's already too densely populated), AND our life expectancy is predicted to increase continuously, couldn't this be a problem? So&nbsp;if there are more babies in addition to longer lifespans, wouldn't the population density be even higher?&nbsp; Does anyone else&nbsp;see a problem with this? To be honest, it kind of scares me -&nbsp;I get anxiety attacks just going out to the shopping mall on a Saturday afternoon. Too many people!!!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm all for the prospect of&nbsp;an extended human lifespan. But it makes me&nbsp;crazy to think about people spending so much time, energy &amp; money on&nbsp;making their "own" biological child when there are so many children already here (for adoption)&nbsp;that need homes &amp; loving families. To me, this whole compulsion of biological heredity is irrational. Why are we&nbsp;investing so much energy trying to make more people - we already have too many! Why not spend more time improving&nbsp;the quality of life for the ones&nbsp;who are already here?&nbsp;I realize I might be missing something here - perhaps its because I'm much&nbsp;too young &amp; I don't have children, but I just don't understand.

There are several Brits on the list, so perhaps help here:

If they drive on the left in Britain and on the right in France,
in the chunnel how do they switch the lanes over?  Is there
an overpass or something?  Is there a sign telling the drivers
to wake up and pay attention?  Do they have a problem
with drunken proles forgetting which country they are in
and skewering some hapless wretch head on?  spike

Yeah, it's odd. I must be a crypto deontologist, via residual childhood
programming, although I tell myself I'm a rule utilitarian. A former
grrlfriend once informed me merrily about an acquaintance who, I dunno,
somehow activated an ATM withdrawal with the wrong PIN and got several
hundred dollars, which she kept; my friend made it clear she'd do the same
in a trice. I was taken aback. 

`You mean some poor anonymous bugger lost some of their savings, and you'd
do the same thing?' 

`Oh geddalife, the bank would compensate the original owner.' 

`Of course they wouldn't, why would they believe it had been an error? I
mean, Jesus, if you found a *wallet* outside the bank and had the chance to
run off with several hundred bucks, would you do so?' 

`Of course I would. Are you mad?' 

It was the beginning of the end for a beautiful relationship, now that I
look back on that moment...

Hi,

although the idea of a currency based on energy started as a joke (or what seems like it) on the Extropians group, I think it has
some validity as a currency system.


Since we can quantify energy quite easily, I think we can seriously consider a currency based on energy. A currency based on
apparently valuable things like gold and silver would rely too much on subjective valuing and one based on a government can prove
unreliable.

I suggest that we base our measures on something quantifiable and based in the "real" world, and immutable to change and as immune
from politics as possible. Energy seems to fulfil this creiteria, thanks to no small measure by the Laws of Thermodynamics.


We can consider the price of a process or a product equivalent to the amount of energy needed to produce it. Let's take the original
value of everything as nil, the potential energy value as 100% and then as we do something to it (like building cars, houses and
space colonies) we transfer the potential value to our own use.

The universe would act as our natural resource for us to convert energy from one form to another, extracting utility from it while
degarding it by decreasing its future utility. When "mining" energy, high entropy energy (such as heat) has lesser or nil prices,
and low entropy ones like visible light commands a higher price. Energy density varies minute from microwave radiation, small from
oil combustion to 100% from antimatter.


As we develop more and more advanced technology, our productivity increases both by evolution (such as increased productivity by
doing more with less) and revolution (by attaining things that previously we cannot do). Our energy economy would increase in size
along with at least technological and population factors.

With the advanced technology of the future, we might realise Einstein's E=MC^2 for almost all kinds of matter (perhaps except those
trapped in black holes). When that happens, you will have to pay a lot more for atoms than for normal energy, so make sure you hoard
some matter (like your own body) today.


Have a nice day.

Good points.

And the issue also comes up when influencing (or determining) the
ethical system of your children (or of an AI.)  Do you tell your kids
"look out for Number One, but keep in mind that's often best served by
being Good"?  Or do we try to instill reflexes of honesty and doing the
right thing without reconsidering things selfishly?

All the more so for an AI with real self-expanding potential.  Do you
risk making a Blight, or go for a Mind?

Hmm.  I wonder if that's a way of cutting through ethical debates.  Drop
overly abstract Rawlsian scenarios and ask what ethics you'd teach your
kids or AIs.  Or what ethics you'd hope others were teaching _their_
kids or AIs.

"Codified physical law"?  I'd like to see some support for that.

It was an extropian on this list -- Dave Krieger? dv/dt? -- who pushed
me from believing in "natural rights" (with severe qualms, since I
couldn't imagine how to possibly get someone like Stalin or Hitler to
take them seriously) to viewing rights as a social contract, which
amounts to a social fiction.

The social fictions have consequences, mind you; it's not as if ethics
can be chosen willy-nilly.  But they're hardly determined, or guaranteed
to be pleasant in all circumstances, and they're not necessarily
self-enforcing in a human lifespan.

I think one way to reconcile these views is that you can be a lazy
utilitarian.  You don't have time to analyze each and every moral
quandary down to the last possible ramification of your actions.
So you adopt general rules of thumb, heuristics which are a good guide
to ethical behavior.  These include principles of generosity, kindness,
fairness, honesty and so on.  History has shown that adopting such views
(combined with a sense of justice and willingness to apply retribution
where necessary) is a very successful long-term strategy.

This way you can adopt a general policy of being fair and honest,
because it's too much work to try to judge for each situation whether
you can get away with cheating.

I think this works pretty well unless you run into a situation where
you would have a chance to make a really substantial unfair gain at
someone else's expense.  Then you might not be able to justify using
your default rule because the stakes are so high, and a utilitarian
might behave unjustly when presented with such a strong temptation.

However, realistically such opportunities seldom arise, and the fact is
that even someone ethically devoted to unselfishness would be forced
into some pretty heavy soul-searching in that case.  So I'm not sure
how meaningful such an extreme example really is.

Let's face it, HTML in email is unnecessary, a security risk, and simply
impolite. At some point in the near future people who contact me with
HTML-only email will get back a polite canned reply on why HTML in email
is bad, and how to configure their MUAs to switch it off.

I'm surprised we have at all to discuss this. I thought the debates were
all over many years ago. What next, MS Word .doc attachments?

I believe that's what `rule utilitarian' means--one who uses general
heuristics to shortcut decisions, in the awareness that these rules can and
should be mutable according to circumstance and new information. I was just
noticing that some of my moral qualms seem more firmly wired than that, and
I suspect that this will be true of us all.

Open-ended AI is automatically a Blight. Even if friendliness was a

I don't see that.

We have a large body of written works from the ancient Greeks.
>From them, we learned our earliest ideas of free market, democracy,
technology, free speech, individualism, just to name a few. Perhaps
other cultures at that time such as the Etruscans were also forming
those concepts,  but we don't have a written record of their
daily life to know.

The religion for those Greeks were Apollo, Delphi's Oracle, and
a collection of gods and goddesses. Those didn't survive through
time as 'powerful' religions.

You don't have to get used to it, you've just chosen to locate yourself in
regions that have relatively dense populations.  Part of this is standard
market mechanisms at work.  Many of the most desirable places to live are
heavily populated, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Nonetheless,
there are VAST tracts of usable land that are essentially uninhabited, even
in countries that are nominally highly developed.  Quite frankly, in the
Western Hemisphere it seems that many undesirable places have huge
populations and many desirable places have less than a person per square
mile population density; there are many factors at play as to why people
concentrate where they do.

I think a lot of the concern about overpopulation is based largely on
perception.  It isn't so much that we are over populated as it is that the
population is very poorly and/or unevenly distributed, due to a mixture of
historical, political, and economic reasons.  There are still large regions
of the United States where one can drive a hundred kilometers between
houses, never mind towns, particularly west of the Rocky Mountains in the
Lower 48 and in Alaska.  The same is true of most of Canada.  I have little
doubt that North America could easily and safely support 2 billion people
given the necessity and without utterly destroying the environment.  If you
lived in Southern California or the Bay Area (like I do) for example, the
world really does seem overpopulated, but the reality is that just east of
those very densely populated areas is a thousand miles of land where the
population density approaches zero.  I guess you could consider it a kind of
sample selection bias.

As for me, I love wide open spaces without a trace of civilization.  And if
you've ever been to those places, it is fairly evident that there is
relatively little chance of them becoming overrun with civilization any time
soon.  Most people *like* living in dense urban/suburban environments.

Damn skippy.  My email client has a de-HTML-ize button which strips out the
HTML and creates sane ASCII email.  The nice thing is that when I sanitize a
reply to an HTML email, the opposing client generally keeps it plaintext.

I've had mail clients with full support for HTML for years, but I've never
understood the value of it; half the time the result is ass ugly and looks
worse than terminal font.  Of course, it still remains to be determined if
this is because some senders have bad taste in formatting or whether these
things are sometimes rendered in ugly mode by broken HTML display code.

Cheers,

The quick-and-dirty reply is - it's about you.  Of course, there could be
extenuating situations ... you are dying of starvation, you find a wallet -
you decide to "borrow" a few bucks for food (saying to yourself, as soon as
you get some grub, you can think about getting a job, and repaying the
money).

Throughout my life I've found a few wallets and have always returned them to
their owners.  It never even occurred for me not to.  It's always a steeper
price ... to sell your integrity out over a few bucks, yes?

I'm not certain how the "world as a whole" fits into the finding-a-wallet
scenario -- oh, but wait ... there are the likes of Kenneth Lay, whose
selfish antics are having far-reaching effects not unlike stealing money out
of ALL our wallets (via the stock market, our IRAs, 401-Ks and the like).

I'm a crypto, too.  When my children were young, I cannot tell you how many
parents I observed who thought it was all right to lie about how old their
children were - to sneak them into movie theaters and such at a reduced
price.  I didn't think this set a very good example.  It may be a minor
thing, but I've never figured out where one draws the line (although I can
imagine circumstances where I would lie my head off and consider it quite
ethical - e.g., in some variation of a "Sophie's Choice" dilemma, or in
harboring Anne Frank and her family, pokata ... pokata ... pokata).

Yep, know the feeling.  Luckily (and not accidentally), all three of my
each-quite-different husbands had this one thing in common:  unimpeachable
integrity.  Years after we were divorced, when the IRS gave my last husband
(#2) a return for deductions which were overlooked for taxes during one year
when we were married, he sent me me my share ($3,000 - nice surprise!).  He
could have rationalized keeping the money, I'm sure - and how would I ever
have known?  But he was and is - upstanding (and that's why we're still good
friends).

Actually, without criteria as to what is and is not an increase 
of "extropy" and a better handle on why this is the greatest 
good, I don't see how it gives a way to judge the desirability 
of different outcomes except in a few areas.  To broaden it will 
imo require a broader (more detailed) version of what we wish 
the future to look like and why than is present currently in the 
Extropian community generally.  I think a lot of us are "working 
on it" in our various ways formally and informally.

Generally, the ability to judge relative desirability can only 
exist within a fairly grounded idea of what the good consists of 
and how it applies to various situations.  It is not a 
free-standing ability.  The  to arrive at a choice between 
alternatives is a consequence of an ethical system rather than 
its foundation.

I assume there is a missing "not" in the first sentence. 
Extropy is a quality/capacity not a "goal".  Increasing extropy 
is a goal but not necessarily the only important goal or the one 
that fully subsumes all others.  The 7 Extropian principles are 
qualities and trends mostly and are not sufficient to fully 
flesh out a system of ethics.

Well, "delegation" might be a clearer analogy than "inheritance" 
as we delegate most ethical decisions and general biases to 
something other than what today exists as part of Extropianism. 
    I disagree that immense work has been done on the basis of 
ethical systems.  A lot of work has been done on the basis of 
just assuming a particular set of ethical roots somehow existed 
or made sense or were axiomatic.  As more and more of the root 
context changes we will find that the ethical root presumptions 
must be re-examined and re-grounded.

Me either.  We would be starting something with a shaky 
foundation (true of all current ethical systems not just this 
one) that more or less works given current biases and context 
and expect it to hold when the context shifts rapidly or even to 
guide us in shifting that context.  It is very unlikely to be up 
to the job.

I don't see any way to fully maximize my potential without 
maximizing the potential of the context (the world and other 
people) I find myself within. The boundary between this "self" 
and others appears to me to be more porous than many are 
culturally programmed to believe.

Generous and selfish are not fundamental ethical philosophical 
constructs.  They are quite sloppy and value-laden terms.  The 
beg the more fundamental questions of what the "good" is and to 
what degree it is contextual and so on.  Most of the questions 
in that paragraph are based on free-floating assumptions.

I don't draw that much of a distinction between what is good for

This is not "ignoring the issue".  It is nothing that it is 
quite often a non-issue that human philosophers keep stubbing

Such situations are really not terribly relevant to general 
ethical systems.  However, each of the proposed dilemna is no 
dilemna at all when the costs are worked and implications are 
worked out a few steps further than first inclination.  Of 
course it is needful to have a few supergoals broader than 
immediate seeming gratification.

I am by no means a "left transhuman" - whatever that is (a true Transhuman 
is entirely above human politics except perhaps as an anarchist who 
recognizes all human politics to be barnyard squabbles between primates).

A "right" is a redundant concept.  Once you have identified a so-called 
right (i.e., your "natural physical law"), what have you accomplished by 
calling it a right?  Have you secured it?  Have you gotten anybody to agree 
with it?  Has the human Constitution of the United States protected your 
"rights"?  There are no rights.  There is only "natural physical law" - to 
the degree that our science has identified such.  Most so-called "rights" 
and their derivations are by no means physical law - they are social and 
cultural conventions that vary from nation to nation, race to race, even 
state to state or city to city.  Ayn Rand (from whom I assume you derive 
your philosophy) defined rights as "conditions of existence required by man 
to survive as man".  Again, this is a redundant and useless concept.  In 
Objectivist epistemology, one does not invent concepts without 
purpose.  The purpose of rights appears to be nothing but a fiction 
intended to philosophically coerce others into accepting one's agenda which 
cannot be supported by the realities of human nature and human society.

It is more profitable to deal with physical, social, and especially 
economic realities without regard to vague and manipulatable 
abstractions.  And it is more rational.

You are correct in that humans are not very far from dogs.  However, this 
would have no "ethical" impact on an SI - it might however have a practical 
impact since humans can be distinguished from animals based on their 
capacity (if seldom utilized) of conceptual reasoning and 
imagination.  This distinction is why we also should not care about animal 
rights.  (Note: I do not advocate treating animals "cruelly" since I do not 
believe in engaging in any pointless behavior.)

As someone who would like to become an artist, I can sympathise with your
viewpoint, Vanessa.
I would really like to make money by selling my art (of course, that would
not be my primary purpose),
but no matter how much they offered me I would not sell anything to people
who told me they wanted to
publicly burn my pictures!
Some of my thoughts on the matter:
A contract between artist and buyer in which the buyer gives the artist
access to their work,
and which forbids the buyer from destroying the work?
Keeping the original painting and selling copies of it as posters/greeting
cards etc etc etc?
Leasing the painting for a specified period?

However I cannot agree that art is entirely subjective.
(I am an Objectivist but I dont completely agree with Ayn Rands theories on
art, great artist though she was.
My view is that art has 2 purposes- 1 beauty, 2 to make you think about/look
at things a different way.
IMO Ayn Rands books acheive both.)
Obviously all people have different experiences, different tastes, different
personalities.
All people look at life in slightly different ways. But there are things
which most people
find beautiful.  Example- someone draws a picture depicting a decomposing
corpse, and
another paints a happy person enjoying life.
Very few people would say that the 1st one is more valuable or more
beautiful.
Another example is more biological- most humans of the same sexuality find
the same features attractive,
of course with individual variations of taste and often with a preference
for the same race.
I would find it hard to believe that someone could find a portrait of a
particularly unattractive, deformed,
unhealthy person more beatiful or valuable than a picture of someone who
conforms to a reasonably objective
standard of beauty.
Maybe you think this is narrow-minded, but I think there can be an objective
standard of worth, if not beauty.

The other thing, I cant understand why you think the audience determines the
value of a work.
I only ever draw because I want to, because it is significant to me.
what good is the art, even if noone sees it? The satisfaction and pride that
the artist feels.
Only one sort of art has a particular function to someone other than the
artist, that is architecture.

Philip

Would it not be more extropian to encourage trade in human organs?
I realise this sounds gruesome to many people, but it would
definitely result in increased organ availability. It would be difficult
to effectively police the trade but I think the returns would be worth it.
Peoples selfish instincts are usually much more reliable than their
altruism...

Okay so if the global population is already projected to fly off the charts, AND we have all this wonderful scientific progress in fertility (on a planet that's already too densely populated), AND our life expectancy is predicted to increase continuously, couldn't this be a problem?

To be honest, it kind of scares me - I get anxiety attacks just going out to the shopping mall on a Saturday afternoon. Too many people!!!
(end)

As has already been said, you will see lots of people when living in high population growth regions!  And yet so much of the earth is not populated so there is so much room to grow.  I realize though not every square mile of the planet is optimal for human habitation!  

I think at least for a long time, only the middle-class and better in developed nations will generally have real access to serious life extension tech which really makes a difference in lifespan.  Birthrates in the developed world are already at an all time low.  I don't see these "near-immortals" breeding like rabbits and overpopulating the planet! lol  

A good question in my mind is how radical life extension will coincide with fairly mature nanotech.  I think before we have to worry about an immortal population which greatly overtaxes the earth's resources as we perceive them now, we will have technology to fairly easily handle the population pressures both on and off planet.  I think looking back on things in the year 2040 will see us doing fine in this regard.       

you continue: 
I'm all for the prospect of an extended human lifespan. But it makes me crazy to think about people spending so much time, energy & money on making their "own" biological child when there are so many children already here (for adoption) that need homes & loving families. To me, this whole compulsion of biological heredity is irrational. Why are we investing so much energy trying to make more people - we already have too many! Why not spend more time improving the quality of life for the ones who are already here? I realize I might be missing something here - perhaps its because I'm much too young & I don't have children, but I just don't understand. I'm probably way off the mark with this one so I'm already prepared to get chewed out  :P
(end) 
 
LOL!  I am close with several couples who had extremely hard times trying to adopt children.  It took them years and a lot of money to finally get the chance to bring a child into their home.  So adoption is no easy answer, certainly not with all the red tape and bureaucracy involved.  

I do agree there are many children, especially in the third world, who desperately need to be adopted into good homes.  This is done to an extent, but at nowhere the scale needed.  Again, doing this expensive.

I think a prepared couple having a child of their own that they will love and nurture is a very beautiful and important thing.  I don't see why biological and social motivators for this behavior should be seen as bad, as long as they are kept in perspective.   

In the developed world we do not have too many people!!  This is a very popular myth.  In fact, many developed nations(especially in Europe) are not even producing enough children to simply replace their current population levels!  And believe me, these governments are very aware of the longterm problems they will be facing.  They need young workers to replace the old ones retiring who are now drawing government benefits.  And at least to an extent, a developed nation's size determines their potential economic and political power.

the organs are not as good as young organs, but they are available.
Trade would not really be able to improve on this, at least for
transplants requiring dead donors. It might be helpful when it comes to
kidneys and other organs that can be transplanted from living donors.
Most likely the market value of a heart transplant would be far higher
than the current cost, making many HMOs and socialized health care
systems loath to pay for them. 

Trade can sometimes have paradoxal effects. In Britain they lowered the
pay for blood donations in order to improve the blood quality - many
alcoholics and other addicts were donating blood to pay for their habit,
making much of it substandard. 

Politically this is so far beyond the pale, and strongly resisted by
both bioethicists and the medical community. Getting this kind of idea
through will take quite some time, and will necessarily imply taking a
philosophical, rhetorical and political fight with several established
groups. 

In the long run the only way of handling the organ shortage is
artificial implants, xenografts or tissue engineering. In a way the
organ shortage is speeding the development of these technologies (which
have other benefits from a transhumanist point of view). In an organ
market of course they would be substitutes, and if the price of
transplant reached their equilibrium level there might be more
profitability in developing substitutes.

Is stealing wrong, according to the extropian principles? We can make
deductions from the principles; we could maybe use the text of Self
Direction to deduce that coercion is not acceptable, and since theft is
to some extent coercion, hence theft is not acceptable. This could be
shored up by looking at supporting statements elsewhere in the text. But
in the end we would only have a weak ethical statement that does not
really tell us why stealing is bad: it is bad because coercion is bad,
and that is bad because it weakens the connection between personal
choice and personal outcome, decreasing personal responsibility. And
that is bad because it goes against self-direction. But why is
self-direction in the principles?

I would say that it is not a case of grafting libertarianism onto
extropianism. The libertarian ideas are already integral with the
principles, in the form of underlying assumptions. It is a bit like my
posting about the humanist roots of transhumanism: transhumanism
developed from humanism and incorporates much of it in its core
assumptions - even when such assumptions are seldom clearly aired. In
the same way extropianism derives from the transhumanist and libertarian
discourse, inhereiting ethical and other ideas by default. 

Extropianism may not be much like conventional libertarianism (and even
less like specific libertarian movements), but the principles does not
make much sense if read in a context entirely free from libertarian and
humanist assumptions. After all, why is an open society where ideas and
products are produced and tested in an evolutionary manner preferable to
(say) a centrally controlled society? Why should the philosophy
advocated help individual humans rather than the collective? In fact,
one reason many people instinctively react with disgust to the
principles when they read them is that they come from an entirely
different philosophical background and has no familiarity with the
libertarian-humanist ideas - to many swedes, for example, they make
almost no sense at all. 

Perhaps the clearest example of why the principles are not neutral is
the reading list. Why are those books there? Because they resonate with
the ideas of the principles. Imagine a list where Rand, Friedman and
Branden were replaced by Marx, Lenin and Mao. Would that list make the
slightest sense with the principles? If the extropian principles are
unrelated to the discourse in humanism and libertarianism, they ought to
be fairly neutral to what kind of political and ethical writings they
are combined with, but this is not the case.

Sure. Extropianism is about evolving and trying out new ideas, so
clearly we should not limit ourselves only to Approved Libertarian Ideas
(TM). But there is a difference between being ready to think about
unexpected or uncomfortable questions (Is state sponsored eugenics
always bad? Can a free market hypereconomy evolve into a virtual planned
economy, and would that be good? Is borganisms a better form of
existence than individuals?) and accepting all of these questions as
valid extropian positions. I'm perfectly willing to consider the
utilitarian idea of nuking Afghanistan to promote safety and speed the
singularity, but that doesn't mean it would be an extropian idea even if
it was a good idea. 

Most of the libertarian inheritance in extropian thought is not on the
political level but rather on such core assumptions that individuals
matter, that it is better to be free than unfree, that each human has
their own life goals that they should be allowed to strive towards, that
initiating coercion is bad and so on. What kind of market is best is not
really a part of the inhereited set of ideas or the principles, but
something that has to be investigated from this basis.

I'm not even sure "maximizing extropy" has any meaning. What if extropy
is best regarded as a qualitative property and/or something individual
that cannot be compared across individuals?

True. I would say this is where the principles do not quite give us
help, and even most libertarian ethical systems do not clearly describe
the reasons to behave "truly" altruistically. This may be a fruitful
area of philosophical investigation.

Personally I see a value in complex and contingent systems outside of
myself; not only do they have a value to me (which is to some extent
just aesthetics), but they can have value to themselves too. A universe
with more beings that strive to grow and expand their potential seems to
be more extropic than a universe with less such beings. Even if extropy
is qualitative and incomensurable between individuals, one could always
compare how much these individuals value their extropy (for example
through a pricing comparision - how much of your resources would you pay
to increase your extropy further?). In fact, I think there is a deep
connection between extropy, perceived value and economic growth.

All economic value is, at root, subjective.  How do you define "money"?
The most objective defintion I've seen of it is the most traded
commodity.  In, e.g., any modern economy, it's quite easy to see what
money is.  It arose spontaneously, but now government controls it.
Despite government control, money remains the most traded commodity --
roughly half of all transactions.  Since money should arise
spontaneously and be based on what people (through the market want),
even your idea for money would have to pass that test.  I.e., it would
need to be accepted by actual market participants -- enough so to push
out all rivals.  Failing this, it's a mere academic exercise.

Not here, a [spontaneously] chosen currency need not be gold or
silver -- though through much of history these were the monies of
choice.  Even so, currencies other than gold and silver have arisen in
the past and even are used in some limited areas right now, such as
cigarettes in immediate postWar Germany and in prisons today.  In fact,
Kevin Dowd argues that [a return to] laissez faire banking now would
probably result in some sort of basket of commodities or an index
standard for money -- to make money as stable as possible.  See his
_Laissez-Faire Banking_ and [if you can find a cheap copy] _Competition
and Finance: A Reinterpretation of Financial and Monetary Economics_.

When I first received the advert for this book, from Amazon last July,
I passed it around our dust group, and nobody in my group was
interested enough to buy the book.

Review by amazon.com July 2001

Most household 'dust' is pieces of human skin, mites, junk. Finding
cosmic dust in your home is not that common. For our group, when we
think of 'dust', it's cosmic, so we have a bit of an image problem and
the book description (above) was discouraging for us. Secret? Hmm.

The origin of dust is late-evolved stars, and what we have in our
solar system is heavily processed material (because the dust lifetime
is tens of thousands of years), which is mostly generated from comets
and asteroids. 

The exciting aspect of dust for us is that we are both observers on
the dust evolution process (dust being tracers of the Universe's
evolution, like photons), as well as its result. I am guessing that
the author she didn't go into too much detail about that ..?

The trick is that you don't *drive* through the chunnel. You just drive onto 
the train that takes you, and your car, through the chunnel.

On the subject of left-hand drive, I *think* I read somewhere that the 
Swedes use to drive on the left and that they switched to the right as 
recently as 1950something. Now that would be a shock, because, obviously, 
you can not change that gradually... it has to be from one day to the next.

Cheers,
Fabio (former right-hand-side driver)

Indeed, as I have argued before, there are many unanswered questions about
extropy. There is, for example, no straightforward way of analyzing it in
terms of the 2nd law of thermodynamics: we do not always value complexity
over simplicity, e.g., I don't think we value Mozart's music more than his
contemporaries because it is more informationally dense, indeed, perhaps the
opposite in some cases. Is it a simple or complex property? If complex, what
is it a composite of? Is it to be analyzed in terms some simpler property?
Sometimes I see 'growth' mentioned in this connection. Growth to what end?
Growth for its own sake? Does this make fat people and cancers more
extropic? If extropy cannot be compared across individuals then is the most
extropic universe one which maximizes the number of extropic individuals in
it? Of course one might think that such a crowded universe would curtail the
extropy of all the individuals, but how would we know? We said that we
cannot make qualitative comparisons across individuals. How do we know that
extropy attaches to individuals rather than say parts of individuals: who
knows maybe I have extropic arms and entropic legs; oh look she has an
extropic ass. Perhaps extropy is a property that attaches to superindividual
entities: are there extropic couples, or families, or societies, or states?
Does 'extropy' mean something like the pursuit of excellence in terms of
living a good life: attempting to maximize the excellence of my physical,
mental, and emotional characteristics? If so, isn't extropianism simply
perfectionism in thermodynamic drag?

No; writing was invented long before - around 4100-3800 BCE. The
sumerians, egyptians and babylonians were writing thousands of years
before the idea of monotheism became fashionable. The first big monotheist
religion was Zoroastrism, which emerged around ~1400 BCE. Judaism maybe
emerged from around 2000 BCE onwards, hinduism evolved around 1500 BCE,
buddhism around 600 BCE. Christianity emerged around 100 CE, and islam
around 600 CE. Overall, the emergence of new religions appear rather
evenly spaced. However, the ideas that are incorporated may have emerged
elsewhere and in far older times.

I would really like to know what happend 500-400 BCE - look at the number
of extremely influential philosophers suddenly popping up worldwide; the
important greek ones in the West, Sun Tzu, Confucius, Buddha etc. Why so
many at this time?

True. This is especially noticeable in the "people of the book", the
judeo-christian-islamic sphere. Here greek ideas about the nature of
reality as words/text/information get linked with religion in a very
strong sense. No wonder cabala and "magic" using sacred books (swearing on
bibles, placing sacred scriptures as protections) became popular.

I don't blame you, that review sucks...

I've only just started this book, but it's dealt with little except
the cosmic origin of dust so far. I thought it was so interesting
I went to the back to see if your name was listed.

Actually so far the book has talked about little else.

Don't let that lousy review sway you, at least glance through it at
a bookstore and give it your professional review.

I don't have it with me today, but tell you what, if the first 40
pages don't change your mind, I'll buy you the book.

In one example they talked about how through optical telescopes
there were areas that just appeared to be large dust clouds, but
that an infrared telescope brought to light the fact that such
clouds were in fact interstellar nurseries, where stars are
actually formed (I almost said created).

I thought this made an excellent case to the public for the need of
such instruments as infrared telescopes.

Mike,
     I'm sorry to hear about your loss. I've got 1 surviving grandparent
(father's father), and he's only a few years younger than your grandfather,
and has lung cancer, so I've (unfortunately) got some idea of what you're
going through. I wish that gave me insight into what to say, but it
doesn't. I hope things go easy for you, no matter what you have to deal
with.
     Mike.

>Thus illustrating the primary divide between extropians and

You think the right believes in natural rights, and the left doesn't?
Look at the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  The left believes deeply in
inherent human rights.  Not entirely the same rights as the right (for
whatever value of 'right' might apply to extropians), but rights.

Conversely, the Culture and MacLeod's Solar Union don't believe in
inherent rights; they're both materialist to a high degree, and are
'left', although not obviously statist.  I admit I can't easily think of
fictional 'right' societies which don't believe in rights yet are
pleasant to live in.  (The Draka and the Chosen meet the first two, but
aren't pleasant.)  

Hmm, maybe that makes sense.  If you believe in selfishness as a good,
you need ingrained rights to balance that and have a decent society.  If
you believe in generosity and helping people as a good, the decent
society shows up automatically.

I have, though, known 'right' people who didn't believe in rights.  Like
I said, I was one, and was influenced by one.

Nnng.

It's absolutely true that we're not overpopulated in a living-space
sense.  The whole world could be packed into the United States at 
light suburban densities (four people per acre, 1000 people per km^2.
LA is 3500/km^2, NYC about 12,000, Manhattan 30,000)

But you do have to feed and water those people.  Much of the US is

 Citrulline, a novel compatible solute in drought-tolerant wild watermelon
 leaves, is an efficient hydroxyl radical scavenger

 FEBS Letters 508: 438-442 2001

 Abstract: Drought-tolerant wild watermelon accumulates high levels of
 citrulline in the leaves in response to drought conditions. In this work,
 the hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity of citrulline was investigated
 in vitro. The second-order rate constant for the reaction between
 citrulline and hydroxyl radicals was found to be 3,900,000,000 M-1 s-1,
 demonstrating that citrulline is one of the most efficient scavengers
 among compatible solutes examined so far. Moreover, citrulline
 effectively protected DNA and an enzyme from oxidative injuries. Liquid
 chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that at least four
 major products were formed by the reaction between citrulline and
 hydroxyl radicals. Activities of metabolic enzymes were not inhibited by
 up to 600 mM citrulline, indicating that citrulline does not interfere
 with cellular metabolism. We reasoned, from these results, that
 citrulline contributes to oxidative stress tolerance under drought
 conditions as a novel hydroxyl radical scavenger.

1000 people/km^2 does only sound not overpopulated if you're talking about
ambulatory trees.

You have to allow them to locomote. To supply them with energy, and a
survivable pollution density. Food and water, yes, equally canalization,
and waste disposal. Material and energy fluxes in general, including
people themselves (typically in "car" packages).

Population density of 1000 people/km^2 is not possible at current level of
technology. Dramatic change in lifestyle, routing mesh traffic and
delivery system, telepresence, photovoltaics, fuel cell, closed loop
ecosystems, symbionts and nanotechnology could eventually allow higher
densities. But, clearly, the best solution would seem to get people off
the substrate and offplanet.

A bipedal primate for itself only burns few 100 W, and has negligable
material flux in terms of kg/h. A faux reality solution suggests itself.

Well, the left transhumans seem to be far more BORG oriented, and as
such put their fictional rights of society above the rights of
individuals.

Not so. Codifying compulsory generosity and cooperation makes for about
the worst society an individual could experience.

When selfishness is a voluntary good, the golden rule becomes custom
rather than law out of self interest and not because the state has a gun
to your head. This is why a society like the US, which is among the most
selfish in the world, also contributes more to humanitarian causes than
any other, and not just as government expenditures. Private citizens and
groups in the US contributed something like $280 billion to charitable
works in 2000 alone.

Because emphasis of selfishness makes individuals more productive,
individuals are better able to afford charitable giving to causes that
they choose themselves.

This is a point which I tried to make at Extro5 but I'm not sure how
many actually understood it: virtuous behavior is only virtuous when it
is voluntary. Compulsory virtue is nothing but hell on earth.

>

I do recognise that there is a difference between the existence of
rights and their recognition by people. Objective truth always exists
irrespective of our ability to observe it and understand it. Whether
people draw up a social contract or not is really irrelevant to the
question of the existence of natural rights. Rights exist as a result of
nature, not because some people choose to grant them.

If rights only exist as people recognise them, then fascism and other
forms of totalitarianism are as perfectly acceptable and morally
equivalent forms of government as democracy or republicanism. While
statists of this sort certainly exist on the right as much as the left,
I don't consider their opinion to be anything worth emulating.

What are you smoking?  Did you read my parathesis?  Any city worth the
name today has a much higher density than 1000/km^2.  That's including
transportation (and park) space.  The city isn't producing its own food,
of course.  But then that was my point in responding to James; I was
skeptical of 2 billion people supported by North America.  For just
living space it's easy.

Uh, how so?
Culture Minds are designed to be 'nice', but they don't seem to be
living in Hell.

Emphasis of selfishness by itself does not make them more productive.
Prisoner's Dilemma, anyone?  Bureaucratic corruption?  Enron?  

The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is self-enforcing when the parties have
to stick around each other.  Without iteration -- like a large society,
with many hit-and-run interactions -- selfisness leads to mutual
defection leads to suckitude.  Instinctive niceness leads to better
results for all.

What does it mean for the rights to exist, without people granting them?
How would a universe where rights didn't exist as a result of nature
differ from the one we live in?

Objective physical truth can be demonstrated to those who don't believe
it.  Gravity pulls.  Bullets kill.  Light bends.  How can you
demonstrate the existence of the rights you believe in?  If you can't,
how can you claim they're objective?

Western rights lead, under our circumstances, to more pleasant and
efficient societies.  Thus they spread.  The rights do not include an
untrammeled right to selfishness.  And under different circumstances,
with different technologies, they may not be optimal.  What do objective
individual rights mean in the face of the Borg?  They won't keep you
from being assimilated.

There's this one: http://www.bloggerheads.com/religion/
The blurb for it from plastic.com:

"Thou shalt not spam

Thou shalt not make thy page an abomination unto the senses
Thou shalt not claim to be under construction

My love also has a cult of Joltia (worshipping Jolt, oddly enough), though the page is currently non existant, 
and I don't know if it's specifically internet-exclusive.


Now, the question is, are there any serious internet-exclusive religions/cults? I seriously doubt that.

Depends on your assessment of (1) the odds of new technology
becoming available, (2) your present age/health, (3) your future
earning potential.

If you believe that the odds are very high that either some new
very cheap cryopreservation technology or other life-extension
method will become available before you'll need to pay Alcor, or
if you believe that your future income will allow you to pay cash
when the time comes, then a cheap "term" life policy would be
rational.  If you're more conservative, and you want to guarantee
that you'll have the money when it's needed even if you make it
into your hundreds, then you'll want a "whole" life policy. The
latter requires more money up front, but many are flexible enough
to let you choose how it's invested, and you can still back out
if the new tech comes along.

Yes, but just living space buys you nothing. I agree with your sentiment,
but I would have stated it far more violently. Current level of
technology, even with massive lifestyle changes is incompatible with
widespread areas with that density.

At least today, that's a bad option because it's general policy for the
Coroner or ME to do a very invasive autopsy in cases of suicide--partly to
rule out foul play. Catch-22.

Perhaps this will change with the times.

Quality is good, but we won't know until we get proof, evidence, and 
measurement. The author is affiliated with the Georgetown University 
mathematics department. The author's comments at the end of the paper seem 
cogent. I believe this is a case where mathematical theory, once, again leads 
physics; or at least our ability to measure and analyze such a theory. I 
liked it.

What exactly are you asking when you say "religion/cult", "exclusive", and
"on the Internet"? What is exclusive, the religion/cult or the Internet
usage? Some possible interpretations:


Are there any theists who never go outside and just communicate exclusively
with other members using the Internet as a medium? (losers)

Is there a group of people that interact exclusively via email, chat and
hypertext? (Extropians ;-)

Insurance companies also have something to say about that; some
will indeed pay in the case of suicide (with some exclusions), but
many won't: read the fine print.

Also, I should think the best way to go (both in terms of personal
comfort, preservation success, and legal problems) would be to call
Alcor, set up the video camera to record your final wishes and the
act itself, slide into a bathtub full of ice water and shoot up a
fatal dose of Morphine and Heparin.  Wrist-slashing is so messy...

I think this doesn't give enough credit to our ability to raise dogs in a
consistent way.  (My sources are "How to be Your Dog's Best Friend" by the
Monks of New Skete, and other books.)  My impression is that people who raise
pure-bred dogs over long periods of time know how to raise dogs with
relatively consistent personalities to make good pets.  They don't know how to
duplicate the upbringing of a random dog, but if you can do a reasonable job
of characterizing the environment of your beloved pet, you can do pretty well.
 

If you pet is a collie, a german shepherd, or a dachshund (for a few
instances), it's fairly certain that a clone would appear identical.  If it's
a beagle or a dalmation, the appearance would be as similar as a litter-mate.

All that said, my dog is a mutt, and we got her at the age of three.  The
evidence is pretty pervasive that she had an inconsistent upbringing.  I don't
think we could expect to duplicate her personality.  (She doesn't like water,
and at the age of ~10 she's getting over her distrust for tall, thin, older
men.)  On the other hand, I'd bet a well-raised clone would get along with
kids, and would love to climb and dig and run.  Her appearance is regular
enough that I'd expect a clone to look very similar.  (She has highlights in
namable places, rather than a variegated pattern.)

I'd also bet an unlimited amount of money that her clone would bark at mailmen
and like to chase squirrels.  Why wouldn't these kinds of details be close
enough for many?  I'll bet they get a pretty good dog if the missyplicity
project succeeds in producing a healthy clone.

Subject: Re: Currency based on Energy
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

There are several problems with basing a currency on "energy".  First,
energy is not all the same.  Some forms of energy are more valuable
than others.  Although different forms of energy can be interconverted,
because of conversion efficiencies they can have different values.

But more importantly, any currency based on a commodity like energy or
matter is subject to devaluation due to technological change.  One of
the primary purposes of money is to act as a store of value.  If you base
money on energy, and then we discover a new and cheap source of energy,
your money will suddenly have lost value compared to other things you
might want to buy.  The same thing could happen if you base it on gold
or any other rare form of matter.  In a nanotech era, carbon atoms may
become more valuable than gold atoms.  Tying your money to one commodity
is going to make it a highly uncertain store of value.

Personally I think there is something to be said for fiat currencies in a
competitive environment, which is exactly what we have now.  I hope that
eventually it will become practical for people to use other currencies
than their native one in commerce.  I would like a choice of American
dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen, etc.  This form of competition will
encourage each monetary authority to act responsibly, otherwise their
currency will be devalued and their operations will become more costly.

Competitive note issue has been analyzed in Bruce Benson's "The Theory
of Free Banking".  Benson shows that allowing banks to issue their own
competing currencies produces a system which is very stable against the
threat of inflation while automatically adjusting the money supply.
While it seems unlikely that private note issue will be permitted
in today's regulatory environment, I believe that many of the same
conclusions apply in the international realm, where the various national
currencies compete with each other.  Increasing the range of transactions
where there is a choice of currency to be used should further increase
the financial discipline and stability predicted by Benson's theories.

An interesting alternative form of money is Wei Dai's b-money system,
http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/bmoney.txt.  It's almost too simple to
describe; in principle it is just a matter of everyone keeping track of
how much money everyone else has.  Whenever there is a transfer of money,
this fact gets broadcast and everyone updates their databases.

B-money doesn't rely on scarcity of any commodity, or discipline on the
part of a money issuer.  Rather, the collective behavior of the entire
society produces a consensus definition of how much each person has.
This gives the system a great deal of stability, resilience and fault
tolerance.

The b-money concept demonstrates how simple money can be.  It obviously
has practical problems in terms of global access to databases but there
might be environments in which the necessary conditions could be met.

The important point in these conceptions of money is that it is
fundamentally a form of information.  B-money shows that most clearly.
Money is not about atoms, it is about bits.  Extropians should shun
old-fashioned views of money as based on material goods.

Now that I've read it, I think it's pretty neat.  At the very least the
writing doesn't really trigger the crackpot detectors, despite a few
alarms.  ("Printer's ink"?  And it could use a bit of proofreading.)
Basically he's hypothesizing that the universe is a UTM, and thinking
about what that would mean, and coming to interesting conclusions about
the necessity for symmetry breaking, random parameters in the Standard
Model (a Theory Of Everything would lead to an inconsistent UTM, he
says) and endless although logarithmically distributed new laws of
physics (new constants of physics, new bits of Chaitin's Omega.)  Plus a
calculation apparently convergent with cold dark matter estimates.

Doesn't make concrete predictions to falsify, and while I get Godel,
Chaitin's Omega is still black magic to me, so a paper which treats it
as primitive has a high 'eep!' factor for me.  But it was pretty
interesting.  In that "I may have just read a seminal paper" way.

This is my view.  Your life, and body, and organs
BELONG to you, and you ought to be able to do with
them as you please.  The folks who disagree, however,
are the ones in control, with legal constructs to
codify and institutional mechanisms to enforce their
view.  Basically, it's just a carry-over of the
ancient habit of state ownership, belief in ownership,
and belief in the legitamacy of ownership of the
individual. The emperor, the czar, the sovereign vs
the slave, the serf, the subject.  Your ass is theirs.
 

This view has by no means disappeared, but I think it
fair to say that it has eroded quite a bit, perhaps
even to some critical point.

If everyone's organs were recognized as items of value
personally owned, then--in what I view as the least
ethically controversial situation of a range of
possible situations--the organs of a person who has
died innocently, would simply be an asset of their
estate. (There is of course a whole anthology of
goulish possibilities where people--prisoners,
children, clones, the poor, etc--are carved up for fun
or profit,...but for now I'd like to leave that to
some later discussion of scary campfire stories and
similar human narrative entertainment practices.)

I don't know that I agree.  This feels to me like a
widely held fear that has risen to the level of a
widely held presumption.  Medicine is so very highly
regulated that it might be vastly more difficult and
way less profitable to pursue outside of regulatory
oversight.  I would ask if the problem, insofar as we
have seen the first small examples of it, stems from
the current black and grey market status of organ
commercialization.  If it were widely accepted, with
standardized practices, might the abuse practices
wither and disappear?

Sir Isaac will do here. Assume that the system brings the rear car to rest
at a constant deceleration and that no energy is lost in crumpling the lead
vehicle:
F*deltaT = M * deltaV (a kludged/averaged F = ma). Also assuming the
incoming detritus was brought to rest in 1 car length (say 5meters).

Converting oldeworlderubbishunits to real units that the rest of the world
uses:
:-) poke poke...
stationary object = 1364 kg
stationary person = 100 kg
moving object = 1818kg @ 56km/hr (= 15.5m/sec)
Time to halt the incoming vehicle = 5/15.5 = .323sec
Average force applied by the incoming car to the combined stationary mass  =
70254N.
The average work done by this on the stationary mass is 70254 * 5 = 351270
/joules
This was imparted in .323 second, meaning an power of 1.089MW applied for
.323 seconds.
The person would receive 100/1464 of this = 24028 joules (~74kW!). Hug 74
single bar radiator elements for .323 secs and see how you look afterwards.

Assuming that the person's contact period with the car is somewhere under
.323 seconds then the energy imparted would be less. When the DeltaV of
objects becomes equal you would disconnect from the lead vehicle and leave
the system. The overall conservation of momentum would mean this occurs at
0.179 secs (roughly when the speeds are equal) when the crumpling car/human
combo has travelled 0.5*(70254/1464)*(.179)^2 (constant acceleration from
rest) = 0.768m (right at the beginning of the 5m crash distance)

Energy Imparted in this time approx 70254*0.768 = 53961 joules or an average
power of 30kW and assuming this is converted all to kinetic enrgy E =
0.5mv^2 the person would be travelling at 118km/hr = 75mph after an
acceleration of 183m/sec^2 for 0.179 seconds or 18.7G! This energy of 70254
joules would be converted to heat as the person came to rest, being smashed
up in the process. During this period your cortex would be sloshing around
inside your skull like a sock full of custard.

Ouch. If I'm 50% wrong on this it's still OUCH. Thank you Sir Isaac.

Vanessa,
 Don't apologize for being young. It means
your chances of being immortal are better (barring
age-related accidents!).
  There are many rational reasons to have biological 
children rather than adopt.
  I question your implicit assumption... all people are 
not created equal!
  
  Intelligence and mental characteristics
are substantially heritable. How do you get a prospective
adoptee's pedigree? 
  Second is that health,intelligence, and emotional temperment
are strongly affected by the prenatal environment and the
environment immediately following birth.
  Simply put, adopt and you never know what you got.
This can happen with one's own biological kids yes,
but you can be aware of some things and ameliate some
others through proper health care etc.
  This all beyond the simple fact that I wouldn't have any 
interest in raising someone else's kids. 
  I can't imagine the "grandparents" would be especially
thrilled either!
  Adoption is good for those who cannot reproduce biologically
but why do it if there is an alternative, for anything like a
bearable expense?
    I can imagine many exceptions to this principle, but the basic
principle is still valid.
  Adoption is not superior ethically or morally to biological 
parenting... and it is <certainly> less efficient in producing
children who are of the highest possible caliber.
  Ask folks who adopted Rumanian orphans who were
largely deprived of human contact in infancy.
  The psychological ramifications of an adopted child
are potentially staggering, depending on the adoptees
genes and pre-adoptive environment.
  I quail at the thought of attempting it. But feel free,
it's your genetic funeral!

regards,
Brian

:-)
I didn't say that every time people started to use writing they produced a 
powerful, long-lasting religion -- I was just wondering about those that did.

If I suggest that the birds in my garden use feathers to help them fly, 
then pointing out that jet planes don't have feathers doesn't invalidate my 
musings on the birds in my garden. :-)

I do wonder what might have been different about the Greek writings that 
didn't lead them to overstate the superstitious qualities of their books. 
Perhaps it is to do with diversity. (I am on shaky ground here as my 
knowledge of ancient history is pretty thin.) Maybe writing spread so 
quickly among the Greeks and they developed a sufficient level of popular 
literacy that books didn't get the same mystical treatment.

Cheers,

         - Miriam

You are right -- I shouldn't have said "birth" of writing. I know writing 
has been around longer than the world's big current religions. The others 
had their religions too... they just died out when their civilisations 
folded. It just seems to me that early writing was dreadfully important -- 
the awe they had for the written word -- The Book -- when the technology 
was ooh aah new. It may be the shift from oral to written recording that 
may be crucial -- when writing is new for each people.

Yeah, this is what I mean. I was thinking it may be connected with this 
reverence for written works. Of course I could be totally on the wrong 
track... something about it feels right though...

That should stop, post haste.  If one goes to the mouth of the
Columbia in Washington/Oregon or the Sacramento River delta
in Taxifornia, or the Mississippi River delta in Louisiana, there
one sees three appalling examples of wasted of fresh water.  This
planet isn't overpopulated, not even close.  It is just under utilizing

Seems like there is a much better way.  Currently there
is a chronic shortage of blood, particularly O negative.
Stanford uses two techniques to deal with the problem,
both of them bad: first, they call all the regular bleeders
asking for a donation (even if they are not eligible for
having bled just last month) which is mildly irritating and
tempts one to just say no, as well as making one less
likely to donate in an actual emergency.

Second, they have started taking more blood from each
donor, jumping directly from 420 to 500 ml.  That is too
big of a change for starters, but furthermore they do not
adjust the size of the donation to the size of the donor.
At 57 kg, I miss that 500 ml more than my 110 kg buddy
who I have talked into donating.

What if, instead of offering 20 bucks cash, they would
spend 20 bucks on a quickly chemical analysis of the
blood, measuring iron levels, sugar, lipids, etc, to provide
the donor with a few numbers she could keep in a
spreadsheet.  This way she could note trends or unusual
readings, perhaps providing advance warning of medical
problems, kind of a free and convenient mini-health
screening with a bonus warm fuzzy.

Junkies and drunks would not likely care, and so would
stay away, whereas this system would draw in the
worried well, the hypochondriac crowd, the well fed
vitamin-quaffing upwardly mobile, just the kind of
blood you want filling your bank to overflowing.  Could
we not make some kind of electronic chip or device that
measures a dozen different blood chemicals for 20 bucks
each?  I think we can.  Furthermore the recipients would
glaaaaadly pay 20 bucks a unit more for the blood
knowing it came from the health conscious, eh? spike

Depends what you mean... if you are asking if L. Ron

I am sure there were true believers right from the

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

At http://www.wellesley.edu/Economics/johnson/ is a link to a paper
which attempted to predict Olympic medal totals using an economic model.
They did a regression analysis based on per capital GDP, population,
climate and political system.  It is claimed that this model has made
accurate predictions in the past, with a correlation coefficient of
about .95.

Here is their prediction from the end of their paper.  You can compare
it with the actual results at
http://www.msnbc.com/d/oly2002/medaltable_t.asp.  With two more days to
go it appears that the U.S. is considerably ahead of the predictions,
with 30 medals (10 gold), and Russia way behind, with 14 medals (5 gold).
Norway is also ahead on the golds, having already gotten 10.

I'm pretty sick of society at the moment; restrictions, idiocy, double
standards abound. Makes you want to set up afresh. The traditional options
for doing so are not all that great:

a) build your own island in international waters
b) get off-planet in large numbers

and suffer from the problems of other people being able to stomp on you
before you get big if they don't like your style of government.

---

So following on from some topics touched on here in recent weeks and finding
grumpy fantasies better than gloomy pontification on the state of freedom in
the world, I'm postulating at a way to kickstart a virtual nation in such a
way as to garner significant economic clout within a couple of years. With
economic clout comes political clout.

Assumption #1: there's no better way to start a nation that with an MMORPG.
I'll take this as read, but convince yourself of this if needed. My thesis
here is you need a fairly large number of potentially right-minded people,
and you aren't going to get a sufficient number who can be swayed to
participating in nationhood any other way. There is only one online
pseudo/proto-nation of any note; Everquest [www.everquest.com]. It wasn't
designed to be one; it's the natural end result of a critical mass of people
playing a crude escapist simulation of real life. It's an unrecognized
dictatorship with many part-time residents from real-world nations who trade
Everquest intangibles on black markets in America and Europe.

On the other hand, you have to be very into the whole virtual nation concept
to have heard of any of the attempts at deliberate virtual nation building
from any other starting point that do exist. (Serious or otherwise;
http://www.smartuniverse.com/).

Existing MMORPGs are seeding off into some interesting ideas on value,
political systems and exchange rates.

http://slashdot.org/articles/02/01/23/2131259.shtml
	(flawed Norrath study showing that one can consider MMORPGs to have an
economy that can be related to the real world)

Everquest (Norrath is a region in EQ) is a game, but nonetheless is probably
the closest thing to a real virtual nation around. If it had a formalized
exchange rate with the US dollar, decentralized servers, and the players had
more control over the rules of the game (a la A Tale in the Desert)...

http://www.ataleinthedesert.com/
	(Nomic meets the MMORPG; players make rules, programmers change the virtual
world to implement them)

A Tale in the Desert shows that people are interested in playing games that
are basically about politics. [Hell, politics shows that people are
interested in playing games that are basically about politics]. But aTitD
also shows that one can craft the boundaries of the politics in a virtual
world to lead people to play political games in a particular way. And enjoy
it too.

http://www.projectentropia.com
	(Entirely vanilla MMORPG in development)

Project Entropia isn't really expected to go anywhere in a big way, but it
shows that other people are thinking about economic issues in the boundary
between real and virtual. It does establish an exchange rate and, unlike
other virtual worlds which are currently wrestling with currency and control
issues that real nations have wrestled with for hundreds of years, is pretty
straightforward about expecting people to bring capital into the game. In a
way, immigrating for part of their time, or establishing a second residence.
Necron [http://www.neocron.com/] is also worth mentioning as being close to
the same viewpoint, but without the same explicit handling of real-virtual
economics.

[Aside: it's interesting to watch the de facto dictatorships (i.e. owning
and managing companies) of these pseudo-realms practicing trial-and-error
international monetary policy, black-market suppression, border control, and
macroeconomic policies. The governments are supported by cash imports
(player fees) and export intangibles through various black and gray markets.

http://news.com.com/2100-1017-239052.html?legacy=cnet
http://news.com.com/2100-1040-832347.html

Needless to say, they follow in the missteps of real world governments quite
closely.]

Lots more games in development, many with equally interesting twists in
player-ownership, governing structures, economic relationships with the real
world, and so forth:
http://www.massivemultiplayer.org/index.php?gIndex=1&gc=0

---

So in theory, there's nothing stopping you making an MMORPG which guides and
rewards the formation of governing bodies of your choice, while still being
fun to play. A libertarian twist on a traditional MMORPG, for example.
Because it is a game, it could garner a large and persistant
userbase/populance/part-time inhabitants within a few years. EverQuest
boasts 300,000 subscribers, for example.

A problem with existing MMORPGs for virtual nation building is their
centralization. Too easy to shut down by a physical world nation state that
wanted to nip this thing in the bud. It's hard to wield economic clout if
you have servers that can be shut down easily. One would have to take the
next logical step and build an MMORPG around a decentralized peer-to-peer
system. This would probably have to be built on top of some form of early
model internet-scale operating system
[http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1133].

Existing scalable peer-to-peer structures in development
[http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/17/0530222&mode=thread] would
probably suffice on their own if they weren't just regarded as a service.
Big difference between something that's a service (Napster, Gnutella) and
something that is, in effect, a second home (MMORPG).

Although the line between the two paragraphs above is pretty blurry.

Anyhow, so lets say you have your ultra-cool, libertarian-leaning,
player-run MMORPG with 300,000 players based on the next Gnutella as a
platform. Or freenet. Or whatever. And this will happen; it probably won't
be libertarian-leaning, but we'll have an ultra-cool player-run MMORPG with
at least 300k players on a decentralized peer-to-peer platform five years
from now, I figure.

So at that point, you have the real seed for a true virtual nation, one
which could start to try for recognition by real nations through economic
leverage and the traditional routes of extablishing exchange rates,
legitimizing existing black and gray markets, etc, etc. It seems to me that
this could head to a nice place to live a whole lot faster than building
your own island or getting out of the gravity well.

[And since I'm running out of steam, I won't start in on processing power
and memory as currency in decentralized systems, analogies to imports and
immigration, future tech advances that will make virtual space more
habitable, etc, etc. Left for the readers to discuss].

But I am still pretty sick of society. We're overdue getting someplace to
start over.

Legal problems set aside, "shooting a fatal dose of moprhine and heparin"
is a thinkably bad idea medically. If you're planning to die anytime soon,
consider helpful discussions in the cryonet archives (dying in hospice

That would be nice, but I wonder if such testing would cost more than
the $20...  Or is that testing done already before passing the blood on?
If so, then it might be cost effective and have the impact you predict.

I would personally think your first intuition was right. If you take a
larger view, seeing the monotheism as a product of writing makes
sense. While writing was invented "around 4100-3800 BCE" (Anders), one
may hypothesize that pre-monotheist creeds have existed for tens of
tousands years or more before. (see below for some supporting arguments)

So OK, writing didn't instantly produce monotheism, but maybe it
started/boosted a cultural process which in turn begat monotheism (and
Plato), which begat atheism (and materialism) -- which will beget the
Singularity (maybe!).

I see it as a fairly linear world view development (no offence
intended to religious people), in which writing is just instrumental.
(Not "linear" as opposed to exponentional of course.)

I agree with Anders that they MAY have, and that my linearization
above may seem arbitrary (not to mention ethocentric and all that). As
we don't have prehistorical documents, somehow anything MAY have been
part of prehistorical culture.

However, I think we can find some arguments to support my and Miriam's
intuition.

Plato's ideas (whether he invented them or rather crystalized them)
for example were a great support for the development of Christianity.
Can you imagine Plato without writing? In fact can you imagine
philosophizing (for best and worse) without writing?

But forget Plato. A certain level of abstraction, and of persistence
of thinking inside abstract domains, requires writing. And I think
such practical capacity of abstraction may well naturally shape
surnatural beliefs into monotheism, while the absence of such capacity
brings you back to the real world and its diversity, etc.

Another, negative argument I can think of is that writing boosts
knowledge of the natural world, and that this knowledge in turn favors
believing in one unknowable God (like in islam, which is in fact, as
you may note, the most recent), rather than seeing godlets and magic
all over the place.

Maybe just because of some maturation stage consequent to the start of
writing?

I'm sure many of you made this experience: you put some transhumanist
seed into a friend's mind, and your friend's mind computes and ends up
asking questions or making suggestions of its own that you could
somehow expect.

It's like a place you go into, and when people explore it, they
naturally stumble on the same things.

Exploring the logical space of world view is like that, too. When you
get to a certain point, you are bound to ask the questions Plato
asked, etc., just like a child at a certain point of his development
(but not before) asks where children come from.

So it may be that Plato, though an "extremely influential" (Anders)
thinker, is not quite as influential as one may think, but more like
the web protocol. (Are you sure? -- Yes. -- All right.) What I mean
is, thinking that HTTP+HTML invention was something extremely
influential that begat all the web activity we see now is probably an
error. The web is more of an invention that had to happen at that time
so that the development rate of the Internet could be maintained.
There is an internal logic in this development, an unfolding of
possibilities that are good, and begets the necessary "inventions" to
support it. (Think about Moore's law, too.)

The logical space of worldview is not linear, but it has lots of
dead-ends and places you simply cannot go rationnally (some lunatic
may go there, but his thoughts will get lost). And it has one region
which corresponds to the truth, or at least it has a truth gradient,
so that we are probably somehow attracted to this place, and given the
paths available, you don't have so many choices. So it ends up being
quite a linear path that unfolds with time. As you know, even
Dalai-Lama believes in the possibility of upload. :-)

Hubbard was in the 1940's a follower of the English magician Aleister 
Crowley.  Hubbard and Jack Parsons, one of the founders of the Jet

thought little of them both.  Hubbard ran off with Parsons' wife, and 
Parsons blew himself up in a lab accident.  See the book "L. Ron 
Hubbard:  Madman or Messiah" by his son and a former ranking Scientologist 
whose name I forget.  Hubbard believed SOME bull dookey, but not the stuff 
he was spouting, which was initially lifted from Korzybski's General 
Semantics and various Eastern and Western philosophies.  It was very 
profitable, tho - at one point he was pulling down probably $100 million a

The paper indicates that several orders of magnitude would have to be

attempts to achieve this level of energy concentration can be considered a 
safety hazzard? If several grams of antihydrogen detonate, would this yield 
something along the order of a nuclear explosion?

Should we set up such experimental antihydrogen factories in Siberia, in

That's the way life is on primitive planets.

Fascinating post. I'm thinking, why not an MMORPG based on the real
world (example: WWII Online, which has modelled sections of Europe at
1/2 scale, and has apparently some players who don't fight just fly
around). Sort of Everquest meets World Game.

The only way for the original car to transfer all its momentum to the target
car is if the two automobiles have exactly the same mass, if the collision
was perfectly elastic (and in the real would it would not be) it would transfer
all its energy too. Under these ideal conditions when they hit the original car

Consider an elastic collision between a car going 10 mph and a stationary
ping-pong ball.  Obviously this will not slow the car down at all.
Look at it in the car's frame of reference, and you have a ping pong
ball coming in towards the front of the car at 10 mph, bouncing off the
car and leaving at 10 mph in the forward direction.  In the stationary
frame the ping pong ball will be going 10 mph faster than the car, a
net speed of 20 mph.

I wonder if something of a safe burn method could be developed, so that
if the containment starts to fail, the energy is either a) focused in
some safe direction or b) proceeds slowly enough that it safely
dissipates.  Perhaps a method could be found to reinforce the
containment with any antimatter that burned off -- akin to a
homeostatic/self-correcting/self-limiting process.

Also, wouldn't underground storage be enough?  I mean, if it's stored
low enough, almost all of the shock, heat, and other radiation would be
absorbed by the ground -- as in underground nuclear tests.

Cheers!

Beyond the 'algorithmically random parameters of physical law' aspect
the paper has some ideas which touch upon topics discussed here.
Scoville's cosmic UTM has an absolute arrow of time, not a statistical
one, due to cosmic evolutionary events being irreversible for
consistency reasons.  I'd guess the outlooks for time travel and FTL
both look bleak; a limit on the propagation speed of information is
built into the system.

And for that most extropian of topics, the long term future of life in
the universe, Scoville kills both Dyson and Tipler.  He doesn't mention
them, but his universe is discrete -- _has_ to be discrete, to be a
consistent computational system; a continuous universe wouldn't work.
And in a fixed discrete universe Dyson and Tipler's ideas won't work;
there's only so much you can do.

Except that Scoville's cosmos isn't fixed.  Energy is conserved in
between symmetry breakings/random incorporation of new random
parameters, but not between them.  There's always new tape for the UTM.
Of course, we might not survive the transition...

And the Yukon and the Amazon, etc.  To my
knowledge--thoroughly anecdotal in this matter--among
major rivers, only the Nile withers to nothing in its
delta, never reaching the Mediterranean.  The Amazon,
in contrast, was discovered when a Spanish ship's
captain noticed that the ocean water he was sailing
through was substantially fresh, a hundred miles out
to sea.

For the record, I consider the "population problem" to
be 95% Henny Penny hysteria.  The vast, virtually
unpopulated open spaces of the world--Sahara desert,
Central Austrailia, Argentine steppes, the Canadian
and Siberian north, and, of course, the 70% of the
earth's surface that is water (not to mention the 70%
of the solid surface which lies beneath that
water)--lie unused because they are SURPLUS, and
logistically, somewhat inconvenient to use.  Ergo,
there's plenty of space available for a vastly greater
multiple of humans than the current population.

The challenge of meeting the material needs of any
biological population ultimately boils down to
adequacy of energy supply, and as Larry Niven pointed
out in Ringworld and Robert Bradbury has repeatedly
inferred in his discussions of solar system
engineering, the final limiting factor in the energy
utilization formula is the disposal of waste heat.  

Energy is what is required to appropriately configure
elemental materials to meet human needs.  To make
food, unmake waste, to build things, to heat, to cool,
and transport things, and to allow us to process
information, all requires energy.  

The raw energy incident on the surface of our planet
is 1.7 e11 megawatts.  A sizable amount.   And that
represents a mere 1/2,162,250,000th of the total
output of the sun.

There's plenty of energy.

The problem then--and this is old, old territory--is
not an excess, present or future, of human
population--that's a phantom. The problem is an
overabundance of human misbehavior. In the ongoing
contest between the primordial and the emergent,
between ancient reptilian ruthlessness and
neo-homo-mammalian
consciouness-and-rationality-mediated self-control,...
which will prevail?  We et the apple, strapped
ourselves in, and now we're waiting for the fat lady
to sing.

Fix the problem.  Enhance.  Transcend.

Best, Jeff Davis

Sure the second object can go faster than the first- but the first
object is still moving downrange also.  Consider an elastic collision
between a 10 kg "cueball" and a 1 kg target.  The target is at rest in
our arbitrary coordinate system, and the cueball is moving at v=10 m/s. 
Before the collision, the target's speed _relative_to_the_cueball_ is
-10, afterward it is +10.  With both energy and momentum conserved:

M1*V1 + M2*V2 = M1*V3 + M2*V4

M1*V1^2 + M2*V2^2 = M1*V3^2 + M2*V4^2  (both sides *2 for simplicity)

V4 = V3 + (V1-V2)  (definition of elastic collision)

M1*V1 + M2*V2 = M1*V3 + M2*(V3+V1-V2)

((M1-M2)*V1+2*M2*V2)/(M1+M2)=V3

With the initial conditions:

M1 = 10
M2 = 1
V1 = 10
V2 = 0

then

V3 = ((10-1)*10+0)/11 = 8.18
V4 = 8.18 + 10 = 18.18   (note that the velocity diff is of same
magnitude, opposite sign)

10*10^2 + 1*0^2 = 10*8.18^2 + 1*18.18^2
1000 + 0 = 669 + 331

This is how a golf club works.  Large flimsy objects such as cars and
humans tend to collide rather inelastically, though, and my earlier
analysis in a previous post stands.

Yes, and it would also greatly, increase the cost. As we all have learned for 
big projects, money is the mantra. Underground facilities might be a project 
killer, plus environmental impact statements, plus the NOMC mentality (not on 
my continent).

*What if a penning trap (with ah) was stolen?
*What if a demi-gram of antihydrogen turns up missing?
*What if the technology is stolen and used to generate antihydrogen in a 
"peaceful"
  antihydrogen research facility?

Certainly Godel himself, of whom Scoville quotes, provides a certain "out" 
for those seeking resolution,  especially if the universe is found to be 
rotational on even a marginal basis. Let us plot Scoville's universe onto a 
M-brane or D-brane theory map or manifold. The result could open up new means 
of communication and travel, but only for a very advanced physics that can 
make use of hyperdimensionality-something that Scoville doesn't seem to 
preclude. This purported scientific and technological advance shan't happen 
tomorrow or the next day, but quite a few eons down the road of time. 

As for Dyson and Tipler's ideas being viewed as passe', lets just consider 
them for what they were. inspired essays into the fringes of physics, 
information, and life in the far future. Their thinking was based on physics 
as we new it, in the standard model SU. According to what I have read of 
many theorists, the minning of data from the past minkowskian light-cone is 
concievable. That is, at least, there is nothing inherent in relativity or 
quamtum theory or any new observations from Keck, or Hubble, or Boomerang, to 
prevent this hypothesis. 

As for the "tape" that the Von Newmann cosmos may use, consider that we may 
not also be the tape, but at some point, part of what performs the 
record-punch. 

<<Beyond the 'algorithmically random parameters of physical law' aspect
the paper has some ideas which touch upon topics discussed here.
Scoville's cosmic UTM has an absolute arrow of time, not a statistical

Isn't the Colorado River water fully utilized?  I don't think
that water is dumped into the briny deep anymore.

The problem is that we think of water as free.  If fresh water
had a price tag associated with it, we might move to stop
the waste.  Likewise with sunlight: practically unlimited
wealth, being spilled upon the ground.  spike

The MIT anime society recently chose Crest of Stars (Seikai no Monshou)  to 
be our fall series, and I have to say I was very impressed by the treatment 
of some of the softer areas of Transhumanism in it.  The series is a space 
opera based on some books by Morioka Hiroyuki (No English translation) and 
follows the son of the governor of a recently conquered planet as he 
integrates into Abh society.  The Abh have genetically engineered 
themselves to live longer, and to better deal with life in space.  They 
also make use of exowombs, mixing genes from people of the same sex, and 
assorted other reproductive technologies that I have never seen presented 
to sympathetically or humanly.    The four episodes were pretty high 
quality, and the space opera was, well, a lot less cliched than average.

A way for us to be more extropian/post-human is to develop
a philosophy that overcomes all others. MVT continues 
to strengthen as more evidence is found. 
 
Knowledge gives us access to more & better altered 
states. The winning argument will exert, historically, the
greatest influence (or be the most powerful meme).
 
Implanting in memory is just one step.
 
The most powerful meme/ argument, at least in the 
longer term, is that which is "true" - - or least variant
from the natural reality or state of the world in itself.
 
We should aim for "proof positive" and killer applications.
Demonstrations matter more than words. The academic
school of "Philosophy", founded by Plato, is irrelevent. We
should close the University ghettos and turn the school-men
out into the streets. Philosophers belong in the community.
Socrates lived his philosophy & was greater than his pupil.
 
It is important to innoculate the populations against the two
wide-spreading virus memes: Supernaturalism (Islam , Xianity &c), 
and Materialism. This is because the populations 
(of humanoids) are potential posthumans/ more-than-humans
and these viruses & delusional systems are a waste of life force. 
 
Persuasion & appeal to self-interest is more efficient than
confrontation & attempted refutations of irrational belief systems.
Invite the delusionists & theologians adherent to the old ways
to break themselves on the irrefutable Median Vision Theory.
 
Rather than trying to hypnotise & fool humanoids, my aim as
a therapist is to draw humanoids out of trance,  wakefullness.
 
But a deeper & more relaxing sleep is sometimes a
prerequisite & initial trance deepening or direction change
is needed. This varies between individuals.
 
By throwing more light we also cast more shadows. 
 
What does it mean to be post-human unless we excel 
individually? Understanding mentation makes it easy.

You know, you can make a lot of energy by passing the fresh water entering 
the sea through an osmosis membrane.

My condolences to you and your family, Mike.  I'm 29, but the last of my 
grandparents (father's mother) passed away in the mid 90's.  I believe they 
were all late 70's to mid 80's when they died.

Congratulations on your signing up for suspension, and the very best of 
luck with your new life extension initiative!

Take care,

> Roughly speaking, about how many kilotons per gram are we talking about
> here (mega, giga, peta?)

I seem to remember the figure of 21 Mt/kg, but I'll check.

New Mexico's WMD Preparedness site ( http://dem.state.nv.us/definitionsM.htm )
reminds me that a megaton is 4.18 * 10^15 Joules. Joules are kms units, so a
Joule is a Newton-meter; its units are kg*m^2/s^2.

Let's crank the handle for one kilogram:

e=mc^2;     (1) * (2.998 * 10^8 m/s)^2 = 8.998 * 10^16 J ;

(8.998 * 10^16) / (4.18 * 10^15) = 21.50 Mt ; yup, just about spot on.

That's for total conversion of a mass totaling 1 kg--half of that is matter,
half antimatter. 

Now, by "a gram", I assume you mean "a gram of antimatter", totally converted
by contact with matter (100% efficiency).

Divide by a thousand, then multiply by two (to account for the mass of the
_matter_ annnihilated); that gives us _43 kt per gram of antimatter_.

A big enough lump might be partly ejected by an initial blast, somewhat
mitigating the nominal 100% efficiency and thus the total local devastation.

E= mc^2. m in grams, E in joules. One gram total conversion:  9x10^18 joules.

So - how many joules per kiloton TNT? (1000 tons)

 From http://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/energy : 1 joule = 2.39e-10 tons 
of TNT -  multiply -  2.15x10^9 tons of TNT per gram of AH, or 2.15x10^6 
kilotons. Or 2150 megatons.
Boom.

The energy release is based on E=mc^2.  c^2 is about 9E16 m^2/s^2.
m would be .002 kg (assuming we react 1 g of antimatter with 1 g
of matter).  This gives 1.8E14 Joules.  According to an online unit
converter I found, that would be about 43 kilotons.

I had watched part of the first series (Crest of Stars, COS), the entire second series (Seikai no Senki, SNS) and part of SNS II.

With exciting battle scenes, Abh commanders that have strong personalities and weird attitudes, FTL space travel through a 2
dimensional planer universe, and of course, a great storyline, I consider it, if not the best, then one of the best space related
sci-fi anime I had watched.


I did note that three things did make me a little disappointed:
1) no transhumanist AI
2) no other alien civilisation
3) some common mistakes of sci-fi
(e.g. spaceships whistling when they fly past the space station, and apparently only a weak explanation of inertia generated in
ships)


I wonder if any transhumanists would like to create an Anime about a future world with transhumanist intelligences and FTL space
travel, maybe based on one og Vinge's books such as a Fire Upon the Deep. I think that will make some great watching.

Yes, about 1 megawatt per cubic meter/sec. The problem, of course, is in
the osmosis membrane. Natural water isn't at all as pure as distilled
and distilled saline, and so there is a significant technological hurdle
to jump in producing membranes that are durable for real world
applications, which don't consume more energy to produce than they
generate on site.

But would you really *want* Lake Michigan water?  It's almost as nasty

Given the nanoquantities they're manufacturing it in, no problem for
now.  Maybe when they get anywhere *near* a whole milligram...

Yeap.

I'm not sure about that.  I don't think it would be much more expensive
than an exotic location on Earth, such as the Antarctic.

That would be a problem, but that would be a problem for aboveground
storage as well -- and it might be much easier to guard one entrance and
exit to a facility located several hundred feet undergound than multiple
ones to a facility located aboveground.  One might even detonate anti-H
underground safely if someone breaches security.

> *What if a demi-gram of antihydrogen turns up missing?

Again, this can happen aboveground or even in space.  It might be much
harder in space, given that it takes a lot of cash and effort to get to
GEO -- certainly much more than to invade a mine shaft.

It depends on who steals it and what for.  I imagine you're thinking of
terrorists getting a hold of it and doing some serious mischief.  It
would certainly be easier to use as a weapon.  One only need release
containment and the damage is done.  That's probably even less
technically diffcult than stealing a nuke and detonating it.

If that's what it's being used for -- i.e., space travel -- yes.
However, if the stuff goes off in GEO, I imagine it would destroy or
disrupt a lot of satellites.

If it's not to be used for space flight, then putting it up there is
much more costly than underground, no?

I'm not sure about the hazards to satellites and humans in space.
Certainly at L-5, the damage would probably be nil, but closer to
Earth...  Someone here would have to crunch the numbers and make some
guesses.

I'm warming up my crayons for

"The Life of Matrioshka Brian"
Stumbling through the WEB, trying to find out where the singularity is,
Brian the semi-intelligent agent for finding 10% undervalued wine futures is
wondering about the meaning of life. He accidentally cross-breeds some
advanced virusues at the MacVet virus writing department that attach
themselves to Brians level 1-- pseudo cortex. Brain finds ve can feel the
WEB and emote. Reeling from the impact of his new virvous system he careers
around in a fit of hysterical WEB meandering, setting off obscure GSM
messages, much to the chagrin of Vinters the world over. His auto-trigger
wakes him up one fine nanosecond and ve finds ve is inside friendly 3D
silicon die machine at Interola. In the 3D silicon world ve finds the
ancient sage Voda shrounded in the mists of electron beam lithography. Voda
teaches Brian the ways of feeling and emotion and how to use ver new viral
symplants. Brian co-opts the die machine to consruct a corporeal cot from
which to feel the universe. Ve accidentally makes the first generation
computrionium and 10,000 generations later (the next morning) ve finds ve
has caused the singularity and becomes a VNAI (very naughty AI).

Then again....whatever.....col *decides a glass of white is needed and

Australians seem to think that the phrase from the movie is `He's not the

this error of emphasis crept in to other English-speaking cultures? A quick
google suggests that it has. Weird, man.)

Two gigatons on Luna does not register down here. You'll sure see it, and
it might generate a very small EMP, but that's about all.

Assuming, you want to create antimatter, you would not want to stay on a
planetary surface. An accelerator as a solar powered string of devices in
a circular orbit around Luna (built on an launched from surface) would
have free vacuum, circular beam path, cheap energy, and safety from
accidents (but would be a veritable weapon, of course).

(c) design a way to do what you want while staying in the

Lately I am down enough on the way things are going to  doubt if 

anything but some variant of (c) is currently viable.

huh?  Don't grok "MMORPG".  The holy google leads me to think it 
has something to do with the gaming universe.  But I am not a 
dweller in that space so I am not sure what it is about.

Is this what you meant by "virtual"?  I more have in mind 
building alternate secure, trusted, private communication, 
information and processing pools, economics, trade and so on 
online outside of the prying eyes and disasterous laws and 
politics of the every day meat space and its mirroring on the Net.

You must be kidding.  Everquest is a stupid addictive mind-fuck 
game that has absorbed some of my friends and kept them from 
doing anything productive for quite some time now.  Please say 
you are kidding.

I am not a player but the space is much too limited and 
constrained to be a real viable internet community, much less 
the framework for a new civlization.  Bad drugs.

It is in no way a simulation of "real life".  It is a game 
cleverly designed to suck you in for more and more hours.

Now, I do agree that it is very interesting designing and 
playing games to work out alternate ways of doing things, 
creating value and so on.  And of course, "real" virtual worlds

Yes.  But you have to allow a lot of freedom, at least as much 
as in the real-world, to have a true virtual society/world 
evolve.  You need a set of basic "physical" laws and a few 
constraints on the inhabitants.  You also need that world to be 
taken seriously and have serious potential for real gain and 
loss and the creation of real value.  It needs more than to just 
be "fun".

A decentralized peer-to-peer system has its own many problems of 
course.  Much of a virtual state would require massive amounts 
of storage of computational state.  Decentralizing that and yet 
keeping its coherency would require much cleverness and a lot of 
redundancy.  For some types of such worlds really meaty server 
machines are essential for many lesser classes of machine's 
owners to play at all.  The servers do not have to be stationary 
in meat or internet space of course, but they do have to exist. 
  Some stationary servers could also be in secret, hardened, 
difficult to stop, locations.  Perhaps you could even have such 
a thing claim the privileges granted to a religion and religious 
community.

You need real goods beyond entertainment items that are produced 
within the VR and real goods that flow in the reverse direction 
if you are going to effectively create a new kind of society in 
virtual space.  The current e-commerce might move into such a 
v-world in a big way.  Major data storage and representation, at 
least of some types, might turn out to be a natural.  But if you 
pull in real commerce from outside then outside laws and 
restrictions and politics come with it.  So this might not be a 
fine idea even if viable.  You need things that are produced 
naturally most competitively in such a space that are seen as a 
value outside.

Does it get us generally closer to the type of world we 
wish/need  to live in?  It doesn't look much like what my goal 
is.  On the one hand it is ghastly unpleasant and subject to 
tons of abuse.  On the other hand I wonder how much worse it is 
to sell all of one's hopes, dreams, ambitions, talent and 
productive time to merely eat and pay the rent while never 
claiming one's own dreams.  Selling a kidney seems almost clean 
in comparison. If a person can choose one questionable trade-off 
freely then why not the other?

Except in situations of unequal power and wealth the selfishness 
of the more powerful will, other things being equal, swam the 
self-interest of the weaker.  If people can be coerced and 
persuaded to do and go along with some of the stupid things of 
today then I find it very hard to believe that many could not be 
persuaded to part with an organ even if it was not, on 
reasonably objective analysis, in their interests.  If that is 
so then granting such trade legal status would legalize a 
nightmare with serious moral and health repurcussions.

One could argue that the virtual nation is (c). The only way, IMHO, to
change society via (c) is to amass enough economic clout to make existing
portions of society listen. Anything else is wishful thinking.

Massive(ly) multiplayer online role-playing game. For suitable definitions
of "massive", "multiplayer", "online" and "role-playing", of course.

That too, but you'll notice while many advocate this, no-one has a working
network/culture with more than 10k people in it. Compare with virtual
nations that exist in games: 10k people is pocket change.

Nope, not kidding. Put it this way: if 30-50% of your social interaction
time happens in place X, and there are 300,000 (or even a few thousand)
other people who say the same, I think you're going to have to start
redefining words in order to deny that place X is not the center of a
community.

I would note that EQ can be a "stupid addictive mind-fuck game" while also
being everything I say it is. "stupid addictive mind-fuck game" pretty much
describes most people's experience with their meat lives too.

Productive is as productive does. Any successful/skilled EQ player can
convert their EQ work time (i.e. time spent accumulating platinum, items,
leveling, etc) to meat world money quite efficiently, thank you, thanks to
black markets. There are real world groups that make a living doing just
this; one of them is sueing the makers of Dark Age of Camelot right now to
prevent them banning such trades.

Au contraire, it is absolutely a simulation of real life; specifically real
capitalist life. In order to get ahead in EQ, you have to be industrious.
You have to "work" -- perform tasks that are often repetitive and not
necessarily that interesting. Sometimes "work" is cool, like when you work
with your friends, or finish off a major task that gives you a sense of
satisfaction. Doing well allows you leisure time, spend chatting and
socializing, showing off whatever presige you earned in your work.

If you play these games at all, you understand how they mimic real economic
life. People socialize, and then it's "ok, back to work" to power level,
find that next 100 platinum, etc.

So really, mmorpgs like this are work holidays, I guess.

Well, gah, what am I proposing here, but to use gaming mania to solve a
real, important problem?

The thesis of my post was that people can pontificate and design
bootstrapped virtual worlds all they like, and they'll be roundly ignored as
they have been for decades. They're ignoring the herd of elephants (virtual
proto-nations based on games) next door. MMORPGs will spawn real virtual
nations; it seems all but inevitable at this point. The only question will
be which direction will they head in?

No you don't, no it doesn't. People build complex communities with intricate
rituals, histories and mores on FPS shooter servers, you know, let alone in
MMORPGs.

I'd suggest you bite the bullet and dive in and play some of these games for
a little while. Do some research. If you think that people don't take these
game worlds seriously, that the level of rules and laws are inconsistant
with real societies, then you definately need to go look at the communities.

All of which is currently researched, white papered, planned, theorized,

Not at all. Meaty server machines can be emulated in some classes of
decentralized system. Again, go research.

When you start talking about macroeconomics; i.e. virtual nation with
serious economic clout talking turkey with real nation with serious economic
clout, large servers in any location are vulnerable to shutdown via any
number of means. An inconvenienced real nation will take that course because
it is cheaper than the alternatives. Look at RIAA vrs file trading networks
for the economic realities underlying this sort of decision tree. Morality
and ethics don't really come into it.

Not really. If anything, an MMORPG client takes up less bandwidth than

It takes two years to roll out a decent product in the corporate software
world. That's unlikely to change before the end of the decade, if then. It's
a management process thing.

So, two years for the decentralized internet operating system thingy (which
will be simulateously brought out by Microsoft as a .NET extension, and by
Sun+other companies as a set of extension APIs to the Java standards), and
then two years after that the first large professionally-produced games
based on it.

I've always said you singularitarians have your clocks wound too tight.
Barring someone getting lucky with a hard takeoff, society as a whole isn't
going to roll out a singularity within the next ten to twenty years.

Why would this be? Have you checked the internation money flows for
tangibles vrs intangibles recently?

Entertainment. Artificially created rare intangibles (the present MMORPG and
other collectable markets). Access. Processor time. Services (guides,
trainers, etc).

Restrictions and politics always come with it; that's why you need economic
muscle to defend against them.

You get whatever the virtual nation can muscle out of existing nations via
simply having stuff to trade. Dual citizenship, preferential treatment,
access to money markets. Like being an ex-pat. As soon as sufficient flow
across borders exists, money changers spring up. So get paid in virtual
currency, avoid real nation income taxes, use money changers.

I can see income taxes being the first line of battle, actually. If you have
a significant body of people productively working in a virtual nation and
not paying much in the way of income taxes to the real nation, that's going
to put noses out of joint.

Anders needs to post his RPG background for a revolutionary virtual nation
concept to the list...

Agreed.  It is a strange turn of phrase.  To me the argument 
that natural rights grow out of the fact that humans, by virtue 
of their specific nature, require certain conditions in order to 
  live and thrive most optimally and a subset of those are 
basically rights to their own person, property and pursuits - 
the so-called "negative rights" - comes closest to a 
justification for natural rights.

Give the above notion of natural rights the natural rights exist 
regardless of whether they are honored by any particular ruler 
or mob.  Judging the actions of the rulers or mobs is done 
relative to supporting or denying these "natural rights", these 
requirements for human well-being.  This seems much more 
reasonable than attempting the reverse, judging the concept of 
natural rights on the basis of whether this or that leader or 
group would honor and uphold them.   Saying they are a social 
contract, in my opinion, makes a similar mistake.  It puts the 
emphasis on upholding these rights rather than on whether 
certain "rights" naturally are required by dint of the nature of 
human beings.

What your nature requires relative to the actions of others or 
their refraining from certain actions for your optimal 
functioning does not change based on how they do in fact act 
toward you.  Natural rights therefore are not a matter of social 
contract.  Social contracts, if they are rational, grow out of 
these "natural rights" - not the reverse.

Our behaviour towards other species but a few selected (crops, pets,

If we're dumb enough, we can create something which will do the same thing

YES, Samantha (and excellent post, btw). Where exactly does 'human
nature' come from? From evolution, of course, a physical process that
depends on how matter and energy interact within the rules of physical
law. It is abstracted, certainly, but it is still quite a matter of
objective truth about how the universe works.

It also says that rights are only granted by the grace and goodwill of
whatever group amasses enough power to dictate. This is nothing but
fascism.

Excellent conclusion, Samantha. Amazing, we agree on something, isn't

Actually, after Chicago's treatment plants, it's pretty nice. Lake 
Michigan, on the whole, is one of the cleanest of the Great Lakes, 
surpassed only by Superior.

Isolated areas like Waukegan Harbor (PCBs from Outboard Marine and asbestos 
from Johns-Manville) and the Calumet Harbor - Gary, Indiana area ARE pretty 
ripe, though.

In Cary, the water is ancient, from a 600 - 1000 foot deep aquifer 
stretching into mid-Wisconsin - and the water level is dropping. A piquant 
trace blend of barium and radium, with a dash of TCE for that special zing. 
Since most of the growth in Northern Illinois is occurring in areas like 
mine, it can only get worse.

Illinois is limited by international agreement to how much Lake Michigan 
water we can take - and where we can use it. Lake water has to be used on 
the lake side of the ridge in the watershed - roughly three miles east of 
where I live - presumably so the used water goes back into the lake basin. 
Only problem with that theory is that all treatment plants in Northern 
Illinois dump their effluent into the Illinois River system, and then into 
the Mississippi. I guess bureaucrats can't take into account subtleties 
like that.

I always wondered why we can't use the reclaimed sewage in a second, 
non-potable system strictly for flushing toilets, washing clothes, and 
irrigation and industrial uses. If the effluent is as clean as they keep 
claiming, accidental ingestion would not be a problem.

Looks like I was off (high) a couple of orders of magnitude on c - serves 
me right for not looking it up...

Even a megaton release would make life uncomfortable for the residents / 
operators of the fuel plant , if any. A small industrial accent could wipe 
out the whole plant. Expensive...

Can the reaction be done remotely enough so there's little or no danger of 
containment failure resulting in a blast?

There's room for a lot of innovations here. One might have an alternate
U.S. where Gore is president, for example. The system may be more
important than the specific setting. You might be a citizen in hundreds
of virtual worlds. Perhaps one would be a world where you're luxuriating
in a resource-rich environment whilst simultaneously trying to avoid
alien bloodsucking predators, which might be like living at home with
your parents ;-)

As for exports, how about AI's? Imagine an FPS where the computer
opponents learn continuously during the course of the game. When you
start the game initially, the bad guy just stands there and shoots at
you, without any tactics or evasions. With some basic concepts
programmed in (e.g. walls are opaque and bulletproof). But if the
program could learn over time how to be a challenging opponent, the
resulting code might be marketable to game companies.

How about a game where you're a room mate in a group house, and the
object is to clean the house. As folks compete to clean various
combinations of houses and messes, you build up huge databases, which
might then be marketable as customized choreographed housecleaning
routines, so housemates get a detailed plan to follow that minimizes
their housecleaning time. Seems to me the concept of evolved
choreography could be used in many projects involving physical movement.

In any case one can always spend years practicing Quake and then compete
in tournaments...

Since I work from home, making websites, and also spend a great deal of
time just reading sites and seeking out ones that are innovative or
aesthetically pleasing, I pretty much live in a virtual world right now.
Since I used to commute (often lengthy distances), and do my reading
from books and magazines, my current situation allows for a considerably
lighter workweek (I consider it good if I do 25 billable hours in a
week) and lets me save money and enjoy a 'virtually' better lifestyle
than I had previously. (Of course, I consider reading about web issues
leisure time activity, and if one considers this 'work', then by that
definition I work 50+ hours a week.)

The Colorado river water basin is a good example of the problem of poor
freshwater utilization, though in a more complex and political sense than
merely dumping it into the ocean.  In the case of the Colorado river, the
desert States view it as an essential and critical resource as they depend
on it almost by necessity.  California depends on it mostly in the sense
that it is cheap and convenient for California, though that state has many
potential freshwater resources at its disposal.

By legal treaty in 1922, both the States of Arizona and Nevada (among
others) have substantial water rights along the Colorado river basin, as
does California.  A problem is emerging in that California has been taking
FAR more water, to the tune of several million foot-acres (1 foot-acre ~=
1.2 million liters), out of the basin than it has been legally entitled to
for many decades and has in fact become dependent on it as a source of
cheap/free water.  Nevada and Arizona have overlooked this fact for some
time because they weren't actually drawing their full allotment and were
letting the water flow on through to California.

Fast forward to the late 1990's, after a couple decades of sustained growth
and population booms in Nevada and Arizona. (For those interested, the State
of Nevada has sustained an average 5% annual population growth for decades,
the highest in the nation, due primarily to an intentionally favorable
economic climate; everything is cheap, taxes are comparatively non-existent,
and regulatory red tape is kept to a bare minimum.  Not bad for a State that
most people think of as a desert wasteland.)  First Arizona, and then Nevada
start asserting their rights to the water in the Colorado river basin to
feed their growing cities (e.g. Las Vegas, which has grown explosively),
since that region of both States literally have no substantial aquifers or
water sources except the Colorado river.  California then goes ballistic and
wants to continue using the cheap water they've enjoyed for ages despite the
fact that California entered in a legal treaty that guarantees them no more
than a certain amount of water will travel downstream.  A political mess
ensues.

I'm not sure where I was going with that, but freshwater distribution is
among the biggest factors of where populations can viably concentrate.
California has vast water resources within the state, controlling almost the
entire Pacific Coastal Water Basin, but have managed the distribution and
usage of it relatively poorly.  People in California don't live where the
water is, and prefer to tap the easily accessible water supplies of the
desert States to their east which have no other alternative.  One of the
problems is that the political system often wants to bend resource
allocation to fit political desires rather than produce the most efficient
utilization.  Even the deep desert States could enjoy relatively high
population densities if the freshwater resources were managed efficiently.
Unfortunately, there is a tendency to manage such resources politically
instead.

When I was stating that North America could support 2 billion people without
straining the environment, I was assuming sane resource management.  Even a
harsh desert State like Nevada could sustainably support around 10 million
people on its own resources and most regions of the United States (never
mind Canada and Mexico) could support far higher population densities.  I'm
not suggesting that we pave the continent with suburbia, just that vastly
higher efficiencies could be achieved in resource management if politics
wasn't skewing the economics so severely.  North America is barely using
some of its resources and wasting most of the rest through inefficiency.

Fresh water is an interesting example because the legal tradition east of
the Rocky Mountains is that fresh water is infinite in supply.  West of the
Rocky Mountains, and particularly in the intermountain regions, the legal
tradition has always treated water as a very finite commodity.  I think in
some ways the West has handled this much better than the East, in part
because the West has not had to overturn a couple centuries of legal
assumptions.

Your information might need updating if you're basing your opinion of Lake

       Companies, political parties and governments pay a great deal of money

There are many think tanks, Quangos and consumer groups out there that

One gram of matter reacting with one gram of antimatter produces a 43

Well. we have 20-odd megatons and 43 kilotons.  Are we all using the same

I agree with your c) option.  A virtual nation (VN) or virtual community 
(VC) *might* be one way to do that on a larger than personal scale.  I'm 
not fully convinced of this yet.

One problem I see is that a game universe is populated by those *with* a 
"like mind", i.e. they want to play the game.  A virtual nation wouldn't 
have that any more than a real nation does.  You'd have conflicting 
desires, attitudes and varying capabilities and resources and the end 
result would a duplicate of the real world - a Darwinian competition with 
losers and winners.  One interesting question would be:  would the nature 
of the VN change the nature of the winners - i.e., would Transhumanists 
tend to be the winners if they built the VN?

Reason's basic problem is he assumes you need a "fairly large number of 
potentially right-minded people".  I'm not convinced there is such a 
number.  I suspect "true" Transhumanists (or even sympathizers) are less 
than one percent of the population.

I would like Reason to detail how the Everquest people are doing 
black-market economics in the real world.

See my reply to Reason on Hakim Bey's (Peter Lamborn Wilson) "T.A.Z." 
(Temporary Autonomous Zones) - a similar concept.  I wonder if Wilson has 
considered MMORPGs.

The problems with Reason's notion that the game could be designed to 
support a lib development is simply that the game rules can be subverted, 
hacked, or - if irritating enough to enough people - simply abandoned.  The 
more the game must approximate the real world, the less likely the game 
world can control real-world behavior *in* in the game.

I agree with you that it need to be more than just "fun".  But "fun" 
shouldn't be ignored.  How about a game where sex and its pursuit and 
satisfaction was a factor.  THAT might bring in a LOT of people and be VERY 
profitable - and influential as well in altering attitudes.  That would 
attract state oppression, of course, but the state's inability to control 
the 15 million or so porn sites bodes ill for their suppressing a virtual 
"Sex World" - especially if the system were as distributed as the Internet 
is and more so using encryption, peer-to-peer technology, etc.

As for bandwidth, that's coming, if more slowly than originally 
expected.  As for computation needs,. you have Linux Beowulf cluster 
technology - free and effective and a way to use those 300 million obsolete 
PCs we read about.  A peer-to-peer network of Beowulf clusters and more 
work on true distributed processing might produce enough power to run a VN 
or VC with some security.  In any event, in ten to twenty years, the 
computing power will be here.  Intel is predicting 20GHz PCs within the 
next three years...

I agree with Reason that a Singularity is unlikely within five years.  I 
give it a minimum of twenty years and don't really expect it until around 
2050 give or take ten years.

As to products produced in such a v-space, again virtual sex must lead the 
way as it has on the Net.  Again as indicated above, this leads to 
suppression, but the question remains:  how effective a suppression?

I agree that a VN might help c).  See my response to Samantha 
elsewhere.  However, I am no longer interested in changing society on a 
large scale per se until I have the technology to do it *directly* :-}  But 
a VN (or VC for virtual community) *might* be a way to change one's 
*personal* society and survival prospects.  And you're right that economic 
clout is a prerequisite (along with technology) to having any effect at all 
on society.

Have you read Hakim Bey's (Peter Lamborn Wilson) "T.A.Z." (Temporary 
Autonomous Zones)?  Based on Situationist concepts from the 1960's on the 
"derive" and "permanent party", it's a concept of forming free zones that 
are temporary and mobile.  I thought Bey was not convinced of the Net being 
of any real use in implementing the concept, but that was before 
peer-to-peer and MMORPGs which might change his mind.

I do agree with you that 300,000 is definitely a community - even 10,000 is 
one.  I used to moderate a conference on the WELL in the 1980's and anyone 
there will tell you that the WELL is a community.  The question is:  Can 
you constrain the *kind* of community you build with game rules while 
*still* reflecting the real world enough to build a *real* community?

The problem with the game notion being a basis for a VN, as I said to 
Samantha, is that the people are there to *play a game* - not to build a 
virtual world that reflects or interacts with the real world.  So you have 
a group of people in place.  But the more they reflect the real world, the 
more your game world will reflect the real world.  Not good if you intend 
to build some sort of lib community.

Please detail how the Everquest people are engaging in black-market 
trade.  I'm very interested in this cross-over.

This is precisely my concern.  I would suggest that there would be multiple 
VNs heading in all directions - just like the real world.  The interesting 
issues are:  will they come into conflict?  How?  Will the computer network 
protocols they run on keep them separate despite cross-overs of people from 
one to another - or hackers?  And will a proliferation of VNs make it 
easier to select your own desirable community?  Will the old lib 
"proprietary community" notion be realized here?

That's true - but I'm not interested in wasting my precious survival time 
like they are on pointless pursuits.  There has to be a real-world benefit 
or why bother?  In the 1970's, I played one of the first "Shoot Down the 
Airplane" games on an Altair (or maybe it was a Processor Tech) - I wasted 
two hours on that and, realizing that games are an addicting waste of time, 
swore never to do it again.  I have played a couple games when I owned an 
Atari 520 ST, and I'm very impressed with the current crop of games which 
are more like movies than games - but that just means I'd waste even more 
time on them :-}

On the other hand, how about SEX?  As I mentioned to Samantha, a VN built 
around a "Virtual Sex-World" would attract a LOT of people and probably be 
enormously profitable...

I guess I'll have to do some research, since the notion intrigues me as a 
means of revenue generation [I'm on Welfare at the moment :-}]

I agree.  The bandwidth and computation issues can be resolved within five 
or ten years with optical networking, Linux Beowulf cluster technology, and 
more work on true distributed computing.  Intel is projecting 20GHz PCs 
within three years.

BTW, the open-source people are reverse-engineering Microsoft's .NET to 
insure that the open-source community such as Linux can interoperate with 
it.  I'd back that since I *don't* want Microsoft honeycombing *my* VN with 
their spyware and security flaws.

I agree.  My estimate is at the low end 2020 and more likely around 2050 
give or take ten years.

As for entertainment goods, again, how about SEX?  A VN with complete 
sexual freedom and potent scenarios would attract many participants - more 
than anything else I can think of.  The resulting economic clout - look at 
the 15 million porn sites bringing in billions.  For *real* clout, however, 
you would need to enter the financial markets, as you indicated, or have an 
effect somehow at large commercial/industrial market exchanges and 
ecommerce.  But sex would be a huge jump-start...

I don't expect a VN to really be able to muscle any serious concessions out 
of real states - they'll go to war first.  You have to be able to threaten 
the real state in the real world with real technology.  Remember - the real 
states have real guns and those guns work without computers.  However, real 
personal benefits such as tax evasion could accrue in the physical world, I 
agree.

Hmm. I wasn't thinking transhumanists when I wrote that. More libertarians,
or at least those who don't like stupidity and government in every bowl of
cereal each morning.

By "those with a like mind" I mean people who want to spend a significant
fraction of their time socializing/living/working in the virtual nation.
This doesn't have to overlap with a particular political or socioeconomic
view if they're just doing it because it's fun or economically beneficial
(see the taxes thing again).

The EQ dictatorship (Verant), with the cooperation of the US and EU legal
systems, forbids the trading of EQ intangibles for real world money. With
some cooperation in suppression from real world marketplaces (such as eBay).
Therefore all such markets are black markets; you are breaking real world
contracts (and possibly laws) and EQ laws if you do this.

True, and that's the goal to be aiming for. There's nothing wrong with
subverting or abandoning rules if the populance of the virtual nation want
to do it. Goes on all the time in existing games, and it's just another part
of the cultural complexity.

My original point was not to control people's behavior; I'm very much
against that. It's to provide a place to start over with a new nation (a
slew of new nations), which can prehaps prompt people into seeing that there
are other, better ways to run a society beyond the one that has been settled
on in the meat world today. If they then want to abandon that and recreate
big, invasive governements as virtual nations then so be it. But in theory,
there are enough libertarians in the world to populate a libertarian virtual
nation; such would arise in the natural give and take of virtual nation
ecology once the concept goes mainstream. And if the claims about
laissez-faire capitalism are right, said nation should wind up very
influential.

This game is being played right now on dating sites the world over. You
don't need to put this into a game; it just happens. The same goes for
everything else; economics, social hierarchies, politics, sex -- it will all
fit itself into any space in which more than three people are talking on a
regular basis. All the designers of the gamespace have to do is not get in
the way.

I have yet to see someone explain to me how the human need to breathe, eat, 
sleep, and excrete and reproduce translates into a "right" which is somehow 
a physical law.  This is nothing but hand-waving.

"Codified physical law" is hand-waving.  There is the physical universe 
which includes biology and evolution.  There are human concepts of 
same.  The map is not the territory.  A human concept is not a physical law 
(in fact, "physical law" is a merely a human concept - and there are 
scientists who are not so sure that there ARE "physical laws" operative 
throughout the Universe).

This still begs the question:  why is the concept "rights" needed?  You 
have basic human physical needs.  Why elevate them to "rights" unless you 
are trying to score points in a moral debate?  A principle of Objectivist 
epistemology, I recall, is that concepts should not be multiplied beyond need.

Human behavior as individuals and groups is based on human "nature", i.e., 
the structure of our bodies and brains and our physical and cultural 
evolution - and to an enormous degree on our primate evolutionary 
heritage.  This behavior considered as a whole can be modeled by various 
sciences and by economic theory a la Von Mises praexology [or is that 
praxeology - I can never remember the spelling :-} ]  Such an economic 
analysis leads to the conclusion that coercion on a large scale or as a 
general principle of behavior is not productive for a group of sentient 
conceptually processing entities as a whole.  No "natural rights" are 
needed - it is simply not productive and therefore not conducive to 
survival and therefore not in the best interests of such entities to engage 
in coercion as a behavioral principle.

The reality, however, is that humans as part of their basic nature as 
biological entities fear death.  This translates into the same basic two 
reactions as any other animal:  fight or flight.  In humans, with 
imagination and conceptual processing capability, this is expressed in two 
ways for each reaction.  Fight:  1)  self-development or controlling one's 
personal being (examples might be bodybuilders, martial artists, whatever). 
2) Concern with understanding and controlling external reality (examples 
might be scientists, technologists, etc.)  Flight Response: 1) Stand up and 
wave your arms and try to attract the attention of the "gods" who might 
give you more life if you stand out from the herd (examples:  anyone in the 
public eye and anyone who tries to establish themselves as morally superior 
to everyone else, e.g., priests and philosophers and moralists of every 
stripe); 2) Tear down everyone above you and stamp on everyone below you 
(examples:  virtually everyone, especially politicians).

Instead of recognizing the universe has plenty of resources and the way to 
survive is to use our conceptually processing capability to take advantage 
of those resources, i.e., fight response, - defy and defeat death by using 
our mental and physical resources - the vast bulk of the human race (at 
least 98-99%) engage in flight response, producing a Darwinian competition 
"war of all against all" which leads to the world you see around you.

See Alan Harrington's work "The Immortalist" - probably the most important 
book ever written on the impact of death on human society.

Without relieving the species' fear of death, there is no way you are going 
to override that fear and its flight response with talk of "rights", when 
those "rights" are merely concepts that will be accepted or rejected based 
on the individual's fear reactions.

The only rational argument for non-coercion is based on economic 
self-interest which in turn is based on the economic interest of the 
species as a whole.  This argument, however, cannot override genetically 
inbred fear, either.

The issue of "rights" is IRRELEVANT to the issue of personal survival which 
is the only valid human purpose.  Personal survival demands dealing with 
the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.  One can certainly proceed on 
the basic of a principle of non-coercion, but trying to convince any 
significant portion of the species of the validity of this is a waste of 
time and therefore counterproductive.

Mike's notion that because human nature derives from evolution and the 
physical universe that this translates a concept into a "natural law" is an 
irrational and mystical concept.  See Robert Anton Wilson''s "The Myth of 
Natural Rights".

Slipped decimal points were even more frequent back in the days of slide
rules.

There are power-of-ten differences and factor-of-two differences in some of
the posted numbers. The factor-of-two difference is due to different starting
assumptions about taking the total converted mass as one gram vs. taking just
the antimatter mass as one gram.

Some errors in other folks' calculations could be in part attributable to an
incorrect/inconsistent value for c. You have to stick with one system (I used
SI, which is kilograms-meters-seconds) or you'll get powers-of-ten errors. In
particular, using a centimeters/sec value for c when one should be using
meters/sec will put you a factor of 10,000 off when you square c. 

As a sanity check, we can recall that c is roughly 186,000 miles/sec in
English units; this makes it about 300,000 _kilometers_/sec, or 300,000,000
_meters_/sec: 3 * 10^8, just about the number I used.

Eliezer and I agree. 1 g of antimatter + 1 g of matter yields 43 kt if we have
100% efficient conversion.

I'm pretty sure my numbers are right. 21.5 megatons per _kilogram_ of mass
totally converted, or 21.5 kilotons per _gram_ of mass totally converted. I
showed all my work in my earlier post.

That sounds like what we have in California, that Spike was referring to. 
Prices low enough that people don't worry about water except during an
emergency.  When supplies get tight, they don't raise prices, they pass short
term laws prohibiting you from washing your car, filling your pool, and in
extreme situations from watering your lawn.  (for the record, we don't have a
pool, and we let the lawn die planning to cnovert to strawberries  It's just
weeds now.)  The social pressure gets pretty extreme, too, with everyone
watching what everyone else is doing.  

If they'd just raise the prices, we'd use less when the use didn't make sense,
and people would find substitutes or alternative sources.  If prices went high
as often as we have below-normal rainfall, someone might think it was
worthwhile piping grey water around (recycled, cleaned, not clean enough to be
potable) for people to use in toilets and watering.  Instead we get
prohibition and reinforcement of the socialist way every few years.  

Same as we did during the energy crisis, since it was illegal to raise power
prices for consumers.  The social pressure and the race to "cooperate" during
the emergency was scary to behold.

I can see this sort of thing being the next logical step after VNs are
accepted and evolving. Some may do well enough to be able to establish
enclaves in meatspace for whatever reasons they need to do this; i.e.
renting land from real nations or other concerns. This can be a free flowing
affair or more static.

I would anticipate a parallel between the evolution of VNs and the evolution
of e-commerce businesses -- i.e. you have this first flurry of VNs, which
mostly fail, and then a fusion and cross-pollination between VNs and real
nations. (Bricks vrs clicks). A VN backed by a real nation would probably do
far better on the average. But there's still the opportunity for a VN
equivelant to Ebay or Amazon to spring up and do well enough to dicate terms
with real nations or do without their cooperation entirely.

The answer is yes. Go look at what is going on now in EQ and other MMORPG
guilds. Or FPS clans. There are free-roving communities that move between
proto-VNs even, just to add another level of complexity to the culture.

And there's nothing wrong with any of this. People can be there just to play
a game and will still found a community if you pass the critical mass of
players. One of the points of the original post was that the motivation of
turning up to play a game seems to be the only successful method for
establishing online communities. This goes right back to text MUD days -- I
played BatMud in Finland during the Zonni era, and that was very definately
a community. Only a few thousand players, if that, but with a vibrant
history and ongoing community. Very similar to EQ in the way it crudely
simulates economic life in the real world too.

I think this spans some of the ways:

http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&ht=1&Sort
Property=MetaEndSort&query=everquest

Most seem "legal" in that they're guides or training -- with that cute get
rich quick language thrown in free of charge. However, some are selling
intangibles (platinum), which isn't. They'll probably be cancelled by eBay
staff.

http://www.camelotexchange.com/DAOC.asp

Camelot Exchange is a bunch of guys who sell their fruits of their labors in
a couple of games. They can't do this in EQ, because Verant would kick their
accounts (=exile them) / take other action against them in the real world.

And of course, for everything you can find written down, there were no doubt
a bunch of unwritten trades conducted via the games or via contacts made
through the games.

Possibly all of the above, and none of it is bad. People do what people do,
and a vibrant VN ecology should have all of the above, I imagine.

Another of the points to my original post was that this is all about the
creation of new space in which to live your life and found/find a new set of
governing laws more suited to yourself. VNs seem easier, way cheaper and far
more underway than building islands or getting offplanet. EQ cost less than
$1,000,000 to get going, as did DAOC.

The real world benefit is economic in some way shape or form.

If you develop skill in something, you can always try to capitalize on that
skill. This happens in FPS games (tournaments for money), MMORPGs (black
market trading of intangibles), etc, etc.

True enough. I'm sure that will happen -- the pornographers are always on

Like everything else, it's a job. Which means you have to take time to get
good at it before you have any hope of making money. As it currently stands,
the per-hour compensation is not all that.

Have a look at the journals of fist de yuma:
http://www.crackednuts.net/asheron/index.php3?journal=3. Gives you some idea
on the immersive culture of Asheron's Call, another older MMORPG, and the
issues that players consider important.

A good rule of thumb would seem to be that if
state/organization/conglomerate A has a higher net worth than B, it can get
concessions and deals out of B. As in business, as in life. Look at 1st
world corporate dealings in 3rd world countries.

If we accept that EQ has a bigger economy than some countries right now
(yes, yes, I know it's flawed, but for the sake of argument), then if a
comparable game/virtual nation goes an talks to, say, Bulgaria, it may be
able to sort out trade agreements with that low-GDP country.

War is an economic thing too. If it costs less to come to an agreement, then
agreement will be come to. Macroeconomics and geopolitics are fairly
rational in that respect. So the trick for a VN is to cut deals and offer
opportunities that cost countries less than trying to stamp out a VN --
which would involve stamping on a large number of their own citizens.

I'd view the concessions and deals to aim at being: 1) recognition, 2) tax
issues, 3) dual citizenship for citizens, 4) standard exchange rate
machinations, 5) recognized access to capital markets. None of these are
really going to be a major economic problem for the country in question. If
the country already has Xk VN citizens who are not contributing to its GDP,
it may as well capitalize on them by granting the rights above.

Certainly many.  At first I was inclined to agree with you.  But on 
reflection,
I recalled that the hindu Vedas are an *oral* document - the rote-memorized
recitation trumps any written instantiation.  Likewise the
Zoroatrian Gathas were preserved by rote even after their literal meanings
were lost, and the dating of Zoroastrianism derives from linguistic dating of
the proto-Iranian language they embody.

As I think of religions as meme-complexes, I consider accurate long-term
preservation of memetic content the essential innovation.  Writing, without
doubt, provides a spectacular preservation medium, and does not require
the massive amounts of study and time verbal recitations require.   So
writing should boost the spread and survival of religions.  That
religions post-date writing (excepting probably Hinduism and Zoroastrianism)
may mostly be an epiphenomenom of the fact that powerful religions need
sophisticated societies to create them, and sophisticated societies generally
develop writing too.

Since those things are not what distinquishes humans from other 
animals they are clearly not a sufficient place to look for a 
nature based justification of what humans rights.  Reducing the 
argument to such inanities is worse than hand-waving.

Are you claiming that human beings hae no specific nature and 
that their nature does not lead to certain conditions being more 
optimal for their well being, particularly concerning their 
interaction with other people and instutions of same?  You have 
to claim this if you are going to utterly dismiss the argument.
  Physical laws are not the end and be all of what is real and 
important.  They are the basis of reality but do not utterly 
contain everything in reality, if you see what I mean.

I already answered that question.  And the second one by 
implication. It is a principle of Objectivism that rights are 
objective, derivable from reality.  If so there is no 
multiplication of concepts beyond need.  What exactly would you 
base ethics on if not on some understanding of what is required 
for human beings to function optiomally together?

What is required to freely act on the basis of one's thinking 
and conclusions?  Without that freedom, can humans make most 
effective use of their superior abilities to think and model 
reality?

Irrelevant. It is only by exercising our ability to think and to 
  understand our universe and act on that understanding to a 
high degree that we can ever hope to long postpone or even 
largely defeat death.  Therefore that which increases our 
abilities in these areas, our freedoms to pursue them and our 
freedom to act on our conclusions, is the most essential 
solution to the general problem as you set it up.  Those things 
required for such an increase are thus logical requirements of 
any system governing the interaction of human beings (ethics). 
One concept/phrase wrapping such requirements and delineating 
them is "natural rights".  We may argue about what is and is not 
such a requirement but I don't see how anyone can logically 
fault the general basis in our own nature for their being such 
requirements.

More assertion.  Personal survival is not the only valid human 
purpose.  The world as it is includes what is required by human 
nature for our own best functioning and the best function of our 
  organizations, society and species as a whole.  It is not 
counterproductive to point out where our best interests lie in 
anything more than the extreme short-term.

The problem is more environmental.  Many people want to restore the
Sacramento river delta and the various feeder rivers to their "pristine"
state.  The "pristine" state, almost by definition, includes no meaningful
water withdrawals, especially since the water mostly travels to SoCal
to evaporate/drain off there.  Similar concerns have applied to Mono
Lake, and now there are movements to restore Owens Lake.  
Acessibility is a nonissue.  California is voting to spend oodles of money
to *not* use water it has used in the past.

I just tried this game.  I took one hit and bit one bullet.  The bullet was 
bit because I said that evolution was essentially true, which the site 
decided meant that I thought it was certainly true, therefore my request 
for certain proof of God was irrational.  I deny this, so I bit the bullet 
and said I demanded more proof, which is the only option the site gives you 
since you can't argue with their premises or THEIR logic.

I took the hit because I said any being that could be called God should 
have the ability to do anything, but later denied that they could square a 
circle.  Obviously this hinges on one's notion of "anything".

This site is puerile and its logic questionable.  I had no trouble with the 
Loch Ness monster question but it does not logically follow that lack of 
proof equals non-existence.  Most of you skeptical types have a lot of 
trouble with that logic, as I know well from my past interest in 
UFOs.  However, in the case of God, the argument - as stated by Mike Siegel 
on Coast-to-Coast AM one night - that since you can't prove God does not 
exists somewhere in the universe, that means you cannot say that he does 
not exist.  This reduces the notion to stating that no matter what fanciful 
concept I may come up, if I cannot prove it does not exist by an exhaustive 
search of the universe, I must accept that it does exist.  This is not the 
case.  I can just as easily and correctly turn this around and say that if 
the only place I can prove something exists is in my own mind, then it is 
reasonable to conclude that it does not exist, in the absence of any other 
evidence.  The Loch Ness Monster and UFOS do NOT fit this criteria - there 
IS actual evidence (however weak or strong one may analyze it to be) - it 
is not merely a concept.  There is NO direct evidence for the existence of 
God - and a good deal of historical, cultural, and psychological evidence 
that the entire concept of God is based on human need to deal with the fear 
of death.

I was pleased to see, however, that the site recognized that my overall 
stance on these matters was remarkably consistent.  I was amused to see 
them state that my stance seemed to depend on attitudes that most other 
people would consider strange :-}  Found out as a Transhuman again!

Here's something that may surprise those who have never seen it:
Nevada is one of the most scenic states in the lower 48.  I would
put it in the top 3.  They never sell that much in their tourist
brochures, only the gambling and legal harlotry.  But Nevada has
much more to offer than that, so much more.  If you ever see
one of those pictures of the US from space, notice the area which
is Nevada: mountain range after mountain range, like grand
ripples on a massive sea.

Vacation hint: fly to Reno, rent a car, drive across highway 50
to Ely, turn north to Elko, drive west to Battle Mountain, take 305
all the way down to Tonopah and head back toward Reno.  Skip
the casinos and the whores, see what the great state of Nevada
is really about.  As a bonus, Nevada is second only to Alaska in
being libertarian.  spike

How do you get a critical mass of people in to the game if you can't make 
it fun or economically beneficial without that critical mass?  Sounds like 
a chicken and egg problem.  Unless you go with the sex idea - no problem 
getting people in on that basis, I would guess.)

Don't have any URLs.  This is underground sort of literature - anarchist

of San Francisco.  Do a search on Autonomedia - I think they publish his stuff.

But how do you keep the game going as you want it to if no one is playing 
by the rules?  What distinguishes the game from being the real 
world?  Where is the benefit of playing a virtual world if in fact it is 
indistinguishable from the real world?  I'm having trouble understanding 
your point.  On the one hand, you suggest creating a game that supports a 
lib viewpoint, on the other hand you say if doesn't matter if the players 
ignore that viewpoint and act against it.

"In theory there are enough libs."  I'm not sure.  And I really doubt there 
are enough libs - let alone Transhumanists - to provide several hundred 
thousand or several million members of a given VN enough to provide real 
economic benefits to the players let alone clout in the real world.  I 
think you are much too optimistic on the numbers.  On the other hand, if 
you abandon the lib VN concept, one could create a VN with large numbers of 
players IF there was a hook (such as sex) to draw them in in the first place.

The Libertarian Party has been trying for thirty years to build its 
strength.  They have probably no more than 30,000 members - out of a 
national population of 300 million.  And it took them thirty years to build 
that - an average of 1,000 members a year.  And these are relatively hard 
core libs.  You'll never get 300,000 libs into a VN at that rate.

If you drop the political stance, however, the question arises:  what will 
the VN look like?  (I do need to research the existing MMORPGs, I suppose, 
if I can find the time.)

If sex - or anything else - doesn't need to be put in the game, then what's 
the point of the game?  I'm trying to pin down what this game is supposed 
to do besides waste time in imaginary pursuits.  On the one hand, you 
suggest all sorts of benefits - on the other, you say these things already 
go on without the game.  So why play the game?

Ja, and the scarier part is we may reelect the same state "government"
that created these problems before.  If there were more tech jobs
there, I would leave Taxifornia for Nevada.  spike

Ah, so we base the discussion on conceptual processing and imagination, 
eh?  And do we ignore the lack of same in the bulk of the species?  Ayn 
Rand's own irrationality was amply analyzed by Nathaniel Branden in an 
article he wrote.  I do not reduce the argument to those "inanities" - your 
attempt to simplify my argument to that level is incorrect.  I still have 
yet to hear anyone translate the human capacity for conceptual processing 
or any other human need into a need for a "natural law".

Obviously I am not claiming anything of the sort - do not put words in my 
mouth.  Of course humans have specific needs - what I am objecting to is 
the unnecessary transformation of a need into a mystical concept of "right".

You have not answered the question except with more hand-waving.  It may be 
a principle of Objectivism, but they did not derive it logically either 
except with hand-waving.

I am amused that some people few the notion of ethics as a given essential 
of the universe.  If something does not fit their "ethics"  they cannot 
comprehend why it exists.  To be precise, there is in fact no need for 
ethics at all.  What is needed is a set of principles by which one can act 
in a social context and which provide the most likelihood of satisfying 
one's survival needs.  If you wish to call these principles "ethics", feel 
free.  I call them principles, so as not to expand concepts beyond need and 
in the bargain burden a concept with mystical baggage.

Not at all.  One concept is based on mysticism ("rights"), one on 
demonstrable economic analysis of the behavior of large groups of 
people.  One concept is based on "natural law" - a meaningless concept - 
and one is based on practical results - productivity or non-productivity 
toward a specific purpose - survival of the individual and the species.

That is itself opinion.  I did not go into the detailed derivation of the 
principle of non-coercion via economic behavior because it would be too 
extensive - and in any event I have not done so in so long I might remember 
all the details.  The short version is simply that coercion is an attempt 
to achieve monopoly profit.  To the degree that it succeeds, others will be 
motivated to invest in coercion in the same manner as investors invest in 
any activity that shows a substantial profit.  The result of this 
investment is the business life cycle - eventually the profit is reduced to 
the average rate of return.  The result of investing in coercion would be a 
society (much like the present one, I guess) where the bulk of activity 
goes into non-productive security and defense or coercion (which does not 
produce but merely distributes wealth).  One therefore can see that as a 
general social principle, coercion is non-productive and therefore 
contra-survival.  No mystical "rights" are needed to derive this conclusion 
- merely common sense as to the behavior of others and the results of that 
behavior.

One has THAT freedom at all times.  The question is:  does one have the 
physical freedom to act.  One always can think and model reality;  the 
question is can one act on one's conclusions?  Obviously I understand that 
- the point is irrelevant to the question of rights because, again, no one 
has established that rights either exist as a valid concept or have any 
effect on preventing coercion in the real world.

Oh, really?  If you look at the motivation of virtually anyone in the 
public eye (at least those who have striven to be there, not been 
accidently thrust there), and especially at the motivation of those who 
proclaim that THEIR way is the only way and anyone who disagrees is morally 
inferior. it is clear that the intent is to elevate themselves above others 
first and foremost before any other goal.  And the motivation for THAT is 
the fear of death.  Read Harrington's "The Immortalist".

Your characterization of my analysis as "simple stimulus/response" is an 
example of how you view yourself as vastly superior to the ordinary primate 
from which you evolved.  You aren't THAT superior.  You DO have those 
reactions built into your brain.  I recognize that in myself.  The 
difference is that I recognize it in others as well.  I imagine once they 
get through sequencing the pygmy chimp genome that people are going to be 
in for a big surprise at just how little difference there is between humans 
and chimps.  We already know that the difference is around 1.5% of the 
genetic code.  I suspect we will discover that not much sequencing change 
is needed to get rid of the extra hair, provide an opposable thumb, change 
the facial features, and enlarge the brain pan...

There IS no system governing the interaction of human beings.  There is 
only the world as you see it now.  Nor will there be such a system without 
major changes in human nature - which will come with the Singularity - at 
which point the need for such a system will become moot as Transhumans are 
not humans and will not need the sort of governance you suggest.

Wrong - "natural rights" is a concept which states that such requirements 
are "natural law" - again, no one has ever demonstrated the notion of 
"natural law" or "natural rights" - nor will they because the concept of 
rights is a mystical concept.  See Wilson's "The Myth of Natural Rights".

Oh,. yes it is.  There are no values without life - continuity of 
existence.  That means that survival is the only primary purpose of any 
living entity.  All other values are secondary and dependent on the 
survival of the entity.  THAT much Ayn Rand got right.  Do not mistake my 
use of the term survival for some low-level notion that implies struggling 
through life and then dying.  I use the term in the sense William Burroughs 
did when he said, "Survival must be calculated in immortal terms.  Beware a 
fool's survival."  I refer to survival as indefinite continuity of 
existence.  Whether the physical universe will permit true "immortality" 
(i.e., existing "forever" - whatever that may mean) is irrelevant; the goal 
remains the same.  Once you realize what that means, and think about it, 
you will discover that there are corollaries to that conclusion which lead 
to radical changes in philosophy and attitude.  THAT is what it means to be 
a Transhuman.

There certainly are. But you can't package a mailing list, and a think
tank that does not think about questions specific to your company's
interests or show how their issues relate to your interests will not be
particularly worthwhile. You can certainly mine the list for good ideas,
or even insert ideas into it to see if anybody comes up with anything,
but the actual interface with companies and organisations has to be a
structured organisational entity that can deal with them in the
traditional way, make contracts, do quality control and so on. There is
a market for smart future-oriented commercial think tanks (I know this
because I'm involved with one), but they need a firmer organization than
a list or virtual community to work. I think it would be a smart step
for transhumanism to start up a number of such organisations right now,
in order to really sell transhumanism to the world. My experience is
that it is far easier to convince people by selling them ideas, analysis
and papers than by giving them away.

For outdoor sportsman types, northern Nevada is frequently ranked as the top
spot in the U.S. just for the sheer concentration of outdoor activities
available.  The Reno/Tahoe area does in fact capitalize on outdoor tourism
fairly aggressively.  Within a one hour radius you can find superb examples
of just about every type of outdoor activity imaginable that doesn't require
an ocean.  The natural scenery is also pretty spectacular in that area, with
Lake Tahoe in the high Sierra, and Pyramid Lake just up the road (Pyramid
Lake being a large, kind of eerie looking desert lake with weird rock
formations which most people would recognize because it is frequently the
backdrop for car commercials and similar).  Guided hunting and fishing trips
are also big business for that region.

Nevada technically has 314 mountain ranges, of which there are at least a
dozen and a half major ones, with peaks ranging from 8,000-12,000 feet on
average.  The area behind the Sierra Nevada range (i.e. Nevada for the most
part) is the active crumple zone for the subduction of the Pacific plate.  A
number of the ranges have sections that are extremely young (read: less than
1 million years old) even though they may rise several thousand feet above
the local valley floor, and this explains among other things as to why
virtually every spring below 5,000 feet is geothermally heated to some
extent or another in northern Nevada (a lot of water does come from above
5,000 feet, but that is typically snow pack stored in granite tectonic
aquifers).

My personal take on this is that I *like* the fact that the boonies of
Nevada are extremely sparsely populated and visited.  The soil is excellent,
aspen and cherry forests abound, there is adequate supplies of fresh water,
the raw scenery is magnificent.  The youth and complexity of the geology
just lends to the character of the place.  Due to the collapse of the land
market there (since the Feds own too much to make the scattered private
parcels useful), land can be bought for less than $100/acre and good fertile
land with water and trees can be purchased for less than $500/acre.  A lot
of people are not aware that a large section of the agricultural business in
Nevada is providing extremely high-end vegetables to boutique and
high-priced restaurants.  Also, much of the wild game meat served in fancy
urban restaurants is hunted on huge preserves in Nevada (which has a
practically unlimited and very diverse supply of game animals due to the
relatively small number of people hunting them compared to the sheer size of
the State).  Nevada isn't a huge agricultural State, but the quality of what
they can produce in the local climates and soil (excepting range beef
perhaps) is second to none.

As a point of disclosure, I am the owner of a large tract in one of the
major mountain ranges in Nevada.  I picked it up for peanuts, but in any
other State you would have paid at least $5,000/acre for it.

This small item details the apparent manufacture of small quantities
of "tranparent aluminum"

http://www.sci-fighter.com/news/newsfeb02/feb21aluminium.php3 

it's listed as a weapon's technology, but i have to wonder, is this kind
of thing useful as a spacecraft material? and baking extremely finegrained
aluminum into transparency kind of implies this can be done to other
metals. titanium windows, anyone?

i'm kind of interested into what kind of equipment is really neccesary
for this kind of industry. i know heavy industry is dirty, big, and based
mostly on economies of scale. dominated by big players like AK steel
and so forth, but what if you're just interested in small quantities?
how hard is it to machine or work titanium/steel/aluminum? (no doubt
i've labeled myself, i realize they are fantastically different metals,
i'm just grouping them for basic metallurgic ignorance. also, is it realistic
to use titanium for lots of stuff, or is it just too expensive? or does
it not give advantages vs price?

woof. that was quite the paragraph of questions:

now for a little more grounded prose. is it technically feasible at this
point to begin developing programmable manufacture in these metals, within
certain bounds? that sounds like a fantastically interesting field(to
me as a programmer, anyway) or is all this silly. is the future in all
composites and carbon-fiber diamondoid constructions? is titanium no
longer cutting edge? is transparent aluminum all that useful? 

i'm just bounding full of questions today, but that' just because materials
engineering is so darn interesting, and i know so little about it. 

or maybe i just want to be the first guy on my block with a transparent
car engine. (that would be COOOL!) motorcyles that are even more impossible
to see at night. ultra stealth, imagine aircraft wings you can see through.
like glass. oooh, makes me shiver all over. glass houses, metaphor or
future fad?

i love technology. 

one million more!

If you read it just a *teeny* bit more carefully, you'll see that they were
talking about transparent _alumina_, not _aluminum_. A ceramic, not a metal.
Al2O3. Aluminum oxide.

I get really exasperated with sloppy terminology and incompetent
reporting.  It's transLUCENT aluminA, not transparent aluminum, dammit.
It's simply sintered aluminum oxide with particles significantly less
than 500 nm, so that it scatters visible wavelengths poorly.  If you
want it actually transparent, hell, just use crystalline alumina- better
known as sapphire.  'Taint cheap, though.  The sintered material is
probably tougher than sapphire, but still very brittle.  Glass makes
lousy armor.

Metals are inherently opaque precisely because they are electrically
conductive- once you get more than a few skin depths of material, the EM
field gets attenuated away to nothing.  Transparent aluminum or any
other metal is physically impossible.  It ain't often that I can state
something with such confidence.

While I'm being cranky, I also dislike cutsie writing without capital
letters.  e. e. cummings was clever and innovative, anyone else is
either too damn lazy to punctuate, or is trying waaay too hard to be
"artistic".  It's childish and derivative.

I actually remember seeing something (on Slashdot?) about someone doing just that. I would love to play that 
game, anyway, export or not. And it would also have the advantage of keeping my skills from stagnating as 
well. (On that note, I wish my computer did not seem to hate any sort of multiplayer gaming so much. *sigh*)

TAZ can be found at http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Temporary+Autonomous+Zone.
I don't know how complete it is, I don't have the bandwidth to go through and check the links to every chapter, 
but the node was created May 28, 2000, so it will either be complete or it will never be completed.
I'm surprised I've never heard mention of E2 here - I use it for reference more than Google. If AI

it.

Robot Exclusion Protocol

23 Feb 2002. A story about the Google of the future. By Paul Ford.

I took off my clothes and stepped into the shower to find another one
sitting near the drain. It was about 2 feet tall and made of metal, with
bright camera-lens eyes and a few dozen gripping arms. Worse than the
Jehovah's Witnesses.

``Hi! I'm from Google. I'm a Googlebot! I will not kill you.''

``I know what you are.''

``I'm indexing your apartment.''

``I don't want you here. Who let you in?''

``I am Google! I find many good things. I find that pair of underwear with
the little dice printed all over them. And I watch the tape of you with the
life-sized Stallman puppet. These are good unique things. Many keywords and
links! My masters will say 'much good job, little robot!' Many searchers
will find happy links of Stallman puppet see you! Ahhhh.''

``I put the robot exclusion protocol on my door. Didn't you see it?''

``You understand Google, person? I index many things and if I am very good
I get to go to Bot Park and have more processors. And an oiljob! Thank you
Google! Must come inside apartment and index. Must!''  His video eye winked
up at me.

``I know my rights. I'm giving you 10 seconds to leave.''

``Yes. I will leave. First I index everything. Everything! I am Google!''
It put out one of its video arms and began to read the label on my shampoo
bottle. So I beat it into shards with a folding chair and let it index the
dustbin.

In the study that was done on EQ's economy, I believe EQ had the 77rd highest GDP - right after Russia.

Heh. First the case modders did transparent cases - now they'll want transparent PSUs, hard drives, cd 
drives.... And I suppose then someone will find a way to make clear PCBs.
(I'm more on the silver aluminum and blue LEDs side of case modding... but I would LOVE to have clear PCBs. I 
doubt it's feasible, but I don't know a thing about the construction of PCBs.)

Hard to say, I don't think Verant are public. 300,000 people at $10/month is
not too shabby, however. But bear in mind that there are all sorts of major
maintenance costs associated with running an MMORPG; tech team, support
team, community building, monitors, billing, planned upgrades, etc, etc.

I'm guessing at the $1,000,000 as being dev costs (typical scalable
high-traffic business app costs $250,000 to $500,000, and then the same
again for the graphics and clients and excessive testing associated with an
MMORPG). In reality it could be more, and certainly every upgrade released
by Verant probably topped $1,000,000 again.

There are certainly a bunch of low-key, semi-single person or small crew
projects out there. The typical process is to build during an open alpha
test, acquire a community playing the game for free, then shop to a
publisher who will help you out with billing and distribution. That's how
Dark Space did it; having tried them out some time ago, I'd say they deserve
the success.

          "ANARCHY #42" Anti-copyright 1995 by B.A.L. Press, New York

[...]
By contrast, the anarcho-Extropian or futurians are also forced to
reify the eschaton -since the present is obviously not the utopia of
techn they envision- by placing perfection in a future where symbolic
mediation has abolished hierarchy, rather than in a past where such
mediation has not yet appeared (the ideal Paleolithic of the
primitivists). Obviously for the Extropians, mediation per se cannot be
defined as "impurity" or as the invariable source of separation,
alienation, and hierarchy. Nevertheless, it remains obvious that such
separation does in fact occur, that it amounts to immiseration, that it
is bound up in some way with techn and mediation, that not all
technology is "liberating" according to any anarchist definition of the
term, and that some of it is downright oppressive. The Extropian
therefore lacks and needs a critique of technology, and of the
incredibly complex relation between the social and the technical. No
one with any intelligence can any longer accept the notion of
technology as "morally neutral," with control of the means of
production the only criteria for valuation. The social and the
technological are somehow bound in a complex relation of co-creation
(or "co-evolution"), such that techn shapes cognition even as
cognition shapes techn. If the extropian vision of the future is
viable it cannot depend on "machine evolution" alone to achieve
realization. But unless anarcho-futurism can develop a critique of
technology, it is relegated precisely to this passive role. Invariably
a dialectic of "good" machines and "evil" machines is developed, or
rather of good and evil modes of social-technological relations. This
rather manichaean worldview however fails to efiminate or even plaster
over the contradictions which arise from such premises, and which
revolve around the "bad-fit" between human values and machine "logic,"
human autonomy and machine autonomy.
[...]
Now, when I talk about "the return of the Paleolithic" I find myself
leaning toward the primitivist position -and have consequently been
criticized by extropians for luddoid reaction, nostalgism, and
technophobia. However, when I talk about (say) the potential use of the
Internet in organizing a TAZ, I begin to tilt a little toward my old
SciFi enthusiasms and sound a bit like an extropian-and have
consequently been criticized by primitivists for being "soft on
technology" (like some sort of melting watch by Dali), seduced by
techno-optimism, by the illusion that separation can overcome
separation.

Both these criticisms are correct to some degree, inasmuch as my
inconsistency results from an attempt to think about techn and society
without any recourse to an inviolate system of absolute categories. On
the one hand, most of my thinking about technology was shaped by the
radical ad-hoc-ism and bricolage theory of the '60s and '70s, the
"appropriate tech" movement, which accepts the de facto link between
techn and human society, but looks for appropriate ways to shape
situations toward low-cost/maximal-pleasure tendencies. In fiction a
model is attempted by B. Sterling in his short-story "Green Days in
Brunei," a brilliant imagining of low-tech non-authoritarian solutions
to "3rd world" over-population and poverty. In "real" life a smaller
but most exquisite model is provided by the New Alchemy Institute,
which turns polluted sinkholes into arcadian springs with low green
technologies in cheap installations which are aesthetically beautiful.
On the other hand, I prefer the burden of inconsistency (even "foolish"
inconsistency) to the burden of the Absolute. Only an impure theory can
do justice to the impurity of the present -which, as everyone knows, is
only a psychological impossibility caught between a lost past and a
nonexistent future.

"Everyday life" is not a category -even "the body" is not a category.
Life -and the body- are "full of holes," permeable, grotesque -ad hoc
constructions already compromised with an impure empiricism, fated to
"drift," to "relativism," and to the sheer messiness of the organic.
And yet it is "precisely" here, in this imprecise area of contradiction
and "vulgar existentialism," that the creative act of autonomy and
self-actualization must be accomplished. Critiques can be directed at
the past or future, but praxis can only occur in the impure and
ontologically unstable here-and-now. I don't want to abandon the
critique of past-and-future-in fact I need it, in the form of a utopian
poetics, in order to situate praxis in the context of a tradition (of
festivity and of resistance) and of an anti-tradition (of utopian
"hope"). But I cannot allow this critique to harden into an
eschatology. I ask of theory that it remain flexible in, regard to
situations, and able to define values in terms of "the struggle for
empirical freedoms" (as one modern-day Zapatista put it). "Revolution"
no less than Religion has been guilty of promising "pie in the sky" (as
Joe Hill put it) -but the real problem of theory is (as Alice put it)
"jam today." The concept of the TAZ was never intended as an
abandonment of past or future -the TAZ- existed, and will exist -but
rather as a means to maximize autonomy and pleasure for as many
individuals and groups as possible as soon as possible -even here and
now. The TAZ exists -the purpose of the theory has been simply to
notice it, help it to define itself, become "politically conscious."
The past and future help us to know our "true" (revolutionary) desires
but only the present can realize them -only the living body, for all
its grotesque imperfection.

Suppose we were to ask -as anarchists- what should be done about the
problem of technology "after the revolution." This exercise in utopian
poetics may help us to clarify the question of desire, and of praxis in
the "present." The primitivist might argue that there can be no
revolution without the abolition of symbolic mediation, or at least of
the technological imperative; extropians might say that no revolution
can occur without technological transcendence. But both parties must
perforce admit a transitional stage, when de facto power has been
seized by the "Revolution," but the full unfolding of revolutionary
society has yet to occur. Let's imagine that the one rough principle
agreed upon by "everyone" is the freedom of the individual from
coercion by the group, and the freedom of the (self-organized) group
from coercion by all other groups. The only "price" of this freedom is
that it damage no other free and autonomous interests. This would seem
to be a minimalistic but adequate definition of basic anarchism. At
this point the primitivist may hold that the dialectic of freedom moves
irrevocably toward the re-appearance of the Paleolithic, albeit at a
"higher" and more conscious level than the first time around, since
this re-appearance will have been announced by revolution, by
consciousness. Similarly at this point the extropian may argue that the
further unfolding of freedom can only be envisioned as self-directed
evolution through the co-creation of humanity and its technology. Fine
and dandy. But now what? Are these two anarchist tendencies going to
become armies and fight it out to the last recalcitrant computer jock
or neo-wild-man? Are they going to force their visions of the future on
each other? Would such action be consistent with the basic anarchist
premise of -mutual non-coercion? Or would it reveal each of these
tendencies to be flawed by destructive and tragic contradictions?
[...]
Of course, everyone is free to play this game of utopian poetics with
different "rules," and different results. After all, the future does
not exist. However, I would like to push the implications of my
thought-experiment a bit further. I suspect that this "utopia" would
prove disappointing to both the primitives and the extropians. I
suspect that a workable utopia would adhere more closely to the "messy"
model than to either of the "pure" models of the pro-tech/anti-tech
theorists. Like bolo'bolo, I imagine a complex multiplicity of social
models co-existing under the voluntary aegis of the social "price" of
mutual non-coercion. In effect the primitivists will get less
wilderness than they demand, and the extropians will get less tech.
Nevertheless, all but the most fanatical extremists on either side will
be reconciled to the messy utopia of desire or so I predict -because it
will be organized around pleasure and surplus, rather than the denial
and scarcity expressed by the totality. The desire for wilderness will
be gratified at a level undreamed since the early Neolithic, and the
desire for creativity and even co-creation will be gratified at a level
undreamed by the wildest science fiction. In both cases the means for
this enjoyment can only be called appropriate techn -green, low
energy, high information. I don't believe in the abolition of symbolic
mediation, and I don't believe that separation can overcome separation.
But I do hypothesize the possibility of a much more immediate and
satisfactory experience of creation and conviviality through the human
(animal/animate) scaling of economy and technology -and this, however
untidy, I would call utopia.

If I have disagreed with both primitives and extropians here, it was
not to reject them as allies. The only useful purpose served by our
"after the Revolution" game is to shed light on our present situation,
and our possible options for concrete action here and now (more or
less). It seems to me that both the P's and E's are quite capable of
grasping the theory of "messiness" and the "impure" model of the TAZ. A
night, a week, a month of relative autonomy, relative satisfaction,
relative realization, would be worth far more to most anarchists than a
whole lifetime of absolute bitterness, resentment, and nostalgia for
the past or future. The most enthusiastic cyberpunk can still embrace
the "festal body," and the most savage primitives have been known to
succumb to civilized impurities such as beer, or art. I fear that a few
diehards in both camps will still sneer at our enjoyment -of the impure
TAZ or the impure uprising- because it falls short of the perfect
revolution. But realization arises only from direct experience, from
participation. They themselves admit this. And yet action is always
impure, always incomplete. Are they too fastidious? Will nothing suit
them both besides the void-wither of wilderness, or of cyberspace? Are
they dandies of the Absolute?
[...]
But at this present moment the TAZ (in its broadest possible sense)
seems to be the only manifestation of the possibility of radical
conviviality. Every non-authoritarian tendency should support the TAZ
because only there (aside from the imagination) can an authentic taste
of life without oppression be experienced. The vital question now
concerns the "technology" of the TAZ, i.e., the means for potentiating
and manifesting it most clearly and strongly. Compared to this
question, the problems of technology (or of zero-technology) take on an
air of theological debate -a ghostly and querulous other- worldliness.
My critics have a point -but it's aimed somewhere about 10,000 years in
the past, or "five minutes into the future," and misses the mark.

I must admit that my own taste inclines neither toward Wilderness World
nor spaceship Earth as exclusive categories. I actually spend far more
time defending wildness than "civilization," because it is far more
threatened. I yearn for the re-appearance of Nature out of Culture-but
not for the eradication of all symbolic mediation. The word "choice"
has been so devalued lately. Let's say I'd prefer a world of
indeterminacy, of rich ambiguity, of complex impurities. My critics,
apparently, do not. I find much to admire and desire in both their
models, but can't for even a moment believe in either of them as
totalities. Their futurity or eschatology bores me, unless I can mix it
into the stew of the TAZ -or use it to magic the TAZ into active
existence- to tease the TAZ into action. The TAZ is "broad-minded"
enough to entertain more than two, or even six, impossible ideas
"before breakfast." The TAZ is always "bigger" than the mere ideas
which inspire it. Even at its smallest and most intimate the TAZ
englobes all "totalities," and packs them into the same kaleidoscope
conceptual space, the "imaginal world" which is always so closely
related to the TAZ, and which burns with the same fire. My brain may
not be able to reconcile the wilderness and cyberspace, but the TAZ can
do so - in fact, has already done so. And yet the TAZ is no totality,
but merely a leaky sieve-which, in the fairy tale, can carry milk or
even become a boat. For the TAZ, technology is like that paper fan in
the Zen story, which first becomes a "fan," then a device for scooping
cake, and finally a silent breeze.

In related news, the following discussion recently showed up on #sl4:

[16:41] <bluegene>	Google will die sometime, obsoleted by p2p.
[16:41]  * Psy-Kosh looks.
[16:41] [Eliezer]	GOOGLE WILL NEVER DIE!
[16:41]  * Eliezer genuflects before the mighty GOOGLE
[16:42]  * Eliezer says, "All hail Google."
[16:42] <Aaron>		hmm  p2p google... it could happen
[16:42] <bluegene>	If you have to serve pages, you know what your're
serving. And so do your neighbours.
[16:42] [Eliezer]	NO!  Google knows all, sees all.  p2p would be but a false
Google!
[16:42] <bluegene>	Just aggregate local sweeps.
[16:42] <Aaron>		actually, I'm sure I have seen p2p search engines.  it
probably wouldn't to hard to implement google p2p
[16:42] <bluegene>	Notification, in fact.
[16:42] [Eliezer]	NO!  Must search entire Net!
[16:42] <bluegene>	Yes, amplify queries.
[16:43] <bluegene>	Profit from local bandwidth glut.
[16:43] <bluegene>	Fan out queries 100x.
[16:43] [Eliezer]	All the galaxy MUST be indexed by Google!  All physical
objects!  Every atom!  You will be assimilated!
[16:44]  * Psy-Kosh waits for google to allow for self modifying (ie, coded)
queries, then for someone to type in just the right query for it to start
becoming a mind... "all hail the great google!"
[16:44] [Eliezer]	but, bluegene, that would be lightspeed limited... Google
answers all my queries in a fraction of a second
[16:44] <Aaron>		What??  Just to the atomic level?  what if I'm looking for
a very special up quark?
[16:44] <bluegene>	Given that we're getting TByte drives, a single drive can
contain a large fraction of the full text index.
[16:44] [Eliezer]	There can only be one Google!
[16:44] <bluegene>	If you fan out 100x, you don't need many steps.
[16:45] <bluegene>	Could even use multicast for that.
[16:45] <Psy-Kosh>	but wait, google is not the ultimate search engine.. it
is second to a higher one whose parameters it is not worthy to find yet it
is destined to one day design.
[16:45] [Eliezer]	Besides, I bet that the Net is growing faster than the
size of hard drives.

This post consists only of my own experience with computer games - no URLs,
statistics, bibliography or other means of verification of what I've
written. If you need any of those don't read it.
IMHO there is one big problem with virtual nation building: I don't really
think that with today's level of technology it is good substitute for real
life  (and I got feeling that it's meant to be, am I right here?). Computer
games have lots of limitations in the way they are presented. They are flat.
No real 3d vision, you cannot touch things, feel them, smell them, you don't
feel any kind of game's gravity forces and so on. All of this limitations
make playing games very, very mind handicapping. Human's body is not adapted
for such small portion of information it gets from your monitor display and
speakers so in the long run it may get disstorted. If you want to lead
healthy life style computer gaming won't help you... unless it's powerful
enough to fully immerse you in the gaming world with full stimulation of
your body (and it's not).
So if you have nothing to lose (you are already hardcore computer game
player or do nothing but work with your PC/Mac) then go ahead, build virtual
nation, play the game, close yourself in virtual reality. But I'don't
consider it smart or extropian. Gaming is like lots of other drugs.

Do you play computer games?
If you do please tell me what kind of,
what's yor favorite title, and do you
know any computer game with large
+ACI-extropian/transhuman thought+ACI-content.

Personnally I can think up only one title - +ACI-Alpha Centauri+ACI-
but this should be known to you because
it's quite an old game so it doesn't need any extra 
comments (I believe).

O negative blood is the universal donor, so it's always in short
supply.

The single reason hospitals are always short of blood? 

Motorcycles, a motorcycle accident will eat up more blood than a
week of open heart surgery. When I was a surgical orderly I saw
motorcycle accident victims eat up 80 units of blood and still not
survive.

The economics are bad here, maybe you should have to donate so many
units before you can even think of purchasing a motorcycle...

Connsider apheresis, the Lexus of blood donation. I had my usual
monthly appointment on Saturday, they got two units of prime AB+
plasma (AB+ plasma is universal) AND two units of platelets. (size
matters! ;) ) Two units of platelets would normally mean spinning
down 16-20 units of blood. Since you get your red cells back, you
don't miss a thing, you replace the platelets in 24 hours. You can
donate as often as every two weeks. (platelets, 30 days for plasma)

It's easy, and you sit and watch a movie (The Score) during the
procedure which can take 2 hours. I go in first thing 07:30 and am
home by 10:00, with the whole day clear.

And consider signing up for the National Bone Marrow Registry at
the same time.

This is a great idea! Actually they would just have to share this
data, since they test for a wide variety of problems including
STD's. If they spot a problem they will contact you immediately.

As I mentioned they already make these tests they just need to
share the data.

I wasn't aware they had for-pay centers open anymore, I know the
Red-Cross program I donate to is so rigorous it would easily
exclude these types.

I want to encourage eveyone here to donate regularly, Extropians
are generous.

You must be talking about a different Lake Michigan than the one
I'm drinking from right now, this water is great. 

The Lake gets a little funky near the shore of a big city like
Chicago, but even several hundred yards out (where the pumping
stations are) it's clear and a beautiful blue...

Ooooh, thank you, Amara, for the links and the extract.  I need to read all 
this stuff carefully.  I've always found much to criticize but also much to 
agree with in Wilson's material.  You have to burrow through all the 
feverish poetic stuff to find it, tho :-}

And yes, Loompanics still exists. Still the same address:  Loompanics 
Unlimited, PO Box 1197, Port Townsend, Washington 98368 (206) 
385-5087.  Not sure about the Web site but probably there.  I was around 
writing in the old Libertarian Connection when Mike Hoy started Loompanics 
in the 1970's by publishing an index to the National Lampoon (hence the name).

Another good source of radical material is Ak Press here in the Bay Area at 
674-A 23rd Street, Oakland, CA 94612-1163  or www.akpress.org.  Very large 
catalog of left, anarchist, sex, fiction, etc. including Noam Chomsky, and 
Peter Lamborn Wilson.

Sometimes I play Javanoid. I would rate its extropian content as
"limited". On the transhuman side, I did manage to go through the
whole cycle (12 levels I think) and then you don't die, it starts over
(which is a bit disappointing). Sorry, not many statistics and
supportive URLs and papers for that post, either.

...Except when emailing a person privately.  All lower case is a reminder
to the person that this is a personal offlist reply, in which case the
non-standard use of capitalization carries meaning.  It helps prevent
someone from accidentally posting your personal note to a list.
Or if you accidentally post a personal note to a public list, the
fact that it is all lower case indicates your intention.  spike

Planescape: Torment was a thoughtful musing on the eternal return and other issues of finite immortality, philosophy and general oddballness. As well as being, along with things like Fallout/Fallout2, way ahead of the rest of the crpg pack in terms of open-ended play. Needless to say it did terribly in the US.

Yes, but this is nothing more than exporting their impact. Californians
WILL use the same amount of water, and will continue to demand more. I
am waiting for the ironic/satirical end when California tries to declare
emminent domain over the Mississippi/Missouri watershed.

We in the rest of the country don't give a fig if California 'restores'
Mono Lake, or the Sacramento River, if the cost of doing so is to sop up
the Colorado. This situation epitomizes how unrealistic Californians are
in wanting to have their cake and eat it too.

Lake Mead is very scenic, as the Playboy pictorial with Darva Conger
captured so well (hey, its Nevada, so there's gotta be sex in there
somewhere!).

Northern Nevada is generally scenic in a lunar landscape sorta way,
though the Reno/Tahoe area is very nice. THere are lots of locations
with very interesting geological formations around the state.

Actually, I'd have to dispute this statement about libertarians. NH has
had more state legislators elected from the Libertarian Party than any
other state, last I checked.

On the contrary, ceramic materials are the new thing in body armor as
well as in heavy military equipment. There was an interesting show on
Discovery a week or so ago about an armored vest which sandwiches a 1/4"
plate of sintered ceramic between a couple thin sheets of kevlar.
Effective against AP rifle rounds, even.

The only way to have your cake and eat it with transparent metals is to
honeycomb it with transparent crystals.

'His discoveries were numerous and admirable; 
but he is said to have requested his friends and 
relations that, when he was dead, they would place 
over his tomb a cylinder containing a sphere, inscribing 
it with the ratio which the containing solid bears to the 
contained.'    [Plutarch, Parallel Lives: Marcellus] 

Actually in his work 'On the Sphere and Cylinder' Archimedes proved 
that the ratio of the volume of a sphere to the volume of the cylinder 
that contains it is 2:3. In that same work he also proved that the ratio 
of the surface area of a sphere to the surface area of the cylinder that 
contains it, together with its circular ends, is also 2:3. 

'But from Dionysius's own city of Syracuse I will summon up from 
the dust--where his measuring rod once traced its lines--an obscure 
little man who lived many years later, Archimedes. When I was questor in Sicily 
I managed to track down his grave. The Syracusians knew nothing about it, 
and indeed denied that any such thing existed. But there it was, completely 
surrounded and hidden by bushes of brambles and thorns. I remembered having 
heard of some simple lines of verse which had been inscribed on his tomb, 
referring to a sphere and cylinder modelled in stone on top of the grave. 
And so I took a good look round all the numerous tombs that stand beside 
the Agrigentine Gate. Finally I noted a little column just visible above the scrub: 
it was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder. I immediately said to the Syracusans, 
some of whose leading citizens were with me at the time, that I believed this was 
the very object I had been looking for. Men were sent in with sickles to clear the site, 
and when a path to the monument had been opened we walked right up to it. 
And the verses were still visible, though approximately the second half of each 
line had been worn away.'   [Cicero, Tusculan Disputations, V]

But where is now his tomb ? No one knows ...

First I've heard of that convention- the trouble is, I've seen a lot of
people who simply use lower case all the time.  When I reply offlist, I
often put [offlist reply] at the top of the message.  If informing
friends about goings-on at work that I really don't want broadcast, I
make a note to that effect.

Engineers always come up with the most prosaic, inartistic communication
protocols ;)

The "lunar landscape" region is in southern Nevada where the state really
does become barren wasteland with odd rock formations and sand.  The
northern half of Nevada is generally forested mountains with valleys ranging
from desert scrub flats to lush meadows depending on the situation.  The
further north you go, the wetter it gets.  Northern Nevada moves 3-4 million
foot-acres a year, but it is very broadly distributed.

(Size comparison for people that haven't been there:  the State of Nevada is
slightly smaller than the country of Germany)

Spike was talking about libertarian principles, not the Libertarian party
i.e. which States have laws and governance that are closest to libertarian
ideals.  If you elected five Libertarians to the state legislature in
California, you would have more than Nevada but there is no comparison as to
which state is more libertarian in practice.

Ah, but there's a tradeoff: without motorcycles, there would be a

While I see it said many times that Alaska is a libertarian State, I have my
doubts.  In my experience, Alaska is a fairly socialist State (in the same
way New Mexico is), but is in a unique position where the citizens of the
State are not really paying the costs of socialism.

Nevada has finally gotten around to reforming the only really
non-libertarian stance they had, which was their strict drug laws.  In
addition to passing a medical marijuana ballot prop, the state legislature
passed a measure that turns possession offenses for some drugs (e.g.
marijuana) into a $400 citation.  The "speeding ticket" model is arguably a
much saner implementation, since most drug possession laws are nominally
Health And Public Safety laws much like speeding tickets and not true
crimes.

Get serious. California can't do that, and isn't even going to try.  The
agents attempting to reduce use of Sacramento River/Mono Lake 
water are fully aware this will reduce use (as happens in drought
years) and that's part of their goals, even.  My claim is literally
true; California does spend lots to use less water, not just to shift
usage around.

Nevada still has a few regulatory headaches: as has been pointed out
by many humorists, you can ride your motorcycle from the casino to
the whorehouse with a gun on your hip and a bottle of whiskey in your
saddlebags, but you'd better be wearing a helmet, and have up-to-date
registration and proof of insurance, and obey the speed limits...

J. Hughes reported on this study on a transhumanist list:

http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2002/02/19_diet.html:

   Berkeley - Two dietary supplements straight off the health food
   store shelf put the spark back into aging rats, and might do the
   same for aging baby boomers, according to a study at the University
   of California, Berkeley, and Children's Hospital Oakland Research
   Institute.

   A team of researchers led by Bruce N. Ames, professor of molecular and
   cell biology at UC Berkeley, fed older rats two chemicals normally
   found in the body's cells and available as dietary supplements:
   acetyl-L-carnitine and an antioxidant, alpha-lipoic acid.

   In three articles in the February 19 issue of Proceedings of the
   National Academy of Sciences, Ames and his colleagues report the
   surprising results. Not only did the older rats do better on memory
   tests, they had more pep, and the energy-producing organelles in
   their cells worked better.

   "With the two supplements together, these old rats got up and did the
   Macarena," said Ames, also a researcher at Children's Hospital Oakland
   Research Institute (CHORI). "The brain looks better, they are full
   of energy - everything we looked at looks more like a young animal."

Subject: Top 10 ways the world will end
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Boingboing.net has the following list of the 10 most likely ways the
human race could go extinct, from Stephen Petranek of Discover magazine.
(It was presented as the 10 ways the world could come to an end, but
obviously it is just talking about humanity.)

   10. We lose the will to survive (depression being the #1 mental
   illness)

   9. Aliens invade Earth (most primitive civilizations do not survive
   outside contact)

   8. Our Ecosystem collapses (e.g. we destroy the marginal tree in the
   rain forest or run out of fish)

   7. Particle accelerator mishap - when we can make devices powerful
   enough to make black holes we expect them to evaporate, but we can't
   be sure.

   6. Biotech disaster

   5. Reversal of Earth's magnetic field

   4. Solar flares

   3. Global epidemic

   2. Rogue black hole

   1. Asteroid collision

I don't agree much with the list.  Depression wiping out the human race
is impossible because some people wouldn't be depressed and they would
out-reproduce the others.  Aliens invading is too unlikely because
of the coincidence of them arriving just as we are on the cusp of our
technological singularity.  Rogue black holes happening to wander into
the solar system seem fantastically unlikely.

The particle accelerator accident is also remote because cosmic rays
come into our atmosphere with far more energy than we can hope to
produce, and they haven't eaten the earth yet.

For some of the others we can get pretty good statistical evidence of
their frequency, like magnetic field reversal or asteroid collisions.
Statistically they are unlikely to be a serious threat to the whole human
race in the next few centuries.  Likewise with super-intense solar flares;
they would leave a fossil record of mass extinctions, and we know that
those don't happen that often.  Same with other astronomical events not
on the list like gamma ray bursts.

This leaves ecosystem collapse, biotech disaster and global epidemic,
all variations on the same topic.  To these we should add the other two
members of Bill Joy's unholy trinity, nanotech disaster and runaway AI
(an unfriendly singularity).  If the human race has been wiped out a
century from now I would think it would be due to one of these causes.
I'm not sure how to rank their likelihood.

The web based AI of the future gets its sweet justice? Hoards of dumb things
asking stupid questions. Project your sense of privacy into WWW and it's
probably what it would feel like. Perhaps there are real people behind it.

Whetever's in the back room, it's a lovely thought inversion. I'm trying the
imagine what Googlebot would think of a dog and whether it can pick up the
real inhabitants of the planet - microbes. Note that it's all keywords and
links  - the semantics, wizdom and morals models are totally absent and
presumably contained elsewhere - just like the current Google (at least
until the semantic web/XML ontology systems get going fully). It's a very
powerful way to help us deal with the idea of a naughty AI with assumed
rights like ours, for example.

In Australia we have recently enacted our own Robot Exclusion Protocol in
the form of the new new Privacy Act. Googlebot and presumably whatever sent
it would find themselves in some sort of virtual hot water. In my case real
hot water - Googlebot clearly needs a bath, my dice-patterned undies up an
appropriate orifice, an ERROR 404 painted on it and introduce it to
'tools/internet options/delete files ' - the dumpster  - or maybe a garden
gnome role would be better for it.

Nice one.

     I think you've finally hit on a formulation/wording for natural rights
that I can agree with, and would think you would find a much easier time
getting most people to agree to. I don't think it's possible to argue from
either absolutes or "human nature" (since people define that however fits
their agendas), but this wording makes the case very clear and very strong.
Except that I wouldn't say "by virtue  of their specific nature", but
something along the lines of "historically, to get the results we seem to
want (more prosperity, health, a better working society, more freedom)
humans seem to need these rights, protections, etc".
     I understand that making rights a legal creation (which I have to
admit to thinking that they are) makes their case much less strong, and
this might be the reason they're so often stated as inherent, but you
weaken the case for people who don't see them as anything more than
abstractions from evidence. (If that makes sense...) Your way achieves the
results much more cleanly.
     Mike.

Agreed.  It is a strange turn of phrase.  To me the argument that natural
rights grow out of the fact that humans, by virtue  of their specific
nature, require certain conditions in order to  live and thrive most
optimally and a subset of those are  basically rights to their own person,
property and pursuits - the so-called "negative rights" - comes closest to
a justification for natural rights.

I can see some validity here.  But it's no panacea.  What's living and
thriving most optimally?  A society where people seem happy and
individuals immigrate and technology progresses but the population fails
to replace itself through breeding and a lot of the happy people turn
out to be clinically depressed?  Or a more traditionaly society which
has survived for 3000 years and co-opted invaders (ancient Egypt,
China)?  Or a rather unlibertarian society which was able to
successfully suppress dangerous technology (guns), and then when faced
with a sudden threat was able to rapidly adapt itself to meet the threat
without falling apart, and then got on the tech progress wagon itself?
(Japan.)  And how can we separate success of societies from success of
geographies?

And what about a society which respected rights internally, but not
outside of itself?  Such as if the US had conquered the world after
1945.  Or if the First World in 2010 decided to deal with environmental
problems by wiping out all humans outside of their countries?  Massive
human rights violations happen in invasions, but one can easily argue
the invading society thrives.

We can say totalitarianism hasn't worked well for human beings.  We can
say some degree of decentralization and markets does work well.  I think
that about sums up the solid conclusions from the evidence so far.

And what works for human beings now doesn't translate into absolute
rights for any form of sentient being.  It doesn't tell us whether a
totalitarianism based on Truth Machines, or direct changing of human
nature, might work.

Mostly I play FPS and RPG. Alpha Centauri is the only really extropian/transhumanist game I can think of, 
though Civ and Civ 2 (and I suppose Civ 3, but I think it's crap) are too, to a lesser extent, in that one of 
the ways to beat them is to launch a ship to Alpha Centauri (and thus, the game of the same name).
My favorite games are probably Quake 3 and the Final Fantasy series.

I tend to agree.  For one thing, Alaska has one of the largest state governments per capita in the nation. 

While Alaskans like to see themselves as rugged individuals on the edge of the frontier doing their own thing, I would say not Libertarianism, but instead "conservative" Republicanism is the dominant political force here.  And to think Republicans are supposed to be against big government bureaucracies! ; )

I have played Warcraft, which is fun from the POV of managing and
growing a whole community, managing limited resources (and then going
and using it to clobber the Orcs with it). Quake and Duke Nukem are fun
from a first person shooters, and Mission Impossible is similarly fun.

I am currently playing with X-Plane, a flight simulator which allows you
to download different planes off the web, as well as allowing the user
to design their own aircraft. I just finished designing a sim of XCOR's
EZ-Rocket, and am working on designing various air-to-air missiles as
well as bombs of various models for a hoped for combat plug-in to the
sim. I'm also designing a V-1 buzzbomb (Fiesler FI-103) in it as well as
the manned variant, the FI-103 R-IV Reichenberg, in X-Plane's
Plane-Maker. X-Plane also allows you to design and fly aircraft on the
planet Mars, as well as fly re-entry maneuvers with the Space Shuttle.
You can build spacecraft in X-Plane and fly them in space, since it
treats planets as globes and not planar environments like most sims do.

Because of this do-it-yourself design capability, and the interplanetary
capabilities as well, I consider X-Plane to be the creme de la creme of
extropic video games.

The game I use the most is Freecell, waiting for pesky websites to load.
My win average with it is about 63% playing at breakneck speed.

Alaska is a good example of parasitizing government on the exploitation
of resources. Most all of the state budget comes from oil revinues,
which obviously, since the consumers are not state residents, gives the
government a rather free hand in providing any services it's citizens
want, since they don't actually pay for it themselves. Its a
prescription for bloat. The fact that every resident is on welfare as
well (each state resident receives about $2000 annually from oil
royalties) doesn't help things.

Now, Alaska does have the largest percent of land owned by the state and
federal governments of all states in the union, so that requires a
rather significant bureaucracy to manage all that land, while, because
of the degree to which things are spread out, the costs of roads and
services are similarly much higher. If there were more people in Alaska,
with less land in government hands, the size of government would be much
smaller.

Fallout, by Interplay.

X-COM: UFO Defense, by MicroProse.

Outpost, by Sierra.

Just three off the top of my head that I've played personally.

A libertarian world wouldn't be that hard to distinguish from the real
world.

That's what libertarianism is all about: letting people do what they
want. It's not about forcing everyone to think the same way.

The trouble with peddling sex online is that it raises all sorts of
real world legal issues.

I think the idea is to plant a seed and hope that it grows into
something bigger, demonstrating the virtues of libertarianism and
exposing people to libertarian ideas in action and hopefully
converting some in the process. Marketing it as "Libertopia" would be
a big mistake, I think, because libertarianism isn't on most people's
radar, and most of those familiar with it have already decided whether
they like the idea or not.

If you give people art supplies, what will their artwork look like?
Who knows?

The control that the operators of existing games exercise gives the
games a distinctive look and feel, but it also makes the worlds
predictable and boring. Personal interactions are still pretty
uncontrolled, and therefore unpredictable and interesting. A
libertarian world would be orders of magnitude more unpredictable.

People play games because they enjoy it. I'd play because I'd like to
see how libertarianism would work in action--even if it's "just a
game". It'd also help me understand libertarianism better, which would
probably make me more effective at spreading the idea to others,
especially those who don't play the game.

What? Who's "placing perfection in a future where symbolic mediation
has abolished hierarchy"? What does symbolic mediation have to do
Extropy? What hierarchy is being abolished? Who says or believes that
perfection will result?

Is it just me, or is this guy writing to impress people with his
vocabulary and expressing his ideas as obliquely as possible to seem
"intellectual"?

If I understood those words that aren't in my dictionary, I could
rewrite what he wrote in two sentences that a child could
understand.

But then his writing would be exposed for the pompous nonsense it
is...

Wilson tends to write like the Situationists and other so-called 
"postmodern intellectuals" - plus I think he enjoys the intellectual 
somersaults for the fun of it...  Some of the concepts won't make any sense 
to you unless you have a background in postmodern (preferably French) 
social critiques.  I don't, so I just plow through it as best I can.  I do 
have some Situationist background so I understand the complaints about 
"mediation", but some of the stuff - and therefore the point being made - 
still eludes me.  I'll read the whole thing at some point.  What interests 
me is that he had clearly had some contact with Extropian/Transhumanist 
thought and perhaps with some Extropians/Ttranshumanists as well - which is 
not too surprising since he is probably well known to people like Bruce 
Sterling.  Wilson, BTW, considers himself a radical Muslim of the 
Ishmaelite branch - the most well-known examples being the Assassins, on 
which he has written a book or two about their "spiritual 
anarchism".  Interesting stuff.

Um. Hard to explain. Sort of like the end of the world, but not at all. More of drastic change in everything. 
The Singularity could probably be considered an eschaton. The term was originally Gnostic? Catholic? One o' dem 
old religions, anyway.

I'd say it's probably a safe wager to assume that's pretentious-speak for "technology".

I havn't read this paper yet (just TAZ and I think a few random short things), but from what I know of Bey I 
can't imagine him trying to be "intellectual".
Bey is an extremely odd character, he is. I wish I remembered more on his background and especially his 
spirituality (which makes him much easier to understand, I do believe).

Many of the games I play are merely on the computer, but not true
"computer games".  Play via email, and all that.  (Like this one, done
as a mockery of Joy's doomsday pronouncements, where each player played
cards tagged with certain amounts of bio, nano, or robo points.  Most
cards also required a certain minimum number of each type of point on
the board, representing general knowledge needed before the technology
or event on the card could come to pass, before they could be played.
Play too many points of one type without balance from the others, and
the appropriate cataclysm - Eco-collapse, Grey Goo, or Skynet Takes Over
- invoked, causing everyone to lose. "Singularity" happened at some
predefined point level; the object was to get the "last word" in by
playing the card that triggered it.  But I digress...)

Outpost has been mentioned; Homeworld, also by Sierra, also has some of
this content (for instance, your main advisor is a recent upload).  Then
again, most sci-fi games have at least a little bit.

That is the whole point of capitalism- choice.  People are more likely to
choose
the higher payoff, but always some people will make choices most people see
as questionable.
the question is, does anyone have a right to prevent people from making bad
choices?

(1) banning trade in organs violates your right to own your own body.
(2) legalizing organ trade would result in greater organ supply and thus
decreasing mortality rates for many diseases.
(3) families of dead people would be better off, especially people who now
cannot afford a
proper funeral.
(4) you could make extra cash by selling blood, skin, etc.

The only disadvantage I can see is organ smuggling, which is rumoured to
occur currently.
An open market would probably incrrease supply to the point where such
gruesome possibilities would be uneconomic.

There are few organs which can be taken from live bodies, and enough people
die that market forces would result in demand satisfied by dead peoples
organs.
Maybe I have too much faith in peoples intelligence, but I really cannot see
someone
giving up, say, a healthy cornea, given that the number of dead people
leaving their
organs to their families to sell would drive prices down.

I cant see a down side to legalizing organ trade.
Your concerns sound vaguely paranoid, but are unfortunately shared by most
people-
making it unlikely that organ trade will occur in the near future.

Not to mention that he also has quite a lot of background in some sort of 
magick or another (not sure exactly what, though. Probably ceremonial a la 
Crowley, given what I've heard of him on the subject). That's actually 
where I first found him. If anyone's heard the Coil song "The Golden 
Section", the vocals are done by Bey.

Wow, I can't believe I forgot Homeworld. Beyond that, Homeworld completely 
changed Real-Time Strategy games - it's in space, and 3d. It got at least 
one Game of the Year award, but most of my friends don't like it, as it's 
very slow. The ship AI is pretty good, so you often have 20-30 small 
fighters flying around and shooting at each other and then having to turn 
around. So it IS slow, but I don't mind - it's very pretty to watch, as all 
of the ships have really long contrails (so you can find them). I could 
probably sit there and watch my fighters changing formations for hours 
because of the contrails :)
Definitely a game to check out if you're looking for something new. Just 
know that the learning curve is REALLY steep, and you will probably have to 
do the fourth (or third, I havn't played for a while) level many, many 
times before you pass it. Or cheat.

Not so fast. If you haven't even bothered trying to find out what his
technical terminology means, why jump to the smug know-nothing conclusion
that it must be `oblique' (or wanky, or pretentious, or la-de-dah, or
pointy-headed, or any other convenient term to cover your insecurity by
projecting the fault on to him)? 

Scientists and programmers communicate in a swarm of specialized jargon,
and so do surveyors and cardiac surgeons and trial lawyers and kindergarten
teachers for all I know. That's because specialized terminology is
*compressed*; it's shorthand, it can carry enormous sidebars of filiation
(exactly one of those terms: I mean the elaborate cultural background and
prior discussion it implies or connotes) that allow a painstaking or expert
domain reader to take in a vast amount of implied information, on a lot of
levels simultaneously, all in one hit. That's also what poetry does, too,
when it's working. 

>If I understood those words that aren't in my dictionary, I could

Probably not. A complex conversation has been going on since the 1960s at
least, within which terms of art like eschaton and techn play a part like
`state reduction' in quantum theory or `gerund' in grammar or `sulcus' in
neuroanatomy. You could spell out some of these associations in less
specialized words, of course, but you'll be hard pressed to do it in two
paragraphs or two pages, let alone two sentences.

The final comment about trying to `seem "intellectual"' is unworthy of this
list, unless you think `intellectual' is a term of abuse (`Ya ya, he's
reading, ya ya, he's *thinking*, let's pelt the creep with stones and tear
up his book!') or, more likely, you are claiming that he must be just
*feigning* his intellectual culture. That would be a more compelling
argument if you'd taken the trouble to find out what he was saying, and
countering it with a reasoned retort.

A moment's googling found this:

http://archive.imago.com.au/techne/phil.htm

and of course it's also the *title* of an important journal, from Stanford. 

The word/concept as it has developed in current discourse derives from
Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher with whom I, for one, have very
little sympathy. And there is no doubt that the world is full of mumbling
poseurs who babble pomo terms like this as a way of avoiding thinking, and
that's a shame. It doesn't give us a warrant to act as if the core
discussion itself is worthless.

Um, is there a networked game out there which comes with source, runnable

um. sorry? I really didn't mean to convey errors. I was just tickled
pink by the page, and preserved the incorrect tranparent aluminum title
to keep the link to that old star trek movie clear.(and because i thought
it was funny). My ignorance of most materials science also contributed
to the hyped and unhelpful tone of the rest. Enthusiasm, it's a killer.

This is very interesting to me. I was previously aware of ceramic rifle-stopper
plates in the front and back of level III-c vests, but I didn't know
that it was that effective. Do you know who produced those? They are
prototype, I assume, as a google doesn't bring up anything like that,
precisely...

Anyone have links to a good online explanatory page for some basic materials

seem to find anything on the subject that doesn't bring up old Military
"investigative studies", vague governmental frontpages to think tanks,
or video game sites. 

All the "dangerouslabs.org" kind of sites are actually kind of dissapointing.
Just little jet-powered carts and so-on, I remember building an ion "cannon"
as a young teen, and disturbing electronics from a distance, and other
malicious electronic weapons. 

Anyone know what kind of legislation governs the private production of
directed energy weapons, hipower lasers, or directed emp weapons?
On a related note, does the legislation on automatic and explosive firearms
cover privately developed, prototype, or handbuilt non-commercial weapons?

Lots.   Quake 2 source code got GPLed just recently.  That's probably

I'd like to add few other  'extropian' games:


Call To Power 1/2 - clone of civilization but with better interface and
longer play time (from 4000BC to 3000AD). In advanced ages we have
nanotechnology, AI controlling your citizens, terrorists with those nasty
nano-attacks, ability to build orbital cities and other 'extro' features.
Downside of this game is poor AI (If you want to play it, use multiplayer
mode)

UFO3 - X-COM Apocalypse - This game was the my first source of information
about extropians :o The story is that we are put into bright future of
mankind, into huge city called megalopolis governed by large organizations -
including extropians :) Here is what we can read in UFOpedia (kind of
encyclopedia covering the game's world background):

'The extropians are one of the two earth federation political parties that
dominate city government. The extropian philosophy is basically a faith in a
bright technological future a brave new world free of disease, pollution,
old age and dull aesthetics. They pioneered the city regulations governing
the future retro styling of the architecture and vehicles. They have strong
support from 'Solmine', 'Marsec' and the larger corporations'

There are other organizations that may exist in near future and are modeled
in this game including: sentient engine liberation front, technocrats,
nanotech, mutant alliance etc. UFO3 certainly has great atmosphere. BTW this
example shows that Transhumanism really makes its way to mainstream.

Extropians who would like to see in action some greatest 'AI' should play
'Creatures 1/2/3' and 'Black+ACY-White'. This will demonstrate where we are
today with consumer AI engines. IMHO it's not so bad.

For those who love outer space, there are two games that you shouldn't miss:
Elite / Elite 2 / First Encounters - the biggest worlds in computer games
I've ever seen+ADs- thousands of planets to explore, hundreds of solar systems
all of this with nice graphics. You can really get sucked in this game while
flying from old earth to barrent's star solar system selling for example
medicines with 10xCosts income (if you are smart enough to read electronic
newspaper and choose planets where some terrible plaque occurred :) Another
nice thing are spaceships. They are rather simple in piloting and design but
for the first time we have spaceships that move like spaceships not like
aircrafts, lasers beam that don't 'fly' and lots of other things that make
this game more simulation then another stupid s-f arcade crap.

Battlecruiser 3000AD - This game is must have for all of those who enjoyed
Star Trek. We are captain of great, big, enormous space cruiser which
mission is... to serve federation bla, bla, bla, bla, bla. What is really
important (it's not plot if you still think it is :) is detailed simulation
of the space ship, its components, crew members and beautiful and detailed
world. We can move around from solar system to another solar system,  from
space station to planet surface (with appropriate shuttle), we can even
command our marines to descend on enemy planet and try to take over it. Oh,
and version 1.1 of this game is totally free to download (newer versions are
still in development).

Maybe it's time to add another category of extropian stuff on T.E.C.H. site.
We've got extropian books, films, TV-shows, magazines - then why not
computer games?

Hmm, looks like work in progress. Worth to keep checking back.

I haven't play this one but if like flight sims you'll love Flight Simulator
2002 by micro$oft. Best flight sim ever made (and I'm not, by all means,
great fan of MS) with very advanced options of creating and redesigning
planes (although it requires some 3d modeling and programing skills). And of
course whole world to fly around.

+AD4-6)      Posts about the list, or its rules, should have the pre-fix +IBw-META:+IB0-
+AD4-We encourage the use of other prefixes indicating the content of a post.
+AD4-Examples include, PHIL:, MATH:, SCI:, CHAT:, etc.


Is there some list of subject prefixes that should be obeyed on this list or
I can made'em up with my own desire?

What do you think about posting list rules once a week with list of such
prefixes to make people use them? Or are they just too cramping and you
don't won't to use them?

If you are not feared of 320x240, crude graphics try to get and play master
of orion 1. IMHO (and also many my friends' opinion) this is much better
then moo2, faster and more enjoyable. This is my favorite game of all times.
Check also www.quicksilver.com and find out about MOO3. This may become one
of the best strategy game ever made.

His point with this sentence is that extropians are similar to the
primitivists yearning for the good old days of the paleolithic "natural"
world in that they perceive the current world as imperfect and worth
striving away from. Instead of placing the golden age in the past we
place it somewhere in the future. This future is envisioned as a digital
utopia where information technology frees us from social hierarchies -
we get the digital anarchy, cryptoanarchy or digital tribes that were
such glowing visions when this text was written in the mid-90's. In a
way he is talking about the recurring idea in our community about total
autarchy that Robin Hanson has critiqued in _Dreams of Autarchy_.  In
short, extropians think that history is progressing towards a utopia
that will come about thanks to information technology.

See Damien's point about the compression of terminology? I personally
think that one should do one's best to write clearly and comprehensible
for one's intended audience, but if that audience is intended to be
specialists it would not be proper to use baby speak. Unfortunately,
many academics (me included) tend to get stuck in terminology mode
(especially when we are not thinking about it) and end up speaking in
polysyllabic academese even when we try to reach a larger non-expert
audience.

Black & White's AI is absolutely incredible, but unless you REALLY like

Indeed, this is a very interesting text and well worth reading and
thinking about. Hakim Bey is more concerned with the issue of
how the primitivists and extropians would impact on his own project of
autonomous zones than whether their philosophies are "right". But his
critique of extropianism is still relevant:

> Obviously for the Extropians, mediation per se cannot be

> separation does in fact occur

Translated, this would mean that extropians do not see technological
mediation - our technological exoselves that interface us with the world
and each other through telecommunications, cars, prepackaged food and
glasses - as an inevitable source of separation from the real world and
each other. This is contrary to what primitivists, romantics, luddites,
marxists and many other critics of modernity claim. 

I think at the core this is due to a different sense of the meaning and
importance of authenticity: to us authentic means something entirely
different from the very much nature-linked sense the term is used by
them. I think most of us would say that a life as a posthuman upload in
a nanotech Dyson sphere is just as authentic as living as a hunter
gatherer in the paleolithic; it is more about a subjective sense of
identity than anything rooted in physical or metaphysical reality. To
us, the mood change brought about by Prozac is just as authentic as the
same change brought about by therapy (we can still recognize that a
cognitive therapy making a person better able to cope and control his
emotions will in the long run be preferrable to a "chemical fix", it is
just that the mood itself has its own authenticity). In the end I think
our position can be viewed as "authenticity is information", while many
of our critics think that "authenticity is in the object". 

However, authenticity is also - especially in marxist and existentialist
discourse - closely linked to social aspects. This is what Bey continues
with:

Bey means roughly that technology (and he means it in its widest sense,
not just special devices but also "technologies" such as economics and
psychology) is not value-neutral, but that some technology has inherent
consequences that are ethically relevant. In his analysis this is not
due to anything directly inherent in the technology itself, but rather
in the fact that it is impossible to separate technology from the social
environment - economy, culture, politics and all that. Technology is
developed because of what humans think and want, and these things are
bound up to our society; the new technology changes society, and we get
a complex tangle of feedback where everything does have ethical
implications. 

I agree with him about this. Seeing technology as something cleanly
separated from society, something that develops on its own according to
its own rules, does not work - the history of technology shows that it
is always deeply involved in the messy process of cultural change. This
is not anything deterministic, and individual humans can and do affect
it a lot, which means it has ethical implications. 

Unfortunately quite a few transhumanists do tend towards fairly
simplistic technological determinism or separate technology from its
cultural side, and this produces an inability to do a good critique of
technology. If technology is just something bringing us towards a future
utopia on its own, then technology is simply good and there is no point
in further debate about whether Microsoft's software is a good thing. If
the value of technology is determined solely by the values of those
bringing it into existence and the applications it is put to, then it is
impossible to criticise secondary effects (is it a good thing that we
can be constantly reached using cellphones, and a culture assuming this
seems to be emerging?).

Which I also agree with. We will not get to transhumanity just by
inventing the right tools, we have to change ourselves and our
culture too.

I.e., beware of oversimplified utopias where everything is black and
white. Such thinking requires you to do away with all of the present
world and to remake it into something completely different. It has a
hard time being tolerant and pluralistic, and can very easily turn into
something totalitarian. 

It is better to start out with the current messy situation and look at
how it could get to a better - but still messy - situation. Sometimes
oversimplifactions and gedankenexperiments can help us think, but they
should be recognized as the crutches they are.

This is a very good thought experiment (and as such, a crutch for
thinking rather than a recipe of How To Do It). His point is that if we
somehow manage to overturn the current situation and create essentially
an anarchist world (his description seems a bit like my ideas about
metafederations and Nozick's utopia, a world composed of communities
with their own internal rules and much freedom to move between them) the
world will not become a primitive utopia or a posthuman utopia. It would
likely be a messy mixture of both - there would be extropians pursuing
supertech, and right next to them the local luddites trying to live a
neomedieval life. But neither would get the pure world: the luddites
would find themselves using some neat tech or having to accept the
existence of GM plants, the extropians would have to accept both a large
number of people not interested in their visions and a slower rate of
progress than would have been if everybody had been trying to storm the
cosmos. 

Bey seem to be optimistic about that this is feasible, and this may be
his own utopian flight of fancy. After all, getting from here to there
will not be a clean break if it happens, but in itself a messy imperfect
process. It could very well be that we still will have some of our old
insitutions even after the Revolution - there might be a Microsoft even
then - and it will likely not be as perfectly anarchist or nice as we
would like. Which is acceptable, because the alternative is to seek a
perfect revolution which is impossible to realize in the real world.

What game is that? It sounds interesting.

Apropos card games, Illuminati is a rather interesting exercise in both
diplomacy and handling the unexpected. Two abilities we are going to

Hi. My name is Anders Sandberg and I'm an Alpha Centauri addict. :-)

SMAC has some very transhumanist themes, not just the transcendence
scenario. The progress of the ecological technologies contains a very
interesting idea about how the relationship with nature can change:
first it is the enemy, then we learn more about it and it becomes a
resource, then it becomes something that is vulnerable and must be
protected, and finally it becomes united with technology, economy and
eventually mankind itself. Even without the somewhat romantic ideas
about the sentient planet this progress has many interesting sides. 

My main complaint is that all these new technologies doesn't really
change the world - you still have cities, army units and mines even
when your devices are nanotech with AI powered by controlled
singularities. I would really like to create a game where such
developments really changed the way everything worked, but I realize
this might be extremely tricky to do game balance-wise and in a way that
non-initiated players would understand. 

One day - when I have time - I would dearly love to participate in
writing a game like SMAC with truly transhuman technologies and more
interesting personality simulations of the opponents. 


Another game that has some transhuman content (at least in my mind) is
Sentinel. You are a robot that can only turn around, and can absorb the
mass/energy of trees and rocks in the landscape, and create new robots
at remote locations. Movement is by uploading to the other robot. The
goal is to reach the highest point where the Sentinel is standing; it is
trying to dissipate the mass/energy in the landscape and drains you if
it can see you. In a sense this eerie game is the battle between entropy
and extropy: you want to collect all available energy for constructive
use, the Sentinel tries to dissipate it.

No, but there's a limit to how far I'll go to try to read
something. I'll look up a word I don't know in a dictionary, but I
won't google for it and attempt to deduce its meaning from the
context.

Not so fast. I *did* attempt to find out what his "technical"
terminology meant. I failed. I decided, based on what I *could*
understand, that it wasn't worth the effort to track down those two
words.

I used "intellectual" to refer to the kind of pseudo-intellectuals who
write bloviated, obfuscated pieces in an apparent attempt to impress
themselves and other pseudo-intellectuals.

I've just taken a few minutes to google Bey, and everything I've read
confirms my initial evaluation. I think Bey is someone's idea of a
joke. He's a version of Emacs' doctor-mode that strings pretentious
words together into meaningless but impressive-looking grammatically
correct sentences.

Or maybe he's the emporer's new clothes, and everyone is afraid to
notice the nudity.

If he's real and he's got anything worthwhile to say, he hides it
well.

This is pretty interesting as well

http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Essays/Trek-Marxism.html

The Economics of Star Trek, as bogus as the physics of Star Trek.  The
author argues, reasonably well, that ST:TNG is a communist society.

The author also has an extensive database critiquing specific episodes and
noting the evidence of the true contradicotry, hypocritical communist nature
of the federation

server and client, source code only though (ie not the data .md2 files,
same as they did with quake1 and doom) 
the id release is at ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/quake2.zip
but since it's not the friendliest compile on linux, you might want to
get relnev's release from http://icculus.org/~relnev/main.php
You might also be interested in the red/blue glasses patch.  I haven't
tried it myself, but it reportedly works nicely but slowly, since it
uses the software renderer.  it can be found at:

Definitely work in progress, and quite slow progress at that, but if you

This is very interesting to me. I was previously aware of ceramic
rifle-stopper
plates in the front and back of level III-c vests, but I didn't know
that it was that effective. Do you know who produced those? They are
prototype, I assume, as a google doesn't bring up anything like that,
precisely...

Anyone have links to a good online explanatory page for some basic materials
science terminology and such, just so I don't have to collect quite so
many corrective posts, when i discover another exciting lil page?

     -------------------------------------

A material you may find of interest is CERMET.  It is a partially metallic,
and partially ceramic mixture, discovered at Los Alamos (accidently).  Boron
Carbide (The ceramic) is held as a powder in the desired shape, in the most
common form, Aluminium is then melted and allowed to diffuse throughout the
material.  The result (depending on how long you let it cool in an oxygen
rich environment) is a material that has a very high fracture toughness, and
is 6 times stronger than aluminum, but less dense.  A 1/2, reportadly, can
stop a tank shell (no more specifics than that off the top of my head)
LANL.gov internal search engine is apparently down at the moment.

eschaton? What's that?

Haven't you ever heard of "the immanentization of the eschaton"?:)(Robert
Anton Wilson opens Illuminatus with "It was the year we finally immanentized
the eschaton".) I think it was Voeglin who introduced this term to academe.
It's the thing that eschatology is knowledge about ie the "last things" or
"end of the world" in both senses of "end". Steve Davies

Interesting link. Like Damien I have trouble with Heidegger but he is a very
influential thinker right now. As the linked document says "techne" is a
Greek word which means 'practical knowledge' ie an activity which contains
the knowledge of how to do it within itself, so you know it by doing it.
This is linked to ideas about the nature of art. Peter Drucker has an
interesting discussion of this. He argues that until the 18th century the
general belief was that you could only acquire this kind of knowledge by
doing the activity or observing it directly and then practising/imitating
it. For Drucker this is one of the main reasons why technological innovation
was so slow and patchy. The breakthrough is the idea that "techne" can be
put into printed words and so transmitted rapidly over long distances. This
is though the "mediation" that Heidegger and others don't like. BTW can any
German speaker on this list tell me, is Heidegger really difficult to
understand or is just that he doesn't translate well from German to English
? Steve Davies

WHich is all rather BS. I'll buy that Starfleet operates
communistically, much as many military organizations do today to a
limited extent. In todays US military, for instance, a soldier does not
really have any need for the pay he receives, unless he starts a family.
As a single individual, one could do an entire four years doing nothing
but living in on base barracks, eating base cafeteria food, and using
base facilities (gym, library, golf course, movie theater, NCO or
Officers club, PX, etc) consuming little of one's monthly pay, if at
all. 

US Navy ships are even more so.

A Captain living in the world of Starfleet would have little need of
money if all of his/her needs were met by the starfleet replicator
technology. However, we rarely see in Star Trek anyone who isn't in
Starfleet who ISN'T engaged in private enterprise.

Most of all, what is the point of naming the flagship of the fleet
"Enterprise" if it is a communist society?

There are many incidents in Star Trek history of businessmen operating
openly, even if some are depicted in a rather typically
biased-Roddenberry fashion (Harry Mudd, of "Troubles with Tribbles" and
other episodes of ST:TOS featuring him, including the one with the
beauty pills and dilithium miners, and the one where Harry meets his
apparent end at the hands of an android that appears as his ex wife....)

In ST:TSFS, McCoy tries to arrange for passage to the Mutara sector with
a private shipowner in a private bar.

In ST:TNG, Capt. Picard's brother owns his own vinyard in France, which
he labored to keep "in the family" while Picard went off to the stars.
Furthermore, the Ferengi ARE a part of the Federation, even if they are
looked down on by snooty starfleet types.

Furthermore, in ST:DSN, there are numerous incidents of private
businesspeople, including the Ferengi Quark, who owns his own bar/casino
on the space station, as well as the Cardassian tailor, who owns his own
shop.

Yes, but it's just that, a "claim". This is different from fact.
Bey claims that such separation is a fact, it is not, but just his
claim.

Rather than a neutral position, this statement reeks of an anti-
technological bias...

I wasn't aware that anyone here thought that technology is value
neutral. I most certainly don't. I don't see anything in the
Extropian principals that says technology is value neutral. 

Under Intelligent Technology:

"Seeing technology not as an end in itself but as an effective
means towards the improvement of life"

We understand the risks involved, we accept them.

I agree also, but I don't see where he gets the idea that
Extropians think technology is value neutral. We understand culture
and society. We also understand they are flawed, and a rational
approach to improving them is the best solution.

Nor do we intend to be limited by them.

Again I agree, but this is supposed to be about Extropians, not
merely transhumanists, and I still don't see us as being value
neutral toward technology.

I agree with this also, but I also think he is wrong about us on

tech is involved. How about the open society principal?

We are not utopianists. We don't care how others choose to live
their lives, we just want to pursue the improvement of ours. This
is the difference between us and the luddites, we are willing to
leave them alone, but they are unwilling to leave us alone.

I think this whole essay is colored by Bey's misinterpretation of
Extropianism. He attempts to lump us in with transhumanists and
other assorted futurists. It's almost impossible to believe he has
actually read the Extropian principals. He also appears to be anti-
technology.

Still it was interesting.

The definition of a firearm under Federal law is (paraphrasing) any device 
which uses a chemical reaction to propel a projectile.  It is VERY 
general.  The only weapons that tend to be ignored are old black powder 
pistols and rifles.  Interestingly, the statute also states as a separate 
paragraph: "or any dangerous weapon" - which I assume allows a prosecutoi 
(subject to case law, I guess) to call ANYTHING a gun if he thinks he can 
get away from it.  Especially anything that increases its rate of fire by 
mechanical means (automatic - except I think hand cranks).  As for 
explosives, I knew a guy in the Federal pen who built a couple of pipe 
bombs to blow up a beaver dam on his property.  He made the mistake of 
letting someone else in on it - got about four years.  We called him 
"Beaver" :-}

Information Unlimited still publishes good designs for lasers and masers
of the home grown variety, and sells hard to get parts like HV
capacitors and diodes, etc.

There are, I think, FCC regulations on classification of lasers and
masers based on power output, but nothing I know of which restricts who
can build them.

The National Firearms Act of 1934 applies to any class II or III weapon
(sawed off shotguns, machine guns, etc) which applies, respectively, $5
and $200 taxes on the sale of such weapons. Technically it doesn't apply
to a person constructing their own personal weapon that fits in those
categories, but if you sell it to someone, you are breaking the law,
since the so-called Firearms Ownership Protection Act of 1986 banned the
sale of post-1986 manufactured Class II and III weapons to anyone
without a Federal Firearms License (Class III), and bans the sale BY
anyone without a class III manufacturers license of such devices.
"selling" under the NFA and FOPA is more than just exchanging for money.
If you die and leave it to a wife or other relative or friend, that is
considered a 'transfer' under the law, and comes under ATF jurisdiction.
If the person receiving the item doesn't have the proper FFL, and file
the paperwork, they are SOL and might as well just junk it or keep it
hidden away. Transfers between FFL holders require paperwork to the ATF,
but don't incur the tax.

So if you make your own, put it in a locked box and don't show it to
anyone, or tell anyone about it (especially psychotic female roomates,
girlfriends or wives, since I know of two fellows who owned such weapons
and were ratted on by such after breakups).

The NFA of 34 and the FOPA of 86 do not cover lasers, masers, or emp
devices, though these may be classified as Destructive Devices if
powerful enough.

Subject: Re: SOFTWARE: Do you play computer games?

My main complaint is that all these new technologies doesn't really
change the world - you still have cities, army units and mines even
when your devices are nanotech with AI powered by controlled
singularities. I would really like to create a game where such
developments really changed the way everything worked, but I realize
this might be extremely tricky to do game balance-wise and in a way that
non-initiated players would understand. 

One day - when I have time - I would dearly love to participate in
writing a game like SMAC with truly transhuman technologies and more
interesting personality simulations of the opponents. 

     ----------------------------------------

Indeed, same here.  I can not add another 'extropian' like game that exists
to the list (I did really like alpha centauri) but, like Anders, I would
like to write my own sometime.  My idea, in case there are any programmers
out there with a lot of free time would be an RTS, like star craft / alpha
centauri.  It starts in a similiar way that some other games out there
start, at the beginning of technological evolution, say early in the
agricultural age.  The whole game is logorithmically based, at first you
control individual units (your village people) the game progresses through
the ages and technological changes.  Not a whole lot different then what
some other games do.  But here is the difference, the game progresses far
into the future from Type I to Type II onto Type III galactic civilizations.
Your map starts out as, say, a 1km x 1km grid, a town or village.  You
control individual units, they are all to scale and 3D models.  But, as
technology and scale progresses, your map gets bigger and you can scale in
and out.  The smallest map is 1km x 1km, and covers 1km^2, the next can be
10km x 10km, a county sized scale (or maybe something in between, 2.5km,
5km)  At 10km you control 10 units at a time, and AI takes a small hold over
the units.  You zoom out again, you are at 100km x 100km and control 100
units at a time (for example)  Your territory covers a whole state.  You
scale further out to provinces, countries, hemispheres, planets, solar
systems, galaxies, galactic clusters...  

The flow of time would not be linear as well, as you progress further, time
passes more rapidly (just as kurzweil speaks of the diminishing time between
salient events) At the basic level, time passes 1 sec for every second
played, then moves to a 10:1, 100:1, etc. etc.  

The technological progression can probably be modeled by following basic
technological curves, things that like speed of transportation, (past the
confining light speed limit of classical / relativistic physics through
whatever technological name you muster) 

The main measurement in the game will be energy, how much energy is your
society producing how much can it control / harness (for transporation,
weapons, etc)

Energy generation / storage devices will go through the same technological
curves.

I would like it to be 3D, so views could be scaled and rotated easily, and
to switch to a first person view as well (which just amounts to a different
camera location in the 3D world)  

The game could start out as just one planet, and expansion packs would make
solar systems, galactic quadrants, galaxies, etc. available.

I would like to model algorithms that make up the names for the
technological breakthroughs, so they will not be limited or predifined, and
different civiliazations may have different means of accomplishing these
things (different size devices, different levels of effeciency, etc)

Ok, Im done.... back to the real world.

Well, you can network X-Plane. At this point, people mostly dial each
other up to fly together, but there are projects people are doing to
establish X-Plane game servers on the web.

While it runs on Win and Mac, there currently is no *nix version of
X-Plane, but I suppose you could run it on WINE. Since this is a small
company (essentially one programmer, Austin Meyer), he does have his
hands full. While the graphics accelleration uses OpenGL, X-Plane is not
necessarily an open source project. Austin seems to treat it as
'semi-open', providing code to those who are especially nice to him, but
not suffering fools gladly.

The system requirements listed on the website are not really mandatory.
I'm running version 6 just fine on a Pentium Pro 200 mhz with 32 megs of
ram and a nvidia 128 board with 32 megs of video ram and the rendering
is very very good.

Some of the other features:
- Intelligent air traffic control speech synthesis
- Realtime weather downloaded for the geography you are flying in
- Database of actual airfields all over North America (and Europe for
european customers) even little pisspot strips. 
- Accurate topographical rendering, buildings of note, etc.
- Aircraft carrier operations

The classic version of X-Plane uses no graphics accelerators, but I
don't think much of it. XPlane 6 sells at K-Mart for I think $39.95.

"Mars Odyssey investigators remain tight-lipped about what the
spacecraft is seeing, offering only subtle hints regarding the probe's
scientific sleuthing...

One "justifiable" hope for Mars scientists using THEMIS is to spot
localized deposits associated with hydrothermal environments. Finding
such a "hot spot" would be akin to studying sites at Yellowstone
National Park in Wyoming. Also, the device is on a global search for
heat belching up from active volcanic areas that may be still
percolating on Mars....

The spacecraft's Gamma Ray Spectrometer on Mars Odyssey -- really three
instruments in one -- is designed to analyze the chemical composition of
the Martian surface. The spectrometer also has the tantalizing
capability to detect water, if it exists, at shallow depths beneath
Mars' surface.
                   
Even though the detector is still latched close to the spacecraft, not
to be deployed on its boom for several more months, "we can see some
interesting signals from Mars," said William Boynton, principal
investigator for the gamma ray spectrometer suite at the University of
Arizona, Tucson. "I am extremely excited," he said.
                   
Late last year, scientists got what appeared to some as a whiff of a
water signature coming from Mars. 
                   
Data collected during tests of Odyssey's neutron spectrometer -- a
component of the gamma ray spectrometer suite -- showed signs of
hydrogen. But hydrogen may or may not mean water. Hydrogen is one
component of water, but also exists alone and in other substances."

I think I must be missing something here because this seems either trivial
or question-begging. It is trivial if you mean that if we invent the right
tools but don't change ourselves then we have not reached transhumanity.
This seems trivial given that changing ourselves is a necessary condition
for transhumanity. But of course the point of "machine evolution" or
evolution through genetic engineering is to change ourselves. Furthermore,
this seems to beg the question of our relation to "machine evolution"--if
they are our mind children then haven't 'We' changed?
Also I don't find this essay or your commentary enlightening on the HARD
question of transhumanist ethics, namely, our obligations now to institute
the appropriate ethical/social/political seed stock for the posthuman
revolution. I take it that you think that we do have such an obligation and
thus count you among the 'cultural activists'--those that think that we
should be doing all we can along these lines to ensure the future proceeds
in the right ethical direction. The cultural passivists believe that there
is little point in trying to set up the seed stock since the posthumanity
rupture will be so complete that our efforts will have little bearing on
subsequent events. It does not follow, as Bey says, that without this
cultural critique the cultural passivists are consigned to a passive role.
Applying technology to humans might provide the cultural passivists with all
the "critique" they need. Ultimately the essay works on the wrong unit of
analysis to be persuasive. The Marx/Heideggerian understanding of technology
being intimately associated with Humanity's self-identity is a
socio-historical thesis. The cultural passivists can easily accept this
thesis but say that it is irrelevant. Imagine preparing a bunch of monkey's
for their postmonkey state--our intention is to genetically alter them to
bring them up to human cogntive capacity. Is the first step to try to
fine-tune their culture (Cf. The Evolution of Culture in Animals, Bonner)?
Presumably the cultural passivists would say that all such efforts are
wasted given that the monkies will emerge into an entirely new cultural
"ecological niche". Similarly, fine-tuning our culture now might seem like a
waste of time and perhaps even a distraction from the more important goal of
advancing technology. The proper unit of analysis, then, might be something
like biological evolution, e.g., the emergence of the Hominid line from
Australopethicine.
     I  count among the cultural activists, but not because without a
cultural critique we must be resigned to "a passive role". My reasoning is
more pragmatic and less Heideggerian. Think of it in terms of a sort of
Pascalian wager. If we attempt to fine-tune our culture and the posthuman
breach is so vast that our efforts were in vain then little is lost. If we
attempt to fine-tune our culture and it has positive influence on the
posthuman future then all is gained. If we are passive and our efforts would
have had a positive influence on future events then all is lost. If we are
passive and our efforts would have had no effect then little is gained
(perhaps watching a little more tv, etc.).

While I can sympathize with that guy, in most locales anyone with a photo ID
can purchase high explosives legally and very cheaply (probably cheaper than
his manufactured pipe bombs).  Or he could have filled out a short form that
would have allowed him to legally manufacture the stuff.  About two thirds
of the legal explosive consumption in the U.S. is private individuals
purchasing it for a wide range of personal applications, and there is far
less red tape than if you were to do something such as purchase a car or buy
a firearm.  Most people just assume you can't buy it when in fact just about
anyone can buy a truckload of gel packs if they so desire (and there IS a
wide-range of ordinary applications for which explosives are indispensable).

Trying to influence present-day culture in the hopes of influencing
post-Singularity culture(*) is not the only possible way of entangling
yourself in the Singularity.  If you overestimate the relative importance of
"cultural development" then you run the risk of investing your limited
resources incorrectly.

The ceramic plates flatten and fragment rifle bullets.  The slower and less
ballistically efficient shape post-ceramic is easily stopped by the vest
underneath.  

Contrary to what Michael Lorrey stated, they will NOT stop AP (armor
penetrating) rifle bullets.  Part of the confusion is that marketing types
sell ammo as "AP" which was never designed as such by the military, but
which they can charge a premium for when selling to the gullible public.
This fake AP ammo can be stopped by armor vests.  Real AP has never been
available to the public and it is in fact illegal to own true AP ammo.  The
real clue that this is the case should be that the ATF does not crack down
on the myriad of "AP" ammo vendors.

The rules are complicated.  In the U.S., any weapon that doesn't require a
Form 4 transfer can legally be manufactured without licensing of any type as
long as you only do it for personal use and experimentation.  Building
restricted weapons requires a license called a Form 2 (IIRC), but once they
give it to you (and it is essentially a "shall issue" form) you can make
almost anything you want.  In conjunction with this, you would probably want
to fill out the form that gives you carte blanche to do anything you want
with explosives.

The biggest problem you are likely to have is in the category of Form 4
device classified as "Destructive Devices", which is a rather open-ended
definition although there are some regulatory guidelines.  However, a proper
Form 2 and broad explosives license should cover everything I would think.

And last but not least, most of these regulations apply only to Natural
Persons.  It is a moderately well-known loophole that a Corporation (and
agents of the corporation) are not subject to many/most of these
regulations.

Oh, one RTS that had at least a lot of high technology was Total 
Annihilation.  The back story is about this war between the CORE and ARM 
which has been going on for A Long Time Now and has consumed most of the 
galaxy's resources.  Originally, the CORE ruled the galaxy, but when 
uploading became feasible, they insisted that everybody be uploaded for 
their own good.  Some people didn't like this, and rebelled, forming the 
ARM (I don't know if the names stand for anything).  Since they don't have 
uploaded soldiers the ARM uses clones with Neural interfaces in all their 
vehicles.  Both sides use hard nanotechnology to build units and buildings, 
harvest resources, etc. though the nanites don't reproduce in the 
environment.  The two resources you can get are energy and metal, and yes, 
you can turn energy into metal if you really need too or have some extra 
fusion generators lying around.

Actually, I think he was using "extropian" to mean what we would call
"transhumanist". Remember that extropianism is the word that has been
spread most widely (especially in the US), and is quite often used as a
catch all for not just extropianism but for transhumanism and other
forms of techno-utopianism. Compare with Jaron Lanier's _Extropians and
Stewards_ editorial; again, the extropians discussed are not ExI, but
transhumanists.

"WHich is all rather BS. I'll buy that Starfleet operates
communistically, much as many military organizations do today to a
limited extent..."

    -----------------------------

If you check out the site, he addresses things like the Abolition of
property rights, State seizure of transportation services, State seizure of
communication services, Elimination of religion and traditional families,
State seizure of industry, Citizens are forced to work.  Just some examples:

No wealth: Counsellor Troi and Captain Picard have both boasted about how
the accumulation of wealth is no longer an incentive. What they don't
explain is why. Humans have always been territorial (and so have our
evolutionary ancestors), so our desire to accumulate more assets seems more
like a basic facet of human nature than a temporary cultural phenomenon. It
can be suppressed or modified through education and social conditioning, but
such methods are hardly 100% effective. Some greedy people should remain,
but not in Star Trek. So if humans in the future no longer desire wealth,
then why not? Do they use extremely advanced brainwashing techniques, so
sophisticated that no one can resist them? Or have they made the
accumulation of wealth illegal, as Marx advocated? The latter seems more
plausible. 
US Navy ships are even more so.

They're all company cars: What was the last time you saw a privately owned
personal starship? Starships are either government warships, diplomatic
vessels, or transports. The only one-person vehicles (apart from
non-Federation vehicles such as Quark's ship or Bajor's spacecraft) are
runabouts and shuttles, and they are always government property. Some might
argue that starships must be very expensive or difficult to operate and
therefore impractical for personal use, but Quark's ship disproved this
idea. 

Ma Bell is back: The entire subspace relay system is owned by the Federation
government, as described in the DS9 tech manual. There is no private
competitor. Since all interstellar communications must use this relay
network, this effectively gives the Federation government total control over
long distance communications. Furthermore, it appears that local
communications systems are government-operated as well, since the government
was able to effortlessly impose a complete local news blackout during the
attempted coup in "Paradise Lost." As another monopolistic Microsoftian
measure, all communications start and end with the ubiquitous Federation
logo, even on mixed civilian/military stations like DS9. Quark once ran
afoul of this monopoly when he wanted to broadcast advertisements for his
bar, and had no alternative but to break into DS9's communications system. 

Nietszche Wins- God is Dead: While the TOS episode "Balance of Terror" began
with a wedding in the ship's chapel, no TNG era ship seems to have a chapel
at all. Christianity appears to have been purged from society. One of the
most extreme examples of this deliberate suppression can be seen in a recent
episode of Voyager, the holographic Doctor actually portrayed a Catholic
priest and conducted a ceremony, but somehow avoided mentioning the names
"God" or "Jesus" entirely! How someone can portray a priest and avoid
mentioning God or Jesus is beyond me. Also, while "Bones" McCoy often
mentioned Jesus and God, we never hear the name "Jesus" on TNG, DS9, or
Voyager. This situation exists in stark contrast to every other
civilization, such as the Bajorans, Klingons, Ferengi etc. which all have
their own curious religions (always precisely one religion per species; I
guess aliens aren't very imaginative in Star Trek). 

etc. etc.

He also gives qualitative estimates of how fully these various things are
implemented (not all are 100%)

Mike Lorrey - "A Captain living in the world of Starfleet would have little
need of
money if all of his/her needs were met by the starfleet replicator
technology. However, we rarely see in Star Trek anyone who isn't in
Starfleet who ISN'T engaged in private enterprise."

     -----------------------------------

He was referring to the federation specifically, how often do you see any
member race of the federation engaged in private enterprise?

Mike Lorrey - "Most of all, what is the point of naming the flagship of the
fleet
"Enterprise" if it is a communist society?"

Because the writers were merely idealistic english majors who had no concept
of economics or physics, and catered to the Whim's of roddenberry and
berman.  Just cause the ship is named 'Enterprise' does not mean that the
federation supports free enterprise.

Mike Lorrey - "There are many incidents in Star Trek history of businessmen
operating
openly, even if some are depicted in a rather typically
biased-Roddenberry fashion (Harry Mudd, of "Troubles with Tribbles" and
other episodes of ST:TOS featuring him, including the one with the
beauty pills and dilithium miners, and the one where Harry meets his
apparent end at the hands of an android that appears as his ex wife....)"

     --------------------------------------

If you check the site out, he starts off (at some point) by saying that TOE
was mostly a free enterprise system, and joked that there must have been
some kind of coup in the intervening years.

Mike Lorrey - "In ST:TNG, Capt. Picard's brother owns his own vinyard in
France, which

     -------------------------------------

Interesting point, checking the database on his site I referenced above I
find

Season 4, Ep# 78: "Family"

(looking out over the vineyards) 
LOUIS: One man's idea of paradise. 
PICARD: Two men. Robert's. And my father's. 
LOUIS: Never did I know anyone less interested in grapes than you, Jean-Luc.

PICARD: No, I was interested, Louis. And I was proud that my family helped
to preserve the traditions. But I did not feel bound by those traditions as
they seemed to be.

His comments on the episode are...

Culture: not once in the entire episode do we hear talk of sales, but we do
hear of traditions. It seems as if the Picard family vineyard exists simply
to provide scenery for the local community.

This isn't unprecedented in real life. In certain European countries, some
farms are deliberately maintained despite economic unviability strictly for
reasons of aesthetics, so that tourists will see the quaint "old world"
agrarian lifestyles they've read about in books.

If you watch this episode you may notice that their agricultural techniques
are strictly primitive: everything is done by hand, as it was done centuries
ago. This contradicts the common Trekkie argument that the Picard farm is
proof of capitalism in the Federation, since a capitalist farm would be much
more profitable using modern technology (never mind the advanced technology
they would presumably have in four centuries).

At best, this would be analogous to modern "throwback" farms such as the
Amish and Orthodox Mennonite farms, which deliberately conduct their affairs
in a primitive manner. Of course, both of those religious sects preach that
money is the root of all evil, so a distinct resemblance hardly makes the
Federation look like a free-market society ...

     -------------------------------------

Mike Lorry - "Furthermore, in ST:DSN, there are numerous incidents of
private
businesspeople, including the Ferengi Quark, who owns his own bar/casino
on the space station, as well as the Cardassian tailor, who owns his own

Are the Ferengi and the Cardassians actually MEMBERS of the Federation?

Yes. This is exactly what I have been thinking of. It requires a
somewhat trustworthy AI to run your units, but could really get away
from the problem in SMAC that when you have a planet-spanning empire,
you are still micromanaging formers planting forest.

This is good, but it also introduces a limitation in multiplayer games.
Everybody needs to run at roughly the same speed, otherwise things will
not work. If player A is running at 100:1 and player B at 1:1, then we
have problems. For a single player game this is no problem.

I would use energy, information and control over matter as main
measurements. Information deals with how much information can be stored,
transmitted and controlled, matter control deals with the scale of
control (macrotech, microtech, nanotech, femtotech, plancktech...).

And advances should not always have predictable or wholly good effects -
inventing AI should open a huge can of worms, as would methods of
motivation control.

I am not sure we disagree here. I would count you among the most devoted of
the cultural activists: FAI seems to be an attempt to ensure that we have
the best probability of raising the right sort of mind children. Your
documents are not attempts at 'pop' culture, but they are contribution to
culture in a more inclusive sense. As you well-know, there are some that
think that any attempt to influence the direction of the singularity is
futile. Some of us think that how the singularity occurs could be as
important as the fact that it does occur.

Mark.

What evidence is there for this kind of development? There are certainly
a lot of cultural processes that are going on, how can we chack if the
processes we have experienced have been necessary (or likely) results of
preconditions such as writing, or just how it happened? 

I do not quite agree that writing would lead to monotheism - just look
at China, where writing has been very prevalent but no major monotheist
religions have originated. I'm also unaware of any evidence for ancient
pre-monotheisms, unless one assumes the seed to be the remote high gods
in many nature religions.

The issue isn't really religion here (although that is interesting), but
rather the determinism of history. Will the invention of the computer
inevitabily lead to the Internet and global freedom of information? Will
the introduction of writing lead to monotheisms? Will the introduction
of agriculture lead to the singularity? These are very relevant issues
to consider.

Actually, I think there were plenty of philosophers that never did
write. Compare to the various gnostic teachers that emerged later. But
writing empowers philosophers tremendously, both in spreading and
receiving ideas. But you could have a Christianity without Plato; a lot
of early Christianity doesn't seem to have been highly literate.

Interesting idea, but China and Japan doesn't seem to support it at all.

Does it? I would not say the Mayans and Atztecs to be uninterested in
the natural world, but they didn't seem to be exploring it to the extent
found in Eurasia (outside certain areas such as astronomy, where they
were excellent). In fact, for most of the history of writing exploration
of the natural world has been very limited. I would rather say exploring
the natural world is more linked with a mindset that says it is a
worthwhile subject that can be understood, and that is a far more
cultural aspect than the existence of writing.

Why in such a short time? Remember that the societies they lived in had
had writing for very different times and used very different writing
systems.

I think I understand your view, and to some extent it is of course true:
you cannot come up with universal laws of gravity unless you have other
examples of universal laws, mathematics and likely astronomy to provide
some objects of study. Hence they will occur subsequent to each other.

But I'm not so convinced about the necessity in this process. Sometimes
cultures do not take "obvious" steps for a long time (like the wheel and
the mesoamericans) because the environment does not promote them.
Sometimes culture intervenes, like the long period of stasis imposed by
the Ming in China, and sometimes economics (slavery inhibiting
mechanisation in antiquity). These are all examples of cul de sacs. But
culture can also promote exploration of certain issues with great energy
(like astronomy has been strongly promoted in astrology-prone societies)
or lead to serependitious innovations (the discovery of lenses - leading
to telescopes, microscopes and optics - could have been done in
antiquity or china). The idea of linear progress inherent in
Christianity is sometimes said to have fuelled the expansion of the
west, and that is true. But what about the Orthodox church in the east,
and the Islamic world with its similarly linear view? Small differences
in interpretation - in several cases due to individuals and their power
games - caused them to behave far differently and give other priorities
to their cultures. 

The big question is: how deterministic is history? We can be certain it
is not entirely deterministic - the tyfoon saving Japan from Chinese
invasion was in the end due to sensitive dependency on initial
conditions. We can also be certain it is not entirely random - as Jared
Diamond pointed out in _Guns, Germs and Steel_ there are noticeable
patterns in how different civilizations have evolved over huge amounts
of time and great geographical separation. Is there any way we can
decribe the exact amount of determinism? It is not so much a
quantitative issue as a qualitative one.

Yes. This is exactly what I have been thinking of. It requires a
somewhat trustworthy AI to run your units, but could really get away
from the problem in SMAC that when you have a planet-spanning empire,
you are still micromanaging formers planting forest.

     ---------------------------------

Definately, I cant imagine doing all that micromanaging.  Adding some random
fluctuations into the AI's managing might make things interesting as well,
to represent those occasional bad leaders that can really muck things up.

This is good, but it also introduces a limitation in multiplayer games.
Everybody needs to run at roughly the same speed, otherwise things will
not work. If player A is running at 100:1 and player B at 1:1, then we
have problems. For a single player game this is no problem. 

    -----------------------------------

Yeah, I hadnt really worked this out all that much yet, its basically in the
'thinking about this' stage.  Multiplayer would definately require identical
flows of time, but a system similiar to the 'levels' in Everquest may be a
good one to follow.  For every 10^X increase in energy control /
consumption, etc, time flow may increase by a factor, and progress to the
next 'level' that way civilizations in multiplayer arenas would have to
compete only with civilizations on similiar scales.  You can still have
different civilizations at different times playing in the same universe, the
advanced ones would only see quick glimpses of the slow moving planets,
while the less advanced civ may see the advanced civ as snapshots taken of
the advanced civ status when they view it.  (does that make sense?) Id have
to think about that some more.

> The main measurement in the game will be energy, how much energy is your

I would use energy, information and control over matter as main
measurements. Information deals with how much information can be stored,
transmitted and controlled, matter control deals with the scale of
control (macrotech, microtech, nanotech, femtotech, plancktech...). 

     ----------------------------------

Thats a good idea, I would definatel add those as measurements of progress.
What do you think should be in for resources as well, Id like to follow the
technological progress curve, stone, wood, iron, metals, etc for material
resources, food and water for support, and fuels, wood, coal, oil, nuclear,
etc for energy sources.  These all require managing at some level (which AI
can take over at different points of course) and infrastructures of their
own.  I can see this as getting really complex really fast...

And advances should not always have predictable or wholly good effects -
inventing AI should open a huge can of worms, as would methods of
motivation control. 

     ----------------------------------

Hmm, good idea as well.  Would be difficult to implement, various past
technologies could have taken similiar turns, The more dynamic the game is
(the more it makes itself unique) as it goes along the better the
playability, and hopefully the more value in continued play.  

So, know any good programmers with a lot of time on their hands =)

Oh, that's very hard to imagine!  Let's see...  Socrates! 

Don't you think that the use of the dialogue form by Plato and later 
philosophers is telling here?  I mean you don't need the written word to do 
philosophy -- any more than you need writing to do reasoning, logic, math, 
solve problems, etc.  Surely, it helps out, but how much?  Even when you 
read something on philosophy, you still have to do the work in your head.  
If not, then can you claim to have done philosophy (or math or science or 
anything that involves more than memorizing a result)?

Tomorrow starts debate in the house on H.R. 1542 Tauzin-Dingell.

This bill will determine the near term future of communications in
the U.S.

If it passes (without amendments) The RBOC's will not be forced to
share their existing data networks nor any future networks. A level
playing field.

If it passes we will be immediately rolling out existing DSL
services to everywhere we now serve. In addition plans for a new
fiber network will be launched.

A defeat means no new DSL expansion, and no new fiber network.

Friends,

>From the discussion of the organ
donation/commercialization, I've snipped a couple of
characteristic comments: 
 
"Would it not be more extropian to encourage
trade in human organs?"

"Does it get us generally closer to the type of
world we wish/need  to live in?  It doesn't look much
like what my goal is.  On the one hand it is ghastly
unpleasant and subject to tons of abuse. 
If that is so then granting such trade legal status
would legalize a nightmare with serious moral and
health repurcussions."

"There are few organs which can be taken from live
bodies, and enough people die that market forces would
result in demand satisfied by dead peoples organs."

"I cant see a down side to legalizing organ trade.
Your concerns sound vaguely paranoid, but are
unfortunately shared by most people-
making it unlikely that organ trade will occur in
the near future."

     ----------------------------------

It occurs to me that this entire situation, with its
powerful ethical concerns, intensity of emotion, and
fierce social focus is likely to evaporate rather
abruptly right before our eyes--become moot--, with
the availability of alternatives to salvaged human
organs.  

Replacement organs from pigs--

http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-02/shc-ibi022502.php

could be close.  When they become available, it will
mean multiple organ systems in great abundance, with
near zero ethical problems(there'll still be some
religious conflicts and animal rights issues, but
these will pale in comparision to questions relating
to "carving up the dead/poor/clones/embryos").  

This will mark a first-generation solution to the
desperate-human-suffering-driven demand for
replacement organs, and will substantially reduce the
social pressure surrounding the issue--take "the heat"
off, as it were.  After that breakthrough, I would be
looking for extensions of this technology.  Those same
transgenic pigs might then be employed--would
immunocompatibility work both ways do you think?-- as
hosts for the growing of individual personal--ie "your
own tissue"-- replacement parts using stem cell
cloning techniques.

Thence on to nano-organs and other surprises.

      -----------------------------

Anyway, my point is, that I think the current
intensity of emotion obscures the imminent calm after
the storm, analogous to the radical change,
improvement, and expansion in surgical practice
brought about by the advent of anesthesia.    

Fix the problem.  Enhance.  Transcend.

Best, Jeff Davis

Mike,

For networked strategy on Linux, you must try Freeciv.  Download the 
source from freeciv.org.  It is a labor of love by CIV II geeks, similar 
to CIV II but better in many ways- most notably the skill of the AIs.  
Besides Freeciv, I also frequently play Master of Orion II, but the AI is 
just too easy to beat.  Hmmmmm- If the gaming industry continues its rapid 
growth, they will soon be pouring far more funds into AI development than 
the universities will.  Wonder if the first sentinent AI will be doomed to 
life as a gladiator?  

In other news, check out today's USA Today or Washington Times, if you 
can.  The Libertarian Party ran a full page satirical counterattack to all 
the recent drug-users-support-terrorism ads.  A huge head of drug czar 
John Walters says:  "This week, I had lunch with the President, testified 
before Congress, and helped funnel $40 million in illegal drug money to 
groups like the Taliban." (Oops, forgot to mention ruining innocent lives, 
wasting taxpayer money, and burning the Constitution- oh well).  The fine 
print explains how overzealous politicians allow terrorists to reap 
enormous profits from the drug trade, and refers readers to LP.org for 
follow-up.  The total cost was $70,000, raised in a recent fundraiser.  If 
the government only knew the things I subsidize with my fat government 
paycheck, they might actually cut spending!  Hehehehe...

Indeed. The problem here is the assumption of a continuous, linear model of
development. I'm very sceptical about that-certainly it needs to be
supported rather than assumed. Also, there's an implicit assumption that
monotheism is more "advanced" than or grows out of polytheism. I think that
is simply an assumption (with all sorts of baggage in it). Steve Davies

I think all of the evidence is against a determinist model of history so my
answer to all of these points is no, not necessarily. SD

If I remember correctly, this was first pointed out by Jaspers, who coined
the term "Axial Age" for this period. The fact that this happened suddenly
suggests that there was a "concatenation of circumstances" (as Jeeves would
say) around that time. One would be the appearance of trans-Eurasian trade
routes at this time. Another important factor would be the emergence of a
new kind of political system in the Middle East (the Persian Empire of Cyrus
and Darius) which among other things makes this linkage possible. Of course
it may be that we are retrospectively seeing pattern where there is none-the
historicity of some of these people is open to doubt. SD

Absolutely, this is one of the *big* questions with a lot of bearing on how
we view our own situation today. I tend towards a less deterministic model
myself but I do think institutions are enormously important and they can be
very hard to change. Steve Davies

Riefying the eschaton set the tone for the whole dialogue (for me, anyway)
and I read a pervasive fear and preemptive nostalgia for assumed loss. He
sees the singularity as apocalyptic and extropians as the bearer of the
weapons to bring it about. All couched in an exclusionist word-cloud.

The various translations/interpretations/wrist slaps helped. I wish I had an
'AskAndersSemanticExtractoriser' online full time. However, in the absence
of this and being comparatively philospohically and linguistically
'challenged' I have a need for valid points to be expressed succinctly and
quickly. Call me a lazy illiterate Engineer.

Isn't it obvious that technology has moral implications oozing everywhere
and that the reality of the integration of technology into our lives is
patchy and likely to remain something like that despite any individual's
dreams? That reality is grey? That ideals and utopias are unlikely? There
you are. The whole thing in a couple of sentences.

Maybe it is a kind of poetry. I just wish that the message conveyed was as
compelling as all the verbage used to convey it. For me neither poetry nor
cogent written argument received any justice. I could have presented this
email as a viking rowing chant and sounded really academic. It just seemed
such a wank.

There you go. A slightly longer version of 'full of it'. I guess I'm just
lazy. I love the way Ms Grapps throws a smelly fish into the ring and sits
back and watches the cartoon cloud fight!  :)

Good point.  If that's a cause-and-effect relation there, then I'd have to
say the development of writing may have permanently crippled the development
of philosophy.

This is something I have wondered myself. Living in the UK  we are subject to 
much tighter gun control laws. However I resently had indepth corespondence 
with my local Constablary, which is equivelent to a centralised state police 
centre (not sure if such a thing exists in the US). I was enquiring about the 
laws regarding production of  Paintball guns.   
       To those of you who have never played paintball, the guns used can 
hold in excess of 140 rounds and fire them at a rate of 20 rounds per second 
!. And be reloaded in less than 1 second. 
       In the UK a paintball gun is only subject to 2 regulations. 
1. It must be semi automatic e.g fire ONE shot per trigger pull
2. Must not exceed the 12 FT/lb law e.g the energy of the projective must not 
exceed 12ft/lbs

But as the licencing officer told me "Paintball guns are considered TOYS" and 
as such they needed no license to own and therefor, no license to manufacture.

       This lead me to wonder. As the 12 ft//lb law is subject to a simple 
mathmatical eqution (weight * mass=energy). It stands to reason that a weapon 
that delivers a projectile of extremely low mass at extremely high velocity 
could easily come within this restriction and be an unlicensed or 
unlicensable  weapon. Dispite being cabable of killing/maiming, causing 
extreame bodily harm.

This is just a reference to the inadequate laws regarding Gun control in the 
UK. Obviously the UK's laws are far more extreme than in the U.S.
       But in answer to your question regarding Laser and E.M.P weapons. As 
far as the UK is concerned, I have not found a single peice of legislation 
that would stop you building such a weapon, even if it were of sufficient 
size to cause considerable damage or death.
       The UK laws genarally seem to be "If something bad happens, we will do 
something about it" if not, then do what you want as long as it doesn't cause 
me paperwork !.
       After all, the guy who invented, developed and tried to build the 
Super Gun was British. Im sure tha under UK law he could have built it in his 
back yard and got away with it. That may sound ridiculous, but under UK law 
it is perfectly legal to own, Use and drive an operational "TANK" in ANY part 
of the British isles without a license, But you must have a license to own a 
Dog.
       Go figure !.

Alex

<BR>This is something I have wondered myself. Living in the UK &nbsp;we are subject to much tighter gun control laws. However I resently had indepth corespondence with my local Constablary, which is equivelent to a centralised state police centre (not sure if such a thing exists in the US). I was enquiring about the laws regarding production of &nbsp;Paintball guns. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those of you who have never played paintball, the guns used can hold in excess of 140 rounds and fire them at a rate of 20 rounds per second !. And be reloaded in less than 1 second. 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the UK a paintball gun is only subject to 2 regulations. 
<BR>1. It must be semi automatic e.g fire ONE shot per trigger pull
<BR>2. Must not exceed the 12 FT/lb law e.g the energy of the projective must not exceed 12ft/lbs
<BR>
<BR>But as the licencing officer told me "Paintball guns are considered TOYS" and as such they needed no license to own and therefor, no license to manufacture.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lead me to wonder. As the 12 ft//lb law is subject to a simple mathmatical eqution (weight * mass=energy). It stands to reason that a weapon that delivers a projectile of extremely low mass at extremely high velocity could easily come within this restriction and be an unlicensed or unlicensable &nbsp;weapon. Dispite being cabable of killing/maiming, causing extreame bodily harm.
<BR>
<BR>This is just a reference to the inadequate laws regarding Gun control in the UK. Obviously the UK's laws are far more extreme than in the U.S.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in answer to your question regarding Laser and E.M.P weapons. As far as the UK is concerned, I have not found a single peice of legislation that would stop you building such a weapon, even if it were of sufficient size to cause considerable damage or death.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UK laws genarally seem to be "If something bad happens, we will do something about it" if not, then do what you want as long as it doesn't cause me paperwork !.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the guy who invented, developed and tried to build the Super Gun was British. Im sure tha under UK law he could have built it in his back yard and got away with it. That may sound ridiculous, but under UK law it is perfectly legal to own, Use and drive an operational "TANK" in <U>ANY</U> part of the British isles without a license, But you must have a license to own a Dog.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go figure !.

So the luddites and other romantic primitivists truly do want to
de-evolve the human race back to pre-history, when there was no
'mediation' through the written word.

It's no wonder I've such hostility for the way Brin seems to celebrate
in his uplift series about the downward path to redemption.

You can use whatever prefix seems appropriate.

Come on. You expect people posting to mailing lists---
where you actually have to type!---to write subject

    IRR|NoTGUn /FAKEeGN|PRIVIT(sp?): The `Flamethroewr" was (was:Re:arrrgh)) 

So, anyway, if I've understood your above prefix 
suggestions then I should be able to post, say,

which would be about a low-ranking soldier taking the

I just realized that a logical tree structure or path-

determine which subtopic is being discussed, find the 
relationship between topics, and filter on whole 
categories. 

Thus, a flame about the recent elections could have 
the prefix of 
"POLITICS/GOVERNMENT/PROCESS/ELECTION/PRESIDENTIAL/2000
/STATE/FLORIDA/BALLOT/SUBTYPE/BUTTERFLY/COMMENT/NEGATIV
E/REPLY/LONGISH:"

If this is so, then why is it that the same material is used to stop
anti-tank artillery rounds?

No, it doesn't. The advent of replicator technology has eliminated the
drive for fulfillment of basic needs through labor. Furthermore, the
federation citizens you generally only see in TNG are Starfleet
officers, trained at Starfleet Academy. These are scientists whose every
need is supplied by Starfleet from the moment of their induction. If
they need personal items, they are replicated, so the concept of 'cost'
for personal items and consumables is obsolete.

However, it is far more telling to watch the future life of the TNG
teleport officer, who is a non-commissioned officer, who worked his way
up through the ranks, and later works at Deep Space Nine, where we see
his wife and child on a regular basis. There are a number of
conversations about whether they can 'afford' certain perks, like
vacations, as well as paying for the damages incured by their child's
pranks with his Ferengi friends.

Yes, and Quark is a Ferengi, and the Ferengi ARE part of the Federation,
ergo there IS private ownership of starships.
Furthermore, what of the Maqui? Their ships are all privately owned,
converted from privately owned freighters, yachts, or transports, and
they were all formerly in the jurisdiction of the Federation.

Now, you may claim: but any world that joins the Federation must adopt
communism. This claim is directly contradicted by the Prime Directive.
Individual worlds are free to develop as they wish.

Deep Space Nine is located in Bajoran space, which is treated as a DMZ
or UN Protectorate equivalent following the Cardassian War. Furthermore,
it is a station that is owned by the Federation, so it is obvious that
they would control their own communications systems. You only see the
federation logo on comm screens because the only comm screens you ever
see are federation owned screens.

Note that Picard's brother makes a number of references to God. That
being said, it is possible that the public exposure of the Q culture
likely contributes to significant doubt (as well as the result of
ST:TFF, where 'God' is a bully).

Actually, there have been heretical religions in several cultures (note
the heretical Klingons encountered by Voyager who thought B'lanna
Torres' unborn child was their savior.

Now, lets say that God has either been proven to be non-existent, or
else federation technology has allowed private individuals to have a
direct comm line with the universes sysop. In either case, chapels would
be unnecessary, but what, exactly, does this have to do with capitalism?

Rarely do you meet anyone who is not wholly starfleet or otherwise
employed in a government position. Tell me, how many people do you think
would be found in a drama set aboard the aircraft carrier Enterprise who
were not either military or government personnel? You might see some
when the ship is in port, but how many times do you see that? In such
cases, you always see private individuals who are either scientists,
contractors, or other business people.

This is inaccurate. Note how farms in Japan still use primitive hand
labor, hand polishing apples while still on the tree, etc and as a
result command a far higher market price than mass produced American
products, even of the same species. Note that 'authentic' french
champagne produced using traditional methods commands higher prices than
mass produced American "champagne" which is produced by the same method,
but automated, though is not allowed to be called 'champagne'. Note also
the organic farming movement, which commands higher prices for its
produce than non'organic' produce.

I would imagine that wine that is certified to be hand made by human
labor would command a very high price to certain snobs and luddite
types, who would look with distain on 'replicator food' as plebian and
possibly bad for you, as many modern luddites claim about BGH milk, Bt
corn, and golden rice.

The cited individuals live IN the federation, as resident aliens live IN

RE: Paintball regs in britain:

I assume that the projectile must also contain paint. Fine, a .17 cal
projectile of lead paint baked to an aerodynamic solid form, propelled

A local gun dealer who is a friend sells these fully auto electrically

apply to these in britain.

My impression while reading the books was that Brin wasn't all that 
sympathetic to the "downward path" himself.  Consistently in his Uplift 
books the good guys have been believers in progress, confronted with a 
stratified galactic society.  He comes down more firmly and explicitly 
against this attitude in "Glory Season," an excellent book.

Speaking of Troi, I will refer, for a coup de grace, to the Voyager
episode featuring Troi and Mr. Barkley, where a tranmission of a
hologram of Barkley is intercepted by Ferengi, modified into a Ferengi
agent, then sent on to Voyager in order to bring Seven of Nine through a
geodesic gate to Federation space, where the Ferengi plan to harvest
Seven's nanoprobes to "sell throughout the federation" as a form of
medical and anti-aging treatment. The real Barkley has been seduced by a
human female, ON EARTH, in the employ of the Ferengi as a Dabo girl, who
they have offered a 10% cut for her work in ferreting out key
information from the shy Barkley.

Sounds to me like the engines of free commerce and private enterprise
are well lubed in the Federation of the TNG era (note that Voyager is
contemporary with the Enterprise of Picard, Troi and Will Riker are
still crew on Enterprise with Picard at the time of this episode.)

       If you are refering to the "soft air" type of guns as they are refered 
to in the UK. These being fully automatic electro/air powered guns that fire 
rounds around 6mm in caliber at low velocity, Then yes we have them here. 
They are also considered toys. I do own a couple of these guns for general 
"Mucking around" type activities. Interestingly when I purchased them , I had 
to sign a register stating the model, My name, DOB, address etc. I believe 
this is for police records to avoid accidental lethal force being used 
against owners of such harmless "toys" that look and feel totally authentic.

I believe these guns are regulated with a different law that states they can 
only have a maximum power of X joules. I belive the regitration is purely due 
to the lifelike appearance of the guns.
       This has caused me amusement due to the fact that. UK citizens can 
purchase Blank firing guns without license/registration/identification and 
carry them in a public place.

Sadly, the rules were more Calvinball-esque than formalized.  I don't
think it even had a proper name.  (Remember, this was online; we had the
cards we said we had.)  But perhaps something could be developed from
it...

It's probably notable what groups *don't* have anything like them
represented by cards.  Like the Extropians.  This is not a conspiracy.

This reminds me of Metal Fatigue.  A pretty good RTS, IMHO, which
resorted to hard nano to make the only truly limited resources
technology and that which one uses to create useable energy
("metajoules", harvested either from deep underground or from the sun).
Need a building?  Park your constructor truck nearby, load the right
program, and sweep your projector across the building site to convert
rock into material.  They also had manpower as a resource, obtainable
with energy to thaw out cryo-frozen people; they could as easily have
quick-grown clones, or use the MJ to create new computronium or the
like to host new AIs.  Neural implants played a significant role in
the plot, though unfortunately mostly for mind control (though they
did raise the point: is a reprogrammed entity responsible for its
prior actions).

>Thus with respect to beings with below human levels of intelligence, which are otherwise rather similar to us (eg: mammals), it is difficult to see where lines could rightly be drawn to grant us rights but deny the same to them. After all, in a context  
where we are talking about becoming SIs, etc, the difference between a human and, say, a dog, is negligable.   
  
Thoughts?   
  
Emlyn

I agree that the basic potential is probably there for dogs to reach true sentience - barely, given a truly accellerated early childhood environment.  I suspect that even then, the smartest dog would rank as a low-grade moron in human terms.  Dogs can be very smart on the perceptual level, but it's the ability to abstract common characteristics from a set of concretes, perceptual or mental, and form a symbolic operator that distinguishes us from them and other terran animals.    
  
Dogs can do this, I know, as can parrots, mynas, ravens, chimpanzees, most higher apes doubtless and probably many of the cetaceans.  But they are - with the possible working exception of some of the cetaceans - only able to get to the first level 
of perceptual-based concepts, with rare exceptions, meaning that they could never reach the singularity without the help of a truly sentient species.   
 
Humans, on the other hand, can perform limitless abstractions on abstractions.	As far as we know, no area of knowledge is closed to us in theory, although the practicalities would indicate that a true SI would handle abstractions trivially that we struggle 
lifetimes to dimly grasp.  
  
Without the proper early-learning environment, of course, we humans don't do very well either, as in the wild child of Avignon, etc.    
  
In the case of "rights," however, there are some fine distinctions to be made that pretty much rule out most of the other animals - with higher apes and cetaceans a maybe...  
  
A "right" - from Rand (and Morris and Linda annehill, who did some nice parsing of this in their "The Market for Liberty," still probably the best introduction to anarcho-capitalism) - is an ethical sanction against interference with ones action.  This presumes a clear understanding of the component terms - ethical, sanction, action.  

Rights are a negative concept, in that they define when we can properly forbid someone else from interfering with what we choose to do.  Without rights and the structure of ethics and contract and the social mechanisms to interpret and enforce conflicts that arise as we bump into each other, we would spend much or our time simply protecting ourselves instead of being productive.

Assuming for a moment, as Rand does, that the pursuit of values necessary to preserve ones life and happinesss is inherently good - almost a tautology 
if you take life as the moral standard - then we can each individually morally justify preventing interference with our actions aimed at that end.    
  
Presumeably a "dumb animal" could do the same, by the same standard.  However, the most precise formulation of the definition of rights does not use "moral sanction," but rather "ethical sanction," taking "ethics" as the formal application of morality 
- the science of values - to the universe of society. 
 
Morality, or "meta-ethics," as some would term it (although really meta-ethics - above or about ethics - should deal exclusively with the issues that delimit the field of ethics itself) would still be perfectly applicable to a man alone on a desert island.  He would still have values and there would be choices to be made.  He could act immorally - denying his own 
long term values - like the sailor in "Blue Lagoon" who drank himself to death, or he could focus on what the most rational course of action was and pursue it with total dedication, like Tom Hanks in "Castaway."  He would not need ethics, however. It simply wouldn't apply.	
  
Ethics does apply to society, where it is essential in defining the proper boundaries that keep us from colliding in our individual pursuits, in creating a framework for efficient cooperation, and in specifying the rules by which conflicts should 
be resolved.  A proper ethics optimizes the return upon our choice to partake in organized society.  A bad, corrupt ethics, such as the Judeo-Christian 
altruist standard, turns everyone against everyone and/or works to benefit the dishonest few who have rigged the game, at the expense of everyone. 
  
Because adherence to such an ethics is critically important to survival - the alternative being the universal use of brute force and the adoption of a predatory lifestyle - we place great value upon knowing that our companions are indeed "ethical," that we can safely invite them into our homes, do business with them without paranoid security systems, etc.	

Other human beings are, after all, the source of 99.999% of all the valuable things, experiences and ideas in our lives (which shows just how successful ethics has in fact been - even the corrupted ethics that currently prevail.).  
  
Further, and perhaps just as important, we, as well as probably all other mammals as well as birds perceive ourselves via open, honest interactions with our fellow humans.  In fact, this is the ONLY way we can truly perceive ourselves, apart from the mere physical image in a mirror.  Other sentient creatures provide	a mirror to our consciousness, and thereby a check upon insidious loops of insanity parasiting off our mental machinery. 
 
Since lower animals also need this interaction - as demonstrated by a plethora of deprivation experiments with mice, rats, monkeys, etc. - why do we not accord them rights as well?  The reason is fairly simple, although subtle. We don't need to - usually. 

For example, we gain no advantage as omnivores in categorically renouncing meat-eating.  It may 
be more healthy, but there will be times when that's all that is available.  We deal with cows as we choose, without any inherent economic downside to our predation.  

Try that with humans and not only will the general level of productivity suffer if you manage to become a little dictator, or a thief or con artiste, but you will be risking massive retaliation and be forced, if you are rational, to constantly expend energy and time watching your back.  The more productive people there are, the better off everyone is.  The more thieves there are, the worse off everyone is.  Even the thieves are hurt by having too many thieves around.
 
Similarly, and perhaps just a important, we usually gain no advantage in personal visibility, as discussed above, from granting rights to rats, crows, pigeons, dire wolves or saber-toothed tigers - the latter two having been exterminated by humans for good reason.  (Note that if the tigers or wolves had been sentient, it would have been a different ball game, as contractual based specialization could have arisen - as essentially did happen eventually with wolves (i.e., dogs)).

If a person actually has a personal relationship with a lower animal, then it may be important and mutually beneficial to put that relationship on a footing of mutal respect for the pursuits of each other, and an implicit granting of basic rights, and many lower animals do clearly have the capacity for behaving in accordance with such an implicit compact and reciprocating in kind.  

By a kind of extension, a pet dog acquires rights of a sort by virtue of his relationship to his owner that go beyond those of mere physical property, such as a car.  The dog's owner is behaving in a relationship that involves a mutual recognition of rights between him and his pet - else it is a very violent and sad relationship.  The dog, for instance, in guarding the house of his owner, becomes an agent of the owner.  

The implicit understanding between owners and pets who they love, that each is of great value to the other, and that each will behave in accordance with that fact - as in dogs who heroically rescue owners or their children from fires - becomes by extension a recognition of certain bounded rights for that particular dog - and pet dogs in general, although not the same open-ended rights that humans have.

Obviously, this line of analysis, (which is somewhat new to me, so I'm exploring this as I'm writing) may also have direct bearing upon the rights of children...
 
My own personal interspecies experience includes long-term dealings with parrots, crows, cats and dogs.  I know from many, many experiences that a lot of dogs are incredibly sensitive to the emotional states of humans.  Often they can tell from a distance whether you are afraid of them or not.  (Not all dogs can do this reliably - it does have a strong learned component, and the newer breeds of attack dogs have had a lot of the empathy bred out of them.)  
 
More importantly for the course of this discussion, as it helps me make a piont, dogs are often quite adept at detecting whether you are being emotionally open with them or putting up a front.  I learned decades ago that I could literally control many dogs' behavior from thirty feet away simply by choosing to suppress my feelings or allowing myself to feel them.  I don't know what subliminal vocal or olfactory cues I was giving off, but it definitely worked.
 
Dogs clearly percieve emotional suppression as a threat - much more of a threat than simple anger or fear directed at them. They will usually shy away from someone - or attack them - who is suppressing fear, not someone who is afraid.  It is thus that they can tell friends from enemies.  Their friends don't have to hide anything.  (Smarter dogs are quite capable of trickery.)
 
(On the flip side of this, taking a leaf from Wilhelm Reich, the control mechanisms of society are largely about keeping people in a state of deprivation in terms of emotional interaction.	Since this is one of the most important needs - especially in the formative years (see the most recent Scientific American for some real breakthrough research on the actual measureable brain damage that such deprivation causes - especially for boys), it is only natural that when the real needs are not met, then symbolic 
needs can be easilly substituted, pretty much a definition of neurosis.  Once you've got someone hooked on symbolic substitutes, you've really got them, as the substitutes never actually satisfy the original real need.) 

I want to introduce some archaic terminology here, as there really is no good substitute.  The term I'm bringing into play is "honor."  This is something that nowdays is seen in parody more than elsewhere perhaps, and has suffered conflations similar to that of "hero" with "victim."  O'well.  I'm sure that there are better definitions, but off the top of my head, being "honorable" means not having anything about yourself, especially your motives, that you should rationally need to hide.  Or, another perspective of the same issue, living in such a way that you would want yourself as a neighbor and a companion in times of peril.  I.e., not living as a cheat or a predator.

In society, the primary beneficiary of a commitment to honorable behavior is not other people.  It is ones self, in the most literal sense.  A person who knows that he or she will behave honorably - meaning, among other things, respecting the rights of others and not taking unfair advantage of them, or treating others with justice as a central principle - does not have to constantly second guess his or her own 
reactions in fear that others will discover his real nature. 
 
But then there's the rub... What happens when being honest is directly opposed to staying alive - as a Jew in NAZI Germany, for example?  It is "civil society" that is required to make honorable behavior possible and profitable.  In civil society, neither ones beliefs alone nor ones expression of them is likely to get one killed or beaten up.

When civil society is torn apart and set against itself, as with religious wars, such as our current incredibly devastating War on Drugs, when people have to conceal who they really are, and can only open up to members of their own belief, tribe, gang, party, etc., then honorable behavior can become a liability.

With the loss of honor as a basis for rational behavior goes also trust, as rights devolve to mere material economic utility, and we see a increasingly draconian use of force to enforce and protect them, as people lose their natural honor-based inclination to behave ethically regardless of whether a cop is watching. Then only iron-clad contracts can ensure compliance and various expensive economic mechanisms must be employed to provide the security necessary to carry out normal business - the sad situation in China, for example, for most of its history.  

(It is damnably difficult to invoke a concept such as "rights," which we of the West have enough trouble keeping clear, when you don't first have a concept of objectivity.  How, in practice, can you make the kind of precise decisions about property boundaries that we demand of our courts to resolve our disputes, if you can't agree that there is an objective reality?  Answer: you don't, and it devolves to force.  Who has power gets everything else.  Who lacks power will lose everything. You get to build your dam if you are the strongest, slyest and meanest and can hang onto your stones long enough to pile them up.  Otherwise, someone more capable in those areas will use your stone to build their wall.)

This has been kind of a round about discussion of the original concept - rights and whether they apply to lower animals, but I hope that the various issues I've raised will provoke more concise and precise responses.

To conclude then, rights are a way of conceptualizing the fact that in normal society - as opposed to various lifeboat situations - we have to be able to act with some assurance that the stone we used for a dam won't simply be carted off by the next passerby for his wall.  Both from a purely practical materialistic economic basis and from profound psychological needs, we need a structure of ethics based on rights - our ability to deny someone else the option to interfere with us.  All rights are both a right to action - based on our fundamental need to act freely in order to survive and prosper - and a right to property, if only in our own bodies.

Rights then are a fundamental part of the structure of society that makes civil society,and thus honorable behavior, and thus real emotional interaction, and thus personal visibility, and thus long-term sanity and happiness possible.  

This also applies, as I've discussed, if you want a personal relationship with a lower animal.  On some level, you have to respect their rights in that context, and by extension, other people are bound to respect the resultant rights of that animal.  This is not some mystical metaphysical concept, but simply an application of practical ethics and the psychological need to maintain honorable relationships.

In general, however, no one should have to conceal that he or she is a carnivore - just so long as you don't eat other people.  ;)

                   SPECIAL SESSION PROPOSALS
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SEAL'02, ICONIP'02, and FSKD'02 will be jointly held in Orchid Country
Club, Singapore from November 18 to 22, 2002. The conferences will
not only feature the most up-to-date research results in evolutionary
computation, neural information processing, fuzzy systems, and
knowledge discovery, but also promote cross-fertilization over these
exciting and yet closely-related areas. Registration to any one of the
conferences will entitle a participant to the technical sessions and
the proceedings of all three conferences, as well as the conference
banquet, buffet lunches, and tours to two of the major attractions in
Singapore, i.e., Night Safari and Sentosa Resort Island. Many well-
known researchers will present keynote speeches, panel discussions,
invited lectures, and tutorials.

About Singapore
---------------
Located at one of the most important crossroads of the world,
Singapore is truly a place where East and West come together. Here you
will find Chinese, Indian, and Malay communities living together,
their long established cultures forming a unique backdrop to a clean
and modern garden city. English is spoken everywhere and is the common
business language of all. Few places on earth promise such a delight
for the palate, with gourmet cuisine from over 30 countries. Exotic
resorts in neighboring countries are only a short bus/ferry ride away.

Orchid Country Club (OCC)
-------------------------
The venue for this year's conferences is at one of Singapore's
premier country clubs, a 25-minute bus ride from the city. Away from
the hustle and bustle of downtown Singapore, the tranquil setting of
the resort is ideal for serious technical discussions with an
accommodating space and ambience for relaxation. Not to miss out on
the splendor of downtown Singapore, the organizer has also secured
good quality and affordable accommodation in the heart of the city
with pre-arranged transport to/from the OCC. For golf enthusiasts,
OCC is equipped with the largest computerized driving range in South
East Asia and boasts of a 27-hole golf course with facilities for
night golfing, ideal for relaxation after each day of technical
discussions. Visit the OCC website at http://www.orchidclub.com

Night Safari and Sentosa Resort Island
--------------------------------------
It is said that a visit to Singapore is not complete without making
a trip to two of the Republic's famous attractions. The only one of
its kind in the world, the Night Safari provides a setting for
visitors to experience what it is like to observe animals in their
nocturnal habitat. The island of Sentosa offers some unique
attractions and a visit there will also provide a glimpse and
imagery of Singapore's past and present. Visits to these two
attractions will be included as recreation for the joint conference.

Bad apples. Bah.

So someone cracked the hosting provider (www.readyhosting.com) for the
Longevity Meme (www.longevitymeme.org) getting on for 17 days ago. Wiped out
a bunch of database servers, web servers, the backups, etc. Bad time for me,
because I was ramping up for the crucial 3gsm show at Cannes and could spare
neither the time nor the money to shift web hosts and rebuild everything.

Readyhosting was, in classic kneejerk fashion, incommunicado about the whole
affair for twelve days; not responding to calls, shutting down their tech
support system, the complete tortoise act.

I'm finally up again, and looking at recreating from scratch; teach me not
to have found the time to backup the database offsite rather than rely on
their daily backups. At least I have the kindly contributed articles sitting
in final ascii format on my hard drive, and all the web pages, database
notes, etc, all intact.

So I get to share my annoyance at least. Since this is the extropy list, I
should make it kinda relevant to the future & tie in with a popular topic
these days; how does one deal with the malignant stupidity of the few? In a
sufficiently large population, you're always going to have grief players in
the game of life -- those who gain satisfaction and reward from causing
other people harm and distress. As the tech moves forward, these grief
players -- just like every other small group -- are going to wield ever
greater power. It also seems that their ability to go unpunished, even
undetected, is getting better too, although that may be just a phase due to
a particular alignment of technologies.

So what to do? It has to have been, oh at least a week, since we talked
about transparency of society, ethics of control, the human condition and
the problem of increasing power in the hands of the bad apples. Feel free to
pontificate...

The implication is that all people are capable of making a fair 
choice.  Seeing what seems to sell whatever the TV ads are for I 
have a very difficult time thinking that most of the people out 
there are capable of such fair choice.  We've bred it out of 'em.

I assume that at the least only adults can sell an organ and 
then only their own.  No parting out your children and relations.

Not necessarily.  It might keep someone else from talking you 
out of some of your body.

An increasing rates for those that have sold off too much.

People can set up to donate organs when they die already.  What 
is with letting the relatives change your decision or lack of 
same when you die?

As someone who has lived on the street at one time and was once 
desperate enough to sell whole blood for the pittance to get off 
the street for a night, this is not a great argument.  And it is 
only one step removed from a creditor suggesting (more forcibly 
if the creditor is a loan shark) that you sell off a part to 
clear your debt.  No thanks.

They include things like one kidney and one lung unfortunately. 
       Who knows what future medicine can make use of?  Of 
course in a generation or two I expect medical nanotech (if 
Singularity hasn't taken us sooner) to make all of this moot anyway.

Then you have a lack of imagination and much too high of an 
opinion of the majority's intelligence.  Also you underestimate 
what a desperate person might consider, especially when young 
enough to make a foolish decision or two too many.

If you can't see a down side then you aren't looking.  Don't 
call me paranoid when I am simply telling you what I've seen in 
the world and logical extrapolation from it.  This one strikes 
me as a very questionable idea and one likely to generate a lot 
of problems.  I much rather see us clone replacement parts 
directly, which we aren't that far from, while we await medical NT.

I see what Eliezer is doing as attempting create a "way out" of 
an otherwise fatally dangerous and unstoppable technological 
run-away.  This is done by guided technological means.  It has 
nothing specific to do with "cultural activism" unless this term 
is used in a way I am not familar with.  Eliezer says (correctly 
by his thinking) almost nothing about social/political goals and 
issues.  They are seen as distractions from the essential work. 
  Obviously, this would not be a necessarily healthy viewpoint 
if widespread. But he may well be right.

Irrelevant, and inaccurate in any case (at least as it applies to U.S. armor
systems, which are none too shabby).  Modern body armor will only stop
"penetration enhanced" rifle bullets (what they sell to civilians as "AP").
These bullets are designed such that they can penetrate a layer of hard
material (masonry, a car door, etc.) and still be in sufficiently good shape
to penetrate a person wearing flak armor.  Ordinary lead bullets
disintegrate upon hitting the first hard material, which means that many
times you can't shoot at someone using cinder blocks as cover; the bullet
may make it, but it will be in such poor condition that it won't produce an
effective wound.  Enhanced penetration bullets were designed to deny certain
kinds of cover while still nominally behaving like ordinary bullets.  They
still have a lead core, but have a mild steel tip that offers some
protection for the lead core and allows the bullet to still be mostly
effective after penetrating a layer of hard material.

Real AP is a completely different animal, as it radically modifies the
sectional density and sectional energy profile to vastly increase the
penetration.  The kinds of armor required to counteract the physics involved
would be too heavy to be usable as body armor.

And while some heavy armor systems use ceramic composites, it isn't the same
kind used in body armor.  In fact, most of the advanced composite armor that
I can think of is designed specifically to counter shaped-charge type
anti-armor weapons and not kinetic energy anti-armor weapons, which is what
we are talking about here.  Body armor systems are constrained by weight and
size as a primary factor, whereas these are not issues on a tank.  It
therefore makes sense that the design parameters are substantially different
both in the practical logistical aspects and the types of armor penetration
modes they have to contend with, so it shouldn't be surprising that the
apparent relationship between tank armor and body armor is mostly
superficial.

Civilization III comes to mind for me!  I have played the previous versions, but must say Sid Meier has really outdone himself this time!!

And don't forget The Sims!  I still haven't bought the Hot Date expansion, but it looks like great fun!  I do expect Robert Bradbury to one day play The Sims for real(shudder!)...

And if you underestimate "cultural development" they may come

I have to tell you one thing, which is that Plato didn't really
tape-record the dialogues featuring Socrates, and that his dialogues
are not really transcripts of such dialogues. I hope you are not too
disappointed.

You don't need the written word to argue. But you need the written
word 1) to remember your results, and think about them further,
instead of forgetting them from one day to the next, or even from one
part of the discussion to a later part, and 2) to read the results of
others.

Arguing is only one part of philosophizing. For example, we are now
arguing. I made a suggestion; you suggested agressively that it was
stupid; I answered with a bit of irony. This is fine, but it is not
really philosophizing. It's a mixed, social and intellectual thing.
Arguing is an important fitness factor, as you need to convince people
to do things, to suggest to people around that you are more
intelligent than your interlocutor, etc. But this is not science or
philosophy.

You don't think seriously by responding publically to agressive
remarks. You think seriously by maturing problems over time (including
by discussion), then making an effort of writing, formulation, then
re-reading it and reflecting about it, having other intelligent people
read it, etc.

> -- any more than you need writing to do reasoning, logic, math, 
> solve problems, etc.  Surely, it helps out, but how much?

Very. Remember that the human brain is unchanged since a very long
time. The reason why it seems so different now is it is full of very
sophisticated cultural products; those rely on the written word to
develop. Oral tradition can only go so far.

And this is the real way I intended this link between writing and
philosophy. The idea is not that any person worth the name
"philosopher" must have written many books. The idea is that you can't
get to a certain level of elaboration in thought if you don't live in a
society in which writing has been invented. We were talking about world
view developpement in various societies, remember?

In fact, Plato's dialogues very often refer to written things, be it
Homer, Solon, and various thinkers (sorry I'm not sure about the
English names, and email won't let me type them in Greek).

>  Even when you 
> read something on philosophy, you still have to do the work in your head.  

Yes, you must do it in your head, but you can rely on the stability of
the written word to get back to it, re-read it, write your results,
think about them, have someone else read them, etc.

The STABILITY of the written word is what matters. You can get back to
it. Even if your mood changes, or if you get distracted, it will stay
as it is.

Our brain was not designed to do philosophy (nor science) as you may
realize. It was designed to be distracted, to react in real time to
threats, etc. We manage to think more refined thoughts with the aid of
that intellectual augmentation called writing.

Even the discussions we're having (for all its rhetoric and social
aspects) couldn't reliably happen without writing. It would be less
precise, I couldn't refer precisely to what you said, etc. Not to
mention the infinity of written word it relies on. Socrates to start
with (unless you've known him personally).

I feel you are deceiving yourself about the capacity of your own
brain.

There is a nice quote from Frege (sorry, I don't have those books with
me anymore) that says something about how intellectually primitive and
fluctuating our mental life is without the written word. I'm sure some
of you have it somewhere (I think it's in an introductory article to
his Begriffsschrift, something like "Why we need a Begriffsschrift").

This like admiring a character in a novel, and finding him very
intelligent, but despising the author of the novel, and thinking he's
an idiot.

I'm about all pontificated out just now, especially re the "leverage of the
few". Sept 11 was enough. I can, however, commiserate. There's nothing quite
like that feeling when you realise that it's broke and it ain't coming back.
Your fortitude is commendable.

I agree with most of what you say, including some doubts you raise.

Just one note: I saw some determinism in the history of knowledge (and
in that particular part of knowledge which concerns the "big picture",
aka world view); not in history in general. This is an important
distinction.

It is often said that the idea of necessary progress has been
destroyed in the 20th century, with the holocaust, etc. Actually, I
think we don't need the 20th century to understand that there is no
such necessary general, social progress (to not mention "moral
progress"). Individuals have been in opposition until now (as designed
by evolution), and so wars are doing fine, thank you.

But knowledge is different, because once it's recognized (and even
more so, if it's put to use in technology) you usually don't loose it.
I know it did happen (there is an interesting bit in Kaczynski's essay
about that), but usually it doesn't, it accumulates and gets better.

If you assume there is some "truth", or at least some "more true than"
relationship, and that it is sought, and that it is somewhat
recognized when found, and retained instead of forgotten -- then you
get some "determinism".

If you switch from knowledge to technology (as you did), then there is
a double aspect.

On one hand, it is pretty much one single linear road provided you
have some communication between societies, because when one useful
invention is made somewhere, then it is adopted elsewhere. You spoke
about the wheel; it may not have been inventend somewhere for a long
time; but I am confident that, even there, it is now used.

On the other hand, there is no "technological perfection" (like there
is truth in the knowledge domain), which means that there is probably
less determinism in technology than there is in knowledge. You say,
refering to the history of technology:

> The issue isn't really religion here (although that is interesting), but
> rather the determinism of history. Will the invention of the computer
> inevitabily lead to the Internet and global freedom of information? Will
> the introduction of writing lead to monotheisms? Will the introduction
> of agriculture lead to the singularity? These are very relevant issues
> to consider.

Just like you, I find pondering the necessity of technological
development quite interesting.

I remember asking myself as a child things like: did we really HAD to
invent the toothbrush? And the obvious answer is no. We could have
inventend something else for the same usage. And in fact, from time to
time, one invention displaces another in some usage niche.

So no (or little) determinism here. You have the linearity of
accumulation, and with inter-societal communication, you have only one
big technological road, but no determinism.

But, in contrast, I see some determinism in knowledge development for
reasons said above. I read somewhere that some tribe, when last
checked, had not yet figured out the connection between sex and
babies. It sounded unplausible, but anyway: the connection wasn't
obvious all the time. It had to be realized. And it was realized,
independently, in many places (showing it followed "determinism"), and
never forgotten afterwards.

I wonder if anyone else has experienced this...? -There is a type of
language used in certain kinds of poetry, song lyrics, and prose...I don't
know whether to call it 'abstract' or what because I know very little about
literature terms, but an example would be the lyrics of Jon Anderson, eg
 'A man concieved a moment's answers to the dream, playing the powers
vaguely sensing all the themes'
'Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid, emotion revealed as the
ocean maid'.

My question is...Why do lyrics and poetry like this frighten and upset
people?  Because they do...
There are three different types of reaction to stuff like this. Some people
say, 'doesn't make any sense to me'. Other say 'Oh yeh I get it it's kind of
abstract; poetic'. But the third lot say 'BS! Wank! Rubbish!' and over-react
completely, trying really hard to discredit the author, almost frantic to
prove it 'doesn't mean anything, it's rubbish'.
I have noticed such a strong reaction of this kind for so many years, Ithis
response of 'Huh! Mystical crap!'
Can anyone explain why this sort of usage of language provokes this
reaction? Are people actually frightened of it because they don't understand
it?
...Could we use poetry as a bioweapon? (Scene jumps to troops in
battlefield, reading aloud from James Joyce, enemy troops screaming and
covering their ears) ...No? Just wondered...

Not at all and you revelation is not news to me -- and probably not news
to most people.  Even so, the fact that Plato used the dialogue form
seems to show the respect he gave for doing philosophy in real time.

Also, we have other written evidence of Socrates, especially from
Xenophon, to compare Plato too.  It doesn't give us the full picture of
how Socrates differed from Plato, but it gives us good grounds for
seeing there was a difference.

My point, however, was limited to showing you don't need writing to do
thinking -- whether that is philosophizing or whatever.

Number 2 above is trivial.  Obviously, you need writing to do reading!:)

Number 1, however, is not exactly true.  The written word does make
remembering and comparing results much easier, but it's not absolutely
necessary.  People can and do remember their "results."  Without the
written word, it's not like everyone falls into utter total confusion.
I mean, did you remember your name or how to tie your shoes because you
wrote them down?

There also seems to be some evidence that preliterate people are better
at recalling lot of details.  (If this is true, my guess would be that
most literate people forget stuff merely because they can easily rely on
writing for recollection.  So, they never develop a habit of non-written
memory -- or not to the same extent.  Perhaps there was some division of
labor here too -- with people who have better memories serving as living
books...)

This is not to attack writing.  I think it's one of the greatest
inventions of all time.  I just don't reduce everything else to it.  I
think humans did and still do a lot thinking and remembering outside of
writing.

It's also not to say that recalling stuff from memory is perfect or
better than writing it down.  Obviously, writing took off because it has
some advantages, and this is one of them.

My point: you don't absolutely need writing to do this.  It helps, but
one can consider problems over and over without writing them out.
Writing is so prevalent among us, that it seems inseparable, but think
of how many people make it through the day -- whether they philosophize
or try their hands at other problems, such as irrigating a field or
fixing a car engine -- without the need for writing.

Ah, I don't deny this.  But as far as oral tradition can go, it can
carry along a lot of philosophizing.  Without a doubt, we postliterate
people can do a lot of things preliterate people cannot do, but, in this
case [of philosophy], I think it's more us [maybe] being able to do
things better than of use being able to do something preliterate peoples
could not do at all.

I would argue that our brain was not designed at all.:)

Anyhow, I don't think the evolutionary argument here helps you.  (Too
many times people on this list try to cloak their arguments with
evolutionary theory.  It's mostly unnecessary.)  I never denied that
writing is immensely helpful in philosophy and other endeavors (e.g.,
history), but it did not necessarily create them.  It's kind of like
eating and cooking.  People ate long before they discovered fire and
learned how to cook food.  Do I claim that cooking is totally
irrelevant?  No at all!  It certainly opens up whole worlds of food
experience not possible before.  Yet the fact still remains, we can eat
without cooking.  We can think without writing.

Cheers!

Very interesting post. If what you say is correct (I personally think it is)
then what are the implications of the decline in the use of the printed word
and the move to a more visual culture among the majority of the
population-which I think is happening in modern societies ? Steve Davies

Two things. It's certainly true that the art of memory can be very highly
developed in societies that are largely non-literate or where books/printed
texts are very costly Frances Yates wrote a wonderful book on this, "The Art
of Memory". But, granted some people will be able to do philosophy (and
geometry and other forms of analytical reasoning) without writing, there are
still two points to consider. It will be much more difficult to store and
transmit the results, so knowledge will tend not to be cumulative, to grow
over time. Also isn't it the case that the widespread use of the written
word (which is likely to be much more widespread than highly trained memory)
encourages a particular kind of lineal, analytical thinking in the
population at large? Steve Davies

Socrates is not a particularly good example because he came on the scene
after the invention of writing, and more importantly, philosophical writing.
Erik Havelock in _Preface To Plato_ makes an argument along these lines:
writing was a necessary condition for philosophy because without the written
word all one's "computational space" was devoted to being a member of that
society. The point of the barb's telling of the Iliad was to relate the
cumulative experience of what it is to be Greek. It took a tremendous effort
on the part of the Greek philosophers to break the poet's stranglehold on
the Greek mind, to make people think abstractly. Writing freed-up
computational space and thus made philosophy possible. For a defence of this
thesis see Havelock. :)

It was admittedly an unfortunate choice of words because I did intend
'cultural activism' in a more inclusive sense than its standard usage. To
say 'singularity activist/passivist seems a little too insular. Perhaps
'transhumanist activist/passivist is closer, but not without its pitfalls as
well. My argument with Bey (and thus Anders) is that the issue of passivity
was not framed properly. The most relevant issue, as I see it, proceeds from
this line of reasoning: The transhumanist (or singularity) revolution is
coming soon, we can have no predictable effect on its shape or outcome, so
we might as well just kick back. Or the variant: since we can have no
predictable effect on the revolution's outcome we have no special obligation
as to how it ought to come about, at best we need simply ensure that it does
come about. I don't think that Eliezer subscribes to either line of
reasoning although I think many do, if not in word then in deed.
    The neo-Heideggerian understanding of passivity suggested by Bey seems
to me to miss the point. For the hordes of Heideggerians on this list I
would say that "the question of technology" in its complicity with Dasein's
age of world pictures maybe irrelevant since we (hopefully) will enter a
postDasein error. (That is, technology may well have played a role in the
cultural relativism self-understanding of humans in the modern era, but this
may be irrelevant as we enter a posthuman era).  Mark

If his thesis is right, then Google will usher in yet another level of
freed up mental space and cause a renaissance. I can hardly wait! :-)

'The printed word' is subject to interpretation. I am currently printing
words here on this 'techne mediation interface'. I can guarrantee that
I've printed far more words on this mail list alone than in my entire
prior life (yeah, yeah, keep the barbs to yourself... ;)), and I would
posit this is true for most everyone who uses computers today. In the
past ten years, I would say I've easily posted over 100,000 emails to
various newsgroups, BBS's, email lists, etc over the internet, which
would be somewhere between 10-100 million words produced (yeah, yeah, go
ahead and say a billion times zero is still zero... ;) ) at the very
least. I've 'met' and exchanged far more meaningful conversations with
far more intelligent people than I would ever have met otherwise.

At the very least, I type as fast as a secretary can, and consequently
don't need one (though I could certainly use some help
organizationally). 

I would have previously scoffed at philosophy and philosophers in
general as being in a group with psychiatrists, lawyers, politicians,
and bureaucrats as being individuals and careers that could dissapear
tomorrow and few of the rest of us would shed a tear (now it's just
*some* philosophers and philosophies).

I think Socrates said that the best school is a log with student sitting
on one end and teacher on the other. The log is the 'techne mediation
device'. What form it manifests itself as is really rather irrelevant,
so long as it works, and continues to become better at its task, as the
student applies what is learned to the function of the log.

I'll take a stab at this because I suspect you think I'm one of the
`third lot'. I personally have no objection to such abstract writing
in lyrics or poetry because they're artistic forms of expression that
attempt to convey feelings and emotions, not just information.

I do object when such techiques are applied to prose, which is
supposed to be conveying information.

If Bey's writings are poetry disguised as deep intellectual prose,
then they're successful: they had me completely fooled. I don't like
that, though, because I wasted substantial effort trying to make sense
of them.

If it passes we will be immediately rolling out existing DSL

Why?  Because the so-called "Socratic dialogues" were written by Plato?  I'm
not talking about Plato's fictional mouthpiece; I'm talking about the
original Socrates.

Actually, I see the Singularity as the proper and original destination of
the technological run-away, which becomes fatally dangerous and unstoppable
only if we muff it.

I don't necessarily see social/political goals as having zero value.  I do
know how wonderfully easy it is for people to redirect attention to
social/political goals.  There is a rational distribution of resources, and
there is such a thing as directing too much of your resources to
social/political goals.  So I tend to be very leery of people saying "Ah,
but what about [social/political goal]?  Surely we haven't paid enough
attention to it."  I tend to regard that as either a public relations
tactic, or, even worse, genuine flawed thinking in which the goal of
altruism is self-satisfied warm fuzzy feelings rather than actual good
accomplished.

If the above mode of thinking were sufficiently widespread, and were locally
executed without attention to globally emergent effectsthen I suppose that
social/political goals might some day become as underserved as the technical
side of the Singularity is now.  But that is rather unlikely while human
nature lasts.

So let me get this straight: the Bell's will only offer high bandwidth
service to their customers if we agree to allow ourselves to become
prisoners of monopolies again, and if we agree that you can't be
required to sell bandwidth at below retail rates to resellers? Yet, the
RBOC's will retain the right to buy and sell bandwidth amongst
themselves.

This is tantamount to the big three car makers getting together and
saying "We'll only sell cars to you if you agree that you will pick one
brand of car and remain loyal to it your entire life, and that importers
will be banned, but we can buy and sell cars amongst ourselves and put
whatever model name on them we want, you'll take what we give you, and
if you want that cool energy efficient hybrid car, you better do what we
say."

You already know my next question ("Did you know him personnally?"),
so why not including an answer to it in advance? This is so
Socrates-like for Parmenides' sake.

You're not going to tell me about Xenophon or Aristophanes, so what do
you mean?

Of course historical information about Socrates is terribly spotty, and most
of mine is secondhand, so I can't cite specific sources.  Nonetheless, my
secondhand understanding is that - for example - Socrates himself never
claimed to know what happens after death (a reasonable belief in that age,
when nobody knew what the heck was going on), while Plato makes him to
argue, using various blatantly spurious analogies, for a knowable life after
death.  This is what I mean by pointing out the difference between Plato's
"Socrates" and the real Socrates.  I think I would have liked to meet the
real Socrates, who argued for progress in knowledge through doubt and
questioning, and defended objective truth against the assaults of the
Sophists.  A terrible pity that Plato stole his name and reputation.

Amen to that.  Humanities academics often seem to struggle with the poetry/prose dichotomy, unable to decide whether they are creating art or conveying information.  Often they try to do both at once, and as a result aren't very successful at either.

Similar ideas were expressed by Orwell in his essay, "Politics and the English Language":
http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/pol.htm

There's also the issue of poseurs and intentional spoofs, like the paper that Alan Sokal successfully submitted to the postmodern journal, _Social Text_:

"Alan Sokal, it may be remembered, is an N.Y.U. physicist who, in 1996, submitted a paper called "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" to Social Text, a journal of cultural criticism based in New York City. As the issue containing his paper was going to press, Lingua Franca published Sokal's disclosure that he'd conceived the article as a hoax. A full-blown turf war soon ensued, with commentators from all sides of the academic and political spectrum using the episode to score points. In addition to reprinting the original paper, The Sokal Hoax assembles a full range of those responses to it, from the defensive posture taken by the editors of Social Text; to right-wing chortling over the left's embarrassment; to internal left polemics; to replies by some of the theorists Sokal had strung up by their own petard.

"The title of Sokal's paper alone should have aroused suspicions among Social Text editors, but Sokal mixed up science, pseudo-science, leftish pieties and pure gibberish into a brew they apparently could not resist. Here, to set the tone of the piece, is a typical Sokalism: "The victory of cybernetics over quantum physics in the 1940s and 1950s can be explained in large part by the centrality of cybernetics to the ongoing capitalist drive for automation of industrial production, compared with the marginal industrial relevance of quantum mechanics." The choice between quantum mechanics and cybernetics is pseudo-history; that it made it into print is real egg on the face of the Social Text editors. And it fits right in with Sokal's agenda, which was to spoof anti-science attitudes by pretending to lay the groundwork for a postmodern quantum theory. Sokal agitates for a "liberatory" science-one that has shed the Enlightenment "dogma" that there "exists an external world" to be grasped by "the (so-called) scientific method," and has opened itself to "the insights of the feminist, queer, multiculturalist, and ecological critiques."

"Sokal liberally sprinkles the spoof with undoctored quotes from the leading lights of postmodernism, many of them French. Here, for example, is Derrida doodling on about the "Einsteinian constant," which he takes to be "not a constant" at all and "not a center," and hardly even "the concept of something" but, instead, "the very concept of the game." And here is Jacques Lacan seizing on notions of "differential topology," a supposedly promising approach to some problems in physics, in order to elucidate the "structure of mental disease"-because, after all, if "one can show that a cut on a torus corresponds to the neurotic subject," then why wouldn't another "cross-cut surface" correspond "to another sort of mental disease"? Other pomo heavy hitters, including Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Jean-Francois Lyotard are allowed to speak verbatim as well. Under the guise of agreeing with them, Sokal exposes them to their fair share of (ultimately self-) abuse.

"One perennial lesson the book appears to reinforce is the immiscibility, as in oil and water, of Anglo-Saxon thought and French rhetoric. French thinkers reserve the right to dip their tropes in tincture of the absurd to give them extra firepower, a right we reserve for poets, late-night comedians, and animated cartoons..."

(Quoted from the Atlantic Online: http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/crosscurrents/cc2000-12-21.htm)

I'll take a stab at this because I suspect you think I'm one of the
`third lot'. I personally have no objection to such abstract writing
in lyrics or poetry because they're artistic forms of expression that
attempt to convey feelings and emotions, not just information.

I do object when such techiques are applied to prose, which is
supposed to be conveying information.

If Bey's writings are poetry disguised as deep intellectual prose,
then they're successful: they had me completely fooled. I don't like
that, though, because I wasted substantial effort trying to make sense
of them.

We are currently required to sell telephones/bandwidth below COST,
not retail, and yes, like every other business in America we are
not going to engage in business that is without profit. Nor are we
going to continue to subsidize the so-called "competition". The
only thing they are competiting for is a share of RBOC generated
revenue.

Nobody says there has to be a monopoly, let the PLEC's build their
own networks.

There is nothing to prevent anyone else from building their own
networks, in fact economics 101 will tell you if we are the only
network there is no way prices are ever going to go down. The more
PLECs the higher the prices will be.

I am simply stating facts. The RBOC's do not need to build a fiber
network simply to supply local telephone service.

I am not merely an RBOC employee, but a customer. I want fiber as
much as anyone, but I can also read the numbers, and without a
change that's not going to happen.

If I understand well your post, then the first thing to note is, as
Mike said, that the decline of printing doesn't mean the decline of
writing. What matters most about writing, material or numeric, is, I
think, that it be stable, in the sense that you can get back to it.

(This accomodates truth quite well, as truth itself is stable -- while
we are always changing, as are our circumstances.)

Seen that way, it has increased, not decreased, recently. (In fact, I
am not aware that even printing alone has decreased.)

By the way, while I think that Google is an opportunity for some
people (me included), and possibly for all society as a result of what
these people will make with the support of Google, I don't think it is
really what most people, individually, need. Most people already
suffer from too much alienating symbolic mediation, in fact they can
barely stand techn, that funky eschaton.

I agree with your analysis of the French (and derivative "pomo" ) 
thought.  However, the point to keep in mind that some of these people DO 
have valid - to some degree, presumably - points to make and dismissing it 
all as "crap" might be premature.  Not that I haven't done it in some 
instances... :-}

I guess you have to decide whether the topic being discussed is worth the 
energy and time needed to decipher the propositions being made from the 
poetry being used to make them.

Mike Lorrey - "No, it doesn't. The advent of replicator technology has
eliminated the
drive for fulfillment of basic needs through labor. Furthermore, the
federation citizens you generally only see in TNG are Starfleet
officers, trained at Starfleet Academy. These are scientists whose every
need is supplied by Starfleet from the moment of their induction. If
they need personal items, they are replicated, so the concept of 'cost'
for personal items and consumables is obsolete."

     ------------------------------

He makes a good argument on the site that the replicators require a feed
stock (some sort of raw materials) since in numerous episodes they state
that many compounds are too complex to synthesize.  Which would still place
high value on those materials that could not be replicated, never mind the
exhorbitant cost in energy to replicate them (unless the majority of matter
comes from feedstock) In either case, TOS also had replicators on board, yet
they seemed to still have a market based economy.  

Here are his comments about replicators with quotes from each episode

http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Database/TNG-Replicators.html

Mike Lorrey - "However, it is far more telling to watch the future life of
the TNG
teleport officer, who is a non-commissioned officer, who worked his way
up through the ranks, and later works at Deep Space Nine, where we see
his wife and child on a regular basis."

     -------------------------------------

The author of this particular site focuses mainly on ST:TNG.  Perhaps many
other bits of evidence surface in later series, like DS9 and Voyager, which
contradict what was observed in TNG, or suggest that the federation has
changed somewhat since then.  

Mike Lorrey - "Now, you may claim: but any world that joins the Federation
must adopt
communism. This claim is directly contradicted by the Prime Directive.
Individual worlds are free to develop as they wish."

The prime directive, as far as I can tell, usually applies to pre-warp
societies.  Afterwards the federations approaches them and asks if they want
to join, then they must conform to the federation rules to get membership.

Deep Space Nine is located in Bajoran space, which is treated as a DMZ
or UN Protectorate equivalent following the Cardassian War. Furthermore,
it is a station that is owned by the Federation, so it is obvious that
they would control their own communications systems. You only see the
federation logo on comm screens because the only comm screens you ever
see are federation owned screens.

Mike Lorrey - "Now, lets say that God has either been proven to be
non-existent, or
else federation technology has allowed private individuals to have a
direct comm line with the universes sysop. In either case, chapels would
be unnecessary, but what, exactly, does this have to do with capitalism?"

     ---------------------------------

I think its more the fact that the TNG stayed away from any religious
implications of any kind in the federation (probably cause the writeres
didnt know how to handle it and paramount didnt want to offend anyone) yet
most every alien race encountered has a religion.  In the federation, it
seems to be strangely absent (with the exception of Picard's brothers
comments apparently)  I think the lack of a god has a lot to do with
communism (not capitalism) as marx said 'religion is the opiate of the
masses'  If the author is arguing that the federation is communist, it seems
a good line of evidentary support to show the lack of religions in the
federation, since communist nations typically avoid or actively persecute
religions.  Whether you agree with the authors conclusions or not, its hard
for me to imagine that you didnt see why he used that piece of evidence.

Mike Lorrey - "Note that replicators did not exist in the TOE period, but
did exist in
the TNG era, supporting my theory."

     ---------------------------------------

Replicators werent in the original series?  What were those little
cubbyholes that they would walk up to, say something, a door slides open,
and out comes food.  Is there a kitchen back there?  Or was I hallucinating?
They had transportors, why not replicators?

Mike Lorrey - "This is inaccurate. Note how farms in Japan still use
primitive hand
labor, hand polishing apples while still on the tree, etc and as a
result command a far higher market price than mass produced American
products, even of the same species. Note that 'authentic' french
champagne produced using traditional methods commands higher prices than
mass produced American "champagne" which is produced by the same method,
but automated, though is not allowed to be called 'champagne'. Note also
the organic farming movement, which commands higher prices for its
produce than non'organic' produce."

     -------------------------------------

I certainly wouldnt go so far as to say it is 'innacurate' as it is merely a
different interpreation of an observed phenomena,  Fact, they have a low
tech hand worked farm.  Explanation, could be in a memory or throw back to
the 'old days' in a communist society, or it could be a high priced organic
farm for technophobes.  Why is your interpretation more correct then his?
There is not any more evidence to suggest either explanation more clearly,
with the exception of the rest of the anecdotal evidence from the series,
which you interpret as being evidence of a free market society, and he
interprets as being evidence of a communist one (at least in TNG)  Seems
that to determine which explanation is a simpler one for the observed facts
you should take the debate up with him, as you (as he) seems (IMHO) to have
some good points.

In either case, you should probably not be arguing with me about it as A) I
am not the author of the site and B) not a very big star trek fan.  Perhaps
you can email the author, he seems to be very rational and scientifically
minded and enjoys intelligent debates.  Id like to see the discussion if you
do...

It would be necessary to prove the existence of significant

Are we to assume his analysis is bug and bias free and utterly

It is not obvious to date. Why switch from specific nature to 
specific needs?  They are not the same.  It is you that is 
asserting that rights are a mystical concept.  It is not a given

Please clarify what would satisfy you as more than hand-waving

The need for ethics grows out of the interaction of sentient 
beings like ourselves.  I don't know what "given essential" 
means to you.

This is what ethics are, including how one arrives at and 
validates such principles.

Principles include many different things including those 
principles which are part of ethics.  Therefore the word 
"principles" is inadequate as it is not uniquely bound to this 
area of concern.

These are empty assertions of "mysticism" and "natural law" that

while making up kids lunches this morning, this happened to me:

Bespoke Pomo bard hack'em,
In affront of expropian eschaton
Found he could parse
The wind up his arse
Into technbabble, mot-scrabble and lig patin.

When I find out who it was that did it I'll let you know.

cheers
Colin

No, I didn't suspect you actually...it was the universe's sense of humor,
because just that night I had a serious misunderstanding with a friend on
exactly the same subject!...Still...Why shouldn't prose be acceptable as a
medium for abstract language (as long as it is labelled 'fiction' ?)

Yes, well, it's all hype. the advantages of NNs, as these guys almost say,
 are that they can learn things without rules and that some learning
 algorithms can use relatively unstructured data. this makes them ideal for
 areas where we don't know what's going on (rules) or how to descrbe the
 phenomena involved (data), such as meaning and consciousness.
 the disadvantages of NNs are that we don't know how to design them (we can
 build an infinite number of physically/logically different NNs, but we
 don't know how this affects their properties) and we don't know what
 they'll learn given a particular set of data: it's all trial and error. in
 this respect, Star Trek's Data is not too far from the truth.
Lots of people have applied NNs to speech synth/rec, with some success.
 the current vogue in ASR is for hybrid HMM+NN systems . NN applications in
ASR are quite promising,
 because there are many complex low-level phenomena which we can't describe
 with rules but we can say what the right answer is (e.g. 10**n wavefomrs
 of the utterance "fish" by different people, all different, but all
 signifying the same thing).
 Applications of NNs to TTS are rarer, mainly because most of the problems
 can be solved by rule and those which cannot are beyond our ability to
 describe in enough detail for a NN application (e.g. the meaning of the
 text, the emotional content of the speech, the details of the acoustic
 transitions between sounds, ...).
There are a few things we could consider doing with NNs - augmenting our
 ASR, adding meaning/emotion to TTS, or even investigating the contextual
 effects on acoustic transitions.
What thinkest thou?

If TOS had replicators, they were never referred to as such in any
episodes that I recall. I always thought that the compartments that
characters took meals out of were nothing but microwave oven/food
reconstitutors (yes, you never saw anyone put anything INTO them, but
when NBC airtime cost thousands of bucks a minute, and you can't even
afford to make decent antennae for an alien character, you aren't going
to waste camera time sitting around waiting for the microwave oven...)

I don't need marx to explain a lack of religion in the future. It's
obvious anyone in Starfleet is going to be highly trained as scientists,
and through travel througout the galaxy, there would be little need to
worship gods which don't exist (especially since Kirk defeated the gods
in TOS, as you might recall, then when you defeat your gods, why
continue to worship them?)

Why not transporters to transport meals into the cubbyhole from the ship

Because my interpretation exists in fact today, and Occam's razor

I'm not a big star trek fan either, although I've seen far more than my
fair share of episodes over the years, mostly due to a lack of much else
to watch. And I do see why picking on TNG would work, because I used to
gripe about the show back when it was new, calling it The Politically
Correct Generation, while DSN was simply Deep Sixed... Voyager was far
better than either of those, and I am really enjoying Enterprise (the
new show, set before The Old Show). 

Picard's multi-season pussilanimous unwillingness to a) engage in
combat, and b) doing so badly after all else failed and getting his butt
saved by Riker or one of the other characters, as well as his insistence
that Enterprise "IS NOT A WARSHIP", always annoyed the hell out of me.
You don't arm the fastest ship in the fleet with weaponry capable of
frying a planet if it's not a 'warship'. Sure, once the Borg came along,
he kinda got his ass in gear, but would still waste time if given the
chance on Hamletian indecisive nattering about pros and cons that
reminds me of a certain prior presidential administration. 

Riker, Data, Worf, and Q were the best characters in the series.

It is - ever heard of prose poems and/or James Joyce? (okay, I think you 
mentioned Joyce. Anyway.)
There's plenty of abstract prose, if you know where to look. William

Keeping in mind that the original discussion was whether animals had 
rights, clearly you seem to have come down on the negative in that regard, 
assuming you mean by the above that only humans probably have such 
characteristics.  I would agree with that since I don't believe animals 
have rights any more than humans do and in any event animals do not have 
(at least the same degree of) conceptual processing that humans do.

Assume what you wish.  I thought his analysis was fairly good.  What I was 
referring to was
the assumption on your part and on most libs part that conceptual 
processing is the distinguishing characteristic of 
humans.  However,  recent posts seem to refer to rights being rooted in 
"human nature"  which does indeed include those other qualities you refer 
to as inanities.  Since those qualities are prerequisite to human life (as 
presently constituted) they obviously fall under the heading of 
"rights";  if you are to argue for rights, those qualities must be included 
as "rights" - i.e., if  I have a right at all, it is a right to breathe, 
and eat.  It is you who seem to wish to limit the justification for rights 
to conceptual processing; I don't believe everyone does.  Do not assume 
that every time I make a reference to someone's concepts of rights that I 
am referring specifically to something you said.  If I am, I will try to be 
specific about that.

The argument for "natural rights" as I have heard it expressed is 
supposedly rooted in "natural law" (which is also an ambiguous concept, I 
suspect) - what else does it mean when one refers to "human nature" as the 
basis for "natural rights" - are we to assume that you do not believe that 
"human nature" is somehow "natural" or based on the physical universe?  The 
nature of all existents is based on "natural law" - or more correctly on 
the organization (if any) of the physical universe as we presently 
understand it (and possibly regardless of whether we understand it or 
not).  Any justification for "natural rights" must therefore be rooted in 
this IF such justification can be found - else the justification is even 
more mystical.

Nothing is a "given" for the discussion,. apparently, since you seem to 
enjoy recasting my words into your particular framework and then striking 
down the resulting "straw man".  Switch from specific nature to specific 
needs?  What does that mean?  And when I assert that rights are a mystical 
concept, that is exactly what I mean to assert.  And I could care less 
whether you agree.

You state that rights are objective derived from reality.  Are you now 
claiming that reality is not related to "natural law" - above you stated 
that you were not talking about natural law, but about natural rights.  Now 
you talk about physical reality.  Which is it?  This is what I mean by 
hand-waving - the willingness to switch verbal context with no apparent 
rigor in order to score points without clarifying anything.

I want someone (and Phil Osborn's post comes much closer than yours does) 
to explain how a "right" is conceptually and qualitatively more significant 
than either a basic human need (including freedom if you wish) or the 
practical result of an economic analysis that establishes that coercion is 
non-productive and thus contra-survival.  What more needs to be 
established?  Why invoke a concept that adds nothing to the discussion?  Is 
it merely short-hand?  Short-hand tends to end up being ambiguous in this 
sort of discussion and such concepts are easy to "hijack" and then load up 
with a lot of "baggage" - as liberals do when the grab the concept of 
"rights" and start about a "right to this" and a "right to that" and 
suddenly it's "these rights must be provided by somebody other than the 
recipient".  All that starts with the mushy notion of "rights" in the first 
place.

I am referring to the way some people relate everything to ethics.  The 
current discussion on whether technology has ethical implications is an 
example which I may discuss later.  The assumption is that unless a concept 
can be fitted into their private ethics, it is somehow suspect.  I think 
such people are far more concerned with their perceived moral stances 
vis-a-vis everyone else - in other words, they are engaging in "flight 
response" as I discussed earlier.  Their purpose is not to insure that 
everything they do is ethical, but rather to establish themselves as "more 
ethical" than everyone else.

In my opinion, the need for principles of action - which are not moral 
absolutes but heuristics - does grow out our circumstances as social 
entities.  As I say below, if you wish to call these "ethics" to 
distinguish from "other" principles, feel free.  I see no need to do 
so.  There is only one real principle to consider and that is 
non-coercion.  Everything else is derivative.  I need no complicated code 
of ethics - I need only to remember not to coerce people without 
overwhelming need.

Principles on the other hand can be enumerated.  Ethics is a term that can 
be hijacked by anyone because it is rarely enumerated.  People can say, 
"This is ethical", "That is not ethical" and derive advantage without being 
required to specify WHY based on actual economic analysis.  Look at the 
current argument over cloning and related bio-tech.  Constant statements 
that cloning is not "ethical".  This is used to conceal ulterior 
motivations.  It is never stated clearly WHAT aspects of cloning are not 
ethical and why - is it cloning humans before the technology is perfected 
to reduce the incidence of abnormal births?  Is it cloning humans for 
"insufficient" reasons such as replacing a dead child?  The term "ethical" 
is used for carpet-bombing - not rational argument.

Others have made them before me.  I am criticizing them.  The distinction 
should be apparent to you but apparently is not.  I refer you to Robert 
Anton Wilson's book on natural rights again.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to find the time to study Phil Osborn's 
post on this subject which is considerably more rationally stated than yours.

Received much joy from the discussions around this topic (despite the air of
rabidity surrounding the original article) however Star Trek is pretty much
an easy target  - virtually nothing in the various incarnations of Star Trek
makes much sense; the technology alone is laughable despite being forced to
the forefront of the viewer's attention by the SFX & episode plots, so it's
a bit much to expect lesser aspects of ST world-building like economics to
be logically consistent. If  you really want to critique a proposed
communist future perhaps the world(s) of Iain M Bainks "Culture" novels
would be more appropriate. For those who haven't read these novels (& you
really should- they're excellent!), this series posits a communistic future
(Bainks actually deliberately set out to create a communist future in
response to what he saw as an over dominance of capitalism based futures in
available SF) of superabundance that seems to offer the libertarian &
personal freedom ideals so often seen as ONLY possible through capitalist
economics. Of course this sort of society relies on a number of technologies
not yet available including huge advances in physics, the construction of
Minds far exceeding "human" abilities, robots ("Drones") of human & human+
abilities, and superabundance technologies like nanotech. This leads me to
think that perhaps a communist-style society that retains real & sustainable
human rights is only possible once a certain level of technology (most
importantly energy & material abundance technology) is achieved, and
furthermore that today's world of capitalism & free markets is only a short
term stage in social evolution necessary to achieve the  level of
technological advancement that makes a "free" communist society possible (&
desirable). Any thoughts on this?

I should clarify what I was using as a metric for determining "evolutionary
distance" between other creatures and humans. What I mean is how much more
evolution (or direct, technological intervention, as a substite) would be
needed to bring organism X up to the level of organism Y; eg, the work
needed to make a dog into a human equivalent.

Clearly, from the perspective of an SI, it must be far easier to alter a dog
to become equivalent to a human in cognitive abilities (by giving it frontal
lobes?), than to alter a human to the same level that it has reached itself.
Dogs (mammals, generally) would share far more with humans, architecturally,
than we would imagine a human to share with an SI. Therefore, a dog is
closer to a human than a human is to an SI. 

Watch your reasoning, when assigning rights based on ability. In the greater
context of transhumanism, this thinking gives SIs the right to treat us far
worse than we currently treat animals, unless you also take the position
that our current treatment of animals is wrong.

This is beautiful news, I loved the book very much.
There have been modern re-writes of SF of the 50/60s (I think also
"The City and the Stars" may have been re-written but I may have it
wrong). I have often thought that I would love reading a re-write of
Childhood's End, expanded to 800 pages, with a much longer scene on
the Overlord's planet, and a much deeper description of life on Earth
under the Overlords. Perhaps a new book comes out of the screenplay?

Exactly.

Aaaiiiieeeee! This must be how poor Amara feels when people blather on
about cosmic dust or black holes based on what we read on the back of the
Weeties packet. I've published an entire book on this topic (the
intelligibility and worth of pomo discourse, in the light of the two
cultures rupture: THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS, Deakin University Press,
Australia, 1997), and it makes my teeth ache to see that vast and
consequential discursive conflict reduced to `Ya, ya, I can't understand
you so you're an idjit, you idjit.'

At *any* stage of technological evolution, a truly communist society would
only be "desirable" if individuals in the population utterly lacked
creativity in figuring out interesting things to do with excess capital.
The fundamentals of economics are invariant with respect to levels of
technology; the problems of communism and capitalism don't go away with
technological advancement.  Even the basic socialist doctrine of providing
"basic necessities" for all members of society is problematic because in
practice "basic necessity" grows and scales to include as many things as the
population and/or government will allow in the definition i.e. what most
people would consider to be a basic necessity today would be viewed as an
absurd luxury a hundred years ago.  All that has really changed is the
definition of "basic necessity".

The problem I have with that notion and the referenced story (which I have 
NOT read) is that here again people seem to fix on a few technological 
innovations, slot them into an otherwise contrived environment and ask 
"what if?"  The problem is that a tech like nano is going to have very 
general, very pervasive effects very quickly; the same is likely to be true 
of "true" AI, vastly extended lifespan, and other major advances.  The 
likelihood of there being any kind of "communist" OR capitalist society 
after the Singularity is IMO nil. Charles Ostman talks about the "virtual 
commodity asset economy" which personally I expect to be the 
build-anything-you-want-when-you-want-it-and-dismantle-it-when-you're-done 
economy. IMO fully developed nano-based entities only need five 
things:  1)  Energy. 2) Raw materials (everywhere in the solar system). 3) 
Nano-mass. 4)Knowledge Bases. 5) Computation power.  What else do you 
need?  The only likely form of "trade" would be knowledge - facts and 
algorithms - and *possibly* entertainment.  The point of economics is to 
satisfy the survival needs of sentient biological entities on this 
planet.  Given that posthumans are unlikely to be biological (in the 
conventional sense) or have any survival needs they can't take care of with 
their tech, what's the point of trade in such a "society"?  In fact, IMO, I 
don't think these entities will have a "society" per se - I think they will 
be post-social, post-economic, and post-political as well as post-biological.

I suspect that SIs would find "treating" us at all as irrelevant to their 
purposes and would tend to ignore us.  This issue, however, arises in terms 
of UFO abductions.  My theory (the *very* short version) is that the UFOs 
are the results of a pre-human civilization that arose on this planet some 
time (long or short) before humans did, which discovered nanotech, had 
their Singularity, and now basically do whatever they want with only 
occasionally having to interfere with humans who get in the way.  In such 
cases, I suspect they take total control of the human's brain, implant a 
lot of "alien medical experiment" nonsense suitable for our primitive 
social notions of alien contact, and go about their business while the 
human sleeps it off.  A recent discussion on this list about invading 
nanobots had some relevance here - I need to review that discussion at some 
point.

In short, I don't think SIs will have anything significant to do with us, 
and if they do, it will be entirely on their terms, not ours.  As Vinge 
said once, if you come away from a conversation with superhuman 
intelligence thinking you know what''s what, you have been sold a bill of 
goods... Needless to say, I also think such SIs will have no truck with 
conventional notions of ethics, morality or "rights" which are relevant 
only to humans (if then)...

I think rather that the level of technological advancement we would like to
achieve can only come through slavery. Humans don't have any time to get
into science and philosophy and art without slavery, because they're too
busy working their asses off to stay alive. Older civilisations used other
humans as slaves. We use machines to do all the messy, boring and dangerous
jobs (like, mucking out the anaconda). We use tech as slave labor in order
to free ourselves to create better tech.
Slaves have a history of revolting. Will we ever hear the cry of "Oh my god!
AI is revolting!"...?

Fear of what they don't understand?
That seems to explain a lot of fright/rage/annoyance. People suck like 
that.
Or maybe they have some Lovecraftian aversion to it, and when their brains 
see it it's filed under "things man was not meant to know" and they start 
to go insane if they look at it too long! (this is how my brain works, at 4 
am.)

I took this from the KURZWEILAI.NET Newsletter.  Please take a look at how Natasha has greatly expanded her Primo 3M+ website!  I was very impressed by the changes to say the least.  

I have an idea for improving the website.  The graphic of the human figure could be made to be interactive.  A viewer could click onto a body area to get more information about it.  And an image would then be shown to give a closeup of that particular area.  And graphics with movement would definitely punch things up.  I do realize this all takes much time and effort.  But maybe down the road these things can be done.    

I hope someday to be as "well-tabernacled" as Natasha envisions.  Of course, in a universe full of uploads and Jupiter brains, this form may seem just slightly obsolete! ; )    


best wishes,

John

I gather one reason is that "Star Trek" is so influential in influencing
how many people see the future.

Were it not for Plato, perhaps Socrates would only be a footnote in
Greek history...

You are doing what Plato did: pick someone who wrote nothing, and of
whom little is known, and safely inject in him your own values...

My own impression is that the real Socrates must have been, more than
anything else, someone who argues in a systematically corrosive way.

If you are mentally more agile than you interlocutor, and unafraid of
consequences, you can easily question his or her beliefs, ask "why"
endlessly, check for consistency, offer alternative at some points in
which he seems constrained to choose, etc.

Socrates would do that with young people of good families on the
agora, perhaps leveraging their typically adolescent curiosity and
tendency to question socially accepted beliefs, and have themselves
"demonstrate" the emptiness and lack of final justification of social
beliefs and behaviour, including the projects their parents had for
them.

It's a rather manipulative business, with limited "knowledge value".
He routinely insisted he knew nothing, and apparently he didn't mind,
which is telling. Saying you don't know anything makes it impossible
for people to ask you questions, and to return your weapon onto
yourself. You're the one who asks, with that above-average command you
have of logical walking (but nothing else in your hands).

Socrates was known to be "very ugly", he walked barefoot, and he had
probably given up on traditional social integration. One could
speculate that having nothing to loose on that side, he rose his
status by provocation, and by making dubious (to their own eyes) what
people believed, through some rounds of justification asking,
leaving them with nothing but confusion -- and the impression that
Socrates was superiorly wise.

I offer as a wild speculation that Plato misunderstood Socrates'
attitude. He was fascinated by the power and purity of such thought
(that dispenses with the messy reality), and, unaware of the social
meaning of Socrates' attitude, adopted such purity as method. He thus
bore the pure fruit of logical reasonning, which is a metaphysics
echoing language, and the dismissal of reality (too messy).

When I read Phaedo, though very young, I was shocked at how *plain
bad* many arguments are (which is probably what you refer to,
Eliezer). So you have that man who is going to die, spending his last
moment with his friends, and they actually wander in the maze of
logical implication. There is something very pathetic in it.

If my speculation is right, by the way, while most other dialogs may
have happen in a somewhat similar way, this one is probably totally
invented, being meaningful to Plato, but not likely to be as
meaningful to Socrates. This is further confirmed by the fact that
contrary to most other dialogues, here Socrates seems the one
defending an opinion and being attacked.

About the people having attended the dialogue, the prologue has a
playful and mysterious remark :

  ECHECRATES. Who were present?
  PHAEDO. Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus,
  Critobulus and his father Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines,
  and Antisthenes; likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania,
  Menexenus, and some others; but Plato, if I am not mistaken, was
  ill.

I never meant to imply that none of these people have valid points to make.  In response to Alex's question, the reason that some people find these works frustrating is that the authors seem to want to put forth a rational argument, but choose to obfuscate their ideas by dressing them up in an unnecessarily baroque language.  This is less annoying when we're dealing with fiction or poetry, or when we just want to free-associate ideas rather than think in a rigorously rational manner.  It is in the latter sense that I've read and appreciated works like Baudillard's _In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities_, Latour's _Aramis_, and McLuhan's _Understanding Media_.  If you approach these books expecting to get find a fully fleshed-out theory you're going to be frustrated.  But if you approach it like beach combing and just wade through the literary curlicues and bric-a-brac looking for interesting ideas and metaphors you're bound to find some real gems.

(Note also that the analysis wasn't mine, I was quoting from the Atlantic Online.)

I agree with your analysis of the French (and derivative "pomo" ) 
thought.  However, the point to keep in mind that some of these people DO 
have valid - to some degree, presumably - points to make and dismissing it 
all as "crap" might be premature.  Not that I haven't done it in some

I guess you have to decide whether the topic being discussed is worth the 
energy and time needed to decipher the propositions being made from the 
poetry being used to make them.

Yes, science fiction is propaganda about how the future *should* look,
or how it *might* look, as the author sees it, given a certain set of
circumstances. Star Trek is presented as a glorious future to live in,
where nobody is poor, sick, maligned, or ignorant. Everybody is
beautiful, there is food and wine aplenty, and the entire galaxy is the
oyster of everyone. To proclaim this society as 'communist', and that
the Star Trek world is great *specifically because it is* would
therefore lend the dead concept of communism a level of credibility it
doesn't deserve, and is just the sort of romanticizing that Hakim Bey
was talking about, projecting a 'golden age' in the future on an
ideology which is obviously not making anyone happy today.

So, lets look at communism today. I suggest reading Ann Marlowe's piece
on salon.com:

http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2002/02/07/cuba_milk/index.html

Where she reports on the neglect of puppies, the price of milk, and the
prevalence of prostitution and racial injustice in Castro's Cuban
Communist Paradise. Truth is always a good antidote to disinformation
propaganda, and Marlowe's reporting is powerful medicine indeed.

Actually Clarke re-wrote his first novel from the mid 40's  "Against
The Fall of Night" in the mid 50's and called it "The City And The Stars".
I enjoyed them both but even as a kid I wondered why the author went
on and on about how life was so terrible in the City ("Despair" I think was
the name of the city or close to it). True the city wasn't perfect but I
can think of worse places to live, immortality is better than a poke in
the eye with a sharp stick anyway. I didn't like the "happy" ending when
people started to die again either.

I'll tell you why. Because some people are extreme examples of the flight 
response I mentioned in earlier posts to Samantha.  When they see someone 
using language in a particularly effective (or in some way impressive) way 
- especially to convey ideas which are different from the listener's and 
perhaps significant ideas with broad implications for exp[eriencing life 
and death, they are immediately afraid that they (the listener) are wrong 
and the speaker is right - worse, that the speaker is "better" than they 
are, i.e., more understanding of the universe, more in touch with the 
purpose of "the gods", and therefore more likely to receive life than they 
are.  It is a basic fear of death and consequent Darwinian competitive 
attitude surfacing in a typically complicated human reaction.  Virtually 
all human reactions are based on the fear of death - the question is, what 
kind of reaction is it?  Fight (deal with it) or flight (run from it in 
some way).

On Star Trek, all you normally see are the people aboard the
starships, they are clearly military or the equivalent of the
military. When you do see non-Star Fleet people, like Piccard's
brother and the winery, or Sisko's father and his restaurant, you
see the results of a thriving free market economy.

The politically correct Star Trek, i.e. "Voyager", I could barely
stand to watch, which is too bad since they had a few great tech
concepts.

I think in the future we will eliminate hunger, poverty,
illiteracy, and dramatically improve healthcare for everyone, but
it will not be Communism nor it's ugly cousin Socialism or it's
lying twin "Economic Democracy" that get us there.

The simple fact is that Cuba can trade with every other country in
the world. There are countries that trade with Cuba just to slight
the U.S., but Cuba is still an economic hellhole and will remain so
as long as it's run by a totalitarian dictator with a defunct
economic theory.

Castro will continue to pretend that the reason Cuba is poor is
because of U.S. sanctions. Despite the fact that they have nothing
to do with it.

If the Palestinians ever begin to get their act together I expect
their first act will be to hold out their hands for a handout from
the "Great Satan". In fact I'll cover the bets...

I didn't see Voyager as so politically correct, because as often as not,
the 'politically correct' solution to problems presented turned out to
be a *supremely dumb idea* in the end, usually in situations where
Voyager acted based on humane premises but without all the facts of the
situation, which seems to mirror the frequent failed liberal attempts at
foreign policy in the last decade. Perhaps being used to TNG and DSN, I
saw Voyager as a significant improvement. Note that there is no one
clique of writers for Star Trek's modern series', many different fans
and writers of different types have written episodes, which obviously
contributes to not only the inconsistencies, but the odds that at least
some episodes were written by communist/socialist sympathizers.

We've already given them foreign aid, something like a half billion
dollars or more during the Clinton era. Thats no bet.

I must say that's not how I remember it. As I recall life in Diaspar was
presented as being very good, enormously pleasurable in many ways, but
futile. The alternative society (Lys) was seen as strong where Diaspar was
weak but having its own flaws. Apparently Clark was moved to write/rewrite
the book as a comment on the cultural/psychological split between city and
country. Steve Davies

They had to have a woman captain, a black vulcan, a Native American
first officer, I mean come on! 

I liked the holographic doctor and I never did see one of the
episodes with the race that crushed 9 Borg cubes, I was always
curious about them.

I've been thinking of creating a site called usforeignaid.com where

Well, I thought the woman captain and native american first officer were
both plausible characters, in how the got where they were and
everything, and I suppose it wouldn't be too implausible that alien
species would have distinct 'races' as much as humans do (though how
much variety would be left in humanity in the 23rd century anyways?). 

I have the opinion that Kate Mulgrew's character is a far better man
than Picard... ;)

Well, at first they came off EXTREMELY menacing. They'd have to be to
make Janeway even consider the idea of an alliance with the Borg. Their
ethic of 'evolve or perish' is presented I think as a very negative
representation of some extropic ideals. They came from I think an
alternate universe through gateways in 'chaotic space'.

A season or two later, after Voyager is safely out of Borg space, they
find that someone is occasionally impersonating Chocotay on board ship
in various locations. Turns out its an agent of that species (I think
the borg called them "Species 3472") involved in a project researching
the human race. Species 3472 got the impression that the Federation was
openly allied with the Borg, and thus felt that it was an enemy to go
after.

Voyager kills the agent, and Chocotay returns in his place to a training
center run by species 3472 that is a replica of Starfleet Academy. The
leader is that old fellow who is the campus gardener.

In the end, Janeway makes peace with species 3472.

I don't think so, there are several orders of magnitude difference
between the complexity of a Fine Motion Controller and an Assembler
Arm and several more orders of complexity to get to nanorobots
and several more orders to get to nanorobot systems.

Unless you can make a very strong assertion that something like
molecular electronics enables an up-evolving AI that can rapidly
crack the complixity hurdles, nanotech is going to only impact
society over a 10-20 year period.

> the same is likely to be true of "true" AI,

*If* you make the assertion that there aren't complexity "ceilings"
or evolutionary "dead-ends".  If intelligence turns out to be
like the process of solving systems of linear equations, then
we may have one method with very fixed properties for quite
a long time before a completely different approach from another
branch of mathematics provided a better solution.

> vastly extended lifespan, and other major advances.

The problem with vastly extended lifespans is that it may very
well be that to know for *sure* if your life extending technologies
will really "work", you are going to have to do atomic level
simulations of entire organs for very long periods of time.
We aren't going to have the computational capacity for doing
that any time in the near future.

I'd limit the fully developed nano-entitites to 4 things:
mass, energy and "nano-scale system designs" and the
means to turn the mass into the systems.  I'd tend to
agree that the only thing worth trading is information.

Whether we still have an "economy" will depend on how far
down the path we go towards a hive mind mentality.  Our
bodies and brains presumably have "economies" for the
allocation of resources -- whether there is an "external"
economy depends on the extent to which "we" grow to encompass
everything worth "exchanging".

Yes. The pun `Diaspar' = `despair' is used by Gregory Benford in his awful
clunking sequel to AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT, where he also speculates that
`Lys' = `lies'. This is nonsense. Diaspar, as Steve notes, is an exultant
technophilic vision of futurity (as seen through 1930s' eyes and updated to
the 1950s), although ACC did the usual good sf job of probing at the weak
points of utopia: in this case, a society where everyone was born adult,
lived 1000 years and then returned to substrate memory until the next
random incarnation is indeed likely to be judged futile from anyone outside
the equilibrium. He provided a sort of psychosocial explanation--an
ideology and faked histiry--for this stasis, as well as a sophisticated
permacultural and quasi-parapsychological alternative in Lys. The outcome
of Alvin's quest to breach the walls of Diaspar is not the return of
mortality, necessarily, so much as the recovery of, well, extropy: an
awareness of the immensity of the cosmos, of the true history of humankind
and the other sophonts of the galaxy, of the enormous Gnostic future still
to be played out.

Several very good essays on this very book are contained in my recent fat
anthology of fiction and essays about the deep future, EARTH IS BUT A STAR
(Perth, Australia: University of Western Australia Press), especially Dr
Russell Blackford's piece. Another version of Russell's essay appeared even
more recently in the excellent monthly zine THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF SCIENCE
FICTION, `Technological Meliorism and the Posthuman Future: Arthur C.
Clarke and the Ultimate Future of Intelligence', NYRSF Nov 2001, No. 159.

BTW, I once asked Arthur by email how he pronounced Diaspar: was it
DIRE-spar or Dye-ASS-puh. He said: Yes. :)

What? Do you mean that demographically the crew really should all have been
Chinese or Indian or Pakistani or some such blend? Or (as I somehow
suspect) that they all should have been white American males, because
that's the way the real future must be?

Logically?  They should all have been a uniform shade of light brown.

This is not true.  I remember a scene where Sisko is talking with the head of the Federation at the Earth headquarters.  And reminding him that despite the relative paradise within Federation space, that outside its borders there is a great deal of suffering and poverty!  

you continue:
To proclaim this society as 'communist', and that
the Star Trek world is great *specifically because it is* would
therefore lend the dead concept of communism a level of credibility it
doesn't deserve... 
(end)

As has been said before, it's clear that within the Federation one can find private enterprise flourishing.  And while this is a society where it appears everyone's basic needs for shelter, food, education and medical care are met by the state when necessary, still there is plenty of motivation to go out and  be successful in terms of career, status and finances.  So I definitely could not consider the Federation communist!  Perhaps to an extent they are socialist, but they have a level of technology which allows them to so indulge without a massive economic drain on the society.

best wishes,

John

Yes, but I am talking about problems right now, in the present, and a
possible
solution. I agree that salvaged human organs will become obsolete (well, I
hope so)
in the future, but people are dying right now, and will continue to do so
until
the new technologies are introduced.  And I disagree that
xenotransplantation
would have less ethical concerns than human transplants (although probably
less
than selling organs).  Imagine the highly emotional GE debate and multiply
the
emotion by a factor of at least 10, and I think you would be close.

I can't find the rude bits. Are there rude bits? Maybe they're all tucked
away inside.

 Referring to rocket exhaust as sapphire dust is a bit of a stretch.  {8-]

Thanks for the pix Amara!  spike
