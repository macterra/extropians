This is part of a chapter of a new book on nanotech.

Open Air Space Habitats

    A home in space need not be the enclosed volume usually described in most movies, 
books and articles. If a strong enough material is used, a rotating cylinder can be so large 
that it holds an entire atmosphere against its inner surface. The only example this author 
knows of is Larry Niven's "Ringworld", a ring the diameter of Earth's orbit, circling a sun, 
and wide enough to contain oceans and continents. It, unfortunately, had to be built of 
"Unobtainium" to perform this mighty feat.
     We now have a material close at hand that can do something like this, albeit on a much 
smaller scale. The smaller the diameter of the rotating ring or cylinder, the less demands 
are put on its main structural material. Instead of encircling a star, we can now contem-
plate building artificial worlds with land areas comparable to Earth that are open to 
space- a feature we've grown accustomed to on this world.
     This fabulous new material is the long sought Carbon-Carbon chain molecule. Its 
existence was posited several decades ago, but no one knew how to make it. The answer 
turned out to be one of those delicious tales of scientific discovery, like Goodyear stumbling
 on vulcanization. We've come to know of a "third form" of pure Carbon, not 
diamond nor graphite. This "new"-to us- stuff is called Buckminsterfullerene, or 
Buckyballs and Buckytubes. Now that we know what to look for, this stuff has turned up 
in four billion year old meteorites, interstellar gas clouds, and right here on Earth: in 
ordinary candle soot, where it was discovered occuring naturally.
    With the clarity of hindsight, it is obvious that a "sheet" of ordinary graphite could be 
rolled up and joined to form tube- I'll wager someone thought of it many years ago. What 
is amazing about this is that it happens all the time, naturally. Now comes the hard part- 
make the tube really, really long, and do it at thousand ton per second rates. The "really 
long" part is being avidly pursued, and we might see meter-long samples this year (1997). 
This in turn may well spawn an industry that replaces "Carbon Fiber" (also mis-named 
"Graphite Fiber") with the real thing. The first products will probably be military, aero and 
spacecraft parts, as was the case with Carbon Fiber. Then come the bicycle frames, tennis 
rackets, golf  clubs and such. These products will weigh perhaps half of an equivalent 
Carbon Fiber part. More importantly, they establish "Buckyfiber" (which should have been 
called "Graphite Fiber") as a viable, nanotech industry.
    To make this material in the quantities we really want, some parts of the production 
have to be done by self-replicated tools, or 'Special Assemblers". The nice thing about 
"Graphenes" (Buckytubes) is they self-assemble to a large extent (cf.  "candle flame"). 
Therefore, the Special Assembler does not need to do direct, positional-control chemistry 
on the forming tube, it only needs to mediate, or catalyze, the process, and move the 
finished end of the tube along and out of the way, where more conventional machinery can  
take over. Since this is essentially a one-dimensional product (like wire or yarn), the 
Special Assemblers can be arranged in a plane, with the Buckyfibers emanating 
perpendicular to that plane.
     Given the above capabilities, we can now speak of creating new worlds. In this 
example, we'll make a 1000 kilometer diameter world, just for fun. A space-based 
industrial capacity, having the tremendous resources of just the inner Solar System at its 
disposal, along with some nanotech self-replication capabilities, can do this kind of thing.
    Beginning with the alluded to giant spools of Buckyfiber, a cylindrical structure can be 
"filament-wound" in deep space. To do this, one need a rotating mandrel, or round mold, 
to wind the fiber onto. This can be made in several different ways. One is to start with a 
long, thin, superconducting wire, formed into a loop, and charge it with an electric 
current. It then naturally springs out to form a near-perfect circle. Using several of these 
connected together in a row, and reinforced with Buckyfiber-cloth, makes a short cylinder, 
say 100 meters long by 1000 km diameter. This now can be brought up to some rotational 
speed in several ways. One efficient way is to build two worlds at the same time, spinning 
in opposite directions, and use a motor between them.
    The gathered ends of Buckyfibers are led off of the spools (which are also spinning) and 
brought to rendezvous with the outer surface of the spinning hoop. The shell is wound to 
a thickness of perhaps a few centimeters. Depending on the masses (moments of inertia), 
allowable fiber tensions, rotational speeds of the hoop and spools and so on, the hoop can 
be made to slow down as the fiber runs out. Now the supercurrent is quenched, allowing 
the mandrel to go somewhat slack (it still has some centrifugal force pushing it against the 
new Buckyfiber cylinder). The mandrel is released from the inner surface of the new 
cylinder wall, and moved along another 100 meters or so, like a concrete slip-form. 
Another gang of Buckyfiber spools is brought  in and the process repeated. After doing 
this a few hundred times, we are left with a big, thin, slowly spinning clyinder, say 500 km 
long and 1000 km diameter, having almost two million square kilometers of new land. 
This now can be used as the mandrel for the rest of the construction.
   Leaving this cylinder spinning slowly, we bring in fleets of these Buckytube spools. The 
fiber should be wound at a slight angle, maybe 10 degrees, which means we need a shuttle, 
like on a loom. This might have to be rocket propelled, like a Shuttle. Another way is to 
build a 500 kilometer beam with the shuttles on it that sits in space next to the cylinder. 
The shell needs to be about three meters thick for structural reasons, and another three 
meters of slag should be sprayed on the outside, for radiation protection. The atmosphere-
to-be will provide the same radiation protection topsides that Earth's air does.
   After winding the main bulk of this world, we have to consider what to do about the 
ends. As this is an "open-air" design, the ends only have to come up from the cylinder wall 
about 150 kilometers, and can be very thin near the top, as will be the enclosed 
atmosphere. These end walls can be made by wrapping the fiber over the edge of the 
cylinder, letting it run in a straight line for a ways across the open end, then wrapping back 

up onto the cylinder. Using a thin plastic membrane across the end, with a small amount of 
air inside for pressurization, can help make the end rounded, as they ideally should be.
After the main shell is built, the rest of the atmosphere can be brought in, the nitrogen and 
oxygen distilled from asteroids and cometary nuclei. Oceans are easy; there is lots of 
accessible water ice strewn about in asteroids and small moons, out past Earth's orbit. 
Mountains ranges might be added to the ends, where the walls rise to hold the 
atmosphere.
   The interior volume of this world can be left open to space, meaning each point on the 
interior living surface has about 150 Km of atmosphere above it, and then 700 Km of 
nothing. Looking upward, at an angle, one can still see the stars.
   That was a lot of work, but what is a World worth?

Sorry for being a little late with this (just been catching up on the
cloning threads), but i don't think this was mentioned already, (unless it
shifted to another thread) 

Wouldn't it be possible (theoretically) and maybe ethically more acceptable
to: 

A) Make sure a clone doesn't develop a brain BEFORE fertilization, by
taking out certain genes ?

B) Grow just an arm or body part from specialized tissue cells ?

Ofcourse growing a clone without a brain, cutting off his leg and then
leaving it? alive for future spare parts would also seem very unethical.
Even brainless clones should have some rights (animal rights?)

Does anyone here know HR Gigers 'Bodenhaltung' (the sketch) ? Its a
nightmarish vision of degraded human working conditions in order to
generate 'bio-power'. Genetical modification should be used to improve, not
to degrade.

and about using animals for donor organs:

Shouldn't i be the one left to decide what i do with my genes to my animals
? (as long as i don't cause that animal to suffer) In the Netherlands a
court ruled a bull had to be 'terminated' last year, because it was given a
human gene (which would increase milk production i believe). In the end
they just sterilized it and let it live. 

It would surely be good for agriculture to allow modification, and maybe
then those subsidies would finally end, opening the doors for a free world
market ?

Having missed out on contribution to the "Anarcho-Capitalism Stability"
thread due to work pressures, I thought I'd toss in a couple of comments
here:

In a message dated 97-02-27 19:12:51 EST, John Blanco-Losada writes:

Except at the extremes, personal freedom is a matter of degree.  I think
individuals are more or less free, not either/or.  Thus my personal "liberty
meter" can register a higher degree of freedom in some societies than others
and in different "axes", i.e. in some countries I am more free to do one sort
of thing, and in others more free to do others.

I think T0Morrow's comments in the "Anarcho-Capitalism Stability" thread are
very apt in answer to this: There are many fronts on which the sphere of
personal liberty can be enlarged using existing tools of polycentric law in
many currently existing societies, especially the U.S.  Depending on the
extent to which one is a "minarchist" or a radical anarchist, it may well be
possible to realize a society of maximal personal liberty by gradually
enlarging the sphere of personal liberty.  

One problem with this approach in the U.S. is that, while the federal
constitution defines (at least in theory) the central national government as
a limited sovereign, the constitutions of the states do not.  In theory, the
U.S. states are "ultimate soveregns" claiming all residual political power.
 Thus -- again in theory -- a gradualist approach will ultimately bump up
against a limit to individual liberty in the sovereign power of the states.
 A successful program of gradualism, however, might approach this limit so
gently, though, that by the time it is reached, cultural expectations of
persoal liberty could be great enough that the "ultimate sovereign" might
"wither away" peacefully, with a wink and a nod.

>  Would you "put your money where your mouth is" and actually move to a 
>  libertarian colony?

This question has been discussed before, with some acute insights from Robin
Hanson, if memory serves.  The problem is one of relative benefit and cost.
 Immigration to a "new society" will have costs associated with it for
specific individuals.  The more economically and socially established and
successful an individual is in the "old world", the less favorable an
immigration decision will be.  Likewise, the more economic opportunity and
liberty is available in an "old world" society, the less favorable an
immigration decision will be.  A review of the character of phases of
immigration to North America reflects these factors starkly.

In practical terms, these factors mean that the new "libertarian colony" has
to offer significant relative advantages to entice immigrants from the "old
world".  They also mean that the immigration decision will be evaluated
differently for differently-situated inhabitants of any specific "old world"
society.  The paradox is that some of the people that a "brave new
(libertarian) world" will want most to attract are the ones with the highest
threshhold to overcome in this equation.

Thus, the answer to the question is, "it depends".  For a young person with
few roots in the old world, living in a repressive society with few
opportunities, immigration is relatively easy.  For a succesfully established
person living in a relatively free society with good economic prospects, the
decision is harder.  

Factors that would act as immigration "magnets" certainly relate to legal
advantage and the availability of new resources.  Thus a luxurious tax haven
built in the asteroid belt sounds pretty good to me.  A "colony" consisting
of some dilapidated structures in a Third World country doesn't.

Sounds reasonable. A bit tricky, but possible. It even circumvents all 
bans on germ line modification, since you are using a clone (hmm, they 
have already been rendered void. Interesting). 

> B) Grow just an arm or body part from specialized tissue cells ?

Tricky, but probably what we really want. Growing entire clones is so 
wasteful (and bad taste), while finding ways to generate organs from 
scratch in vitro by controlled morphogenesis would be much more elegant. 
Hard to do, we need much more understanding of how cell differentiation 
occurs (as the clone experiments have shown, we certainly don't know all 
of the puzzle). 

> Genetical modification should be used to improve, not to degrade.

Exactly. In one of the articles in Nature Axel Khan discussed the ethical 
principle Kant proposed: Human life should never be thought of as only a 
means, but also as an end. While I disagree a lot with Kant in general, I 
think this principle is quite sound. The trouble comes when defining what 
human life is; is a brainless clone human? An undifferentiated cell mass?

Personally I would think bionic implants can do quite well in many 
situations too.

The current rush of condemnations of biotechnology all seem to boil down 
to that some loud people want to decide what is proper and what is not, 
and then force all life to conform to it. A *very* dangerous way of 
thinking - if you start to see certain trait as "unnatural" and hence 
undesirable, you can easily begin to play eugenic policeman.

Unfortunately the groups that currently do modifications are the big 
corporations; they of course thrive in a strictly regulated field since 
they can lunch with government officials and afford expensive security, 
labs and paperwork. In a less regulated field they would have more 
competition, but they would still be the biggest.

It is hardly such. Not meaning to step on toes, but saying that
creativity is an artefact and not neccessary is like saying the ability
to see is an artefact, and not neccessary, when one has the spoken word.
We all have our own blind spots. Mr. Schrader shows us his.

Overall, a good article. I would suggest going into greater treatment of
the engineering aspects, such as needing 500 mile high walls on either
side of the tube wall to keep atmosphere from spilling out (Niven had
1000 mile high walls, which would only be neccessary if you intended on
making it livable for more than a few hundred thousand years). Also, it
is important to NOT have any large body within the radius of the tube,
as the danger of damage to the tube is too great to allow, and the
gravity irregularities of any non-homogenous, non-perfect spherical
gravitational influence would cause the tube ot wobble such that it
would eventually hit the body (as was discussed in Niven's _Ringworld
Engineers_).

Additionally, consider the physiological effects of rotation on humans
and other organisms in the tube ecology. O'Niel et al. determined that
coriolis effects of rotating in small radius structures caused
disorientation, confusion, and losses of balance in people exposed to
such an environment for too long. It was estimated that the radius owuld
need to be at least several miles, with a rotational velocity of less
than 1 rpm. THis is why toroidal space colonies are thought to be
preferred over tubular ones of similar capacity, as you get greater
rotational radius with equal useful surface area.

Also, the effects of radiation on Buckytubes should be examined.

I don't think we know enough about the human genome to do this.  As was
mentioned, you don't want to remove the whole brain, just the "higher level"
parts that (we hope) are necessary for consciousness.  The fear that we
may somehow be creating a person who experiences terrible suffering from
our manipulations may be enough to retard experiments along these lines.

> B) Grow just an arm or body part from specialized tissue cells ?

Cloning technology by itself will not accomplish this.  Conceivably we
could eventually learn to rip a proto-arm off a cloned embryo, hook it
up to a tiny little blood supply, and grow an arm, without growing the
rest of the body.  It's not clear that this would work, though.

The issue of the rights of animals, brainless humans, and small children
is a difficult one.  At one extreme we can say that they are owned
creatures, and their masters can do whatever they wish with them.
That is the more pragmatic view as well, because of the difficulty of
observing mistreatment without having a surveillance state in place.
At the other extreme is the view that people have the right and duty
to prevent mistreatment of helpless creatures even on other people's
property.  A moderate position would provide some kind of partial rights
in these cases, with enforcement limited to when infractions become
externally visible.  That is basically what we have today, although the
details will not be to everyone's taste.

The fear about mixing animal and human cells is the possibility of
introducing new diseases, encouraging germs to cross species lines.
This is one of those cases where a pure property-rights view may not
be adequate to prevent massive epidemics.  It is similar to the case of
quarantining someone who has an infectious disease, one of the classic
"hard cases" of libertarianism.

Also, subsidies are paid by governments to farmers because of
OVERSUPPLY. Farmers are just too good at their jobs. Granted that with
some areas of the world in famine, this should not be true, but the
limits of transportation and distribution are at fault here, not
farmers. Vermont bans the use of BGH in domestic milk that can carry the
Vermont label, and is in a court battle with industry groups from other
states over this, as it makes their milk appear to be inferior in the
market compared to the "hormone free" Vermont made milk. Farmers have
needed subsidies beacuse their business is heavily laden with capital
costs. SInce the Federal Reserve and the other people who determine the
official inflation rate and interest rates have consistently
overestimated inflation, farmers capital costs have been unfairly higher
than they should be, thus making their totally competetive market drift
toward consolidation in big corporate farming. It is this sort of
influence of government on economic factors that leads to enterprise
consolidation and the development of monopolies. THis is what
mercantilism is.

        Keeping an anencephalic (sp?) clone alive would be very expensive,
to say the least.  You can't expect to have your brainless clone acting
exactly how you want it too because it will have no will to do anything that
you tell it.  If it becomes possible to manufacture a clone that has a very
slightly developed brain, then that will delve deeply into an ethical issue
about "what life is."  Food and clothing will be essential, and bathing
would be desired; hygiene will be necessary if you want the parts you'll
take from it to be healthy.  There will probably be some emotional
attachment to this clone, due to the fact that it looks nearly identical to
what you or someone you know once looked, not to mention the build up of
emotional attachment because of the years of "mothering" or "fathering" the
clone.  Imagine having a severely mentally handicapped child for thirty
years then suddenly taking his\her heart or liver.  I would do it if
necessary, but there are definately better alternatives.

          I think the best idea regarding cloning thus far is the one of
cryogenically freezing an anencephalic clone, then taking its parts *but*
remember that it would have to be grown so that the organs etc. would be
compatible.  Who would raise the clone to that point?  Cloning certainly has
its ups and downs, but I think that there are a lot more feasible methods of
extending life and growing body parts.

I'm putting together a proposal for a performance art piece to be performed

refer to several breakthrough events that have taken in 20th Century. Events
that come to mind are:

1.      Sputnik first breaking free of planet earth's atmosphere;
2.      Apollo Misson and astronauts walking on moon;
3.      Pioneer 10 leaving our solar system heading towards
        interstellar space; and
4.      Hubble Telescope time-travel imaging.

If anyone would like to add to my list, or suggest events that might be
better to comment on, I'd appreciate advice.  Thanks.

For Kant, I think it's clear that he meant not biological humans but beings
possessing rationality. In fact, Kant's view of ethical standing has been
used by pro-choice philosophers in the abortion debate to support the
reasonableness of aborting a fetus. A fetus being human (and a human once
developed enough) but not a person.

How about this: taking a cell from the stage where the embryo is just a
ball of cells. Just take that specific cell that has the right anim./veg.
levels to grow into an arm, or a part of the rump attached to an arm, (or
organ). And hook these cells back up to the placenta (this may be the
tricky part)  

At one point we might even be able to manufacture cells with those right
levels. They way i see it all we need to do is take one ball, split up all
the cells, clone each cell, save the original and label it. Put each clone
back on the placenta, and see what it grows into.

It may all sound a little too simplistic to be accomplished, but then so
did cloning sheep didn't it ?

I don't know, we use cows and pigs for leather, why not for a heart ?
We've always 'guided' their evolution, the reason they exist in their
current form, is purely because that current form has brought us benefit.
As long as we don't make/let them suffer, i see no limitations for their
uses.

Hmmm, As long as we restrict experiments to domesticated species, we're
going to benefit from the knowledge we already have on these species. It's
also a perfect test comparison for the free market system: relatively 5% to
10% of the human population (farmers) have been financing research into
medical research for domesticated animals, which we have come quite a way
in, through a free market system. Compared to the state system that dealt
with human medical research. something to consider ?    

You did bring up an interesting point though, which made me wonder about
species-specific mutation rates, what exactly causes it, and the
compatibility and possible influence, animal donor organs would have on
humans.

Yes, Kahn changes the principle somewhat, from "individuals" to "human 
life", thus making it fuzzy enough to involve even brainless clone humans.

This seems to mirror the "neocorticaldeath" idea discussed in Hughes 
interesting essay (forgot the name, has uploads in it) about how 
technology changes our definition of death. He regards a patient as dead 
as a person when the neocortical functions are irreversibly gone, even if 
the rest of the brain works.

This is also the view of Karen Gervais in "Redefining Death". In my
dissertation chapter on conceptions of death I argued that this was a
better criterion, but not ultimately acceptable (as we uploading types
understand...)

I haven't seen the book yet, but am a little familiar with the writer (a
philosopher) and so think this may be good to check out:

Nadia:
>The laziness you speak of is rarely confronted in this forum <snip>

I thank Nadia for her comments, and would like to add that I am more 
willing to pin the label of 'laziness' onto artists themselves rather 
than those who have not yet begun an artistic exploration, partly 
because I perceive an underlying fear of art (a mostly taught fear) 
that creates barriers that the individual must decide to surmount.

But the artists themselves have no such excuse, and I am royally 
tired of reading poetry that says nothing, of looking at sculpture 
that has been thrown together, paintings that blend into the wall, 
artists who are mostly concerned with who comes to their parties.  
When a few brave literary editors decided to award a major poetry 
prize to an unpublished young black man, you would have thought from 
the ensuing uproar that they had threatened civilization itself.  

And yet that event jolted me into a stronger realization that the 
only way to overcome this inertia is to take the responsibility for 
it on a personal level.  If those editors felt the need to track down 
someone in the Black Mountains of North Carolina to find writing that 
Spoke, that to me was an indication that my own personal 
disillusionment with the literary mill was no longer a sufficient 
excuse, because I could have done the same in my own editorship.  And 
this may be my own take on the transhumanist art movement--it doesn't 
matter how much talent one possesses in any particular type of art, the 
important aspect is to utilize those skills to communicate to others 
and to encourage others to do the same.  

And I, for one, look forward to complete the dreary graduate school 
papers so that I may get on with some transhumanist writing projects. 
 Stay tuned!

What about the birth of the first living beings in orbit? That has to be 
those japanese fishes I saw mentioned on Discovery a while ago.

Damien Broderick wrote 2/28/97: <An interesting source that I've belatedly
discovered on these topics, blending cognitive science and informed
literary theory, is Mark Turner.>

A very good article by Turner, "Design for a Theory of Meaning", appeared
in the book "The Nature and Ontogenesis of Meaning", W. Overton and D.
Palermo, eds., (Erlbaum, 1994), pages 91-107.  Turner productively draws on
the work of neuroscientist Gerald Edelman and cognitive scientist George
Lakoff to examine the imaginative mind in the light of genetics,
experience, biology and culture.

It is unfortunate that Mr. Lakoff, in publishing his latest book "Moral
Politics:  What Conservatives Know that Liberals Don't" (1996) has revealed
himself to be yet another politically correct utopian pinko scientist, an
irredeemably "learned ignoramus."  He should stick to his narrow field,
like most scientists should, and do something useful in it, expanding on
Vico's foundational axioms in cognitive science.

Damien: <A convenient summary of such errors, documented by Luc Ferry and
Alain Renaut, Andrew Scull, Erik Midelfort, Leon Radzinowicz, Michael
Ignatieff, Douglas Hay, and David Garland, is sketched in Keith
Windschuttle, The Killing of History (1994), pp. 145-54.>

"The Killing of History:  How a Discipline is Being Murdered By Literary
Critics and Social Theorists", by Keith Windschuttle (2nd Ed. 1996) is a
highly recommended antidote to all the filthy compost-modern revisionist
history, nihilistic literary criticism, etc. of today (note I'm not
singling out just the French like Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard, et al this
time; but I'm not going soft, honest).

My stylistic soulmate Roger Kimball, writing in the Sept. 96 issue of "The
New Criterion" regarded this book as the most important work of cultural
criticism to appear in many years.  Kimball wrote: "at a time when what Mr.
Windschuttle calls 'the return of tribalism' threatens many parts of the
world with a descent into barbarism, to embrace cultural relativism is also
to embrace the 'charnal house politics' that have brought such misery and
destruction to Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Central Africa, the Balkans, and
elsewhere.  This indeed is where the arcane theories of Derrida, Foucault,
and their epigoni collide with the real world.  They abandon the
constraints of empirical truth in the name of liberation.  But what they
wind up with is not freedom but a new and more terrible servitude."  And
that is the truth, I'm certain of it.  Gregory Houston, you might pick up
and peruse a copy of it.

Of course we can challenge that statement.  Unless "idea" is
broadened so far as to cover all human attributes, there are lots of
(combinations of) attributes that make us each unique.  Taken one by
one, most of the ideas we have are also shared by many other people,
just like our other attributes.  

I think the difference for you is that you value your ideas more than
your other attributes, so they define you more in your eyes.  And I
share that trait.  But I have sadly learned that most people simply
aren't like this - they define themselves much more in terms of
non-idea attributes.  So most of them just don't see "me", the me I
care about at least.

Discerning persons would.  Why do you care about the opinions of 
those who can't see beyond externalities--they're not worth wasting a 
short life on.  Think of it as a screening device to find the truly 
interesting people.

On the other hand, who's version of sanity are you compairing with? 
Many people consider me over the edge, and yet many consider me to be
very developed intelectually in certian ways, not necessarly all ways.
Some consider this high level of thinking, because they don't understand
it, then it must be insanity...  (which may not include my spelling).

Also, the "Orbitals" appearing in some novels by Iain Banks, "The Player of
Games", "Consider Phlebas", "Use of Weapons" and "Excession".  These are
rings like you describe, but they have a radius chosen so they rotate in one
day and produce one gee on the inside.  This permits a comfy day-night cycle
without the use of mirrors.  My calculations indicate they have a radius of
1.9 million kilometers, and a tangential velocity of 21.8 km/sec.  In the
books, they're built of Unobtanium, but they might not have to be!  Pure
diamond is restricted to a tangential velocity of 17.5 km/sec; buckyfiber
may be capable of 21.8 km/sec (I haven't done that calculation).

Why spin the slag?  Put it in a nonrotating shell well away from the

That gives an atmospheric half-life of only 60,000 years.  Why not make the
wall a little higher?  You get a factor of ten in half-life for every 10 km
of height.

It will be very bright at night, with a 28 degree wide arch of sunlit land
spread across the sky.  The stars will be too dim to be seen.  This is an
argument for a narrower ring, or perhaps some sort of parasol (sleep mask?).

        Yes, you are correct to an extent.  However, although our
appearances are unique in some way or another, the process of physical
uniquity can be mapped.  The cells will replace themselves fully in X amount
of years.  However, with thoughts and ideas, the stream of consciousness is

Pardon my rudeness, but you might not be making elementary errors if you had
any references less that 6 years old.  It's been known for several years that
HIV is always present and highly active in the lymph nodes of infected
patients for the entire course of the disease.  Antibodies do indeed clear it
from the blood and that's why it's not found in the the blood for a variable
period of several years between initial development of antibodies and
late-stage disease.  However, antibodies just aren't fast enough to provide
100% protection from transmissions in the lymph nodes.  HIV can also jump
directly from cell to cell in such a way that antibodies aren't very
effective.

Ever heard of chronic hepatitis?

Is this true?  If so, how sad that biotech policy is being set by fools.

a) It should be obvious to anybody that humanity is created by brains, not by
milk-producing ability.  This bull's alteration wouldn't make it human in any
way.

b) If you *did* manage to give an animal genes that made it partly human,
then logically it should *gain* rights - like the right not to be
involuntarily sterilized, amongst other more important ones.

Over here we often refer to them as 'Conservative Lite' ;-). Their
policies today are almost entirely identical to the Conservative party,
except that they claim they will increase government spending more without
increasing taxes.

I said :

>> HIV, the virus the government says causes AIDS.

Davon C. Enigl said:

>Scientists...first said HIV causes AIDS, not "governments." ...The
governments only
>adopted what the scientists proved via the peer review process.

Robert Gallo and his employer, the Department of Health and Human =
Services held
a press conference on April 23, 1984, more than a week BEFORE Gallo's =
papers
were to be
printed in the journal Science.  The Secretary of HHS, Margaret Heckler,
sponsored this
huge event and introduced Gallo to the press.  Backed by the prestige of =
the
government,
she officially declared this virus was the probable cause of AIDS.  =
Before
any paper had
been published in a peer reviewed journal. Before any other scientist =
could
review and=20
comment on Gallo's claim, the government had decided the matter. Had =
other
researchers=20
been free to examine Gallo's papers for themselves, they might have =
pointed
out that some of his AIDS patients had never been infected by the virus.
They might have pointed out that no virus had been found in ANY of =
Gallo's
AIDS patients, but only antibodies
against it.=20

>Using Koch's postulates HIV was shown to cause AIDS. The "dissidents" =
have
not shown
>the contrary.

Hardly.  Leading AIDS researchers have acknowledged that HIV fails =
Koch's
postulates as the cause of AIDS.  For example: Gallo, R.C.,
Virus-Hunting-AIDS, Cancer and the Human Retrovirus: A Story of =
Scientific
Discovery, Basic Books, NY 1991; or Blatner, W.A., R.C. Gallo, and H.M.
Temin. HIV causes AIDS. Science 241 (1988):514-515; or Weiss, R. and H.
Jaffe. Duesberg, HIV and AIDS. Nature (London) 345 (1990) 659-660.
Nevertheless, they have argued that the failure of HIV to meet Koch's
postulates invalidates these postulates rather than invalidating HIV as =
the
cause of AIDS.  For example, Gallo in his 1991 book said:

"Rules were needed than, and can be helpful now, but not if they are too
blindly followed.  Robert Koch, a great microbiologist, has suffered =
from a
malady that affects many other great men: he has been taken too =
literally
and too seriously for too long...Koch's Postulates, while continuing to =
be
an excellent teaching device, are far from absolute in the real world
outside the classroom." (Gallo, Virus-Hunting...page 277)

But Koch's postulates consist of elementary logic.  Whereas technology =
is
continually being outdated, logic is permanent.  Koch's rules, after =
all,
simply restate the germ theory itself in experimental terms.  Gallo =
never
tries to explain how logic would change over time, nor does Gallo offer =
any
rigorous scientific rules to replace Koch's Postulates. =20

Koch's 1st postulate is that the microbe must be found in all cases of =
the
disease.
Robert Koch explicitly said a casual germ would be found in high
concentrations in the
patient and distributed in the diseased tissues. If HIV were actively
infecting T-cells then cell-free virus particles, called virions, should =
be
easily found circulating in the blood. This is the case with all =
classical
viral diseases: Patients with Hepatitus B will have about 10 million =
free
virus particles per milliliter of blood; Flu-like symptoms will appear =
only
in the presence of 1 million rhinovirus particles per milliliter of =
nasal
mucous. HIV, like other retroviruses, can achieve high levels of virus =
when
first infecting the body (up to 100,000 particles per milliliter of =
blood),
but in most people HIV is then permanently inactivated by the antibodies
generated against it.

Retroviruses do not typically kill their host cells.  In 1984, in =
Science,
Gallo said HIV kills T-cells and that is the cause of AIDS. Yet HIV is =
grown
in cultures of T-cells where, away from the antibodies to inhibit it, it
reaches levels of 1,000,000 virus particles per milliliter without =
killing
T-cells. If it doesn't kill T-cells then, how is it going to do it when =
it
is suppressed to nearly undetectable levels by antibody?

Pathogenic virus typically cause disease as a consequence of infecting,
replicating in, and  killing more cells than a host can regenerate or =
spare.
Complete proviral HIV has only been demonstrated in one in several =
thousand
peripheral blood monocular cells (in both asymptomatic and symptomatic
persons), and HIV RNA is detected in 1 tp 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 such =
cells
(Simmonds et al., J. Virol. 64:864, 1990). Yet 5% of the body's
T-cells are regenerated in the two days it takes HIV to establish an
infection (Guyton,
Textbook of Medical Physiology, 1987, WB Saunders, Phil.).=20

Viruses typically cause disease shortly after infection, before the =
immune
system of their host can respond. There is no other example of a viral
pathogen which causes primary disease only after long and unpredictable
latent periods, and only in the presence of neutralizing antibodies, as =
HIV
is said to do.

Koch's second postulate: The microbe must be isolated from the host and
grown in culture. This postulate was designed to prove that a given =
disease
was caused by a particular germ, rather than by some undetermined =
mixture of
noninfectious substances. HIV has been isolated and is now grown
continuously in HIV research labs. This rule therefore has technically
fulfilled, but only in some instances.

Since free virus is rarely found in AIDS victims, HIV can be retrieved =
only
from the great majority of them by reactivating the latent form of the
virus. Millions of white blood cells must be taken from the patient and
grown in culture dishes for weeks, during which time chemical stimulants
that shock cells into growing or mutating are added to awaken any =
dormant
HIV from within its host cells. Given enough patience and plenty of
repetition such procedure, a single intact virus can eventually be
activated, at which point it starts infecting the remaining cultured =
cells.
Yet even this powerful method does not yield active virus from many AIDS
cases that have confirmed antibodies against HIV.=20

Koch's third postulate: The microbe must reproduce the original disease =
when
introduced into a susceptible host.  This condition can be tested in one =
of
three ways: infection of laboratory animals, accidental and natural
infection of humans, or by vaccination experiments. HIV fails all three
tests. (data available upon request, check "Inventing the AIDS Virus" by
Duesberg, page 182)

Duesberg argues that AIDS is not infectious. Gallo and the CDC says it =
is.
Based on common characteristics of all orthodox infections, infectious =
AIDS
would be predicted to:

1. Spread randomly between the sexes.=20
2. Cause primary disease within weeks or months after infection, because
infectious agents multiply exponentially in susceptible hosts until =
stopped
by immunity. They are self-replicating, and thus fast-acting, toxins.  =
Slow
pathogenicity by a neutralized virus has never been experimentally =
proven.
3. Coincide with a common, active and abundant microbe in all cases of =
the
same disease. (Inactive microbes or microbes at low concentrations are
harmless passengers,e.g. lysogenic bacteriophages, endogenous and latent
retroviruses, latent herpes, etc..  Hibernation is a proven microbal
strategy of survival, which allows indefinite coexistence with the host
without pathogenicity.)
4. Lyse or render nonfunctional more cells than the host can spare of
regenerate.
5. Generate a predictable pattern of symptoms.=20

By contrast noninfectious AIDS, caused by tozins, would be predicted to:

1. Spread nonrandomly, according to exposure to toxins.
2. Follow intoxication after variable intervals as determined by =
lifetime
dosage and personal thresholds for disease.=20
3. Manifest toxin- and intoxication-site-specific diseases, e.g., =
cigarettes
causing lung cancer and alcohol causing liver cirrhosis.

AIDS is incompatible with classical criteria of infectious disease:

1. Unlike conventional infectious diseases, including venereal diseases,
American/European AIDS is nonrandomly (90%) restricted to males, =
although no
AIDS disease is male specific.
2. HIV is said to cause AIDS only after a peculiar latent period.  There =
is
no precedent for an infectious agent that causes primary diseases on =
average
only 10 years after transfusion in adults and only after 2 years in
children.  The diversity of these latent periods is inconsistent with =
one
infectious agent and their magnitude is characteristic for diseases =
caused
by chronic exposure to toxic substances.
3. There is no common, predictable pattern of AIDS symptoms in patients =
of
different risk groups.  Instead, different risk groups have their own
characteristic AIDS diseases.

In response to these arguments, Goudsmit, a proponent of the HIV AIDS
hypothesis, confirmed "AIDS does not have the characteristics of an =
ordinary
infectious disease.  This view is incontrovertible." (Goudsmit, J.,
Alternative View on AIDS. Lancet 339 (1992):1289-1290.)  Likewise,
epidemiologists Eggers and Weyer conclude that "the spread of AIDS does =
not
behave like the spread of a disease that is caused by a single sexually
transmitted agent." (Eggers, H.J. and J.J. Weyer. Linkage and =
independence
of AIDS Kaposi disease: the interaction of HIV and some coagents. =
Infection.
19(1991):115-122.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

I stumbled into the AOL "current events" area and discovered that the service
was conducting a member poll on attitudes toward human cloning.  The
following was the tally of votes as of early this morning:

>  Out of  10012 total responses:
>  5599 people (56%) picked: Ban it.
>  2086 people (21%) picked: Don't ban it.
>  2326 people (23%) picked: For medical research only.

I then visited the associated message board.  Of the just under 300 messages,
it seemed that a significantly higher proportion or posters were willing to
entertain the idea of tinkering with human genetic material, including quite
a few who expressed very extropian values.  Those expressing fears about
cloning exhibited an abysmal scientific ignorance of the process and seemed
most concerned with the question of whether a human clone would have a soul.
 Opposition to human cloning appeared to be primarily based on some
conception of "god's will."

I find all of this to be an interesting expression of public opinion, even if
it isn't very rigorous.  Presumably the initial survey population represents
mildly technophilic people (compared with the general U.S. populace), with a
slightly higher than average interest in public affairs, since participants
are self-selected in an online service.  In this group, an overwhelming
majority (79%) favors government regulation of scientific research and
technology development.  A solid majority (56%) favors an outright, total
government ban on human cloning.  (In this connection, I spotted a newswire
story that the British government has moved to cut all funding for the
original sheep research . . . perhaps another argument in favor of Scottish
independence . . .)  However, of those willing to take a little extra time to
express themselves, a more free and courageous attitude is much more
prevalent.

Reviewing this material once again brought home to me how careful we have to
be to always remember that the vast majority of humanity, even in "advanced"
societies, is deeply ignorant of science and bases their most profound moral
and political views on simple superstition and inarticulate fears.  Brace
yourselves!

But eliminating them leaves a relatively small part of the population to
choose my friends from. I might well do better to spend some time giving
clues to the clueless...

I think this is axiomatically true. 'Sanity' means that you think just
about the same way as the majority of people in your society; Celia Green
wrote a book about this. So inevitably if you think very differently
you'll be considered 'insane'. Of course, most great art comes from people
who are either 'insane' or can nip over there for a weekend. 

I remember reading an account of a discussion between Joyce and some
psychologist (Jung?) about the similarities between Joyce's writing and
schizophrenia, with the exception that Joyce was swimming in the ocean of
insanity while the schizophrenics were sinking.

I still don't understand this thing about 'child labor'. Sure, I don't
really want to see eight-year-old kids working in factories or mines, but
when I was fourteen I spent a lot of my free time writing software. Why
should I have to do it for free when I could have been earning money at
it and gaining some useful resume points? 

Incidentally, I saw an interesting TV show a couple of months ago which
was looking at the first anti-child-labor laws in the UK. They made a
reasonable case that much of the evidence given to the government was
staged, and that the kids much preferred working in factories to working
on farms.

"The five-part miniseries 'Future Fantastic,' which examines innovations 
of the imaginative as well as scientists who dare to be imaginative, 
premieres Sunday on the Learning Channel at 10 PM.

Gillian Anderson of "The X-Files" hosts the series.  The five parts, 
airing Sunday through Thursday at 10 PM, repeat at 1 AM:

Alien: It's not just the kooks and cranks who say life is out there.

The Incredible Shrinking Planet: Earthlings are inventing their own 
teletransport.

I Robot: Tomorrow androids may think and even reproduce.

Space Pioneers: What speculative ideas are ready to fly?

Immortals: Cryogenics heats up.

The series features interviews with visionary authors and the scientists 
who are inspired by their work, including Arthur C. Clarke, Ray Bradbury, 
astronaut Story Musgrave, and MIT's Marvin Minsky, 'father' of artificial 
intelligence.

The complete series repeats Sunday, March 9 from 1 to 6 PM."

This sounds like the 'proprietary community' idea which I've read about in
the past, and which Friedman touches on in 'The Machinery of Freedom'.  In
this case the community is more like a hotel than a modern town, in that
it's owned and protected by one organisation and those who wish to enter
must agree to abide by a certain set of laws. The intention being that
competition will eliminate those communities which choose excessive laws.

This has already been shown over here in the UK. It's OK (Max and Natasha
make a brief beach-based appearance), but not as in-depth as I, for one,
would have liked. On the other hand, it's not particularly set up to
ridicule the people it features for their beliefs or research, so in that
respect it could be considered 'a good thing'.

Purportedly, (I haven't tried out the package yet) Mathematica 3.0 
offers good support for CA research ]

As a first example, consider various idealizations of the system
discussed above consisting of a ball rolling with friction on a
landscape, now assumed one dimensional. In the approximation of a
point ball, this is equivalent to a particle moving with damping in
a one-dimensional potential. But the basins of attraction depend
substantially on thee exact dynamics assumed. In the case of very
large friction, the particle satisfies a differential equation in
which velocity is proportional to force, and force is given by the
gradient of the potential. In a more realistic model, with finite
friction and the inertia of the ball included, the system becomes
similiar to a Roulette wheel. And in this case it is known that
the outcome is a sensitive function of the precise initial conditions.
As a consequence, the basins of attraction corresponding for example
to different holes around the wheel must have a complicated,
interdigitated, form (cf. [5]).

Complicated basin boundaries can also be obtained with simpler
equations of motion. As one example, one can take time to be
discrete, and assume that the potential has the form of a polynomial,
so that the differential equation is approximated by an iterated
polynomial mapping. The sequence of positions found from this
mapping may overshoot the minimum, and for some values of parameters
may in fact never converge to it. The region of initial conditions
which evolves to a particular attractor may therefore be complicated.
In the case of the complex iterated mapping z->z^2+c, the boundary
of the basin of attraction (say for the attractor z=\infty) is a
Julia set, and has a very complicated fractal form (e.g. [6]).

The essentials of the problem of finding basins of attraction already
arise in the problem of determining what set of inputs to a function of
discrete variables yields a particular output. This problem is known in
general to be computationally very difficult. In fact, the satisfiability
problem of determining which if any assignments of truth values to n
variables in a Boolean expression make the whole expression true is
NP-complete, and can presumably be solved in general essentially only
by explicitly testing all 2^n possible assignments (e.g. [7]). For some
functions with a simple, perhaps algebraic, structure an efficient
inversion procedure to find appropriate inputs may exist. But in general
no simple mathematical formula can describe the pattern of inputs:
they will simply seem random (cf. [8]).

Many realistic examples of this problem are found in cellular automata.
Cellular automata consist of a lattice of sites with discrete values
updated in discrete steps according to a fixed local rule. The image
processing operation mentioned above can be considered a single step
in the evolution of a simple two-dimensional cellular automaton (cf.
[9]). Other cellular automata show much more complicated behaviour,
and it seems in fact that with appropriate rules they capture the
essential features of many complex systems in nature (e.g. [1]). The
basic problems of complexity engineering thus presumably already
arise in cellular automata.

Most cellular automata are dissipative, or irreversible so that after
many steps, they evolve to attractors which contain only a subset
of their states. In some cellular automata (usually identified with
the classes 1 and 2), these attractors are fixed points (or limit
cycles), and small changes in initial conditions are usually dampened
out [10]. Other cellular automata (classes 3 and 4), however, never
settle down to a fixed state with time, but instead continue to show
complicated, chaotic, behaviour. Such cellular automata are unstable,
so that most initial perturbations grow with time to affect the detailed
configurations of an ever-increasing number of sites. The statistical
properties of the behaviour produced are nevertheless robust, and are
unaffected by such perturbations.

It can be shown that the set of fixed points of a one-dimensional
cellular automaton consists simply of all those configurations in
which particular blocks of site values do no appear [11]. This set
forms a (finite complement) regular language, and can be represented
by the set of possible paths through a certain labeled directed
graph [11]. Even when they are not fixed points, the set of all states
that can occur after say t time steps in the evolution of a
one-dimensional cellular automaton in fact also forms a regular
language (though not necessarily a finite complement one). In addition,
the basin of attraction, or in general the set of all states which
evolve after t steps to a given one, can be represented as a regular
language. For class 1 and 2 cellular automata, the siz of the minimal
graph for this language stays bounded, or at most increases like a
polynomial with t. For class 3 and 4 cellular automata, however, the
the size of the graph often increases apparently exponentially with
t, so that it becomes increasingly difficult to describe the basin
of attraction. The general problem of determining which states evolve
to a particular one after t steps is in fact a generalization of the
satisfiability problem for logical functions mentioned above, and is
thus NP complete. The basin of attraction in the worst case can thus
presumably be found only by explicit testing of essentially all O(2^t)
possible initial configurations (cf. [12]). Its form will again often
be so complicated as to seem random. For two-dimensional cellular
automata, it is already an NP-complete problem just to find fixed
points (say to determine which n x n blocks of sites with specified
boundaries are invariant under the cellular automaton rule) [13].

It is typical of complex systems that to reproduce their behaviour
requires extensive computation. This is a consequence of the fact that the
evolution of the systems themselves typically corresponds to a
sophisticated computation. In fact, the evolution of many complex systems
is probably computationally irreducible: it can be found essentally only
by direct simulation, and cannot be predicted by any short-cut procedure
[12, 14]. Such computational irreducibility is a necessary consequence of
the efficient use of computational resources in a system. Any
computational reducibility is a sign of inefficiency, since it implies
that some other system can determine the outcome more efficiently. 

Many systems in nature may well be computationally irreducible, so that no
general predictions can be made about their behaviour. But if a system is
to be used in engineering, it must be possible to determine in advance at
least some aspects of its behaviour. Conventional engineering requires
detailed specifications of the precise behaviour of each component in a
system. To make use of complex systems in engineering, one must relax this
constraint, and instead require only some general or approximate
specification of overall behaviour. 

One goal is to design systems which have particular attractors. For the
example of an inertialess ball rolling with friction on a landscape, this
is quite straightforward (cf. [15]). In one dimension, the height of the
landscape at position x could be given by the polynomial \Pi_i(x-x_i)^2,
where the x_i are the desired minima, or, attractors. The polynomial is
explicitly constructed to yield certain attractors in the dynamics.
However, it implies a particular structure for the basins of attraction.
If the attractors are close to equally spaced, or are sufficiently far
apart, then the boundaries of the basins of attraction for successive
attractors will be roughly half way between them. Notice, however, that as
the parameters of the landscape polynomial are changed, the structure of
the attractors and basins of attraction obtained can change
discontinuously, as described by catastrophe theory. 

For a more complex system, such as a cellular automaton, it is more
difficult to obtain a particular set of attractors. One approach is to
construct cellular automaton rules which leave particular sequences
invariant [16]. If these sequences are say of length L, and are
arbitrarily chosen, then it may be necessary to use a cellular automaton
rule which involves a neighbourhood of up to L-1 sites. The necessary rule
is straightforward to construct, but takes up to 2^{L-1} bits to specify. 

Many kinds of complex systems can be considered as bases for engineering.
Conventional engineering suggests some principles to follow. The most
important is the principle of modularity. The components of a system
should be arranged in some form of hierarchy. Components higher on the
hierarchy should provide overall control for sets of components lower on
the hierarchy, which can be treated as single units or modules. This
principle is crucial for software engineering, where the modules are
typically subroutines. It is also manifest in biology in the existance of
organs and definite body parts, apparently mirrored by subroutine-like
constructs in the genetic code [ check out Kauffman's "The Origins of
Order", Chapter 14 (Morphology, Maps and the Spatial Ordering of
Integrated Tissues) for more info on morphogenetic gadgetry -- 'gene ]

An important aspect of modularity is the abstraction it makes possible.
Once the construction of a particular module has been completed, the
module can be treated as a single object, and only its overall behaviour
need be considered, wherever the module appears. Modularity thus divides
the problem of constructing or analysing a system into many levels,
potentially making each level manageable. 

Modularity is used in essentially all of the systems to be discussed
below. In most cases, there are just two levels: controlling (master) and
controlled (slave) components. The components on these two levels usually
change on different time scales. The controlling components change at most
slowly, and are often fixed once a system say with a particular sets of
attractors has been obtained. The controlled components change rapidly,
processing input data according to dynamical rules determined by the
controlling components. Such separation of time scales is common in many
natural and artificial systems. In biology, for example, phenotypes of
organisms grow by fast process, but are determined by genotypes which seem
to change only slowly with time. In software engineering, computer memory
is divided into a part for "programs", which ar supposed to remain fixed
or change only slowly, and another part for intermediate data, which
changes rapidly.

I believe a major TV show (Nightline?) did a poll of the more general

Yes. There is so much rhetoric going on in the cyberculter that I tend to
watch one's actions attentively as I digest the words. What can be a better
example of what actually goes on in one's head than how he represents

I haven't seen it, although I remember spending quite a bit of time with the
journalists.  Apparently the interview with extropians is presented in three
separate shows, one of which covers more area than the other two shows.

My recollection of the program is that the producers were very interested in
extropy's ideas about the future.  My wisdom of experience sez that you
never know how the interview will be interpreted or presented and in what
context until it appears in print or video.  So, in this sense, it BBC did a
'good thing';

Has anyone heard what the public's conception of cloning is?  I could come
up with a few guesses but I would like to hear what people are really
thinking.

I'd bet a week's pay that these polls make no attempt to ensure
that the pollees have any idea what cloning actually /is/.  If
one actually took the time to explain the details, and then took
a poll among those who knew the facts, I'm sure the result would
be quite different.

Indeed, a medical case a couple of years ago came up where a child
needed a bone marrow transplant, so his parents went so far as to
reverse a vasectomy, have a new child, and give their older child
a bone marrow transplant from the new one.  Their chance of the new
child being a match wasn't very good; if the new child had been a
clone, it would have been 100%.  There were certainly those who
objected to what these parents were doing, but most were supportive.
If this situation arises again, and the parents want to have their
new child be the older child's twin, I think the public would be
generally supportive of that as well--and would still be against
"cloning" if you asked, because they don't know what they're saying.

See

http://cnst.rice.edu/aiche96.html

which is the transcript of a lecture by Smalley (Nobel prize winner) 
on buckytubes.  His team can make bundles of single-walled carbon 
nanotubes (SWNTs) by laser vaporization of graphite + about 1%
nickel or nickel/cobalt in a 1200 C oven.  Yields of SWNTs exceed 
70%.  The tensile strength of these SWNTs is infered to be greater than 
diamond; these tubes are easily strong enough to build Clarke's 
geostationary elevator with little or no taper.  The tubes are 
essentially perfect (any defect causes the tube to pinch off) and 
they self-assemble into hexagonally packed "ropes".

Lots of other interesting papers are available from cnst.rice.edu; do 
a web search.

There are two papers most often cited supporting the contention that HIV 
'lurks' in the lymph nodes (by others, you do not cite any). The first was 
written by Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Health and appeared 
in the March 25, 1993 issue of Nature.  

Fauci reported on his results in using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
to count the number of HIV-infected T cells, as well as checking directly for
cell-free virus particles. He compared the results from lymph node tissues
against the those from circulating blood.  What did he find?

Fauci gets down to brass tacks: "...a burst of viremia...a prolonged period...
little, if any...very low...may be related...high levels...
active and progressive..."but where are the numbers?  Although implying that 
he found large amounts of the virus, Fauci hid his only relevant statistics 
in the caption to figure 1, showing that HIV infected only about 1/100 to 
1/10,000 CD4+ T cells, EVEN IN THE LYMPH NODES.  And this assay DID NOT 
DISTINGUISH between cells containing active or dormant HIV.

Fauci's went on to confirm existing textbook knowledge on the workings 
of the immune system.  He recalled that "an initially adequate immune 
response itself also contributes substantially to the clearance of virus 
from the circulation.  In the late stages of disease [AIDS], these mechanical 
mechanisms are altered and an effective immune response against HIV is lost, 
leading to an increase in viral burden in [blood cells]."  Viremia initiated
from a previously suppressed virus and observed years after infection is a
classical CONSEQUENCE, rather than a CAUSE of immunodeficiency.
Many normally latent parasites become activated in immunodeficient
persons, as for example Candida, Pneumocystis, herpes, cytomegalovirus
and even retroviruses like HIV.  But HIV is just one of many
opportunistic viruses unleashed AFTER the immune system has
been suppressed. 

To eliminate any invading virus, the immune system coats it with
antibodies, thereby immobilizing the offending germs. The neutralized
germs are then filtered out in the lymph nodes. Fauci acknowledged
this "virus-traping capability of the node," and his paper notes that
the ONLY virus particles he could find in lymph tissues were
"coated with proteins" [antibodies]. These were viruses caught while
being destroyed. Furthermore, he does not report the actual number
of such neutralized particles, which presumably means he found few.

Fauci then interprets all this by concluding that HIV was being
produced in the lymph nodes and released to the blood, ignoring his
own outline of how the immune system works by trapping and
transporting neutralized virus to the lymph nodes; and his inability to
find any HIV that were not already coated with antibody. 

A much more competent paper by Genelabs Technologies of 
California and the University of Alabama, which appeared in Science
on March 19, 1993, is the other paper I have heard proponents of
the argument that HIV lurks in the lymph nodes cite.  In contrast to
Fauci's paper, it provided hard numbers in an attempt to refute
Duesberg.

This study used quantitative PCR to measure levels of actual HIV
expression in the blood, also examining amounts of p24 antigen
[a protein contained in HIV particles] and even infectious virus
itself. It purported to show high levels of HIV shortly after infection,
followed by suppression during the latent period and subsequent
reactivation when the patient reaches terminal AIDS. Was HIV
the cause or a harmless opportunist?

"First of all, the PCR and p24 data showed at best a poor correlation
with the actual number of virus particles. Patients registering high
on these molecular assays often had very little HIV, and vice versa.
Thus only direct measurement of the virus are useful, a point well
worth remembering for many other papers that have used such
artifact-prone methods to claim high levels of HIV in the body."

"Second, this new study revealed a complete absence of HIV while
the patients T cell counts drop.  Of the 32 HIV-infected subjects
with no symptoms of early stages of AIDS, having CD4+ T cell
counts ranging from 231 to 1080, 28 had no virus whatsoever, while in the
remaining 4 it was barely detectable. The virus is simply not around while
the immune system undergoes most of its destruction."

"Third, the virus was inconsistently reactivated in patients with full-blown
clinical AIDS or T cell counts below 200.  Of these 28 cases, 6 had no
virus at all. Only 6 others had greater than 1 thousand virus particles
per milliliter of blood, and only 2 of those reached a high of 100,000
particles per milliliter. This was an incredible spread of values, meaning
that the virus could return from latency only in a percentage of patients
whose immune systems had already been destroyed. Had HIV done the
damage, it would have been found all along, in all individuals, in extremely
large amounts. Only the 2 patients with the highest levels of the virus
might have qualified; the other 26 did not. The verdict: HIV is merely a
sporadic opportunistic infection."

"The fact that these authors were able to find several patients with 
detectable HIV, which contradicts most other studies showing only a
---tiny fraction of infected people with infectious particles, strongly implies
that this group of patients had been carefully selected at the start.  The
report failed to describe what risk group they fall into, nor how they were
chosen.  In any case, the established scientific literature shows that the
great majority of AIDS patients have no active virus at all."
[all above quotes from "Does HIV lurk in your lymph nodes?", Bryan
J. Ellison, Rethinking AIDS, v 1, #4, April 1993]

>Antibodies do indeed clear it
>from the blood and that's why it's not found in the blood for a variable

Agreed. This is true for HIV and many other "passenger" and opportunistic
viruses.  But the fact that they aren't around when the immune system is
being damaged makes them poor candidates for causal agents. They are
reactivated after the immune system collapses. Reactivation of previously
suppressed latent viruses is a classical result, not a cause, of immune system
collapse. For a virus to be reactivated, the immune system must first be
destroyed by something else-the real cause of a disease.

>However, antibodies just aren't fast enough to provide
>100% protection from transmissions in the lymph nodes.  

Not "fast" enough?  Care to cite this reference?  Fauci couldn't find any
HIV virus that wasn't "coated with proteins" [antibody] in the lymph 
nodes. They sound pretty "fast" to me. Textbooks, and Fauci [see above] 
recall that the lymph nodes are where neutralized virus are transported, 
filtered out and consumed by antibody. Fauci confirmed as much. 
If HIV was too "fast" for antibodies "in the lymph nodes", then
Fauci would have found antibody-free virus in the lymph
nodes. And if HIV was too "fast" for antibodies in the
lymph nodes, why wouldn't it be too "fast" for antibody
while circulating in the blood. Where is this reference to 
"fast" HIV in the lymph nodes, so I can read what would make
HIV "fast" there, but only 'half-fast' elsewhere? I guess you
are arguing that HIV is a "slow" virus in that disease occurs
only after a latent period that averages 10 years in adults; AND
that it is too "fast" for antibodies in the lymph nodes. So I guess
it's a "fast" slow virus! 

>HIV can also jump directly from cell to cell in such a way 
>that antibodies aren't very effective.

I'd like to read more about how HIV can "jump directly from cell
to cell" in a manner that renders antibodies ineffective.  Especially,
since you yourself mention:

>Antibodies do indeed clear it from the blood 
>and that's why it's not found in the blood

Since you mention that the antibodies do indeed clear it 
from the blood, does HIV only "jump" in the lymph nodes? So
"fast" HIV lurks in the lymph nodes where it "jumps" from
cell to cell. Facinating. I await your citations with bated breath.

On the subject of citing sources, you mentioned:

>you might not be making elementary errors if you had
>any references less that 6 years old...

I notice you did not cite ANY references.  I suppose that entitles
you to criticize my "6 years old" references with impunity? And,
by the way, I cited Duesbergs book, copyrighted 1996, and
A Lancet article from 1992.  So get a calculator.  And some
manners. I expected better from a contributor to the
Extropian list than the sentence quoted above.  

>Pardon my rudeness...

You said it.

        Oh, it'll be banned, alright; but that's never stopped people

The Washington Post reported today (March 2, 1997) that Don Wolf of the 
Oregon Regional Primate Center has cloned monkeys from embryo cells using  
techniques similar to the ones that resulted in a cloning sheep, the animals   
were born last August. Dr. Wolf said that is as far as he intends to go, 
he did not try to make a clone from an adult monkey, nor does he intend to, 
it's not too hard to figure out why, in the next sentence the article says 
that his work is federally funded. 

The Journal "Nature" said they were under considerable pressure not to  
publish the historic article on cloning, right up to the moment the presses 
rolled attempts were made to suppress it. Fortunately Nature has guts and did  
not cave in, they even put the entire article on the Web, you can read it at 
http://www.nature.com./

Our old friend Jeremy Rifkin said there should be an immediate worldwide ban 
on cloning and that the penalty for violation should "be on a par with murder". 
A poll taken by ABC news says that 87% of Americans think cloning should be 
banned, 6% would like to be cloned.

I'm not too worried because I think it's politicians not Scientists who are  
guilty of hubris if they think they can stop this technology. For the first 
time I found something that an "ethicist", the lowest form of human life,  
said that I could agree with; to quote Ronald Munson, "The technology is not,  
in principle policeable [...] These are relatively standard labs. That's the 
amazing thing about biotechnology. It's fundamentally quite feasible". 
Unlike Munson I am not appalled by this, I am  delighted.

wouldn't be mere lab curiosities).

What cometh our way, next? Can we tell, already?

And why should we care?

I believe we should. Though computer monomaniacs'
sensory homunculus shows habitually gross distortions
of projected reality (silicon featuring prominently),
the impact has been very real. More importantly, it will
grow even more pronounced in the near future.

If nothing else, one should know one's enemy.


A trivial fact: technologies don't spring into bright bloom instantly.
Usually, the TNG wonder gadgetry lurks in industry/academia
labs, ogled suspiciously, for years, if not decades, before it
finally flowers fully.

So probably the next solution, to remedy problems which do not plague
us yet, is already out there. We are curious, naturally, so what might
its outlines?

Since hardware and software are tightly coupled, as two spent
swimmers, which do cling together, we can't expect too much
from the hardware sector too soon. Clearly, the era of monolithic
monoprocessor machines is drawing to an end. Oh yes, I know
that has been heralded for years. To no effect. But the SMP
business is now quite there. As the infamous i80xxx chip
line is but an artefact of clever marketing, excellent products
solely, if judged using the "maximization of profits over time"
success metric, it won't last forever. Having tasted first fruits
of modern telecommunications, entertainment, and industrial
automation, we long for more.

I won't hazard a time-line, but...

Multithreading as bottom-up, PVM/MPI as top-down, monolithic
systems are starting to crumble, dispersing themselves over
threads, over CPUs, over nodes. DSPs with multiple CPUs on
die have appeared. TI's new TMSC6x family, with low complexity FLIW
cores, memory on die and links is pointing in the right direction.
Since core on die is a must (due to vastly better access time,
lack of bonding pads and associated silicon real estate and power
dissipation losses), yet chip yield must be excellent to make
the maspar system affordable, node complexity will be low. This
is even more stringent for wafer scale integration (WSI), which
will liberate us from vagarities of multilayered motherboards.
As integration densities will rise, clocks go up and signal
levels go down, geometrical constraints will start to bite. Ouch.
This means buses (lest they would spring all bonds of modesty
with their girth) will have to go the ways of all trash. Serial
short high-speed buses, first electronical, then optical,
will shuffle in their place. OS architecture will be forced
to the OOP nanokernel flavour. We will have virtual machines,
and JIT compilers. Since code density, due to small grain
size, will need to go up, we'll see a brief renaissance
of threaded code. Which will force fast context switches,
and a dedicated hardware on-die return stack. Rejoiceth,
ye Forth followers, for ye finest hour is at hand.

So your next desktop might feature hundreds of processors
(on one, or several motherwafers), interlinked by wafer-local
serial links, network routers/switches on-die. We will
have a modest RAID, linked by fiber optics, and possibly
even solid-state holographic memory. The thing will listen,
and speak. A DLP/DMD-like beamer device could be the output.
Augmented reality headup will accomplish the same much
cheaper, however. People won't turn and stare anymore, if
you don your designer wearable every morning. Who ever
selected "beam" from the Newton communication menu, knows
full well why Borgs have their photogenically blinking
semiconductor laser. It is so darn convenient. Besides,
intercepting a tightly focused face2face laser beam is
virtually impossible, while monitoring cellular traffic,
even if it all crypted garbage, is a piece of cake. Besides,
a NIR laser is also handy to light your way, a wearable CCD
camera assuming.

The same universal optical links could bind the local web.
Overlapping local web patches will spin internet++, the next
Big Thing. Matrix perversion will become a very serious problem,
whatever hardware protection schemes and virtual machines
will form our node-local firewalls. (A certain company, which
I will not name, has now a smart card developed, which will
house and run applications, written in virtual machine assembly.
To counteract possible perversion, both the specification and
the sources are kept secret. Ha-ha. As if one couldn't read
the bit pattern directly, with finite effort. Or simply run
a crashme. (Uh-oh, my wallet has crashed. I'm broke.) I'd
like to see that virtual machine which will terminate
randomly generated code cleanly).

Sounds neat, eh? Of course it's all wrong.

For one, I didn't mention reconfigurable hardware. Back in the
1987, a need for virtual hardware has been already obvious. Now
EHW, evolvable hardware, evolving mindlessly, promises to deliver
fuzzy solutions to our succinct specifications. So reconfigurable
hardware will start gaining a progressively prominent piece of
silicon real estate. However, EHW is not enough. Darwinian
bricolage does not work well (heck, not at all) on brittle
systems, and logic gate assemblies, sadly, bristle with
brittleness. So we need a different paradigm, as, while our
sensorics is excellent, and motorics adequate, the processing
prowess is simply nonexistant. Our hardware must form a cozy
container for a tasty bitsoup, swirling madly in its GA dance,
mapping sensoric vector to the motorics one. This soup must
not be brittle. This soup must run on a monster of a hardware,
featuring gigantic integration densities, ridiculous numbers
of identical elements, an atomic hardware simplicity which
is trivial beyond belief. Virtual hardware will mend.

What for?

We need cleaning robots, both for the flat, the street, and
the PV array. We need nannybots, to cater for the sick and
the elderly. We need heavy-duty machines which will prospect and
mine, and delicate agribots, which can pluck a fruit fly from flight.
We need realtime neural compression, and decompression. We need
systems, producing solutions, to our specifications, on time.
Like yesterday. We need surplus neural performance and bandwidth,
to be skimmed from the web as the daylight load flood passes on,
leaving nocturnal low load tide, to be thrown at problems at hand.
Like, building even better mousetraps. To catch your molecular
switch, and the bit of string.

Why are we working at making ourselves obsolete, and so hard?
I don't know. Probably, it's simple self-destruction. Don't
judge the neo-Luddites so hard. Sooner, or later, we all will
face _personal_ white-collar unemployment. Inasmuch ubiquitous
welfare is compatible with free markets is open to doubt. What
is not open to doubt, is that a closed autoreplication loop
does not need flesh to operate. By then, you either are a
integral part of the machine, or, obsolete.

And we all know what happens to low-fitness species. Rapid extinction.
So root hog, and/or die.

I may have a different definition of 'friend' than other persons, but 
I take it fairly seriously.  Friends support each other and provide a 
haven from the stresses of the world.  It's not easy to find persons 
that will truly accept you for who you are, not for who they want you to 
be, and so I don't actively pursue having large numbers of friends, 
preferring to enjoy the time spent with the wonderful ones I have found.  
There is always room for more, however, and the prospect of acquiring 
another good friend in the future is to me one of the joys of life.

So what's so fabulous about it ? Fill in the blanks in my chart:

..Elastic Strength (stress_max)(in tension)
150 Gpa  ("Buckyfiber")(Is this right ?)

[[Buckyfiber appears to have two to threee times the tensile strength 
of

be
true, right?).]]

Density

Perhaps it would be easier to lay down stuff on the inner surface, 
allowing
the radial acceleration (the imaginary "centrifugal force") to hold the
loose fibers in place for a while, until we glue them down.

[Not a bad idea.]]

If the end of the strand comes off the spool too soon, or the strand 
breaks...
A loose strand on the outer surface of that rotating cylinder ... would
unwind, getting longer and more dangerous by the second.

Makes for good drama :-/.

[[Another reason to build two cylinders side-by-side. Also, these 
fibers are envisioned
as being wound on as a multiple set, and at an angle. If one breaks, it

entangled by the others next to it and brought down.]]
..

I think that 1980's technology "graphite-fiber" pressure cylinders use 
the
optimum 26.6 degrees. If I knew the ("floor-level") air pressure, wall
thickness, and desired floor pseudo-gravity I think I could calculate 
the
optimum angle (between 0 and 26.6 degrees).

[[Sure- first you have to calculate the atmosphere load on the ends, 
and 
some average hoop load. The 10 degrees is just a punt.]]

So, I could place my own personal communication satellites about 200 Km
"up", and they would just stay there ?
Interesting that there is *nothing* at the axis, it truly is an 
imaginary line.
I like this. It allows you to build a spacedock in the exact center of 
the
vessel, well-protected, from which you can either (a) push off and exit 
the
station through either end, or (b) ride the elevators down to the 
surface
for some heavy time.

[[Just so.]]

>   That was a lot of work, but what is a World worth?

I liked your article.

[[I'm glad you enjoy it!]]

You might mention the 3 ways to get light to the plants;
(a) direct sunlight through the hole in the ends (doesn't work for
extremely long cylinders)
(b) direct sunlight through transparent sectors in the cylinder (the
transparent sectors obviously let light in through the holes in a "net" 
of
filaments, with no slag attached to those sectors ... there are many
variants; one of them is that the sunlight filters through the layer of
atmosphere twice, once on the transparent side and once on the farmland
side).
(c) big light generators on the inside. This gives the best radiation
shielding to the plants. The energy presumably comes from solar cells 
while
near a star, nuclear energy while traveling between stars.

[[I might, but space and time limitations in the article may not permit 
this.
 There is a drawing that goes with this piece that shows these 
things.]]

Also, the maximum stresses (due to rotation) are on the outside. If 
this
"slag" is less strong than the carbon fiber, it will flake off when the
cylinder is brought up to speed. Very dangerous to ships in the area.

[[The slag (this term is a holdover from when we made space habitats 
out 
of metal) is subject to one gravity directed radially out. A little 
fiber
reinforcement should suffice to hold it in place. Consider that it 
deforms
 plastically to relieve hoop stress.]]

I've heard an interesting study in which it was claimed that, in some
cases, *no* shielding was better than any reasonable amount of 
shielding.
The argument was that, with no shielding, a high-energy cosmic ray 
would
hit and utterly destroy one DNA molecule in an organism. However, with
"small" amounts of shielding, the high-energy cosmic ray would hit the
shield and generate lots and lots of low-energy particles, which would
spread out and damage many, many cells of the organism. The authors 
argued
that the amount of shielding which would be thick enough to catch all 
these
low-energy particles was totally unreasonable.

[[Yes, a little shielding is worse than none for the above reason. The 
author may
have been referring to spacecraft rather than non-propelled structures. 
Many long
duration mission proposals use a small "storm shelter" for solar storms 
consisting 
of a meter or two of material. I *think* 6 meters of stuff is adequate 
against the
lower energy flux.]]

I think the speed of sound is irrelevant.

[[For pertubation analyses. I was not familiar with casting the 
performance
in terms of tangential velocity, and thought Carl was referring to 
perturbations.]]

A 1.0 Mm radius, 1 gee spacecraft has a v = sqrt(a*r) = 3.13 Km/s (well
under v_max), so your numbers look physically possible (although the 
safety
factor looks kind of small, less than 2).

[[Oops. I had the slag turned off when I did the safety factor. Guess 
you
don't want me designing your house eh?]]

Obviously if the ends are vented to space, the axis is in a vacuum -- 
but I
keep thinking that if we sealed up the ends (or the tube was very 
long), we
would have (significant) atmosphere at the axis. Perhaps my intuition 
is
leading me astray.

[[What would keep it there?

Buckyballs and bucky tubes are chemically more diamond-like than anything.
The distinction between diamond and graphite is not the shape of the
crystal/molecular structure, but the bond hybridization between atoms.
Diamond is pure sp3 while pure graphite is sp2.  Bucky-* allotropes are
composed of sp3 type bonds like diamond, but have dangling single bonds
which allow the carbon atoms to connect in a fashion similar to sp2 carbon
structures.  The major bonus in all this, especially in the case of
buckytubes, is that you get all the flexibility of a planar allotrope, but
the strength and stability of sp3 bonds.  
Carbon atoms strongly resist conformations outside of their normal
tetrahedral bond distribution (sp3) which is the reason they don't normally
form planar surfaces that occur so frequently with sp2 hybridization.  Bucky
allotropes are larger-scale carbon structures that maintain enough curvature
to generate minimal stress on the sp3 bonds, while giving a chemical
appearance of a nearly planar structure.

Agreed. The writing of software has educational value. Looked should be at
activities that both have educational value, and take place outside of the
school environment. In order to increase a more realistic world view and
promote individualism (vs group mentality) early on. 

Maybe this is best done, by having an individual experience a lot of
different 'groups' troughout her/his educational process. Computer and
internet technology also show interesting possibilities for this. 

For auto-finances i also considered a merging of schools with public
libraries and commercial re-education facilities. Though this would surely
work early on, because of the already present knowledge, it would probably
not last long in a free market situation if implemented without an extra
income.

Does anyone have suggestions for good books on education reform ?

I began to think about how such a system could be implemented over the
existing Internet.  As I thought about it, I realized that through some
small changes in the protocol, Usenet already provides an ideal system
for implementing hypertext.  It already allows for coarse-grained
bi-directional linking through message identification in the header
file.  No article can be retracted from Usenet once it has been
submitted; your article has already covered the globe many times over by
the time anyone could have thought to suppress it.  Hypertext could be
implemented simply by tweaking the NNTP protocol to specify not only the
message id, but an exact byte range within the body, and by slightly
altering the "news:" URL to read individual articles within those byte
ranges.  From then on, instead of quoting an article, you'd add a line
in your post which referenced to "news:<messageid>/243-257."  It seems
almost too easy.

Yet there is a problem which I can't resolve.  I'm posting this here to
see if some Extropians can help me to think of an answer.

One of the most important inabilities in a hypertext system, according
to Drexler, is the inability to retract articles.  This allows for a new
and powerful mode of criticism which was impossible before hypertext.
Did you notice someone contradict something they said long before?  No
problem:  simply reference their original article along with their most
recent post in your criticism.  Now, whenever someone reads the
offending post, they will ALSO see a link to your criticism and the
article stating the opposite.  Permanent back-linking is also important
to historians and other social scientists who are interested in studying
a particular point in time, be it last week or five decades ago.

Unfortunately, as far as I can see, "permanent" and "decentralized"
don't seem to fit together.  In Usenet, there's no guarantee that you'll
find the post which you read last week; say nothing of decades ago. 
Nonetheless, the permanent archiving of at least SOME of this
information is useful and important.  How, then, can this issue be
resolved?  Who would pay for a system to archive Usenet forever?

Drexler and other hypertext proponents suggest a royalty system, where
each time someone reads the text, the reader would pay the author and
archiver.  Unfortunately, implementing a system like this seems
unfeasible and even undesirable, as it is antithetical to the idea that
"information wants to be free."  Royalties try to restrict the
transmission of information and assign legally binding (read: government
enforced) monopolies on content.  Royalties will not and should not
stand up in the face of the Internet, IMHO.

Individual authors cannot pay for their data forever.  Eventually (if
not immediately) it would become unprofitable to pay for their
unretractable articles.  Besides, what happens when authors go bankrupt
or die?  Advertisers might pay for their data to be distributed, but
eventually they will want to stop paying for their advertisement.  What
happens to their content then?

How about at least charging one-time micropayments or subscription
charges for information storage and retrieval?  That would allow the
free market to take over.  Information traders could pay a one-time fee
for information and set competitive prices to distribute it.  People
could make a profit on their storage.  Surely a system like that could
last indefinitely, as there is no end of information and no end of
readers.

But what about the permanent public archive?  Most of USENET would be
profitless to store.  If you're just a guy out in California who noticed
that the president has flip-flopped on health care again, would anyone
pay you to write about that?  For that matter, would archivers even HAVE
a copy of the president's five-year-old health care press conference on
file?  Even if traders charged a great deal to store arcane materials,
there would be very few buyers interested in most of that stored data; a
cost-conscious information trader would wisely pitch the least used
material and keep only the most profitable.

The hypertext system must somehow remain public and permanent to allow
for this new and obviously desirable form of criticism.  Unfortunately,
no one will pay for such a permanent public archive, except perhaps the
government.  (I barely even want to consider this suggestion.  Like most
Extropians, I don't like government spending.)

At this point, I'm despairing that a permanent decentralized hypertext
system can work in a free society.  If it's permanent, then it all must
be stored somewhere, and it will never be cost-effective to do so.  If
it's decentralized, the system will drop unprofitable information and
may refuse to buy from most of the public.

Any ideas?

I dunno. Adamantane is diamondoid. Diamantane is diamondoid. Buckyballs,

Glossy black? What electrical conductivity?

I'd say the both are _very_ closely linked. Remember what happens,

Dear Max,

Yes, I would be delighted to receive the Exponet.  

I was a paid subscriber to Extropy Quarterly at one time, but I think that
either 1)  Exptropy has gone online and no longer provides hard copies, or 
2)  I was not billed and slipped through the crack for renewal to this
cutting edge magazine.

Anyway, here is my physical mailing address:

Mr. Rudi Hoffman
1249 Robbin Drive
Port Orange, FL 32119
904-788-3773


I am very interested in extropic ideas.  
BTW, I am a "card-carrying" Libertarian, signed up with ALCOR for cryonic
suspension, (went to ACT festival, in fact...it was great!), and 
a 100% skeptical, scientifically oriented superstition hating
athiest/agnostic.  

I am excited about our boundless future as a race, but we have some "figural"
mass mind paradigm shifts that must occur if we are to move "onward" and
"upward". 

I appreciate your efforts to do exactly this. 

Respectfully,

Rudi Hoffman

Here's how I did it.  My trusty chart of the 1958 ICAO Standard Atmosphere
says that about 10^-10 of the mass of the atmosphere is above 150 km.  I
assumed that all the air above that height was expanding freely horizontally
into vacuum, which would give it a velocity equal to the speed of sound, or
282 m/s at that altitude.  Thus, 10^-10 of the atmosphere disappears in a
time equal to the time required for sound to cross the width of the ring.
The rest is multiplication.  (hmmm... missed a factor of two there; should
be half the width of the ring, because it's spilling off both sides.) 

Obviously the dynamics of the gas is a little more complex than this.  But I
don't think I'm off by more than a small factor.

Child labor means, a force of underpaid, underaged, uneducated,  LABOR, ie:
mining, printshops, industrial factories, etc
It would not include, Mozart, Erkel or a software prodigy, or me selling
paintings at  age fourteen....
It is a history lesson in greed, poverty and human misery. But it is used,
like any ANY issue involving children ( it seems pople go soft in the head
when the word KIDS is involved and will vote for anything) as a *smoke
screen* for the anti-freedom antics of our giovernment, like the new fuss
about kids being perverted by free speech on the internet.  So it has become
a popular axe to grind with libertarians, and vice versa.

"Posthuman unbounded: artificial evolution and high-tech subcultures"
by Tiziana Terranova, in _FutureNatural_ (Routledge, London & NY NY, 1996,
ISBN 0-415-07014-7) talks about Extropians.

Terranova dwells earnestly on the contradictions in the transhumanist
position which she is going to point out, and at the end she angsts over
the contradictions she has pointed out, but in between I didn't find any
contradictions except to say that some transhumanists (Decoder) are
leftists, and some (us) are libertarians, and some (cyberpunks) are
pessimists, while some (us) are optimists.

She pretends objectivity, but shows her scorn for her subjects by
lovingly preserving every single typo captured from her sources and
highlighting them with a [sic].

She infers that transhumanism is male, with all the baggage that goes along
with that if you are feminist (male, linear, non-contextual, aggressive,
logical, non-holistic), because of an offhanded remark made by R.U.
Sirius in Mondo 2000, calling this whole talk-show-as-new-electronic-forum
thing as scary, "given the preponderance of bored housewives with nothing
better to do than get all twitchy over different people's sexual difference."
The lesson here is, and I am quite serious and not tongue-in-cheek,
if you are going to belittle any "generic person" in the pages of _Extropy_
or on this mailing list, make sure you belittle a generic man and not a
generic woman.  No one will mind, no one will insinuate or infer, if you
say something bad about an arbitrary man.

When she delves into the impact of the Internet etc. on society at large,
her language sinks into murky liberal jargon.
What she seems to be saying is that the Extropians don't care
that many people can't take advantage of these new technologies, not
because they're stupid or lazy, but because their culture socializes
them against it.  Any program to alter the foundations of our society
should include a program for including these people.

Actually I don't recommend the book _FutureNatural_.  This criticism
shouldn't be taken very seriously, since I have only glanced through the
book, and one of the articles ("An Interview with Satan", by Frank Dexter)
was quite interesting.  But it seems to be mostly a collection of

If I were to edit a book about the impact of technology on society, I would

were talking about versus people who knew what other people had said.

So perhaps are big recent leap was in social, not physical,

IAN: Ironically, it's the banning of cloning that will ensure
the worst possible scenarios.  The worst possible scenario is 
that only the State has the authority to conduct cloning, and
even worse, that it does so only undercover of secrecy.

That's exactly what will happen if cloning is banned. There's
no way the central cabal of CIA and mega-wealthy conspirators
that actually run/own the federal government are not going to 
exploit this science to their advantage, just as overwhelming 
evidence, which most people have never reviewed, confirms these 
very people are doing with the running of licit drugs and the
defacto monoploy given to them by drug prohibitons.  

Legal prohibition of cloning will be the ideal cover that will 
ensure the necessity for secrecy and the legal means by which 
to enforce a monopoly of cloning sciences for the super-mega 
wealthy cabal that actually owns the State.

It would be logical to predict that this very class will finance
the "grass roots" anti-cloning activists that will through political
lobby pressure no doubt succeed in turning cloning into a secret 
and suppressed science available only to the "secret State."

As much as I fear the possible negative outcomes of cloning,
only open and free access to technology can ensure the best
possible outcomes. Secrecy and suppression are the keys to
tyranny and atrocity.

Consider all the ways people define themselves which aren't in terms
of ideas: physical appearance, health, temperment, personality,
network of friends, hobbies, sports, abilities, status, profession, etc.
Even academics who deal with idea for a living more often define
themselves by their network of collegues, and their research ability. 
I discern lots of value in these people, and don't want to write them off.

You might as well chide people for taking on jobs that aren't what
they would do if they were independently wealthy.  Most of us aren't
so wealthy in friend-attracting features that we can insist on friends
who share most of their deepest values.  We're happy for you, but
realize we may not all be as rich as you. 

A great deal gets said about inequality in this world, and how we
aught to reduce it, but mostly its about monetary inequalities.  The
largest inequalities I see around me are other: who is attractive, who
is charasmatic, who is likeable, etc.  I'm not very sympathetic to
attractive likeable people who demand that monetary inequalities
be leveled, but who think of their kind of advantages as a natural right.

Most people are inarticulate about most of their opinions, and deeply
ignorant of most everything.  But that doesn't mean only simple
superstition is behind it.

I'd be interested to hear exactly what Rifkin and others offer as a

clone?  Should indentical twins be banned as well?

There is little strangeness, actually, we see a fresh hypervariable 
parasite adapting on a quite homogenous, mobile host substrate.  The same 
evolution process which makes it quite hard for host's immune system to 
"seek and destroy" the aggressor will select for progressively benign

   Norwescon is an annual science fiction convention held in Seattle,
March 27-30, 1997. Apparently 2 or 3 thousand people show up for this
over the course of the four days.
This year's 'Guests of Honor' include Robert Forward, Larry Niven,
and A. E. Van Vogt.
I am an invited speaker for several panels, readings and so forth, mostly
on 'nanotech in space', but also on whatever else I want to talk about.
One of the panels I'm on is "Realistic Interstellar Travel", along with 
Robert Forward  and Dana Andrews. Another is "Nanotech and the new
 look in SF", which may include some of my artwork from an upcoming
 video/book.

There is a fairly extensive  art show at this con; if you would like to
 submit art for this I can either give you the contact numbers, or contact
 them for you. I see a thread on >H/Extro art, but haven't been following it.

MESOPARTICLE BEAM PROPULSION
Copyright (c) 1997 Forrest Bishop, All Rights Reserved

Abstract
Between the proposals for particle beam and pellet stream spacecraft 
propulsion lies an immense, largely unexplored regime. Pushing a 
spacecraft using a collimated beam of mesoscopic particles, very 
roughly on the order o
f a nanogram mass each (plus or minus several orders of magnitude), 
presents new opportunities for high speed interplanetary manned 
transportation. This kind of beam can be tailored in velocity, mass 
flow, and beam profil
e parameters to fit the mission requirements. The first example of a 
mesoparticle accelerator the author is aware of is his 
"Starseed/Launcher" accelerator. By ganging many thousands of these 
devices together, several gra
ms per second can be fired in a nearly continuous, collimated matter 
beam, at speeds from a few meters per second, to a few percent of 
lightspeed. The receiver onboard the spacecraft may be as simple as a 
pusher plate. Tw
o novel mesoparticle accelerator designs are presented.

1.  Introduction
   Between the the mighty powerplants of the laser sailors and the 
gigantic accelerators for pellet stream propulsion lies an immense, 
largely unexplored, spaceflight regime. By using very many dust or 
smoke sized particl
es a high speed accelerator can be built that is quite a reasonable 
size, with a moderately proportioned electric powerplant. The problem 
of being able to maintain the collimation of this kind of force beam 
over large dist
ances is a difficult one, but probably solvable, especially if 
molecular nanotechnolgy is brought to bear. For high accelerations over 
short distances, picoradian beam collimation may not even be desirable.

THE INTERWORLD RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM
Copyright (c) 1997 Forrest Bishop, All Rights Reserved

Forrest Bishop
Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering, Seattle, Washington, USA
http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb

Abstract
    A Solar System-wide transportation system is proposed for freight 
and for spacecraft propulsion. A network of accelerator/decelerator 
stations in various positions around the Solar System pass 'Smart 
Pellets' and othe
r forms of matter and energy between each other, to planets and other 
bodies, and to spacecraft in transit. Stations at planets might be in 
high polar halo orbit, supported by planet-based accelerators, or in 
nominal HEO,
 HEEO, or forced orbits. Other 'relay stations' are in Solar free or 
forced orbits. The positions these relay stations take up is dependent 
upon the particular state of development of the entire Solar System, as 
well as t
he developmental state of the transportation network (IRTS) itself. 
Some examples of networks are shown, primarily between Earth, Mars, 
near-Earth asteroids, the main asteroid belt and the Jupiter system.
    By supplying fuel on demand to a spacecraft in transit, extremely 
fast and short manned interplanetary transfers are possible, a matter 
of a few weeks or days. The specific impulse of the spacecraft's rocket 
engine is
 not a critical factor. Three novel accelerator station designs are 
presented.

1. Introduction
    When humanity and its decendants colonize the Solar System, a need 
will arise for a transportation network analogous to current air, sea 
and land networks. Traffic between worlds, natural and artificial, 
implies such 
a system. Disassembling millions of comets and asteroids, mining and 
terraforming other worlds, building new worlds and shipping freight 
would be greatly facilitated by having 'service stations' extant to 
support these ac
tivities [Lewis, terraforming REFS].
    In this proposal, a network of 'relay stations' in various positions about the Solar System pass 'Smart Pellets' and particle, laser and maser beams between each other, to planets and other bodies, and to spacecraft i
n transit. Stations at planets might be in high polar halo orbit, supported by planet-based accelerators [Bishop], or in nominal High Planet Orbit (HPO), Low Planet Orbit (LPO) or High Elliptic Planet Orbit (HEPO) [Bishop
]. Other relay stations are in Solar free or forced orbit. The positions these stations take up is dependent upon the particular state of development of the entire Solar System, as well as the developmental state of the t
ransportation system (IRTS) itself.
    By supplying propellant or fuel on demand to a spacecraft in transit, extremely fast and short manned interplanetary transfers are possible, a matter of a few weeks or days. 

1.1  Background
   The remote support of  interstellar spacecraft via pellet streams 
has been studied since the 1980's [Singer], and independently by this 
author [Bishop, 1982]. A later concept, the "Space Fountain" [REF], 
uses a circula
ting pellet stream on a planetary surface to support an installation in 
halo orbit, as well as its own launching apparatus. The "South Pole 
Accelerator" [Bishop, 1981] was proposed as a method of shipping 
material from Ea
rth to the Moon and to high orbit without having to support an 
intermediate halo installation. An accelerator in HEEO supplied by the 
South Pole Accelerator was studied as a means of supplying an 
interplanetary spacecraft
 [Bishop, 1982]. Coilguns, or "Mass Drivers" have been studied in some 
detail as a method of shipping material from the Lunar surface to L5 
and other points [O'Neill]. Laser and maser beams are proposed for 
remote heating
 of rocket propellant, and for pushing lightsails [Kantrowitz, Forward, 
Landis]. The "Spaceport" concept [Kingsbury] is an Earth orbit facility 
with some similarities to an IRTS planetary station. Neutral particle 
beams, 
suitably ionized near the target spacecraft, are proposed to react with 
magnetic sails [Nordley, Andrews].
    All of these concepts share the central ideas of separating power 
generation from spacecraft propulsion, and supplying the ship or colony 
from a large 'stationary' facility.

I must confess to being one who occasionally fussed about Boundless 
Expansion _if_ it meant 'pave it over', if it meant assuming 
everything in the cosmos was simply raw materials to be converted to 
our own mechanisms.  I don't think this attitude was ever implied by 
the Principles themselves, but could be derived from some other 
sources.  Anyway, if someone saw this ('pave it over') as an 
Extropians attitude and didn't like it, Boundless Improvement might 
still be interpreted as 'remake everything in our own image'.

If you want "extropianism for moderates" then maybe the term to use 
here is Boundless Exploration. Exploration *might* not have the 
imperialistic connotations of the other two terms; also, it preserves 
the acronym :-)

You may have hit on something here.  A lot of people behave rather
superstiously toward twins and larger multiples.  It leads me to guess:
part of the resistance to cloning is fear of loss of identity?

If you look at http://www.foresight.org/WebEnhance/, you can get info
on Drexler's group's current project to try to bring about something with
the flavor of his original proposal.  They are working with a system called
HyperG (aka HyperWave) which allows bidirectional linking and some other
capabilities.  I don't know how or if it deals with the retraction/revision
problem though.

The idea of using Usenet is interesting, although it's not clear to me that
the Usenet model of flooding the world with postings is going to survive.
The web approach of just linking your new data into existing structures seems
so much more efficient.

I'm surprised you didn't mention that, in fact, there are (so far)
permanent, (somewhat) decentralized sources of Usenet postings.
www.dejanews.com and www.altavista.digital.com are the two that I know
of off the top of my head, and I think there are others.  It used to be
that you could order CD-ROMs with all of Usenet for some date range,
but I don't know if that is still the case.  These outfits apparently
are able to fund themselves by means of advertising revenues.  The cost
isn't really that high given today's cheap storage.

So before getting all upset about this problem, consider whether the
existing vendors have already solved it "good enough".

Please don't take this as mean-spirited, but I can actually imagine

===(David Cary)===
I've heard an interesting study in which it was claimed that, in some
cases, *no* shielding was better than any reasonable amount of
shielding.  The argument was that, with no shielding, a high-energy
cosmic ray would hit and utterly destroy one DNA molecule in an
organism. However, with "small" amounts of shielding, the high-energy
cosmic ray would hit the shield and generate lots and lots of low-energy
particles, which would spread out and damage many, many cells of the
organism. The authors argued that the amount of shielding which would be
thick enough to catch all these low-energy particles was totally
unreasonable.
===

I've been reading O'Neill's _2081_ and _The High Frontier_.  He said
about 2 meters of outer crud would be necessary to block radiation.  You
need much less to block solar alpha particles and the like, but then the
high energy cosmics cause the above problem, so you end up with the
larger number.  (Actually, you don't need much to block normal solar
alphas, but those solar storms get nasty.)  It seems to me that a fair
depth of soil, plus heavy meteor shielding, should handle the radiation
problem anyway for colonies.  Getting around is a different problem; I
hope storms are short enough that one can wait them out.  

This looks like an incentive to have large manned ships.

Another thing is that the inner solar system is usually considered the
place to be for energy and communications.  But after reading O'Neill's
ideas for deep space colonies, basically involving a very large mirror,
it struck me that the outer system might be more desirable.  Or that the
biozone for habitats is wider and farther out than usually thought.
Because while energy is richer close to the sun, so is radiation.  _If_
large but thin mirrors aren't too unwieldy to make and maintain, then by
doubling your distance you need to quadruple your collectors but can cut
your shielding by 3/4, because the mirror _doesn't_ focus the radiation
-- if it did shielding wouldn't be a problem in the first place.  So
there should be some range where the mass of shielding saved makes up
for the mass of a larger mirror.

Of course shielding can be crud, whereas the mirror presuably has some
material requirements.  I don't know what they're usually thought to be
made of, though.  Ag?  Al?  Chromium?  Sheets of conducting graphitics?

I would like to make a claim on the Foresight Exchange online prediction

controversy.  Here is the proposal I made there a few days ago:

I'd be curious for the people arguing about HIV and AIDS here to say what
they think about the proposed claim.  Ideally I'd like it to be something
which would make proponents and opponents of the AIDS/HIV link strongly
disagree about its likelihood of coming true, while still allowing for
an unambiguous judgement within about a five year period.  (We have had
a lot of problems on FX with claims which turned out to be hard to judge.)

What do you think?  Could you give an (informal, off the cuff) estimate of
how likely you think the proposed claim is?  Suggestions for improvements
would be gratefully appreciated as well.  Thanks -

Hal

I was trying to give an example to a friend of the dangers of cloning.
I said, "Well, suppose Pamela Anderson or whoever the reigning supermodel
is could license out the rights to her genetic code.  Then parents might
make their daughters clones of Pamela Anderson, and you'd have millions
of cloned supermodels running about... um... Actually, that would be a

I don't know why you would assume that I would have an easier time 
than other people finding true friends.   My looks?  I made one of the 
closest friends of my life during the years spent recovering from a 
crippling accident, and believe me I wasn't pretty to look at then, 
or much fun to be with.  My personality?  Sure, I meet a lot of 
people socially, but most of them wouldn't accept my independence or 
outlook, so I don't pursue more than an acquaintence.  

The bottom line for me is that I would rather not have any friends than 
to have to pretend to be someone else to have one.  Oddly, once I 
made that decision, the search became easier.  Yes, I am rich, and I 
would be rich if I only had one friend in the world, because each 
friend is a treasure.  Treasure takes work to find, tho, and sometimes a 
sacrifice or two.  Treasure in abundance would have no real value.

I'd say *all* people are deeply ignorant of most everything.  There's just
way too much to know.  The problem is that most people do not realize the
depth of their ignorance and are unwilling to address it when emotions are at
stake.  Strong emotions on weak information are a recipe for disaster; if you
can't get information perhaps it's the best you can do, but in our society
you can often get a lot of information about anything you care about.

A proper approach for a reasonable person uninformed about cloning but afraid
of it would be to research what it means.  Fairly superficial research would
show that cloning is no big deal.

Another reasonable approach is to refer judgements to experts.  Unfortunately
many people accepted as ethical experts are from the religious field, and
such people often see no need to consider reality when making their
pronouncements.  After all, they do have a hotline to God, you know.  Just
ask them and they'll tell you.

Of course, if you think Pamela Anderson owes most of her looks to
genetics, you're either a Lamarckian or badly informed :)

Exactly. No government agent can be held accountable for his or her
actions if its his or her secret clone doing the dirty deeds while they
are ensconced in their office with plenty of witnesses to provide the
alibi.

Legal impact of cloning: having an alibi is no longer evidence of
innocence. Thus any one can say anything about you, and if they can
fabricate any evidence, you are screwed. Thus clones should be at least
serialized in their DNA. Every natural born or first generation
individual gets a 0 or 1 serial number, with every clone derivative
getting successive serial numbers. WHo wants the number of the beast?

Well, just as Gutenburg's press is credited with jump starting the
enlightenment, a stable community structure and inherited language would
allow for each generation to stand on the technological shoulders of its
predecessors, as a shamanistic class would develop a verbal history and
record of technology. The development of language allowed cooperation on
a tribal scale in many activities involving complex tool use with multi
stage resource processing, that could be remembered and passed on to
further generations for further improvement.

Been there, saw that.  This system covers backlinking, but it doesn't
answer the problem of permanent storage.  Whoever owns the server
determines how long the server will keep data before pitching it. 
Worse, this system doesn't appear to be easily scalable to the worldwide
database that we all would hope that hypertext would allow.

My Usenet idea could do everything this could, and it would be easier to
implement on a wide scale...  Just implementing that comparably
miniscule change in the "news:" URL would be enough to bring hypertext
to every Usenet reader in the world.  Yet both ideas neglect the issue
of a permanent database, and without a permanent database, hypertext
loses most of its utility.

Dan:

Let me approach this question from a different angle.  This is pretty 
much off the top of my head, and not a refined article.  However, 
this is an attempt share some of the questions that are going through 
my mind on this same issue, applied to audio/video.

DVD has hit the streets.  At lunch today, I went to Fry's Electronics 
in Palo Alto, and saw a DVD player showing a motion picture on a big 
screen Mitsubishi television.

The beauty of DVD is time-coding.  If you tell me to check out a 
segment of a movie (or song), you need only provide the byte range 
(sample range, time code range), and what *you* are referring to is 
what *I* will see, given that I have access to the content.

The next step is to make the physical medium completely transparent, 
so I don't care if the content is being delivered from DVD, video 
server, or thumbnail sized nano-archive of *ALL* pre-recorded media.  

The point is, the media content should have some kind of unique 
identifier, and the *medium* should be of no concern. 

If the content is educational, then the segments become 
"points-of-departure" for virtual classroom discussions, Q&A threads, 
translations to alternative vernaculars, languages, learning 
modalities, etc.

Because the storage and bandwidth requirements for this type of media 
are so much greater than for text alone, I think it's reasonable to 
assume that if we can develop a hypertext system that will work for 
these, then that same system will also work for the more "text" 
oriented verbal discussions.

So, I suggest skipping all the R&D of *text-based* systems, and 
jumping straight into designing systems that will work for 
entertainment and education.

Who will PROFIT from building this type of system?  Those who own 
content.  The publishing companies, music companies, film studios.  
Why?  Because they will be able to "repurpose" their archives.

You may want your hypertext for better, faster, more accurate 
scientific discussion.  I may want mine for better, faster, more 
stimulating education and entertainment.

Do Ted Turner, Gerald Levin, Michael Ovitz, etc. understand the 
technical requirements for these types of systems?  I would guess 
that they don't.  Do ADVERTISERS appreciate the benefits of these 
systems.  I'd guess that they do.  FINE-GRAINED PSYCHOGRAPHICS.  Such 
systems would enable the tracking of information preferences to the 
most subtle levels.

Unfortunately, ORIGINAL CONTENT may not hold it's value, since it 
will be particularly easy to imitate (paraphrase, whatever).  This 
may or may not be true.  However, the usage-tracking would seem to be 
something that will always have value, since it is so completely 
useful from a commercial standpoint.

My apologies.  I was unclear.  By diamond-like I was stating that bucky
allotropes were generally pure sp3.  They do not exhibit the crystalline
qualities of diamond.  The macro properties are very much a function of
the general structure with less regard to bond hybridization, but
chemically, diamond and bucky allotropes exhibit similar conformational
and energy characteristics.  The primary differences between diamond and
bucky allotropes is that bucky allotropes generally will have differences
based primarily on the lack of a crystalline lattice.  This will obviously
impact things such as optical properties.  Chemically they should be very
similar, although the reaction rates will vary significantly.

I am no expert on bucky allotropes, so my statements should be viewed as
educated guesses based exclusively on the fact that I am familiar with
their chemical structure.

I recently downloaded the RealVideo beta client and I must say it's
impressive. With this technology we have the potential to create a
Extropian News Network (ENN?) delivering all the breakthroughs in tech like
the awesome breakthroughs newsletter mailinglist which is delivered to my
mailbox every so often. People on 28.8 or higher connection speeds would be
able to recieve this video and we would be pioneers on the digital
frontier. If the history is accurate, RealVideo will become a standard just
as RealAudio became the standard for transmitting audio over the net. You
can download the Real Player which plays both RealAudio & RealVideo at
www.Realvideo.com or www.real.com. I say lets GO FOR IT!

There are several articles touching on this subject at:

http://www.almaden.ibm.com/journal/sj35-34.html

The article, "Media Banks: Entertainment and the Internet" is
specifically on this subject. All of these articles are from the IBM
Systems Journal Vol. 35, Nos. 3&4, 1996. This is the MIT Media Lab
edition.

It looks like IBM is putting every one of their journal articles online.
They are well worth reading.

WOW! Is this mailinglist actually beginning to develop a sense of humor?

I enjoyed tonight's episode because of the neato 3D graphics, the guest
appearance of Neil Stephenson (I loved Snow Crash) and the demonstration of
a fully functional metaverse w/avatars, good graphics, and realtime voice
to clear up the public & media's concept of virtual reality. I am intrigued
by the idea of having fuel offboard and beaming it to a flying craft of
sorts by microwave or laser. How much energy is lost in the process? I am
also highly skeptical about any vehicle at all based on solar or wind power
with the technology currently being so weak or expensive to manufacture.
Comeon, a commercial airline-type craft fueled by ion propulsion? It would
be too slow to be viable and did they even explain how you get it in the
air in the first place? I disliked how they had an image of an alien in the
opening because it labels the whole show for UFO fanatics and other
miscellaneous wierdos. Another thing i disliked was that antigravity device
that the Navy turned down due to saying it was an anomoly, that just says
crackpot written all over it. (And I know Mike Lorrey is going to fight me
on this statement). Another thing i had a problem with is that they didn't
go into either side of the teleportation problem, destructive vs
deconstruct/reconstruct teleportation. I for one will not want to travel
with destructive teleporation except for my body, I'd prefer nanites to
carry my brain or perhaps transport it through a miniature controlled
wormhole? I believe that an atom's physical location (although being
undetectable) is a vital element in transporting a living intelligent
object such as an individual. In other words, my atoms are mine. MINE!
MINE! MINE! I look forward to tomorrow's episode on Robotics. Does anyone
know what episodes Max & Natasha are in?

The Byterange scheme won't work in a hypermedia enviroment because the
media is so easily edited. There got to be some kind of TAG in the actual
text for any "include" system to work.

something like:
<QUOTE Name=Shortquote QuotedBy="http://name.domain/document.html">This is
what i wanna quote!!</QUOTE>

Unfortunately this means that the original sourcetekst has to be changed by
other people. That's probably a job for the server to do automatically. But
you would at least know who has quoted your tekst somewhere. Also the sites
quoting you could be made aware of any changes in the quotes, or removal of
the page alltogether.

You could then include the quote in your own documents with a tag like:

<INCLUDE>"http://anothername.anotherdomain/interrestingDocument.html(shortqu
ote)"</INCLUDE>

For it all to work there would have to be some kind of coorporation between
the HTML editor and the server. (You wouldn't be able to edit offline.) The
include tag could also be used to include whole documents without any
change in syntax.

It's a simple system but it should work.

Dear RavnStCrow (?),

In a message dated 97-03-03 09:42:19 EST, you write:

Or more accurately you copied part of my post...

  BTW, I am a "card-carrying" Libertarian, signed up with ALCOR for cryonic

Thanks for question/observation (?).  No, I would not say that I am
"officially" anything!:) 
I certainly would not want a lot of wonderful and skeptical people who do not
happen to share my views on cryonic suspension or religion to think they are
"Outside" of extropian ideas.  Or will be kicked out of the party! :)

I like the orientation that Extropy has in a number of areas.  Including the
pretty clear cut fact, IMHO, that most progress we as a race have made has
been a result of increasing technology.  Not new versions of old
superstitions called religions.

Which does not mean there are not some wonderful, kind, thoughtful people
deeply involved in all sorts of religions.  I just happen to believe that
they would be "good" people anyway.  They are basically decent, in other
words, *despite* their particular brand of superstition, not *because* of it.

I could be wrong.  I have been wrong about a bunch of things in the past, and
it has toned down my natural arrogance a bit!:)

Onwards and Upwards,

Rudi

I agree, but the sad fact is, most people think that we are sort of incapable
of rational actions, never mind being good... I have watched grown men sit
and say that the only reason we don't commit mayhem on a regular basis is
because we have something to fear ( God's wrath ) and/or that we have been
ordered from on high, by a devine source...

Anyway, thanks for responding in an intelligent way to my joking about
definitions, there has been some attempts lately to "redefine" extropy... in
sometimes  bizarre ways...

Not that your statement was bizarre in anyway-  your 4 things, atheist,
 skeptic, cryonics ( life extension) and Libertarianism, are pretty much
Extropic staples, I guess...

Sorry about the super-long URL.  

Try this:  Go to ALTAVISTA Advanced Query at:

     http://altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=aq

In the top form entry box, type:

     "Ted Turner" AND "Gerald Levin" AND "Michael Ovitz"

This will pull up some articles about how just a few media moguls
largely control the direction of the industry.  This is probably no
surprise to most, so it's amazing that proposals aren't written
*directly* to these players.

Levin is CEO of TIME WARNER, Ovitz is CEO of Disney.  Michael Milken
comes up a lot in similar articles.  Milken has been active and visible
in the most recent "WAR ON CANCER" campaigns.  I respect his ability to
push technologies that will accelerate R&D, hypertext being one of them.

These folks are unbelievable influence.  A hypermedia business model
that is presented in terms these guys can understand is much more likely
to be implemented than something comprehensible only to academia.

I hope that the DVD people don't make the mistake of mass-producing
DVD's without embedded identifiers on the discs.  

Can ANYBODY use UPC/ISBN databases, or are these proprietary?

Perhaps another universal coding scheme could be adopted that is
intended to be available to the general public.

You need to take out the carriage returns and excess spaces from the URL 
pasted into the message.  Netscape 1.X would automatically clean this up 
on the Macintosh along with QuickMail Express and QuickMail Pro from CE 
software also have automatic fixes in Macintosh and Windows for TCP/IP 
POP e-mail systems.  Netscape 3.X and who knows if Netscape 4.X will 
handle long URL(s) with embedded spaces and carriage returns like the 
old versions did so elegantly.

This is over wrapped and will fail Netscape 3.X without manual intervention:

     /query?pg=aq&what=web&fmt=.&q=%22T

For what it's worth, Ovitz is no longer with Disney (or maybe he's 
still in his 'buyout period'); anyway, as they say, he's 'in play' :)

Michael Lorrey mentioned he had lost some bookmarks. There is a 
collection of about 500 categorized web links at:

The links are not comprehensive in any sense. The guiding methodology for
acquisition was serendipity. The categories "Extropy and Transhumanism"
and "Molecular Nanotechnology" may be relevant to your request.
The link to the Extropian Web site of Eric Watt Forste at:

Perhaps it has moved?

I'm not sure that would work.  Fingerprints would still be different. 
Also, the make-up required to make a clone look 30+ years older could be
detectable.  Besides, why would someone need a clone to do their dirty work
when they could simply have a lackey do it?  If you want to go into
behavorial genetics (something which I am skeptical about, but is an
interesting point here) might the clone want to keep his hands clean as
well?  I don't think anyone is going to be able to do anything with a clone
that they would not be able to do with fanatical followers and look alikes.

As usual, I have more ideas and opinions than free time to write
them all down, but this present discussion of the pitfalls of the
present design of hypertext systems brings up an issue I've been
meaning to tackle in better detail, so I'll take a first pass now.
The problem with creating the ideal hypertext system we imagine is
not a technical one of backlinks and permanent storage, but a legal
one: eliminate copyrights, and you eliminate the problem.

First, the very idea of back-links is unworkable and must be
abandoned.  Information providers want to, and have every right to,
control precisely what they present to the consumer, down to the
last pixel.  Freedom of speech is an inviolate human right.  As
much as we might like to have all speakers subject themselves to
critical review, there's no way we can force them.  The problem, then,
is that if you want to express a refutation of an expressed point of
view, how do you reference it? 

...The Vision

Simple: include a snapshot of the other text in yours.  No need to
worry that the other site might change, or that they may move; just
copy those bytes onto your server and you're done.  He can then copy
your bytes onto his server for counter-rebuttal, and so on.  Everybody
gets to say everything he wants, counter every point made by the
others, and each presents it all exactly the way he wants.  Since the
providers are each using only their own resources, they are not
dependent in any way on the other sites, or other parts of the net.
Each has complete individual freedom and individual responsibility.

How does the consumer find these refutations?  That's easy: because
he /wants/ to find them, they are valuable.  Consumer attention is a
precious commodity, as the experience of traditional media should have
taught us.  Information providers will find means to advertise their
information to the consumers who want it, because it will pay them to
do so.  Whatever mechanism the market demands--whether it be search
engines, push-channels, ordered indexes--that will be what the market
provides.  The individual info-merchant is still free to reject the
standards if he wants, and free to tailor his presentation, but he is
still bound by the supply and demand of consumer attention.

The more and more people who produce information, the more valuable
becomes /selection/, /evaluation/, and /collection/ of the kinds of
information the consumer wants.  That will be the hot-ticket item in
the information economy: not the information itself, but the work of
collecting it, sorting it, and bringing consumer attention to it.
Those who are best at collecting the kind of information I want will
get more if my attention, and will therefore be more profitable.  The
exact details of how the consumer will sell his attention aren't that
critical: advertising is certainly the most obvious, but direct
sponsorship of information selectors is another.  The TV medium uses
both models well.  Broadcasts are paid by advertisers, specialty
cable channels by subscribers who want specially selected programs.
There is no reason to think both models won't work on the Net.  For
general searching, I'll settle for free sites like Yahoo! with ads.
For more detailed information, I might want to subscribe to a service
that provides special content, reviews, etc.

...The Catch

What prevents all the info-selectors from using all the information
from any source they can find is copyright law: the idea that if you
didn't "create" the information (leaving alone for the moment what 
that means, exactly), you can't present it, even if you make no claim
to have created it.  You can't modify it, translate it, change media,
add commentary to it, or do anything else (other than the extremely
limited "fair use") without the "creator"'s permission.  Those who
"create" information (I'll leave off the scare quotes from now on, but
don't assume that I have conceded that info creator is an objectively
definable thing) have complete control of it, even its manifestation
in other minds or other media.

It is not legal, therefore, to copy an essay onto your server for the
purpose of refuting it; you must instead reference it by pointing to
the author's chosen means of presentation.  If the author chooses only
to sell paper, then you cannot put his words online.  If he chooses not
to link back to you, then your link to him will be one way only.  In
any case, your ability to make your point about his words is crippled.

...The Excuses

Copyrights are justified by claiming that authors would have no
financial incentive to create works without it.  They create the
legal category of "intellectual property", and treat the use of
information like the use of real property.

It is true that "property rights" are a man-made concept, and the
concept can be applied to intangible things like names, contractual
privileges, etc.  But the concept was created for dealing with a
concrete, objective fact of existence: scarcity.  If I "use", say,
an apple, I have thereby prevented anyone else from using that
apple.  An idea, say, "apples are edible", is different.  If I use
this idea, I in no way prevent others from using it.  Likewise, if
I choose to give my neighbor this idea, I still have every bit of it
that I had before I gave it to him.  If I give him a real apple, I
no longer have it.  Names and privilege /are/ scarce: if I knowingly
use my neighbor's good name to defraud another, I have materially
harmed his ability to use that same name, by damaging the trust he
has established with others.  If I give a privilege--say concert
tickets--to another, I can no longer go.  But information itself is
not scarce in this way.

Because there is this real, objective difference between physical
property and ideas, our use of the concept of property rights on one
does not necessarily imply that they should be used for the other--
especially since the motivation for the creation of property rights
is precisely that difference--scarcity.  Yet still, the rhetoric of
itellectual property still uses real property words: presenting
someone else's information--even with full credit--is called "theft",
because we have defined it as such. 

There is a sense in which intellectual property does protect a
scarce commodity, but it is not the ideas themselves, but rather the
market for them.  If Fred writes a book, and John copies it and sells
the copy (honestly, i.e. without claiming that it is original), then
the market for Fred is reduced.  But this is precisely analagous to
real property, for which we deny protection: if John sells apples
from his orchard, he reduces the market for Fred's apples, but we do
not grant either of them a legal monopoly just because he planted the
first tree or made the first claim to the market.  We only protect
Fred's and John's individual capacity to produce--not their capacity
to sell--because that reduces competition and leads to an inefficient
market.  Yet somehow we think Fred "deserves" his monopoly on the
sale of his book, but not the sale of his apples.

...The Refutations

In a world without copyrights, Fred still has many ways to take
advantage of the marketplace without our handing him a monopoly from
day one.  (1) He will be first to market.  This is a tremendous
advantage to any product in any industry, and because Fred continues
to write, /every/ book he writes will be first to market. (2) He has
sole right to his good name and consumer attention.  He can charge
for autographs of his book, or charge for the privilege of answering
questions about it, or joining a mailing list on it, and only he can
sell "authorized" editions non-fraudulently. (3) He has his creative
mind and knowledge of the subject.  He can charge for appearances
and Q&A sessions; he can sell preview-privileges to future works; he
can sell his labor in adapting the book to other media (which he
would presumably be better at than anyone else); he can even sell 
his writing skill to adapt other works ("Mr. King, could you write me
a horror-movie screenplay for Gilligan's Island?").  (4) He can sell
his consumer attention to other info-sources ("Max More's best of the
net.").  (5) He can choose to withhold information, and only reveal
it to those who sign volutary non-disclosure agreements.  There are
probably many more.

Without copyrights, every author simply uses whatever information he
can get from any source; he doesn't need to bother with researching
legal minutiae and filling pages with credits.  Schools can run books
though the old Xerox instead of being extorted for $50 for Calculus
texts that haven't changed in decades.  Software would evolve faster
because everything could be reused (and distribution could still be
controlled by cryptography and contracts).

One might still object that even with the new methods of marketing
and the newly lowered costs, it still would not be enough incentive
for an author, or that it still seems immoral to sell another man's
ideas.  But isn't that the situation now?  Isn't every story built on
cultural foundations we can't possibly find all the sources of?  Why
is it that Hank Aaron has to keep hitting home runs to make money,
but the network who filmed #715 gets to keep making money on its one
piece of camera work for years into the future?  And why must we
encourage authors at the expense of others anyway?  Is an author
somehow more "noble" or more "valuable" than a bookbinder that we
deny the latter's right to earn an honest living for the benefit of
the former?  How is that different from any other subsidy?

Finally, in the hypertext world I imagined above, competition between
info selectors for consumer attention would probably be so fierce that
it would encourage them to seek authors that could create valuable
content faster than their competitors, making good authors more valuable
as both creators and as selectors.  They might even sign contracts
with their competitors to respect each other's "exclusives" for their
mutual benefit, thereby creating voluntary copyrights among themselves.

...Conclusion

I am convinced that copyrights are nothing but subsidies to authors,
based on nothing more objective than snobbery and convention, and that
an economy without them would be fairer, more efficient, and produce
/more/ creative output, not less.  It would also go a long way toward
solving the hypertext problem if there were no barriers to any
presenter arranging others' works in new media without legal barriers,
and if information presentation evolved an efficient market seperate
from the one for information creation.

More efficient, yes, but Usenet also has its subtle charms.  Most
notably, a decentralized flood is really the only way to prevent people
from retracting articles.  And, of course, when retracting articles is
impossible, Max M's point about editing isn't relevant anymore.  The
article with that message id will remain constant forever in an ideal
hypertext system, so referring to that message and its byte range will
always refer to the same data.

In regards to dejanews and altavista and other archives...  These are
good, but not good enough.  Ideally, the hypertext system would allow
us to move beyond the plaintext discussion of Usenet and into other
media.  Yet even today dejanews wouldn't even THINK of archiving a
binaries group.  Like a library, the hypertext system would have to
be able to deal not only with text but anything and everything which
computer technology might throw at it.  Is this possible?

Very true, and MIME already accomplishes this...  It doesn't matter
whether my Usenet is running off a DVD disk, a RAID drive or a punch
card so long as the data gets to my computer intact.  MIME will help me
to encode the data and will tell me what medium I'm running.  AND it's
already installed on almost every popular newsreader on the Internet.

Usenet is a text-based architecture, but it doesn't just contain text.
With MIME and other binary-text converters, Usenet has been retooled to
deal with all conceivable media...  And we can refer to these articles
by message id and byte range, especially if these articles are unique.

Really, the Usenet is already basically ready to take on hypertext.  It
already does the coarse-grained work by threading subjects together.
With very little effort, this threading could become fine-grained and
non-linear.  Both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer BOTH have
tools for reading news with links and binaries embedded in them.  The
framework is already laid out.

Certainly, this system has obvious benefits for almost everybody.  In
fact, your stimulating education and entertainment could almost emerge
straight from the current Usenet, were it more popular.  But the real
genius of hypertext emerges when the archive is permanent, and the
acquisition of data becomes a constantly expanding time capsule which
anyone can study from, contribute to, and look back on for guidance.

Heh.  No kidding.  Maybe I'm just talking up pipe dreams.  But I still
believe that hypertext is invaluable to the human race.  Is there
anything more we can do to bring it about completely?

2) STUPID: Example: Logic should only be used in trivial matters not in 
           matters of life and death, accordingly, 10 people getting killed 
           is NOT better than 10 thousand people getting killed because
           arithmetic is irrelevant to morality. 

3) EVIL: Example: If a man is suffering horribly and wishes to die we should
         do everything in our power to make certain that the man does NOT get
         his wish.

I don't have any use for ethicists, I already know that mass murder is wrong,
I don't think stupidity is a virtue, and if cruelty is ethical then I'm
unethical and proud of it.

I swore I included it in the message but anyways, just go to
www.realaudio.com and it will have a button link to download the new beta
4.0 Real Player. You need at least a 28.8 to play back good video or one of
the new 56k modems or equivelant connection for even better quality
playback. Be sure to play back the "buffered play" samples given on the
sample page and not the slideshow samples which are rather lame.

    SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 4, 1997--Nanogen Inc. Tuesday
announced that it has completed a private round of financing on its 
Series C Preferred Stock, raising $26.2 million.
          "We entered this round of financing expecting to raise about $15 
million," said Howard C. Birndorf, chairman and chief executive 
officer of Nanogen.  "The response to the offering greatly exceeded 
our expectations."
          The company was represented by Cowen & Company which acted as 
exclusive placement agent.
          "We were very pleased to assist Nanogen in connection with this 
highly successful offering," said George G. Montgomery, managing 
director of investment banking at Cowen.
          This latest round of financing brings the total venture capital 
funding raised by the company since its inception in 1993 to $39 
million.
          The investors participating in this round represent a broad range
of interests from the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan.  Major
investors included the existing investors, Birndorf Biotech, 
Enterprise Partners, InterWest Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & 
Byers and Sprout Group.  New investors include Elan Corporation plc, 
Oracle Strategic Partners, AIG, INVESCO, MDS Health Ventures, Vulcan 
Ventures, Techno Ventures and Integral Capital Partners, the lead 
investor.
          "We were pleased to have had the opportunity to act as the lead 
of such a diverse group of sophisticated investors,"  said John 
Powell, managing partner of Integral Capital Partners II, LP and 
Integral Capital Partners International III, L.P., two Integral 
Capital partnerships which specialize in investments in 
expansion-stage private companies and growth-stage companies in the 
information and life sciences industries.
          "We view the success of the financing and the diversity of 
interests represented in this financing as a further validation of 
Nanogen's technology," said Tina S. Nova, Ph.D., president and 
chief operating officer of Nanogen.  "We have made considerable 
technological progress over the past year.  This funding will provide
us with the flexibility to aggressively pursue our research and 
product development objectives in 1997 and beyond and to explore 
potential corporate partnerships from a position of strength."
          As a consequence of the financing, Nanogen also announced that it
has elected Thomas G. Lynch, executive vice president and chief 
financial officer of Elan Corp. plc to its board of directors, 
effective immediately.  Elan is a leading drug delivery and 
biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Ireland.  Lynch was 
elected following Elan's significant investment in the Series C round
of financing.  The addition of Lynch to the Nanogen board increases 
the number of directors to eight.
          "I am impressed by Nanogen's technology and have great respect 
for the company's management and scientific team,"  said Lynch.  "I 
look forward to assisting in shaping the future direction of the 
company."
          Since his appointment at Elan in 1993, Lynch has played an 
integral role in the evolution and growth of the company where he is 
responsible for, among other things, finance, treasury, strategic 
planning and corporate and investor relations.  He is also a member 
of the executive committee of Elan's board.  Prior to joining Elan, 
Lynch was a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick where he specialized in 
securities matters and business advisory and accounting services.  
Lynch is a graduate in economics from the Queen's University in 
Belfast and a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
Ireland.  He also serves as a director of Pembroke Capital Limited, 
Icon Limited, Axogen Limited and Warner Chilcott plc.
          "I am excited by the addition of Mr. Lynch, who brings a wealth 
of international business experience and financial acumen to our 
board," said Birndorf.  "His considerable experience in 
pharmaceutical management, coupled with his insight and creativity, 
will be instrumental in helping to lead Nanogen through critical 
stages of our corporate development.  He will also give us an 
international perspective which will help us prepare for future 
global relationships."
          Nanogen Inc. is a privately held company focused on the

I said:

>>1. Unlike conventional infectious diseases, including venereal diseases,
>>American/European AIDS is nonrandomly (90%) restricted to males, 
>>although no AIDS disease is male specific.

Steve Edwards, former virologist, said:

>The list above contains some inaccuracies--
>1)  AIDs is not at all male specific.  The over abundance of male cases in
>the U.S. is entirely due to....[snip]

If I'm being inaccurate in saying that males make up roughly 90% of
American and European AIDS cases, why do you feel it necessary to
explain the "over abundance of male cases"? Isn't that self-contradictory?

>From the statements that you make following that, I assume that you accept 
the statement that for over a decade roughly 9 out of 10 American AIDS
patients have been male, and that you explain this by arguing:

(a)>The over abundance of male cases in the U.S. is entirely due to its route 
   >of entry onto American soil via a homosexual community that was 
   >incredibly promiscuous

and that:

(b)>New cases of HIV infection not attributable to needles show a 
   >female dominant pattern

But I don't understand your statement that

>Aids is not at all male specific

in light of your very next sentence which seeks to explain WHY males make
up an "over abundance of AIDS cases in the US".  

Anyway, in regard to point (a) I would point out that viral AIDS should have 
long since entered into the general population just like all authentic infectious 
diseases, even if its point of entry 15 years ago was an incredibly promiscuous
gay flight attendant, as, I believe, the book The Band Played On speculates.
According to the hypothesis that AIDS is a sexually transmitted viral disease,
AIDS should have long equilibrated between the sexes-exactly as predicted by
AIDS establishment. The failure to leave specific risk groups in more than a
decade poses serious challenges to the virus hypothesis.

Additionally, your argument that AIDS has been restricted to males 
because the virus first got its foothold in the US in male homosexuals 
and has remained with homosexuals until recently is inconsistent 
with the following:

The U.S. Army [Burke, D.S., J.F. Brundage, M. Goldensaum,
M. Gardner, M. Peterson, R. Visintine, R. Redfield, and the
Walter Reed Retrovirus Research Group. Human immunodeficiency
virus infections in teenagers; seroprevalence among applicants for
the US military service. J.Am.Med.Ass. 263 (1990):2074-2077]
and the US Job Corps [St. Louis, M.E., G.A. Conway, C.R. Hayman,
C. Miller, L.R. Peterson, and T.J. Dondero. Human immunodefiency
virus infection in disadvantaged adolescents. J.Am.Med.Ass. 266
(1991): 2387-2391] report, based upon millions of tests, that HIV
has been equally distributed between the sexes among 17 to 21
year olds of the general population. 

This data predicts that among 17 to 24 year olds, AIDS risks should
be distributed equally between the sexes.  However the CDC documents
that 85% of the AIDS cases among 17 to 24 year olds were males
(CDC, 1992). 

HIV seems equally distributed between the sexes, yet males make up
almost 9 out of 10 AIDS cases. Paradoxical to the theory that HIV
causes AIDS.

As for (b) the recent increase in AIDS cases among non IV drug using 
women, in 1993 the CDC changed the definition of AIDS to include
cervical cancer in the list of indicator diseases.  This was the first
gender specific AIDS disease and it had the predictable result of
increasing the number of non IV drug-using women AIDS patients,
although they make up a very small % of total AIDS cases.

>2)  There is something strange about the latency period.

Agreed.  The basis for the 10 year latent period of the virus, which 
has a generation time of only 24 to 48 hours, is entirely unknown.  
There is no precedent for an infectious agent that causes primary 
diseases on average only 10 years after transfusion in adults and only 
after 2 years in children.  The diversity of these latent periods is 
inconsistent with one infectious agent and their magnitude is 
characteristic for diseases caused by chronic exposure to toxic substances.

>Nevertheless, the vast majority of HIV positive people eventually 
>die of opportunistic infection, a fact that needs explaining.  

About 38% of all AIDS diseases, i.e. dementia, wasting disease,
Kaposi's sarcoma, and lymphoma are neither caused by, nor necessarily
associated with, immunodeficiency [World Health Organization, 1992;
and CDC, 1992]. In these AIDS indicator diseases that
are not caused by immunodeficiency, HIV is not even present in the
diseased tissues, e.g., there is no trace of HIV in any Kaposi's sarcomas
[Salahuddin, S.K., S. Naecamura, P. Biberfeld, M.K. Kaplan, P.D.
Markham, L. Larsson, and R.C. Gallo.  Angiogenic properties of
Kaposi's sarcoma-derived cells after long-term culture in vitro. Science
242 (1988): 430-433] and there is no HIV in neurons of patients with 
dementia, because of the generic inability of retroviruses to infect 
nondividing cells like neurons.

>people eventually die ...a fact that needs explaining.  

>From its recognition in 1981, AIDS has been restricted in Europe and
America to patients from abnormal risk groups whose health had been
severely compromised prior to the onset of symptoms. About 60% of
AIDS patients in America are male homosexuals who have abused
psychoactive and aphrodisiac drugs (including nitrate inhalants),
about 33% are IV drug users and their children, 2% are transfusion
recipients, and 1% are hemophiliacs.  Only about 3% of American
AIDS patients are from "undetermined exposure categories". (CDC 1992)

It is argued that health risks associated with these groups, and not HIV,
is causing AIDS.  

HIV is correlated with AIDS because IV drug users who share needles, 
for example, are collecting viruses the way some people collect stamps.
The higher the consumption of unsterile drugs, the more accidentally
contaminating microbes will be accumulated. 

>3)  HIV, by itself, is not what kills you.  It only destroys your immune
>system.  Hence it is not odd that different risk groups should have
>different symptoms.

The existence of risk-group-specific AIDS-defining diseases in the absence 
of HIV challenges your assertion. Controlled studies indicate that the 
incidence of AIDS-defining diseases in IV drug users and in male 
homosexuals engaging in high-risk behavior and hemophiliacs 
is independent of HIV. Each health risk group has nonviral health risks
that are necessary and sufficient causes of AIDS 

>The AIDs infrastructure has at time been alarmist and overconfident of
>research claims.  It wants money thrown at it. Nevertheless,
>one should not throw out all the HIV/AIDs research 
>on that grounds.  

I don't.  I reject the theory that HIV causes AIDS on the grounds
that it violates so many established principles of virology.

>Duesberg can't be trusted... he's into publicity for it's own sake...

"Peter Duesberg has fought with courage and tenacity to drag
a reluctant scientific community back to AIDS sanity since
detecting falsehoods in the HIV story more than a decade ago.
His efforts have earned him much personal abuse, but may
ultimately save countless lives"
Neville Hodgkinson, editor, The London Sunday Times

Dr. Peter Duesberg's courage and his book Inventing the AIDS
Virus will save millions of lives.  He is not only one of the few
people in the world qualified enough to see through the scientific
'AIDS scam', but he is the only one who has sacrificed his
career to save the world from it."
Tony Brown, host of PBS's "Tony Brown's Journal"

Both these observers note the price that questioning the accepted
wisdom has taken on Duesbergs' career.  From having his
Outstanding Investigator Grant from the NIH canceled, to being
censored by the editor of Nature (John Maddox), and being insulted
("It's the virus, stupid" from Ho, current Time Magazine 'Man of the
Year'), Duesberg could have certainly chosen an easier path to
publicity.  I think he is a bit of a modern-day Galileo in that regard.

I've been thinking about this problem also.  If the government is wrong about
HIV=AIDS, and the news 'gets out', it may convince many people that the
whole concept of public health [which is based on the notion that a healthy
lifestyle is not just a matter of personal responsibility, but also a government
management imperative to be achieved with the tools of mass immunizations,
control of food and water supplies, aggressive family planning programs, 
expensive "wars" against cancer and AIDS, and regulating or restricting
access to alternative health therapies or dietary supplements] is flawed.

To some degree, the governments stand vis a vis medical marijuana
initiatives points up their resistance to the idea of giving up the 'nanny state'
idea.  As Inventing the AIDS Virus (pg 390) points out:

"On April 28th, less than a month after Duesberg's first paper on
the HIV question appeared in Cancer Research, the secretary of Health
and Human Services sent out a memo titled "MEDIA ALERT". 
Describing the situation created by Duesberg's paper, the staff member 
ominously noted that "the article apparently went through the normal
pre-publication process and should have been flagged at NIH." The
staffer than pointed out the threat to the government:

>This obviously has the potential to raise a lot of controversy
>(if this isn't the virus, how do we know the blood supply is safe?
>How do we know anything about transmission? How could you all
>be so stupid, and why should we ever believe you again?).."

Together with the sudden cancellations of Duesbergs appearances on
network news at the 11th hour, I conclude that the state has and will
marshaled considerable resources to keep that very story that you
predict from appearing.  You may be aware of the actions of John
Maddox, the editor of a publication you cite, Nature, to censor
Duesberg and others [J Maddox, "Has Duesberg a Right of Reply?"
Nature, 363 (1993): 109] However, I think that because the theory
that HIV=AIDS violates SO many established principles of virology
this challenge to the accepted dogma may and has bypassed the lack 
of major media attention through the internet and alternative press
back door [Many thinking people that I know don't watch the
nightly news anymore for anything other than a hoot]. 

So maybe by 2000 or 2001 the media you cite will get around
to acknowledging that many scientists question the governments
version of how AIDS is caused.  

Perhaps another indirect measure of public perception would be
the price of the stocks of Boroughs Welcome (sp?) and other
pervayors of toxic therapy on the financial futures exchanges.

I hope your prediction is born out.

1) AIDS is entering the general population.
2) It hasn't equilibrated as yet because of a) the long latency period,  b)
there are more male IV drug users than females, and c) it is still being
spread by male homosexuals.
3) Eventually it will equilibrate between the sexes. Be patient.

You seem to think that the US is the only country with an AIDs problem.  
AIDs is far more prevalent in Africa, where IV drugs are rarely used, and,
if you believe the Africans, homosexual behavior is less common.  In Africa,
AIDS is distributed equally between the sexes.  Ditto in Asia, where HIV and
AIDs cases are skyrocketing.

The latency period seems to differ with different sub-types of the virus, of
which there are at least six.  Parts of Africa have a latency period of
about two years.    Some persistent viruses can be dormant for years before
causing disease.   Herpes can cause disease only periodically even though
the patient is chronically infected.

Kaposi's sarcoma is almost non-existent in people with a functioning immune
system.  Similarly, most people don't get fungus growing on their lips and
tongue, but AIDs patients do.  This has to do with a broken immune system,
not with HIV infecting their lips. Neurons don't divide but other nervous
system cells, like glia, do.

That's exactly my assertion, that misfunction of the immune system makes it
much more likely that you will come down with and die from diseases specific
to your community.  Most people can fight off TB (the non-resistant variety)
with a little help from antibiotics, for instance.  AIDs patients have no
chance.  However, even an AIDs patient will not die from TB if he is not
exposed to it. Hence, each risk group will have its own constellation of
AIDs defining diseases.

I suspect that the situation is a little more complicated than simply HIV=AIDs.
Luc Montagnier, the real discoverer of HIV has proposed a model which
involves two components, with the other component not yet identified,
possibly some for of mycoplasma.  But that HIV is clearly implicated in the
worldwide AIDs epidemic, I have no doubt.

I said:

Steve Edwards, former virologist, said:

>You seem to think that the US is the only country with an AIDs problem.

I never said that. I have pointed out that males make up roughly 9 out 
of 10 of the American and European AIDS cases. Where did I say that
the US is the only country with an AIDS problem?

>AIDs is far more prevalent in Africa, where IV drugs are rarely used, and,
>if you believe the Africans, homosexual behavior is less common.  In Africa,
>AIDS is distributed equally between the sexes.  

If you look at global data, AIDS looks like different epidemics.

In the US and Europe AIDS is not evenly spread among the population, 
almost 90% of the patients being male. In Africa it is spread evenly among the 
population and the symptoms are completely different. 

If AIDS is caused by HIV, the ratio of infected to diseased carriers should 
be similar in different countries. In the US roughly 10% of 1 million HIV
positives have developed AIDS since 1985. However in Uganda only 0.8% 
of 1 million, and in Zaire only 0.15% of 3 million HIV positives have developed 
AIDS. This indicates that the AIDS risk of infected Americans is 10-65 fold 
higher than Africans. If AIDS	equaled opportunistic infections resulting  
from immunosupression, MORE, instead of less, AIDS per HIV carrier  
should occur in Africa vs the US.	

Also, all infected subjects should have the same risk of developing those  
AIDS diseases that are not associated with group or region specific  parasites. 
53% of American AIDS patients have pneumocystis pneumonia and  
13% candidiasis. 90% of the AIDS patients in Africa have slim disease,  
fever, diarrhea, and tuberculosis but not pneumonia or candidiasis,  
although the microbes that cause Pneumonia and candidiasis are 
ubiquitous  in humans, including Africans.

Rather than being reassured that the statistical anomalies 
(for an  infectious disease) of American AIDS can be averaged out with 
data from  other countries, I wonder if the categorically different 
epidemiology is a function of their different causes. After all,
a 50-50% distribution by sex vs a 90-10% distribution is as
different as night and day, epidemiologically.

In Africa, Duesberg identifies parasitic diseases, poor sanitation and 
malnutrition as the main causes of AIDS. In the US and Europe, he holds 
that toxic drugs or conventional clinical deficiencies and their treatments 
cause the indicator diseases of AIDS.

This hypothesis resolves many of the paradoxes of the virus-AIDS dogma. 
1)The difference in the epidemiology of African vs American AIDS.
2)The prevalence of AIDS in American males despite evidence that both 
males and females are equally infected by HIV.
3)The vastly different AIDS diseases are caused by different pathogens, 
pathogenic conditions and their treatments.
4)The fact that hemophiliacs have doubled their median age in the last 
10-15 years, while 75% of them have been infected with HIV  for almost 10 yrs.
4)The long and unpredictable latent periods between infection by HIV 
and specific AIDS diseases are the product of functually unrelated events: 
the pathogenic events necessary to reach an individual's threshold for 
AIDS diseases, and infection by the marker HIV.

>Some persistent viruses can be dormant for years before
>causing disease.   Herpes can cause disease only periodically even though
>the patient is chronically infected.

Herpes simplex virus can cause lesions even long after the first antibodies
against the virus have been produced. But this can only happen if the virus 
is reactivated because the origianl antibodies and anti-viral T-cells have 
dropped below a safe threshold level.  After reactivation the virus multiplies 
into large numbers just as in the original infection. 

But herpes produces the same lesions upon first infecting the body as it does
upon reactivation, and antibodies neutralize it both early and late. Herpes can
only recur because it hides in certain cells, waiting until some future 
opportunity when the host's immune function is temporarily reduced. Once
the immune system regains strength, the virus is again suppressed and the
sores disappear. 

When herpes is causing lesions it is active and abundent and found in the 
diseased tissues.  HIV, on the other hand, only infects a tiny % of the T-cells
while the immune system is being damaged. Herpes causes the
same symptoms upon first infecting the body and upon reactivation. 
HIV is alleged to kill its host only years after being neutralized, and even 
without reactivating. Thus herpes is an inappropriate model for HIV/AIDS.

Could this be more in-line with my thesis that the elite,
of which Clinton (CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg)
is a servant, would move to prohibit open access to cloning
technologies? They'll probably allow private research into
animal cloning, as the CIA allowed and even funded private
research on LSD, so as to accelerate the discovery process,
but as soon as they've got it nailed down, they'll slam the
door on freedom of self-replication and cloning technologies, 
reserving such only for the elite and their objectives:

        THE PHILIDELPHIA INQUIRER (03/5/97)

        Clinton limits study of cloning While backing animal 
        research, he banned federal dollars for study on
        humans. He urged private firms to agree. 

        WASHINGTON -- Warning against the temptation ``to play God,'' 
        President Clinton yesterday banned federal funding of human-
        cloning research and asked privately funded scientists to 
        halt such work until a national bioethics commission reviews 
        what he called ``troubling'' legal and ethical implications.  

        ``Each human life is unique, born of a miracle that reaches 
        beyond laboratory science,'' Clinton said during a brief 
        ceremony in the Oval Office, where he announced his executive 
        directive. ``I believe we must respect this profound gift and 
        resist the temptation to replicate ourselves.''

        The President's order, effective immediately, comes 10 days 
        after Scottish scientists reported they had cloned a sheep 
        named Dolly from adult cells and two days after researchers 
        in Oregon revealed they had bred a pair of rhesus monkeys 
        from cloned embryo cells. ...

Learning neural nets learn by a process of trial and error.  A new
link is added, or an existing link is weighted differently, or some 
similar change is made.  Then the net gets feedback and judges it's new 
connection accordingly.  The whole process takes place with no creativity 
involved.  A simple exanple is on the shelf at your local software store 
in the section labeled 'optical character recognition'.  
Thus, having an element of the set 'neural nets' without the characteristic
'creativity', I feel confident in stating that neural nets don't demand
creativity.
But then what is one to think about the fact that creativity does arise
in some neural nets, especially the more complicted ones?  So I called 
it an artifact.

And QM requested:
> ...define artifact

Off the top of my head: an artifact is something that appears from a 
system, but is not essential to its functioning.
I was surprised that some people took this term to be pejorative.  It was 
simply intended to be discriptive.  I readers prefer, I could substitute 
the phrase 'emergent behavior' without significantly changing the meaning.

Natasha's pre-quibble post continued:

Oops!  I got caught making assertions that I can't support.  How embarrasing!
I guess I just tapped into our cultural mythology about artists because it 
seemed convenient to confirm my ideas.  But I know of no study that
demonstrates the converse either.  I still suspect that it may be true.
Anybody got any hard data on this, pro or con?  [ Please hurry so KA can 
cancel her reservations :) ]

I stumbled to the conclusion mainly through my experience - both professional
and recreational - with neural nets on computers.  I have seen that allowing
a net to alter its pathways a little is part of its learning process, and
that sometimes this results in useful but unexpected constructions that can 
best be labeled 'creative'.  And I have further seen that too much altering
can result in behavior that can only be described as 'insane'.

The whole point of this post was to try to get a grip on the mechanism 
of creativity, not to offend artists.  I'll do some more thinking
and post more on it later.

Lets add a little controversy to this list again. (it's been kind of calm
lately ;-) )

I
Revolution (civil war) in Albania, because of a Pyramid system!

Do we blame it on the state ?, or could this be an error that somehow
slipped into our free market ideals ? I remember Russia having some similar
problems and social unrest, in a (stock market pyramid) case where it
wasn't supported by the state, a few years ago. 

It's nice to be more free to make a little money, but what's the difference
between the state taking it all away, or angry mobs pillaging your
bussiness every 5, 10, or 20 year interval ? 

Sorry to bring it up again, but i still feel a little insecure about
finding a fail-safe solution for these specific negative examples of free
market capitalism. 


II
And rational thinking in irrationalized systems:

Personally i don't aspire to become wealthy, as the more i work, the more i
work for the state and the less for myself. I am in the fortunate position,
where i have a part time job, (1 day a week) which pays enough per hour to
get by, and leaves me lots of time for individual development. Don't call
it lazyness, call it rational behaviour in states that have maximum income
tax scales of 60-70%, and where some have understood that time is our most
valuable possession. 

anyone care to comment ?

I'm not sure I see the necessity of preventing someone from changing
his posted information.  If he presents a weak argument, and then
withdraws it, haven't those who disagree accomplished their purpose?
How much more is gained by continuing to throw his earlier errors in
his face?  If the goal is to approach the truth, then there should be
nothing wrong with people evolving their publications in the face of
criticism.

I agree that for some purposes, like official documents, contracts, and
the like, a method is needed to hold them stably.  But for hypertext
publishing and debate, it seems counterproductive to try to keep people
from revising their work.

Pyramid schemes are usually considered fraud, not trade. Fraud is not
a distinguishing feature of capitalism, since it is just as common (if
not more so) under noncapitalistic systems. Free trade is the 
distinguishing trait of capitalism.

Ah, yes, the John Galt strategy, first popularized by Ayn Rand.

I have made no assumptions about why you are rich.  I only noted that
you are relatively rich.  I said nothing about pretending anything,
nor do I think friends whose values differ are any less "true"
friends.

This thread started when I lamented the fact that very few people I've
ever met identify themselves with their ideas as strongly as I do.  To
which you responded:

You would clearly be a very unhappy person had you not found friends
who share your values as closely as you think your friends do.  But
don't begrudge those of us with very ususual values the benefits of a
diversity of associatations gained from a tolerance of different values.

You give no background for this assertion at all, and I don't have
the time to go look up the details of every little civil war in some
corner of the globe.  Besides, even if I did, I'd just get some
reporter's opinion of the war, which is likely to be as biased as
yours.  So please fill in for us what you perceive as the relevant
facts: in what way do you claim the Albanian system is "capitalist",
in what way do you claim it "failed", and what evidence is there 
that this failure is a primary cause of its civil war?  Your only
detail here is to describe something as a "Pyramid system", which is
not the least bit capitalist.  Fraud is a crime in a free market.

What you aspire to is none of my business.  Make yourself happy.  But
when you vote into power a government that uses its guns to actively
prevent me from achieving what /I/ aspire to, at no detriment to you,

I imagine a fully evolved hypertext system replacing the court system.

It's really bogus when the judge says "the jury will disregard the last
statements."

This applies to hypertext, too.

I agree.  Why wouldn't I?  If you're presenting argument, the
identity of source is just a distraction.  Arguments must argue
content, not personality.  Therefore, when presenting a rebuttal to
a point of view, you must include the point of view /as it is/ to
reply.  If the source later changes his mind, that's fine; I don't
care.  Ideas matter more than who holds them.

Since most ideas will be attributed, it would be fair to ensure
that you included the dates of the quote, and perhaps commentary
that the opinion of the source has changed (especially if that
supports your point of view).  But you can't force anyone to say
or not say anything he damn well pleases.  And you especiall can't
expect any "active inclusion" of someone else's text to remain in
any consistent state, because you don't own it.  Copying to your
server is the only way to preserve your arguments.

Absolutely!  How could anything I said possibly be construed otherwise?
I am really at a loss to see how my words could produce your reaction.
I don't want to "keep people" from doing anything!  That's my whole point.
I utterly reject any attempt to restrict what anyone may say at any time
for any reason.  Period.  Do not tell me I claim otherwise.  It is
precisely because of that that in order to rebut a /point of view/--which
exists independently of the one expressing it--one must make sure that
the words are on your server, because you have to expect his to change
with time.  Whether or not you change your attributions, update your own
arguments to reflect his changes, etc. is entirely up to you, and what
he does on his server is entirely up to him.

...but often re-invented elsewhere, perhaps, as I'm using a similar
lifestyle (need to work more, though) and have never heard this
associated in any way with Ayn Rand's works.

Cool, I'm posting.  I wonder if I should be surprised by the total lack
of discussion (unless I'm forgetting something) of Frank Sulloway's work
on this or the transhuman lists.  I just read a review and interview in
_Skeptic_* last night and it seemed cool all over again.  I'd like to
read the book myself soon.  But one thing in the interview struck me:

*Volume 4 # 4 1996.  

Sulloway claimed that based on birth order, class, etc. Darwin would be
94+-6% likely to support a radical idea like evolution by natural
selection.  Assuming his numbers were accurate, that would leave at most
12% influence for genetic *and* uncontrolled environmental factors.

If his model is at all in the right ball park, the "nature vs. nurture"
debate may just have been resolved, at least for certain personality and
"emotional intelligence" traits.  If you can have that kind of
predictive accuracy based on environmental factors alone, I think
'nurture' trumps 'nature'.  Of course this would hit the "cloning"
brou-ha-ha as well.  (SJ Mercury's forum is going downhill.)  So many
reviews of Sulloway's work, so little mention of the implications, at
least that I've seen.  

Another point was the idea that France resisted Darwinism for longer
because it had already shifted to smaller families == fewer 'liberal'
laterborns to 'conservative' firstborns.  The rest of the West has
caught up, and may be becoming more conservative as a result.  Oddly
enough, if China keeps up "one child" it may become relatively more
radical, as only children apparently are less constrained.  (Yay!  Guess
what I am.)

Hmm.  Polygamous societies would be conservative -- lots of firstborns
(one per wife.)  Stable populations of high-tech mortals -- us -- are
conservative, with about one firstborn per laterborn.  Immortal, slowly
growing populations could retain looseness even if the adults themselves
didn't, through the only children.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

In Oct. '95 I posted to Extropians in praise of 
Strauss & Howe's '91 book "Generations" saying:

>I found this to be the most striking book about the future I've read
>since Engines of Creation.  The data presented in favor of their model
>seems substantial, though it is not quantitiative.  If correct, the
>future of society is much more predictable than I ever thought possible.

(I was then told Tim Starr had posted about it 6 months earlier.)

This year Strauss & Howe came out with a sequel, "The Fourth Turning",
endorsed by both Gore & Gingrich. (See:  http://www.fourthturning.com)

A good detailed review is:  http://pages.prodigy.com/VBDS39A/tft.htm

But let me quickly echo my earlier comments.  I consider myself to be
a grump with high standards: most outrageous ideas are junk, and I
hope that by being very selective in endorsing very few ideas, the few
endorsements I make (such as pro-cryonics) will be taken seriously.
So please listen when I say (and note how unusual this statement is): 

  STRAUSS & HOWE ARE RADICAL, IMPORTANT, AND PROBABLY MOSTLY RIGHT!

They give crucial insights into the next thirty years, crucial to
determining whether extropian-types will become scapegoats and
lightning rods in a new age of repression, or will become a core of
a new culture of freedom and possibilities.

Also, amazingly enough Strauss & Howe & the most of the people
attracted to them seem like relatively reasonable people; there are
few ideologues or demogogues among them.

The scariest part of the Cloning ban is that it was actually already in
place.  The national ethics board for Biotech research had already
placed restrictions on the use of federal funds for cloning research!

It would be nice if they would make more readily available what the
restrictions are from the ethics board, and all other federal
organizations that have the ability to place these restrictions on
>research!

Ho wait, i didn't mean to say fraud was inherent to capitalist systems. But
isn't relying on companies who commit fraud today on a daily basis, to
protect you from fraud when payed, a little naive ? 

The main concern i still have with a complete free market, stateless system
is social stability, which i believe is just as important for a growing
economy as a free market. Just thought a current example migth give more
insight in these matters. Guess it was a little too controversial ? ;-)

You called something a "Pyramid system", and then called it capitalist.
If you don't mean to imply that such a fraudulent scheme is capitalist,
then don't say so.  I must assume that you mean what you say; if you
don't, then there's no point arguing with you.

> isn't relying on companies who commit fraud today on a daily basis, to

I honestly don't have the slightest clue what you're trying to say here.
Tie this to reality for me: name names, give examples, show me what you
mean.  I'd really like to have an idea what's going on inside your head,
but these words don't help.

Robin,

Based on several months of reading your insightful and well-reasoned posts
let me say "I, for one, am listening!"

Thanks for the recommendation.

BLOOD, SCREENING FOR INFECTIOUS AGENTS
======================================

Date: Sat, 01 Mar 1997 11:44:27 -0800
From: CDPC-mail (Jim Chin) <jchin@cdpc.com>

March 1, 1997 - From the Lancet

When should blood banks begin to routinely screen for an infectious agent?

Molecular evidence has linked human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) with Kaposi's
sarcoma, and serological studies have shown that the virus occurs [also] in 
the healthy population.  However, Blackbourn and colleagues' recovery of
infectious HHV-8 from a healthy blood donor is the first evidence that the 
virus could be transmitted by blood transfusion (Lancet 1997; Vol 349, No. 
9052: 609-11).  Allain's commentary in the same issue of the Lancet (p 584) 
discusses the issues surrounding when, or if, screening of donated blood for 
newly discovered viruses should be introduced.  Once transmissibility has 
been established, the other important issues are whether the virus is found 
commonly, whether the infection persists, and whether the virus causes a 
serious disease (these criteria are fulfilled by hepatitis C virus, for 
example).  For HHV-8, the next step is confirmation that the virus is 
transmitted; the other questions can then be addressed.

I hear him talk five to seven years ago at Stanford, and thought it
was cool then; still do.  But there was a pretty negative review in
Science in the last month or so.

I think you must be assuming that most people are too conservative.
This isn't supported by Sulloway (nor contradicted).  Maybe such
populations would be too loose.

I admit a bias toward liberalism; more precisely, I consider myself
extremely receptive toward new and halfway plausible ideas, often
getting very excited over them.  For a few days, since I never do
anything with the ideas for some time, allowing criticism or lack of
sustainable interest to prevent silly things from happening.  And I
think this is a neat strategy.

But Sulloway's idea was that first France, and then the rest of the
West, became more conservative due to changes in family patterns.  And
that China might go out the other end.  Whatever one thinks of the
"right" amount of conservatism, or whether there is such a beast, the
idea that society's attitudes might change through this mechanism is
rather provocative.

I peeked at this book at the bookstore last weekend.  I skipped ahead to
the end, where they get down to the nitty gritty about what kinds of
changes we might see in the next 10 or 15 years.  They predict some
kind of significant social crisis shaking the country, leading to many
difficult years, eventually forging a stronger social consensus (to
greatly oversimplify).  The analogous point in the previous cycle was
WWII, a time of trouble and testing, followed by the Pax America years
of the late 40's through early 60's, with the introduction of TV, the
move to the suburbs, Father Knows Best, and all the other manifestations
of that confident period.

Some of their advise for weathering this storm did not fit well into
my own individualistic tendencies.  They advised becoming part of the
community, getting a reputation as someone who is good to know, someone
who helps out with local groups, etc.  Think of the people who got to
be in charge of the ration coupons during WWII.

This would not be an easy role for me to play!  I barely know my neighbors.
I hope that a more detailed look at the book will suggest some alternative
strategies.

Also, amazingly enough Strauss & Howe & the most of the people

I perused this book carefully during a pleasant evening at Barnes & Noble. 
Afterwards, I had one question:  why wasn't this book stacked in the
Astrology/New Age section of the store?  Most of the people I see attracted
to this section seem like relatively reasonable people, they would enjoy
reading about Hari Seldon's hot date with Gail Sheehy - psychohistory meets
psychobabble.

Books like this on historical cycles have as much validity as calculating
the positions of the planets when you are born, and then concocting
interesting generalized theories about what's going to happen next.  I'll
grant that the authors are a cut above the usual conjurer's tricks, they
use more sophisticated smoke & mirrors than Madame LaRue the Fortuneteller.
 Their market-targeted readers are the tried-and-true gullible aging
yuppies with the narcissistic urge to read about their life, have their
palms read and have money to waste.

The fallacy of analysis like this, is that you can start arbitrarily
anywhere in history, in any given year, and make historical facts fit
whatever cycle you choose, whether generational, sunspots, comet
appearances, meteor showers, radioactive decay, climatological, you name
it.  The Elliot Wave, the Kondratieff Cycle, business cycles in general
fall into this type of false prophecy.  The authors of this particular book
bend over backwards to mischaracterize historical events to include as
"evidence" of some magic cycle, but completely ignore major events that
fall outside of their "theory," hoping their readers had a good Outcome
Based Education in history to not know any better.

History is continuous, one year after another, no one year any different
than any other year, every year of equal length.  No year is to be given a
privileged position when starting a cyclical analysis.  There is no
"generation" identifiable anywhere except in relation to yourself and
yourself alone.  To arbitrarily assert otherwise is to commit a category
error in analysis, unless simply telling a non-analytical story, such as
"the Depression generation."  If history has any pattern at all, it might
be of a fractal nature, self-similarity on different geo-temporal scales of
periods of activity vs. quiescence.  I doubt anyone will ever make a
rigorous analytical case for it; too many variables, it's an open system,
not closed.

In writing this book, I have the feeling the authors consulted the highest
authority possible on their subject: P.T. Barnum.

I found this episode quite entertaining but they didn't meantion anything
about the lightsails riding solar wind or wormhole transportation except in
the last show regarding transportation itself. Also at the very end they
meantioned about some sort of algae living in antarctica as the likely
first candidate to live on Mars but they didn't go very indepth AT ALL!!
PLEASE tell me more information than I'd ever want to know about that
species of algae and what they have planned for it! Also I got a kick out
of what they said after the show during the credits telling you 'whats
next'. They said "If you're dreaming of the perfect home where every atom
is arranged perfectly and tastefully... you need help. In the meantime look
for helpful tips on our home show." hehe. Terraforming Mars is something
I've ALWAYS dreamed of seeing. So fill me in with more details on that
algae! Also I'm looking forward to seeing that episode on 'Immortality'
tomorrow nite and I'm wondering if thats the episode showing the
Extropians. Is it?

I don't think emotions are an artifact. Rather, I think they are an
evolving aspect of (trans)human intelligence. Also, they can be, and
often are, the driving force behind science and art. I think if one looks
at the evolutionary tree it becomes apparent that the ability of a species
to experience emotion is directly correlated with its intelligence. For
example bacteria and plants don't experience any emotions, and probably
neither do worms, insects etc.
Dogs and cats, on the other hand, at least in my experience, have the
capacity for primitive emotions such as fear and jealousy. I propose that 
Primates, elephants, dolphins etc. may experience the rudiments of love,
friendship etc. but I don't have any evidence for that. The multitude of
emotions that are experienced by humans could be refined and evolved
(per)mutations of the basic emotions that I have mentioned. For example a
sense of awe or wonder (possibly one of the latest emotions to evolve)
could have combined elements of curiosity, love, admiration and a little 
fear. 

Well, its an idea anyway.

There has been several pyramid scheme scandals in Eastern Europe since the
fall of the wall, I seem to remember a situation in Romania quite similar
to Albania a few years back. Pyramid schemes thrive in a situation where
people want money but don't understand economics, and outside forces do
not step in. The eastern european pyramid schemes does not appear to be
that much a free market phenomena, rather a result of the alliance between
organized crime and the old rulers, which in many cases were quite
involved in the schemes (If you can't rule them, you could at least take
their money). 

Overall, the unrest would have happened sooner or later, it needed some 
igniting spark. The interesting question we should ask is what igniting 
sparks that cause unrest in *our* societies...

I don't see a problem with this and being an individualist, and it is 
actually very good advice for making extropianism more reasonable to 
people - if you read about it in the newspapers, it is a weird cult, but 
your friend Hal is a decent chap with some good ideas. If we could be 
known as the local experts on the future and "big things", people might 
come to us to hear what this fuss about cloning or nanotech is.

Myself, I try to influence some minds in the local community. Every
wednesday I go to the local highschool where a teacher holds an "open
house" for the kids to build electronics and play with the computers (the
girls have just discovered IRC...). I sit there and talk about things with
them, helping them out or suggesting fun things to do. Yesterday I
explained memory and study techniques, the way the brain stores
information and how to optimize sleep patterns to some of them, with good
results. The fun thing is, that by trying to explain things you learn them
better yourself, give hope to the kids (I live in the quite "less than
fashionable" area Hagalund, and most of the kids are immigrant kids) and
spread transhuman memes to the people who will grow up.

"data" ... "not quantitative" is a contradiction.  Data are numbers.
Measurements.  Surveys.  Experimental results.  If you can't measure
it, there's no way to know whether your vague feeling of connectedness
is something real and testable, or if it's just the wanderings of a
random pattern-matching machine run amok, finding patterns caused by
pure chance and baselessly extrapolating them into the future.

Those who postulate explanations for any phenomenon--social, physical,
or any other--must have some means of stating precisely what their
explantion predicts, and then have some way of measuring the actual
result to test the prediction, or else their conjectures no more
falsifiable than theology, and don't qualify as knowledge.  If they
are simply describing things for artistic reasons, or pointing out
suggestive parallels, that's great; but if they are making actual
predictions of real events in a system with 5 billion degrees of
freedom, they'd better have more than a subjective feeling.

Drexler's books for the masses may not have had much raw data (there
certainly were some, but a lot less than one might expect in a more
academic paper), but Drexler himself did the math, and did it right.
Drexler knows precisely the speed of chemical reactions; the size of
DNA molecules; the amount of data in a complex computer program; the
size of the spaces between cells.  Without those real numbers, based
on real measurements of known phenomena, the idea of "incredibly small
machines that build things from atoms" would be nothing more than a
good science fiction hook.  The numbers make it real.

As of March 15, i will be occupied with a new part time job, besides
running my own business, which may leave me a little less time. I also feel
the personal need for a more general transhumanist approach.

I want to thank all of you for stimulating conversation and argument,

Which is how Max is regarded, and Anders obviously and many other key people!

I think it is very interesting to see this discussion on "helping out" or
"fitting in" "being someone who is good to know"
....in other words, socialized behavior -  which is quite different from
"socialism" In general, I think it is being eschewed in the effort to
maintain "individuality".... 

I have noticed that a certain percentage of transhumans and Extropians are
less than social butterflies.Perhaps even unwittingly in persuing the
"individualistic tendencies" coming off as unsocial, lacking in charisma, and
social grace. 

I have noticed this with groups of objectivists, Libertarians, cryonicists
too.  I see a definite trend towards nerdiness and social ineptitude. At
first I found it alarming, still do sometimes. Check out the clothing.... the
hairstyles.. 
(NOT ALL,MIND YOU!) I wonder whether this, coupled with the nonaltruistic
stance (often mistaken for a lack of love, compassion or empathy) gives
people the impression that this is not the group they want to "play with".

I wonder if the "individualist" (a well balanced, worldly individual who can
be in many situations) can be seen by others and not misunderstood.
Can this be done with just a LITTLE effort to make him/herself valuable to
others ...being social, looking good, speaking, giving classes, making
beautiful art...

I was interested to see the rave review of the TFT.  I'd heard reviews that
made it sound like uselessly loose jargon and hot air.  I'll give it a look.

In a similar vein, I'm thinking of picking up D. H. Fischer's most recent
work, on price inflation waves.  His 1989 work, ALBION'S SEED, qualifies as a
must-read on early US (and later) history.  Fischer's method:  use hoards of
grad students and massive amounts of research to generate texts rich in
numbers and illustrations.  From this solid base, offer falsifiable, modest,
and plausible predictions.

Fischer thus steers clear of mere fluff and conjecture, in general.  Can
anyone comment on his work on price inflation?  (I apologize that I haven't
the title at hand.)  I've heard good things about it from informed experts.

What percentage of companies commit fraud today on a daily basis?
Your implicit assertion is not only controversial and unsupported,
it's also vague. Even if it were "true" (and it's so vague that it
is, as Pauli might have said, not even wrong), how much of that
current fraud is a result of big business taking advantage of 
corruption and special advantages given them by the state? Eliminate
the state, and perhaps you'd eliminate most of that fraud. This
itself is vague, but it's all I can come up with to counter your
"argument". Vagueness gets vagueness, and specifics get specifics.

O.K., I name this: start in 1900, and make historical facts fit a 3.4

Then let's see how plausible folks here think your story it.

How do you ever walk into a new building and find room 225?  After
all, your eyes and ears aren't giving your numbers, so there is no

I have not read Fischer's work on inflationary cycles. I do know that, 
along with W. Erwin Diewert, Fischer is considered one of the masters 
of price and index-number theory.  His Fischer 'ideal' index for the 
cost of living is one of two functional forms (the other being 
Tornqvist's) known as 'superlative' indexes that effectively account 
for substitutions in the types and qualities of goods, services and 
technology when tracking some measure of their cost to society over 
time.

The Consumer and Producer Price Indexes produced by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics have no problem obtaining a good sample of costs for 
goods and services, the operational difficulty is in real-time 
tracking of the change in quantities sold over time.(*) As a 
historical researcher, Fischer has the advantage of working at a lag 
and analyzing changes in both price and quantity.

Mark Crosby

(*) Point-of-sale scanner data for consumer goods, as well as 
electronic-data-transfer (EDT) info for manufacturer materials orders, 
may eventually provide more of the quantitative data that would be 
needed to produce superlative indexes; but for now, most of this data 
remains proprietary.

There an interesting article on p1259 in the current (28Feb) Science
about why birth rates have been falling.  By looking at a quite pre
industrial society in Africe, researchers find that even these people
tend to have fewer kids when they get richer.  Thus they suspect that
this tendency is genetic, that passing wealth onto their kids once
helped our ancestors get more descendants in the long run.  If true,
this is cause for optimism.  Such a deep genetic tendency is unlikely
to get selected out before technlogical change makes it all moot.

Yes.  As a young nerd I was sure my social habits were the direct
application of fundamental principles I held dear regarding social
status, etc.  Now as an older nerd, I can see how insensitive and
self-absorbed I was.  There was real social injustice I was reacting
to, but that was not a good excuse.

Robin Hanson wrote about an article in the latest Science that 
suspects that the tendency to have fewer children when one is wealthy 
is genetic.

Now, I haven't read this article, and maybe I'm misinterpreting the 
theory, but, how is wealth something that could activate genetic 
parameters?  It seems to me that the simplest behavioral explanation 
would be that the bulk of wealthy people (those who have earned their 
wealth without an inherited legacy) tend to realize what it will cost 
(mostly in terms of educational expenditures (*)) to keep their 
children wealthy; therefore, their child-bearing strategies tend to 
emphasize quality over quanity.  How could rational decisions like 
this be genetic?

Mark Crosby

(*) This might be especially true of wealthy families in countries 
that are generally considered poor and offering few opportunities for 
the next generation.  I'm sure most wealthy Africans have their 
children educated in Europe or the U.S.  It's a hell of alot cheaper 
to put one or two kids in boarding school and fly them home once or 
twice a year than it is do the same for a larger brood.

    One thing I recall from my anthropology classes, is that in
pre-industrial cultures whose primary food source is cultivation of
rice in paddies -- which includes a lot of east and southeast Asia, as
well as nearby islands -- more children are highly desirable, because
even an eight-year-old is a net economic *benefit* to the family: Rice
production depends on dexterity rather than on physical strength, and
a child of eight is efficient enough in the paddies to produce more
than he or she eats.  That information was alleged to go a long way to
explaining high population growth in that part of the world; if so, it
is an interesting variant on the "commons" problem, because clearly
(in pre-industrial cultures, at any rate), land is also a limiting
resource on food production.

    Another interesting correlate of family values with economy
occurred in areas where most agricultural production involved plows
drawn by draft animals.  Operating such a plow is back-breaking labor,
requiring great physical strength.  Perhaps consequently, cultures
heavily dependent on such production tend to value sons much more than
daughters, even to the extent of either killing unwanted daughters, or
allowing them to die from malnutrition or mistreatment.

    I wonder whether any consequences of these behaviors have made it
into the genetic pool.

The scientists who created Dolly the sheep, the world's first adult

have a genetically manipulated clone by the end of the year. Scottish
researchers also hope to clone a cow by then. Cloning, scientists say,
is an outgrowth of research into animal breeding and the production of
medicines from animal blood and milk. Transgenic sheep that have
partly human genes have already been created. The sheep produce a
human protein for use in treating cystic fibrosis. For the full text

Ever observe how, in governmental service provision

the Bureau of Economic Development will defacto be 
the Bureau of Economic Destruction 

the Bureau of Drug Suppression will defacto be
the Bureau of Drug Running

the Bureau of Anti-terrorism will defacto be
the Bureau of Terrorism

the Bureau of Safe Medicine will defacto be
the Bureau of Unsafe Medicine

the Bureau of Justice will defacto be
the Bureau of Injustice?


Why dose government consistently tend to contradict the 
categories of public service it purports to provide ?

 The answer is only too simple:

 Because a MONOPOLY, for many reasons, does not 
 provide but destroys service to the general public.

A monopoly, liberated from the need to provide a better
service to attract monetary reward from consumers, works 
only to serve itself, only to serve the private interests 
of those at the top of its internal command-structure.

Societies which are incapable of understanding this
most simple rule of human nature will be condemned
to a standard of living that is as low as the 
monopoly "providing services" is large.

I'm suspicious of this leap from correlation of social behavior to genetics.
Our genetic structure evolved over eons, and in the vast majority of that
time there was no such thing as 'money', 'wealth', or 'richness'.  Are

If I wanted to make specific predictions about them, I'd have to have
some way to test whether my actual results matched my descriptions;
that is, I'd have to discover some /definable, observable, difference/
between what is and what might be, and some way to recognize which of
those matches my prediction.  Such definable, observable differences
are called "measurements".  They don't all have to superficially look
like numbers with units, like "9.8 m/s^2", although those are very
good ones; sometimes they are simply records of distinct observation.
"Yes/No" is your basic one-bit number, and a very good measurement of
things like "the rat found the cheese/the rat didn't find the cheese".
What makes it specifically quantitative is that I can rigorously
define what the measurement is, and I can repeat the experiment
enough times to calculate a t-test or other measure of the probability
that the measurements are chance or that they correlate to some cause.

99% of the measurements you make are subconscious, so you're right
that I don't have to count every step or label every room to get to
where I'm going.  But to make predictions, or to explain things to
someone else, I'd better make them more explicit: if I want to tell
someone that there is an alien corpse in a certain room, I'd better
specify exactly which room of which building at what point on the
planet at which point in time, and define what distinguishes my
claim of "alien corpse" from something else, or else my claim isn't
independently verifiable.  And how did you get to your office the
first time?  By looking for distinguishing measurements of the
building among others--it's order in the street, its height, its
color, its shape, or some other set of measurements.

I'm not discounting the value of human pattern-matching machinery.
That's what gives us conjectures to test, and it is a very valuable
skill.  But until they are defined, measured, and tested, it is a
very dangerous game to make predictions on pattern alone.

I have moved in the opposite direction.  When I was younger I engaged in
a constant struggle against my natural introversion in order to meet
people, make friends, etc.  I worked hard to overcome the "nerd" image,
to fit in with ordinary people.  It was reasonably successful but it was
very stressful for me.

In recent years I have adopted a more complacent attitude.  I am who I am,
and I am no longer so interested in pretending to be something else.  If I
share no interests in common with my neighbors, I don't try to spend time
with them chatting about sports and cars.

You can look at this either as a flaw, that I am taking the easy road and
just doing what feels natural, or as a strength, that I am satisified
with my own self-assessment and no longer feel the need to become what
society expects.  The "Fourth Turning" book did put a different spin
on it, though, suggesting that my attitude could lead to trouble in a
few years.

You were trying to describe human minds via neural net models, which 
is a very useful approach.  But, that doesn't mean you can assume that 
because creativity appears to be an artifact in neural nets that it 
might be an artifact in human minds.  Human minds are not *merely* 
neural nets, even though neural nets may be an appropriate model for 
portions of the human mind.

Yes. What I am trying to say is that properties that may have been 
artifacts during a system's early evolution may no longer be merely 
artifacts and may, in fact, as DoBono noted (in Natasha's original 
post), become necessities for the advanced system in its present 
environment.

In other words, while there *are* mechanisms to human creativity, and 
it is useful to get a grip on them, it is not valid to reduce human 
creativity to these mechanisms.

Sounds like ones' level of sociability is a rational function of ones' 
situation in society, and not genetic (oops, wrong thread (-;), 
although there could *also* be some genetic predisposition to being 
more or less introverted.

Someone well established in a career with a secure position may not 
feel the need to be as sociable (assuming they're not in public 
relations, marketing or management) as someone just starting out and 
trying to make the right contacts.  On the other hand, they may later 
decide that their position is not so secure after all and they may 
change their strategy once again.

Hey there,
  found something that might be of interest to anyone that has an
interest in promoting a digital cash "underground".  There's a page
called Nella, and the "Global Village Bank" which work together.  It's
an idea whose time has come, I believe.  Here's the deal.  

Say I like to design web pages.  Now, I'd like to have someone hmm...
Make a midi file for me or something.  Well, I list myself as a business
in the listing the company has on their page.  Then, someone can hire me
for my services of designing a web page for them.  They'll pay me with
"nella", a virtual currency which is not related to anything in the real
world.  This nella goes into my GVB account.  Then, when I have enough
nella, I can go to someone who can do midi, and hire them for their
services.  Anything that can be transported digitally through the net is
sellable with Nella.  no physical property can be sold.  The page isn't
going to get started until 1000 "businesses" have registered.  I really
want to see a day a real virtual cash system happens, without being
bogged down in the economics of the real world.(I don't know if that's
truly feasible, but hey, one can dream, eh?)  Check it out, and see what
you think...  Maybe we can even do projects as a team or something? 
Whatever works.  Anyways, here's the URL...

This is not quite the response I had hoped for, in other words, it's an "us

I have to disagree; yes, there always was "wealth" throughout all of
human history, just as there is in aboriginal societies today.  It's
likely to be measured in plots of land, cattle, wives, social status,
or whatever else the particular society valued.  "Money" is just a
convenient form of measurement for wealth that we have created in
recent times to simplify the act of trade, but the concept itself is
a much more fundamental one.

And yes, anything that affects behavior can be "encoded in DNA".  The
fact that the first step in the chain of gene->phenotype happens to be
protein synthesis is no reason to discount phenotypic effects that we
cannot necessarily trace back that far.  /All/ phenotypes involve
convoluted interwoven reactions among coded proteins, the embryonic
environment, and the living environment.  To assume otherwise would
be to argue conscious design.

What we actually mean when we say "a gene for X" is that some gene at
some particular locus in the genome, all else being equal, will be more
likely than its alleles to result in trait X being expressed in the
organism.  It implies no specific cause; it may increase the emotional
response to some stimulus, thereby encouraging some behavior; it may
make some morphological change that reduces the energy expended on some
behavior; it might make some purely cosmetic change that affects the
way other organisms behave when seeing you.

The question, then, is how might a gene that had the effect of reducing
a wealthy person's desire to breed might have become more numerous than
its alleles in future generations.  At first, this seems impossible--
typically, genes survive when people breed more, not less, and wealthy
people are better able to care for more children.  But evolution has
done stranger things.  Even a trait as drastic as sterility in worker
ants can be shown to be an adaptation of the peculiar haplodiploid
genome of eusocial insects.

Perhaps the trait came about from periods of boom and bust in the
climate.  Families with fewer children wound up fatter in boom times,
and tended to survive the next drought better than large families of
skinny kids.  If such droughts occured on the average once or twice
per generation, such behavior might well have produced more grandkids
for parents who fattened up one or two kids that those who wastefully
bred more just to die out.  This is pure speculation, of course, but
some such mechanism is quite plausible.  All that is required is that
/some/ gene had /some/ effect that caused a difference in behavior,
and that behavior caused a difference in reproduction.

I would tend to suspect other social causes for the effect, but I
wouldn't rule out genetic basis or predisposition.

I would not be so optimistic without a little more data.  How is rich
defined?  Is it a state of mind or certain physical conditions such as
sufficient food and freedom from stress?  If it is a state of mind than I
would still worry.  The definition of rich keeps rising.  A person can have
a color television and be eating to obesity and still consider themselves
poor because there are people with more.

I just saw a tv show on the Discovery Channel on twins, where they
showed that introversion and extroversion, at least in twins, was
closely related to the relative rate of development between the fetuses
in the womb. The faster developing one tended to be extroverted, while
the slower one interoverted. There seems to always be such an imbalance,
which starts when the embryo splits, as one of the new embryo's always
has more cells in it than the other. Given this, I would say that such
behavior is environmental rather than genetic, even though it may just
be due to pre birth environmental factors.

i was also quite introverted growing up, and did not begin to be
sociable till Junior year of high school, and had a big stage fright
problem up until I started my lighting business in Seattle in 1991.
Doing presentations repeatedly got me out of it.

Let's face it, he is a quite successful automorph. One could argue that he
has not done it for art, but for money and success, but as somebody said:

Such schemes have been tried before, although the digital twist is a new
one to me.  The perrenial problem has been the temptation to make lots
of currency, resulting in inflation.  They have to have the ability to
make some currency for each new participant, otherwise stagnation occurs.
So they therefore have the ability to wreck their own economy through
inflation.  Such a misdeed can be very profitable for them since they 
are the first to spend the new currency.

In short, they have means and they have motive.  What guarantees to 
they offer on their money supply?

I'm going to try once more here to make myself clear here.  I never said 
that your friends have to completely agree with everything you value. 
I never implied that my close friends agree with everything I say or 
do.  I never said that I don't tolerate a wide spectrum of lifestyles 
or values in my own friends.  It would be completely unreasonable for 
me to expect my friends to be exactly like I am.  For you to make this 
assumption proves that you haven't listened to a darn thing I've been 
saying this entire time--my entire point was about acceptance of who you 
are as an individual versus mindless conformity to a group just to have 
friends.  You were the one complaining that you couldn't find any.

Now I'm confused.  Are you saying that you can go about your life,
such as walking through new buildings or driving on new streets
without making any predictions based on all those subconscious
measurements you make?  All it gives you are "conjectures to test"?
You don't predict "Hmm.. I think going up those stairs would probably
get me to the second floor"?  Or are you saying you do predict but
that it is "dangerous"?  (relative to what?)

And when I said that Strauss & Howe don't give quantitiative data, I
meant that they refer to relevant historical facts as evidence, but
that they don't map them onto numbers nor organize them in a way that
would make a statistical analysis convenient.  This sounds like data
just as much as your visual perceptions of a building.

Actually Ted Nelson originally defined the term as "nonsequential writing."
There are lots of kinds of hypertext.  The WWWeb is hypertext with one-
way (mostly) links to whole documents (or to anchors put in by the original
authors).  Fine grain links, bidirectional links, versioning, permanent
storage, redundant storage are all nice features.

You can get reverse links by using a search engine like AltaVista to find
references to a URL.  I like this approach because it doesn't depend on
the cooperation of the host of the linked-to page.  Robin Hanson has a
page about backward link-following methods (sorry, not online right now).

There are already people who archive the usenet on CD and sell it.
Also, it's pretty easy to set up a news server and just archive
everything.  I think there's a system for giving a standard URL to a
usenet post.  I wonder if anyone puts the whole history online?

Meanwhile there is a group archiving as much of the WWWeb as their
web crawler can collect.   Check http://www.archive.org .

Actually, I do mean something like that.  Much of our day-to-day
activity can be accomplished purely by subconscious pattern-matching.
Even something as complex as driving, once learned, becomes a self-
reinforcing pattern stored and brought up when needed, but not
actively reasoned.  "Driving on automatic" is something we've all
experienced: you may remember getting in the car, and getting out
at work, but all that stuff in between quickly fades from short-
term conscious memory because it didn't need your attention once
you've done it a few times.

Even reactive behaviors can be put on automatic this way: ask any
good video game player.  He doesn't conscously think about every
little goblin; he has trained his mental facilities to instantly
recognize situations, and instantly respond with actions.  Even new
situations get matched to something similar.  The number of patterns
of a Rubik's cube is so many that the odds of a sufficiently random
arrangement being one I've encountered before are basically zero.
But if you put that random cube in my hand, I would solve it in a
minute or two, because I trained myself to do it.  I might even have
a hard time explaining how nowadays, because I've forgotten all the
mathematical basis, but my hands remember all the moves, and my
subconscious mind remembers the patterns.

What more controlled, quantitative analyses are needed for is the
formulation of rules that are likely to hold for completely new
situations, and that can be communicated meaningfully to people
who have not shared your specific experiences.  Social predictions
fall into this category, as do scientific hypotheses.  The machinery
that lets me solve a Rubik's cube also makes the minds of social
commentators fall upon interesting parallels and patterns that they
can often find some way to express; by then making analogies to the
previous instances of those patterns, they extrapolate how to deal
with these new things.  This is probably a useful function of the
brain for dealing with life, but it is a primitive, incomplete, and
purely heuristic way of doing it.  More trustable decisions demand
more rigorous methods.  Especially when the minds of other free
individuals enter the picture.  Seat-of-the-pants heuristics aren't
enough to find the common laws of nature shared by two minds with
different processes.  You need measurements.

I will concede that historical facts--if they are accurate--are "data"
of the one-bit kind.  But one must refrain from using them as "evidence"
of something other than their mere existence, unless you are rigorous
about your methods of selecting sample sets and measuring statistical
significance of outcomes.  Otherwise, one can just pick the pattern and
then find historical facts to fit it.  Proper science doesn't work that
way: your mind suggests patterns, but then you must do the measurements
cleanly if you want to prove that the pattern means something.

I am guilty of using such extrapolations sometimes.  I have said, for
example, "In every century of human history since the creation of
governments, governments have killed more people than the criminals
they were created to protect us from."  I say this to imply that
governments, as a rule, aren't a good idea.  But if I'm challenged to
say what it really means, I'd have to admit that it's just data, and
it doesn't by itself predict anything, even though it's accurate.  It
is very suggestive--and it leads me to investigate /why/ this might be
the case, and to discover the nature of power and conflict, but if I
want to actually predict what a certain kind of government might do,
I'd better have more than this simple pattern to back me up.

By definition, disease is caused by some kind of immunodeficiency or there
would not be a disease.  Unless you mean a definition that
non-immunodeficiency is a patient with CD4+ over 1.0.  You see, 0.3 is the
AIDS cut-off  plus the 0.3 must be declining or the CDC has a problem with an
AIDS diagnosis.   CDC says between 0.3 and 1.0  are other diseases (possibly
not fatal as AIDS is) but not AIDS.
 
BTW, The skeptics use <= 1.0 as the cut-off to make their case against HIV
erroneously stronger, letting non-AIDS patients into their AIDS defined
group.  They can then claim some non-AIDS ( CD4+ 0.4-1.0) patients don't have
HIV present.  Pretty tricky if you ask me.  But then again they are about 200
people fighting against great odds and need some kind of edge since they
their arguments have so far been rejected by peer reviews.

<< The latency period seems to differ with different sub-types of the virus,
of   
 which there are at least six. >>   
 
This seems likely.  There are many so called "slow viruses" with long latency
periods not just HIV-1. The _Manual of Clinical Microbiology_ (MCM) lists
several p.189, 813, 1027-1032 5th edition 1991;  Kuru, Scrapie; B. Sigurfsson
long incubation period agents (1954).  Other long latency microorganisms are
_Coccidioides immitis_, _Aspergillus_, TB and MAC.  So HIV-1 is not so
strange as far as latency period.  I would even call it uninteresting from
that aspect.  My theory is that we will find many more long latency viruses.
In fact, I am surprised we have not found MORE such as a human cancer virus
similar to Roux Sarcoma cancer virus (also a retrovirus like HIV-1).     
  
HIV-2 is almost genetically identical to HIV-1 (see MCM p. 1013) and causes
AIDS-like disease in African monkeys.   
 
The HIV skeptics don't like the data showing HIV is so identical to animal
AIDS because Koch's postulates are proven easier than with human HIV.  Even
though Koch's postulates have been satisfied by retrospective investigations
of accidental infections with HIV such as the dental cases and hemophilia
cases (to say nothing of the millions of homosexual male infections).   About
200 skeptics are still not satisfied vs.about 35,000 ASM members who are so
far convinced that Koch's postulated are satisfied. 
 
It would be interesting to determine if these seemingly minor genetic
differences change latency period prior to AIDS -like symptoms.

The degree of intimacy a friend can attain with you is very much
dependent upon their similarity to you. People who do not share my
obsession with psychedelics cannot relate to or appreciate what I am
talking about when I am refering to instances where I have consumed
"heroic" doses of an entheogen. A person who doesn't have a comparable
understanding of similar cognitive fields as I do will be wholly
incapable of sustaining a relevant [non-superficial] conversation with
me. Similarity is necessary for a relationship to have any true depth in
a broad spectrum. Its about empathy and depths of understanding. 

However, on the internet, I am not particularly looking for friends. I
make acquaintances who can satisfy specific highly focused interests,
and these people can be extremely diverse. I have no desire to be
cognitively intimate with them on a broad spectrum. It does not matter
if my internet aquaintances particularly share a similar moral,
aesthetic, or political interest/understanding. I generally seek them
for their specific knowledge, ability, or some other specific attribute.
This Elist is an example of a network of acquaintances for me. I
appreciate the people here for their knowledge on science, and for their
ability to rigoruosly debate my own ideas on the same. Unlike my handful
of close friends, I have not been attracted to you for your physical
beauty, your musical skills, your psychedelic obsession, your taste in
literature, food, and movies, etcettera. You might all be overweight,
scarred, tone deaf, and scared witless of psychedelics, but that hardly
matters. Its alright if our relationship is fairly superficial,
detached, non-sensual, non-emotional, but where my friends are
concerned, that is not tolerable. 

My friends and I must be similar, if not, if we grow in entirely
different directions [or if my friends refuse to grow], then we become
acquaintances, and we move on to find new friends. And that is fine.

How could your friends differ widely in lifestyle from you. If you are
not doing the same things, appreciating similar things, then what are
you doing together? Lets say you cannot tolerating watching television,
but this is your "friends" favorite past time. Do you just hang out and
suffer the television with that person for the sake of diversity or do
you go out and find real friends who want to explore and play in similar
ways as you do? 

I must have more in common with a friend than an interest in tomorrows
weather. Diversity is great socially, it gives us options, choices,
alternatives, but a friendship based on diversity is doomed to surface
superficialty. There's a reason why we have cultures, and subcultures,
and subcultures of subcultures. We want friends who can relate to our
experiences.  

A person who refuses to have similar friends is a person afraid of an
intimate relationship. Whereas a person who is afraid to make
acquaintances outside their own sphere is afraid to have their ideals
challenged and augmented. Friends and acquaintances serve different
purposes. I have a hell of a lot more acquaintances than I have true
friends, and I believe that will be true of any strongly individualistic
person. I have no desire to be friends with anyone and everyone. No
egalaterian here.

No disagreement here, really.  The time period that I was referring to 
starts pre-cambrian.  Human history is only a tiny part of it. 
Human genes are greatly the result of the evolution of pre-human critters.
The vast majority of that time there was no wealth, unless clams got money.

The point that I was trying to make was that, if we treat DNA as a
language, there are no words in the human genome for 'rich', and
probably insufficient syntax to talk about riches.

Please consider a parallel example.  If I observe the following evolution:
  ? -> B -> BCPL -> C -> C++ , I can conclude that C++ probably has a
grammar fit for talking to computers, and is not fit for writing love
poems or dicussing aesthetics.


> And yes, anything that affects behavior can be "encoded in DNA". 
> { snip articulate supporting arguments - none of which I disagree with }

True, but not sufficient.  Yes, behaviors can be encoded.  However wealth
is not a behavioral concept.  It is a social construction, and there is
no definite connection between behavior and wealth.  Wealth-recognizing
or wealth-producing behavior in one society doesn't always work in another.
( Howard Stern's behavior makes him wealthy in this society, it would
get him shot in mainland China. )  

The very fact that the correlation between wealth and family size is 
cross-cultural is therefore proof that it isn't genetic.  QED.



> I would tend to suspect other social causes for the effect...
Me too.

Byte ranges work with editing if old versions remain available.
That way, you refer to a range within a version.  There's an interesting
technical challenge in following a byte-range link from an old version
to the corresponding place(s) in a new version.

If there is a mechanism for the author to publish subsequent versions,
and a way to see that the old version is superceded, and how the new
version differs, then we can keep the old version *and* let the author
retract/revise/ammend/clarify... it.

I can't think of a please-don't-store-and-retransmit protocol that couldn't
easily be gotten around by crypto and scrambling routers, even if *most*
people wanted to honor such requests.  Even if you say that only the
original signer of a message can retract it.  If the system is built to
prevent censorship and traces by info police or spies, then (I think) it
can easily be used to reveal retracted writings.  And if there's
a demand for that, then (seems to me) there will be people in the business.

My instinct says that a system built around the truth works better than a
system built around an idealization of the truth.  In this case the truth
is that things have been said in the past, *and* sometimes people misstate
things or change their minds, and sometimes people *really don't want* you
to read certain information.  The system should represent all of these.
It would be idealization to think that everyone is trying to make the most
comfortable environment for debate, that no on wants to unnecessarily
embarrass anyone, that we can control information.

Funny finding myself writing about "the system" meaning the overall
effect that the diverse things going on on the net ought to have and
be designed toward having.  I believe that design is one of the
most important parts of politics...but I'm also an anarchist.  So I
believe in design for *and by* distributed systems.  But still it makes
sense to say "the" system "should" work a certain way.

Also funny to find myself taking this somewhat fatalistic attitude toward
information control.  I said before I don't like the gung-ho, "live with
it" style of futurism.  But (I did also say) you gotta pick your battles.

I forgot royalty, especially fine-grained royalty, and inline quote

I have concluded that it is very difficult to discuss something this 
personal on a listserve, because one doesn't know the frame of 
reference out of which someone interprets what one says.  I will just 
add that I believe that higher forms of friendship do not depend on 
absolute similarities but on the aspects of sharing that take place 
in space and time.  An act of creation through the will of two 
people.

that I know my subjects much better than I did as a child.  Also because I

someone will be disagreeing with me in the lecture, I don't take it so

I don't even mind if I change my mind later and agree with the opponents.  I

That would not work.  IMO you need HIV to be 100% proven wrong as even one
single cause of AIDS . . . that is . . . to satisfy Duesberg's claim that HIV
has no role, not one, 100% _no_ role in causing _any_ form of AIDS.

He says HIV is 100% on the wrong track.

In 1959 a "normal healthy" British soldier was diagnosed with HIV and died of
AIDS.  This was discovered via a 30 year old retro-(excuse the
pun)-investigation.

(The skeptics don't like to admit to this study in their for-profit books and
for-profit lectures.)

Not at all.  It just means HIV is one but probably not the only.  Look at
HTLV -1 and HTLV-2 and probably some CMV, etc.  The definition of AIDS is not
satisfied by the non-HIV infected people since the CD4+ at <= 0.3 and
declining is not their.  The skeptics add every non-AIDS disease up from
"0.0" to CD4+ 1.0 that should not be in the AIDS group at all.

All classical viral diseases?  You mean non-retroviruses. . .  not HIV,
HTLV-I, HTLV-II, HIV-2, or probably  most "gag gene" type viruses.  Some are
only found in the brain not blood, others are in the sputum not blood, etc.
 Viruses tend to be in specific places but since nobody know the HIV
 "minimal infective dose"  low levels of HIV in blood is _meaningless_.
 e.g., Only one Q-fever  microbe will cause Q-fever infection.  By your
criteria Q-fever could also not be a disease cause since you can't find it
easily in the blood.

I don't know of any "violations" yet in print and I have read Peter Duesberg,
Bryan Ellison, and Robert Root-Bernstein.  I _did_ like the article they
wrote and that makes me feel more like going against the grain (and being
more creative).   
 
Robert Root-Bernstein actually writes that HIV _might_ cause AIDS in some
cases.   he is more open minded, creative and pan-critically rational.
 
Duesberg and Ellison reject HIV 100%.  This is leaving nothing to discuss but
a nice  money making lecture and book market for themselves based on stiring
up controversial subjects (not unlike Jerry Riffkin's controversial-lecture
business).    
 
Neither will admit any HIV involvement in AIDS.   
 
For an "END POINT" in the "research futures"  I would like to see HIV proven
to be 100% not involved in any way with AIDS infection as a vindication of
the skeptic's claims.

Even Gallo said HIV is not the only cause, nobody has said that after a
little peer review. 
 
I don't even personally recognize Gallo (et all 13 of them) as the "official"
discoverer of HIV (then called HTLV-3) in 1984.  I would have given HIV's
discovery to the Pasteur Institute in 1983:  
Barre-Sinoussi,  
Nuguyre,  
Dauguet,  
Vilmer,  
Griscelli,  
Bran-Vezinet,  
Rouzioux,  
Gluckman,  
Chermann and Montagnier 
 
It looks to me like Gallo got a clue from the French, saw a good thing (HIV
is one of the causes of AIDS) and quickly "office politics 'ed" the US
government to declare the discovery to Americans before the French beat them
to it. 
 
The U.S. government was duped.  Far from "inventing" HIV as Louis Farrakhon
had said (in 1989) to drum up support for government hate via conspiracy
theory (another good money making business, the conspiracy business).  

To say HIV is what the "government" says causes AIDS shows how affective
Gallo has been pushing the Pasteur Institute out of the lime light.   Unless
you mean the FRENCH government!  ;-)

The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) (is not a government group)
writes a lot on HIV as one cause of AIDS.  The Manual of Clinical
Microbiology had a lot of good information.  I have been a member of ASM
since 1976.

The fact that we won't die as fast does not mean that we won't be
evolving.  Taken to it's ultimate end, the generation renewal ratio
assumption would mean that a longer lifespan would lead to a shorter
life.

Individuals would have to look upon themselves for
evolution/adaptation/improvement, not to their progeny.

I imagine that as we start programming our own genetics and immune
systems we'll be faced with the bio version of the jerks that create
computer viruses.  Those of us who choose extropian life will be faced
with constant challenges coming not so much from "generation renewal
ratio ", but from malicious human\posthuman intelligence.

While much of the evolution of morphology might be pre-human, almost
all of the evolution of /behavior/ likely happened after we took the
basic shape now doing the behaving.  Perhaps most of the perceptions
evolved before that, but muscular behaviors and social behaviors must
have evolved much later, after our muscles and groups looked more like
the ones we have now.  Behavioral evolution is very fast.

Sorry, no sale.  All it proves is that the particular kind of wealth
measured in the study was probably not the same as what caused the result.
To postulate some genetic cause, you would indeed have to have some
less culturally-biased measure that happens to correlate with wealth.
Obesity seems like the obvious one.  That's something common to the
wealthy in every primitive society and most modern ones.  Or free time.
Maybe some gene has the effect of supressing sex drive when one is
sedentary, so those people who had lots of free time were less libidinous.
Any number of things might cause it.  Just because the particular measure
of "wealth" used in the initial study is a modern phenomenon doesn't mean
that there isn't some more fundamental variable not postulated that
correlates well with modern wealth.

"Language of DNA" is not the right way to treat "genes", because it leads
to the wrong conclusions.  The fact that what we call a "gene", i.e.,
the inheritable whatever-it-is that results in some trait, is implemented
in DNA is no reason to limit its effects to the proximal effects of
DNA protein synthesis.  Yes, DNA is a language for doing one thing;
but since the effects 100 steps further along in the chain of causality
can still materially differ when the DNA differs, and the /difference/
causes selection, it makes perfect sense to say that this 100-levels-
removed-from-DNA phenomenon is selected genetically, because it carries
that chunk of DNA into the next generation regardless of whether it
"coded" for the trait or not.

Evolution is not a forward-looking plan; it is a backward-looking 
effect.  DNA doesn't know or care what its "purpose" is.  It just
sits there obliviously copying itself and having whatever effect it
has on the being's development and life.  Somewhere down the line,
those organisms that developed from DNA that happened to have some
long-range effect that made them less "fit" than organisms with some
different DNA died off, or had fewer kids, and the fitter ones went
on.  The precise chain of steps from DNA to behavior is irrelevant.
If the behavior--or morphology, or external conditions, or any other
feature affected by the organism--differs with different DNA, and it
has some differential effect on fitness, then it is an inherited
trait, regardless of whether it's the height of a beaver's dam, the
odds of cheating on your wife, or the size of your bank account.

Again, I'm not saying that there /is/ a genetic basis.  I agree that it
is probably less likely than a cultural one.  I only point out that the
idea of a genetic basis is much less far-fetched than in might sound.

Subject: Clinton vs human cloning : Pres ignores self-ownership


	In a blatant display of political oportunism, President Clinton shows
a sudden concern for ethics. He presumes to impose archaic
authoritarian religious views in an attack on the forefront of modern
science and the basis of all human rights : self-ownership.

	Pandering to the worst reactionary authoritarian statist elements of
the Millenium, Clinton seeks a "commission"  { an Inquisition is more
like it) to study human cloning.

	Clinton and those he seeks to appease on the statist Left & Right
ignore the simple human fact of self-ownership. If human beings do not
have the right to clone themselves they do not have the right to
reproduce in any form without government consent. The level of
techonology is irrelevant to the simple fact that humans have the
right to dispose of their own tissue in any way they see fit. The
alternative is state-ownership of human beings. This is unconscionable
both ethically and scientifically.

	Basic laws protect the rights of humans from enslavement  that
opponents of human cloning pretend to fear in their simplistic
propaganda. In reality, authoritarians of both the right and the left
seek control over human life. Rulers and would-be rulers seek to use
the issue of cloning to establish the principle of state-ownership of
human life.

	Niether scientists nor the public can allow this to happen. We need to
have freedom to experiment so that viruses and all other infectious
agents can be defeated as fast (or hopeully faster) than they can
evolve. Limiting the rights of people to donate their tissue to
medical science for these or any other purposes is to doom humanity to
death from emergent viral and other pathogenic infections.
Biotechnology and medicine in other areas may al;so benefit from human
cloning in ways we cannot even imgaine now.

	But , most importanly, banning human cloning will establish the right
of the State to control human reproduction and human life in toto, by
establishing the precedent created by such a law as Clinton and others
are seeking.

The main issue which I find disturbing in cloning and similar proposals
is, what about the children produced?  Who defends their interests, and to
what extent should I condone someone performing experiments which may lead
to children who suffer from brain damage or deformities?  Apparently it
took > 100 tries to produce Dolly the sheep.  I wouldn't be surprised
if they had some pretty messed-up lambs along the way.

The same issue arises with more conventional technology, like in vitro
fertilization, of course.  I guess that's pretty reliable now.  You can't
make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, so if we have to produce a
few scrambled babies before we get good at it, is that fine with everyone?

It's really not a self ownership issue, it's a question of child ownership.
I see this as a classic gray area; I would be much more willing to intervene
on behalf of another child being injured by his parent than to try to stop
a person from hurting himself.

The same dilemma has been adressed nicely in John Brunner's "Shockwave 
Rider", where they had any number of misshapen failures in their quest 
for the "Ubermensch. Brunner seems to be strongly contra cloning, btw.

If we are to keep severely retarded or semianencephalic self clones for 
blood donoring or organ transplant purposes, the shotgun approach of 
current recombinant DNA technology will have some grave problems. Anybody 
care for a selfburger?

We've surely set up a worm farm if we consider transgenetic animals as 
ersatz wombs for human breeding.

I've heard of other digital cash schemes, before, also...  But they were
all bound up in real currency.

I think I mentioned how it worked.  If not, here it is.  When you
register your business/service at the gvb(global village bank), they
drop 50 nella into your account.  When they have 1000 people signed up
as service providers, they will put the businesses/services on their web
page.  Then, if you need a service you can look around, and then buy
their service.  So, yes they do have the ability to issue the currency
to the people.  Remember, this is purely fictional currency.  The only
material you can purchase is digital/intellectual property.  At least,
that's the way it appears to me from their rules.  So, no, I could not
buy a new sofa, for example.  I might be able to buy the designs for a
sofa, but not the actual thing.  This is just an experiment, and I think
it's something that goes along with extropian principles.  Especially
the Spontaneous Order(I know, there's been some contention within the
past couple weeks about that term)...  This project is starting out
small, and perhaps it'll work, perhaps it'll fail.  But, what loss would
there be to try it out, except, perhaps your time(although, you'd get
someone else's time(created work) in return).  It's seems pretty
anarchic and spontaneous to me.  People free to trade as they wish. 
I've already signed up.  I hope someone else at least thinks about it. 
Did you get to visit their page yet?  If not, I suggest to do so.  It's
interesting, and it'll have the full scheme on how things work.  Also,
you could ask the people who are setting it up your questions on
inflation, etc...

As I said, it's anarchic, spontaneous, and it doesn't exist.  It's
voluntary, contractual agreement.  Once this thing gets going, I think
it'll grow in a great way.

As described, this is precisely as fictional--no more, no less--than
ordinary national currencies.  There is no reason at all you couldn't
use it to to buy and sell anything, just like all the other cybercash
systems on the net (there are several).  If you can sell a document, that
document can be a ticket for redeeming some tangible good, and so long
as there is a relatively fixed amount of currency, or an amount that
inflates at a predictable rate, a useful economy will result.  But as
long as issued volume (and therefore value) is controlled by a monopoly,
that monopoly has incentive to inflate.

The only honest, safe, truly capitalist way to issue currency is to set
it at a fixed value in tangible goods--say, grams of gold--issued by
competing private banks (like Hong Kong).  And of course, make sure 
that you buy deposit insurance valued in currency of the beneficiary's
choice at loss, so that the insurance companies will keep the banks in
line for you.  Banks can still manipulate the money supply by doing
fractional-reserve tricks, but they can never go too far without risking
their promise to redeem in hard goods.

So in order to express and understand things this personal with another
person, we must understand where the other person is coming from ... we
must have an empathy for their framework of perception. And in order to
have such an empathy we must draw from similar personal experiences. And
in order to have similar personal experiences we must have similar
interests and values. And though we could never be absolutely similar to
another person, and we would not want to be, the more we have in common,
the more personal we may be.

I cannot share with someone, something they cannot recieve. If I were to
meet an alien, an entity who I have relatively little in common with,
our differences will make it nearly impossible for us to communicate.
Our encounter cannot be intimate and personal ... until we make a joint
effort to attune to each other, to by some degree become more like the
other. We must find common ground, and then expand that ground of
similarity until we can communicate freely and personally. I can only
share my thoughts with someone to the degree that they have shared
similar experiences. No matter how much I want to share my thoughts in
space and time with a three month old baby, we will not be able to
communicate deeply until that child has had more experiences similar to
my own. No matter how much I want to share my thoughts with the gingko
tree outside, we will never be able to communicate because we are too
dissimilar. No matter how much I will myself to understand calculus, and
no matter how much a mathmatician wills to communicate it to me, if I
have not first acquired the similar experience of learning algebra and
trigonometry, then such communication is not possible until I have
acquired such experience ... until I have become that much more similar.

The will to share, and the will to communicate, is the will to conform.
The only people who do not need conform at all, are those who do not
need other people, and thus those who have no need to communicate. I
don't know anyone who fits into that category. As long as we seek
emotive or cognitive interaction with others, we must conform to them
and vice versa. The greater that conformity the greater we can interact.
I personally do not like conforming to others more than I need to, and
its not much of a problem since I do not want to communicate deeply with
very many people. I don't need to communicate deeply with the lady at
Burger King to get my chicken sandwich.

No one wants to be called a conformist. So we deny the fact that we are
constantly conforming, becoming more similar to each other in order to
interact more deeply and effectively. Extropians offer people reading
lists, suggested reading. This is because Extropians are seeking
potential Extropians, people who can understand and embrace Extropian
ideas. A reading list is a tool to help people conform. They can read
the books and disagree, and never be heard from, they can attempt to
read the books and find them to difficult to read, and never be heard
from, or they can begin reading the books and find that they resonate
with similar thoughts and experiences of their own, and thus they will
seek more reading experiences to increase their ability to interact with
Extropians. There are a list of qualities which make a person Extropian.
We more or less have these qualities in common. If we did not have those
qualities in common, if we were not similar in that way, we would not be
communicating right now. We would have no will or desire to share in a
creative process within "space and time". 

People are attracted to each other and brought together by their
similarities. I go to mechanic because we have a similar interest in
making my car run, though our motives of course differ. I can only
communicate with the mechanic about my car to the degree that we have
had similar experiences with cars. And since I have a superficial
understanding of my car, I will have a superficial conversation with my
mechanic ... no matter how much we both will me to understand. Lets say
the mechanic is a really nice guy and thats all that I required in order
for him to be my friend, we must either find something in common to do
or talk about or else one or both of us must attune to the other in
order to conform in some fashion and thus create similarity. We seek
similarity when we want depth, and difference when we want to expand.
But to expand we must become similar to that which we were previously
different.

These two statements are not parellel: creativity is an action, an artefact

One of Koch's postulates is that you should be able to cause the same
disease by injecting the supposed agent into a new victim.  Obviously, this
has been tough to prove with HIV because nobody wants to volunteer as a test
case.  However, recently chimpanzees injected the human HIV virus have been
coming down with AIDs like symptoms, declining T-cells, and at least one
appears to have died of the disease.  The latency period is every bit as
long in chimps as it is in people, making these difficult and expensive
experiments to carry out.  But they now appear to satisfy the most important
of Koch's postulates.

I have definitely ambivalent feelings about cloning humans.  It's possible
to see good coming out of it.  It's easy to see real weirdness coming out of
it (Micheal Jackson clones himself, brings back the Jackson Five with an all
Michael band).  

For all the good intentioned debate, I don't think there's any doubt that
cloning humans will happen, it will happen sooner than anybody anticipates,
and it will eventually become commonplace.  

My predictions:

1.  Clinton's ban on federal funded cloning research is made permanent.
        
2.  Congress tries to ban all cloning research but fails by a vote or two,
after pleas by Harold Varmus and a lobbying group formed by Amgen, Biogen,
Genentech, Monsanto, and the National Intitutes of Health.

3.  Meanwhile, someone opens up a cloning clinic in Anguilla.
    Cloning research in Europe and the US goes underground  (there has
always been underground research.  Several scientists were thrown out of
good positions when they used genetic engineering in ways that were orinally
banned, eg one of my thesis advisors.)

4.  Extropy Istitute opens up a Tissue Bank for Transhuman Cloning.
Transhumans worldwide start freezing bits of themselves in anticipation of
further progress in cloning research.

4.  Somebody notices that the cloning clinic in Anguilla is making money.
Congress is upset because the Americans are losing the technological cloning
race to Anguilla.

5.  Cloning becomes the hot button issue of the year 2004 presidential race.
Republican nominee Pat Buchanan and incumbent Southern Baptist Al Gore agree
that cloning humans is against the will of God.  Corporate money pours into
the coffers of the Libertarian Party.

6.  President Max More rescinds the cloning ban, asserting that it is
"inimical to Libertarian Party principles" as well as the "American
tradition of individual choice."

7. Albert Einstein is exhumed and cloned in multiple copies.  Einstein
develops a group mind as an Evil Genius that takes over the world,
generating millions of copies of himself.

On Thu, 6 Mar 1997, I wrote:
<Human minds are not *merely* neural nets, even though neural nets may 
be an appropriate model for portions of the human mind.>

Robert Schrader then asked:
<Please elaborate.  What kind of part are these non-neural-net parts? 
And how would you model them?>

Sorry, I don't really know.  The point I was primarily trying to make 
was that something that appears to be an inessential artifact at one 
level can be appropriated as a driving force at another level.  When 
we do get a grip on the mechanisms involved in the *linking* of 
different hierarchical and relational levels in complex systems then I 
think we'll have a better model for such things as creativity than we 
have with uni-level 'hardware' models like Turing machines or basic 
neural nets.

I was just reading a 9701 _Communications of the ACM_ article on 
"Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Organizations".  I like their 
concise definition of ontology: "Ontologies are specifications of 
discourse among multiple agents in the form of a shared vocabulary." 
 (This is sorta what Gregory Houston was recently talking about - on a 
semi-synchronous thread - as a precondition for close friendships, 
while Kathryn Aegis, on the other hand, was talking about friendships 
being based more on shared commitments than on common interests.)

Anyway, this CACM article went on to describe some of the specialized 
agents that are needed in a 'virtual organization', e.g., domain 
experts, wrapper agents (to translate outputs from the domain experts 
to the shared vocabulary), facilitator or broker agents to provide a 
reliable communication layer between the specialized agents.

The human brain also has similar specialized and generalized organs. 
So, I'm trying to find a way to say that /even if/ the underlying 
hardware or wetware is neural nets all the way up and down, at a 
certain level of analysis the functional elements and their roles in 
the overall ecology (e.g., the perceptual and intentional dynamics) 
are able to encode things that you won't see if you look only at the 
underlying mechanisms.

Five-person pregnancy sparks debate in Italy
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copyright =A9 1997 Nando.net
Copyright =A9 1997 Reuter Information Service=20


ROME (Mar 7, 1997 10:19 a.m. EST) - An Italian woman provoked a storm of
outrage Friday with the news that she is acting as a surrogate mother and
expecting two boys in a pregnancy involving five people.

Gynaecologist Pasquale Bilotta said on Thursday that he had implanted two
eggs from different women and fertilized by separate men in the surrogate
mother.

He said both female donors were Italian. The surrogate mother, identified
only as "Angela," was three months pregnant.

Health Minister Rosy Bindi, who this week announced a temporary ban in
Italy on all forms of human and animal experimentation linked to cloning,
was aghast.

"We have crossed unimaginable boundaries," she said.

Bilotta said that the operation was carried out in Switzerland because the
Italian medical body forbids surrogate motherhood in its professional code
of conduct although there is no legal ban on the practice.

Aldo Pagni, the president of the country's medical order, said the fact
that Bilotta had gone abroad did not absolve him and he should face
sanctions in Italy. He also called for government legislation to prevent
future cases.

Father Gino Concetti, a Roman Catholic moral theologian whose views are
close to those of Pope John Paul, said the pregnancy was "a new step toward
madness" and urged a ban.

He said surrogate motherhood was "a blatant violation of natural maternity
and a grave offence against personal dignity which calls for conception in
a dignified manner and by natural means by a couple united in regular
matrimony."

The Catholic Church opposes all forms of artificial human conception,
including test-tube fertilization and surrogate motherhood, as well as
experimentation on embryos.

"Two children are being born as the offspring of five adults, of two
fathers and three mothers. Here the whole concept of the family, of
brothers and of twins has been blown to pieces," La Stampa newspaper=
 declared.

"They are children of science and that is it."

"Angela," a mother of two children aged eight and 10, told newspapers that
she had decided to help two childless women "out of love" and was not being
paid anything more than her expenses.

"It is an act of humanity," she said, adding that after the birth she did
not want to see the babies and had not wanted information about the parents.

She said she was a Roman Catholic but had no difficulties in reconciling
her faith and her decision.

"The Church can say what it wants. I remain a Catholic, I believe in God
and don't understand why a person should be condemned for trying to help
others," she told the Rome daily La Repubblica.

The only ethically unacceptable thing would have been to take money for
what she was doing, she declared.

The reaction was not all completely hostile.

Rosanna Della Corte, an Italian who had a test-tube baby at the age of 62
in 1994 in a case that caused a similar storm, said the case of "Angela"
was a beautiful miracle of science although she opposed surrogacy.

"A woman is not a machine, she is a mother," she said. "If I were that
woman in Rome, once the babies were born I would keep them rather than hand
them over."

I'd appreciate it if you could reference this new chimp study. I'd particularly
like to read about HIV infected chimps coming down with "AIDS-like 
symptoms" after latency periods "every bit as long as it is in people."  
I would like to read it since it is so at odds with earlier experiments I am 
familiar with.

These past studies reveal important differences in the diseases of
infected monkeys from that of HIV in human AIDS:

(1) The absence of antiviral antibodies predicted the incidence of diseases
in monkeys, while the opposite is claimed for humans infected with HIV
[Kestler et al. 1990].  Another study has confirmed that monkey's risk
of disease is directly proportional to the titer of SIV [Futz et al., 1990].

(2) The simian retroviruses barely reduce the T-cell levels of ill monkeys
[Kestler et al., 1991], while HIV is claimed to deplete T-cells in humans.

(3) The spectrum of diseases observed in the SIV-infected monkeys is
different from AIDS, including bacteremia and lacking, among others,
Kaposi's sarcoma and dementia [Kestler et al., 1990; Fultz et al., 1990].

(4) In follow-up studies, SIV failed to cause disease in rhesus and 
mangabey monkeys despite extensive sequence variation of the virus 
which is thought to enhance pathogenicity [Fultz et al., 1990; Burns
and Desrosiers, 1991; Villinger et al., 1991].

(5) Since SIV has never caused any disease in wild monkeys, although
about 50% are naturally infected [Blattner et.al, 1988; Fultz et al., 1990;
Burns and Drosiers, 1991; Villinger et al., 1991] it is not an appropriate
model for the hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS in naturally infected
humans.

With any person on the planet, you have 1000 times more in common than
different.  Even with an alien, the whole of objective reality--the
entire universe--is common ground.  If you find it difficult to have
meaningful conversations with others, then perhaps it is because you
have failed to tie your thoughts to some objective reality that we all
share.  This should be even easier with humans, because we share not
only the external reality but also the physical and psychological
nature of a single species among billions.  What minor differences of
circumstance, attitude, culture, or state could possibly overwhelm
common ground of that magnitude?

If you choose to focus most of your attention on those minor differences,
then your failure to communicate is not because of those differences--
it is because you choose to focus on them.  What better way to expand
your relationships with others than by dedicating your mind to the task
of discovering what everyone shares--i.e., objective reality?

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I got a message from an EXI list member who saw 60 Minutes smear 
my TWA 800 web page: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm
so I thought I should post this to the list. 60 Minutes focused
largely on a popular conspiracy writer on a segment on Internet 
conspiracy theory, but they briefly showed and trashed my page.

While I've yet to see it, I've had multiple detailed accounts. 
Lesley Stahl held up my TWA 800 web page, careful to display my 
name prominently, as an example of why the Internet needs policing. 
She implied without any reference to fact that my page was an example 
of claims made on the internet that are "poorly researched," 
"unverifialbe," and "disinformation."

This is an absolute lie.  Virtually every claim I make is based 
on a verifiable media reference cited with the claim. In fact, the 
"claims" ARE the media references. The page is PURE research, where 
"research" is defined as exhaustive reading and referenced compilation 
of the available literature on a given subject to establish a cohesive 
picture of what the truth most likely is. Of all the conspiracy oriented
pages that could rightfully be said to make claims that are not verified,
my page is most verifiably NOT a member of that set. Anyone can verify
every citation/claim I present, which is why I give such references.

It is outrageous that 60 Minutes would label citations from the 
major media as "disinformation" only when through them a picture
that 60 Minutes has repeatedly trashed comes through. Clearly, the
60 Minutes coverage of my page was false, misleading, and libelous.
But most outrageous, by not citing the web URL so that people could
verify Ms. Stahl's claims, 60 Minutes made defamatory claims about 
my work that are proven by fact to be unverifiable, poorly researched, 
and that therefore constitute pure disinformation -- all the features 
they sought to dump on me. 

Considering that I'm pointing a finger at the military and that 
CBS is owned by a major military contractor...  ahem. Also, it's
all too clear to all who have seen the segment that 60 Minutes
is terrified of the competition that the Internet represents,
and that I was targeted with malice of intent.

[BTW, there is a web page now, http://www.fourthturning.com.  The details
of the cycles I describe below came from here.]

It's hard to judge the accuracy of the cycles picked out in this book
and the earlier Generations unless you know history well.  What were
things really like in the 1910's, the 1870's?  The authors describe
events which fit pretty well into the cycles, but who knows whether
they are being selective?  One solution would be to look at what other
historians say about this work.  Does anyone here have information about
what the authors' peers say?

I did notice a few areas in which their cycles did not seem to work very
well.  They identify a cyclic period which extends from the beginning of
the Depression until the end of WWII, roughly the 1930's and early 40's;
the next period encompasses the post-war years up until the early 1960's;
then we have the social unrest of the 60's up through the mid 1980's,
and finally we have the current period, from 1984 through the early
2000's, which is a recap of the 30's and WWII.  This should terminate
with another crisis analogous to WWII, around 2005.

Looking at recent times, I'm not sure it fits.  The authors have a
break at the re-election of Ronald Reagan in 1984, the "Morning in
America" campaign.  Since then we are supposedly in a period of malaise,
uncertainty, discontent, which will culminate in this crisis which is
coming up.  But I don't really perceive there to have been a change
in the national mood in the middle 1980's, nor for the period up until
then to have been a continuation of the 1960's.  In fact, it's hard for
me to imagine anyone looking at recent history and outlining the period
from 1964 to 1984 as having a coherent national mood, distinct from that
which follows.

There was a huge difference between the social unrest of 1964-1974 and
later years.  Beyond that the 70's were a largely forgettable decade,
with none of the energy and spirit of the 1960's.  Jimmy Carter lost his
presidency largely because he complained of a "malaise" infecting the
American spirit.  I don't recall a shift in mood in the middle 1980's,
either.  It certainly didn't seem like the final end of the "age of
aquarius", the death of the hippie.  That had happened long before.

Then, they have to compare the present day with the Great Depression.
This doesn't fit at all.  Yes, there is uncertainty, worry, concern;
new technologies (the net, biotech) are forcing people to adjust.
But people have been talking about this all my life.  Future Shock was
written in 1970.

We face nothing like the challenges and hardships people had to deal with
from 1929 through 1946.  Trying to map this to 1984 through 2005 doesn't
seem to work well at all.  At best we can postulate that something will
happen which will make us pull together as people did during that phase,
but it doesn't seem to me that we are going into the next decade with
the same emotional attitudes that people must have had after ten grinding
years of severe economic hardship.

Some of authors' characterizations do work pretty well; the can-do era
of the postwar years is distinctly different from the earlier and later
times.  Whether that really matches some 19th century period, I have no
idea.  But the more recent periods don't fit well with my memories and
perceptions.

The problem is that the same trade-off applies to both poor and rich
families.  More children, given the same health, gives a greater probablity
of surviving offspring.  Better health, given the same number of children,
also gives a greater probability of surving offspring.  Choosing between
quantity and quality of offspring is thus a classic economic choice between
two goods with a limited budget.

The normal outcome if you have to choose amounts of two good things when your
budget (here wealth) increases is to get more of *both*.  Hence you would
expect wealthier families to choose to have more kids *and* invest more in
the kids they have.  The number of kids will go up more slowly than the
wealth, as each kids is getting more resources, but it will still increase.
 This is indeed how animals respond to increased resources, insofar as they
have control over the quantity and quality of offspring, and it was also the
situation in early modern (pre-industrial) Europe.  It's conventional wisdom
that this situation applies to most other pre-industrial societies.

The puzzle is why this outcome does not apply to industrial societies.

Incidentally, I think there is some complexity to the relation between
industrial-era wealth and population growth.  England was by far the most
advanced country from the 1600's almost up to WWI by a plethora of economic
measures (per capita income, per capita industrial production, date of first
freedom from famine, etc.)  But the first country to undergo the demographic
transition (smaller families for the wealthy and voluntarily falling
birthrates) was France.

I believe the cause of falling birthrates is genetic, but memetic.  A
fundamental characteristic of modern society that is not characteristic of
any prior society is "too much interesting to do".  I think memes are
evolving to take advantage of us by being so interesting and fun that we want
to spend our time enjoying (and spreading) them rather than having children.

Wrong. If government works correctly, you don't work for the state but the state 
works for you. 

I *do* agree that this is often not the case today. That's what I want to improve. 
The problem is that government is too corrupt and influenced (usually even set up) 
by economy. For government does not have a general interest in acting "evil", but big 
biz has, in order to
  
	- sell more
	- get rid of competitors
	- get state subventions
	- pay fewer taxes

they would do anything they can. In non-anarchies this is a bit limited (they can't 
simply burn down their weaker enemies' factories), but as anarchies are not workable 
this is the only possibility they see.

And don't forget that all large companies are practically owned by investment banks 
like Morgan Stanley or Brown Brothers Harriman. There is no free market or real 
competition, just a search for the highes profit rates.

In addition, those who do the hardest physical work (workers in factories, farmers 
etc.) usually get the fewest money in capitalist systems and have to pay (relatively) 
the most. For one who gets a million each month could pay 995,000 and still live 
quite good. But one who gets 400 $ each month will have problems with paying 100 $ of 
taxes.

Wrong. I will only argue for Germany. We have a maximum income tax scale of 53 % 
(which is supposed to be shortened to 40 % this year), but nobody pays that much. It 
isn't different in the USA or anywhere else. Those who "work" more and make more 
money (mainly by being unscrupulous and corrupt) often don't pay any taxes as all, as 
they can afford the best tax advisors available.

That's why the share of wealth in Germany is so unjust. With 4,7 million people 
unemployed, 150,000 millionaires and about 50 billionaires it is obvious that the 
problem is not government, but economy.

Ah, and they have about 60 % MITS in Japan. 

Freedom is an illusion. Free markets cannot exist, because money accumulates and 
companies get more powerful the more money they have. They don't spend this money in 
developing better products, but in advertising their existing ones and getting rid of 
their competitors. If companies invest, they do not invest in employees but in what 
promises the highest profit. 

Capitalism is the true pyramid system. Lots of people pay and few get the money. In 
the end, there's mass poverty, hunger and a few very, very rich (but usually not very 
clever) guys.

I only see one motivation that drives all Libertarians. It's not the desire for 
freedom or the desire for justics. It's pure greed. Oh yeah, and in some cases it's 
stupidity.

I guess this is true.  Have you gone to the page to check the stuff
out?  I personally wouldn't use it to buy physical property, but I guess
some people could.

OK, please forgive my ignorance.  How exactly does inflation work? 
Doesn't it have to do with the money supply or something like that? 
Also, doesn't it affect the prices of goods(ie: increase the cost),
which in turns increases inflation?  which in turn increases cost,
etc....  Or am I wrong about that?  I oppose government interference in
the economy, however, I admit, I'm somewhat naieve on the theory behind
it all.  I've read a little here and there, but I need to learn more. 
OK, so how does a monopoly benefit from inflation?  

Now, reading that you said "so long as there is a relatively fixed
amount of currency", I can reply: For each person going in, there is
only 50 nella going into the account.  (however, there is a bonus for
introducing other businesses.  I know, it sounds like a ponzi scheme now
that I mention that, but is it really?)  Anyways, isn't that a
relatively fixed amount of currency(the 50 nella)?  I apologize for
asking so many questions, but I want to learn more, and asking questions
is a good way to start.  I'll probably go search the web for some more
in depth treatment, too.

I know that's exactly the problem in America.  The FED is a
fractional-reserve system, isn't it?  Also, ever since the Fed has been
in existence, we've lost our gold standard, correct?  Hong Kong still
works on the gold standard?  How well is their economy?  I know it works
pretty well, but are they better off than Americans?  In general, are
the average Hong Kong people more prosperous than the standard
American(by average and standard, I mean middle class).  Also, how bad
is poverty in Hong Kong?  If you don't know these things, that's fine. 
Just looking for more information.

Haven't seen that one before, but it must be a derivation from one I have
seen: "extrophy" (with an h) meaning a turning out.

I did mention the web page above in my original message.  In addition
I gave a link to a web page review by someone with history expertize.

This was my biggest concern, and why I didn't endorse it as strongly
back in '95.  But I have since talked to Caltech historians who think the
authors are reasonable people, have learned that historians are widely
aware of their work (they just gave a talk at Harvard), and I have
seen that while there have been negative reviews (NYT Book Review
1/26, Publisher's Weekly 1/6), they haven't been of the form I was
concerned about: "The got their facts all wrong."

I think you're taking the boundaries too seriously.  The key idea is
that there are cycles with a roughly 80-90 year period.  For example,
about now is the mid third turning, where we should see a min gender
role gap and weakest families, max individualism and diversified
social structure.  About 1974 we should have seen max
underprotectiveness of kids, max focus on "inner worlds". (I'm reading
all this off of the chart on p.105)  These all fit to me.  

>Then, they have to compare the present day with the Great Depression.

Huh?  The Depression was a fourth turning, comparable to what we may
soon face, not to now.

A number of the AIDS indicator diseases are not opportunistic infections
preying on immune-deficient hosts, including dementia, wasting syndrome,
and the various AIDS cancers-Kaposi's sarcoma, the lymphomas, and, as
of 1993, cervical cancer. 

HIV would have to kill T-cells while destroying brain neurons it cannot
infect and at the same time induce white blood cells and skin cells to
grow malignantly.  Despite years of research, no evidence can be found
that the immune system fights cancer cells, which, after all, are a part
of the host's own body.  Dozens of AIDS patients with Kaposi's
sarcoma or dementia have been reported to have normal immune
systems. [H. Barcellar, A, Munoz, E.N. Miller, E.A. Cohen, D. Besley,
O.A. Selnes, J.T. Becker, and J.C. McArthur, "Temporal trends in
the incidence of HIV-Related Neurological Diseases: Multicenter AIDS
cohort study: 1985-1992," Neurology, 44 (1994): 1892-1900.]

A new disease forces medical experts to search for the new cause. They
have a reponsibility to consider both possibilities for an epidemic:

(1) a contagious, infectious agent such as a microbe or a virus or

(2) some noninfectious cause such as a poor diet or some toxic substance
in the environment or a toxin consumed. 

The period of research into the cause of AIDS which considered both
agents lasted only 3 years. It ended in April 1984 when our government
announced at a press conference that HIV caused AIDS prior to the
publication of any scientific evidence.

> OK, so how does a monopoly benefit from inflation?  

Hmm.  Not sure which basic Econ books best deal with those issues.
You might start with Friedman's "Price Theory" (which you can get
online from his web site <http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/>), but a more
general Econ work might be better.  Monopoly-issued currencies tend
to inflate because the issuer can use inflation to essentially tax
every piece of currency they have issued, transferring some of its
value from the holders to the issuer, without having to go out and
steal it physically.  Just double the amount of currency presently
in circulation; it's worth half as much, but now you own half of it.

I don't want to get into the whole fractional-reserve debate here; I can
go to humanities.philosophy.objectivism for that.  I'll just say that no,
I don't think fractional-reserve banking is a problem of itself; in fact,
I think it's a great way to do business.  The problem is non-fixed value
currency issued by a monopoly.

No, Hong Kong is not on a gold standard.  That sentence was a bit
ambiguous; I meant to say only that they have no government-issued
currency; their primary currencies are privately issued by two banks.
Their economy does quite well, but I think it would be unfair to
compare it to the US, which has so many more natural resources than
they do.

I thought they perfected the IVF technology with animals, so there
wasn't much risk to humans.   I would expect a similar approach with
cloning.

Saw the head of this commission on CSPAN yesterday.  He said they want
90 days to study the question.  They will have lots of religious
leaders on the commission, but he said it was very hard to find
someone in favor of human cloning, but they'd try to dredge up
someone.  If they publish an email address to send comments to, I hope
someone posts it here.

I am amazed and frightened by the strength of the reaction against
cloning.  No concrete scenarios of anyone being harmed by cloning are
being put forward!  All I've seen are complaints that people wanting
cloned kids must be selfish and/or weird.  Everyone agrees on this and
disagrees how concerns for this should weigh against the potential for
medical research.  I fear for the future of self-modification, at
least for a few decades.

Dementia is not a disease; it's a symptom, and it's quite common with
anything affecting the brain, as many diseases do.  Also, AIDS dementia is
often relatively mild and would be hard to detect in something that can't
talk (like an experimental ape).

Wasting syndrome is not a disease; it's a symptom.  It's also common with
chronic gastrointestinal problems, which many AIDS patients have.

Many cancers, including cervical cancers and lymphomas, can be caused by
viruses.  Remember what the original name for HIV (HTLV-III) stood for?  The
immune system may not be responsible for fighting the cancer cells, but it's
definitely responsible for fighting the virus that makes the cell cancerous.

The causal agent for Kaposi's isn't currently known; it isn't HIV, but its
higher incidence rates amongst homosexuals with AIDS than amongst hemophiliac
indicate an agent capable of sexual transmission.  Its absence amongst
immunodeficient apes shouldn't surprise anybody.

(Unless the apes have been going to gay disco bars and scoring :-)

Hey there,
  I'm working on writing an extropian sci-fi story.  I've got just a few
ideas written down now.  now, my biggest worry, is a thing I have
involving destructors.  Would it somehow be possible for a universal
destructor to be created, that could basically eat the whole universe,
and of course, destroy it?  I know that eventually, the mass contained
in this destructor would cause it to implode or something to that
matter.(I'm just not having a very high brain active day today... urgh. 
The words aren't coming out right... Oh well...)  Anwyays, is it
feasible to have an army of destructors destroy the universe, and create
a singularity(by having the mass concentrated so densely) similar to the
one in the origin of the big bang?  If not, is there a way I could
destroy the universe/speed up things to the "big crunch"...  I need to
do this in the story, and the destructors are an idea I like, but I
don't know if it's technically possible.  But then again, I suppose I
could do like Star Trek, and if it doesn't fit the physics we know, just
make it up!  I could use any help on this matter.  I've read Physics of
Immortality and that has a little helpful info.  Also Engines of
Creation is a start, but I need to learn more on something like this. 
thanks!

Peace,
-dave

This thread started by my mentioning a study showing that in a
*pre-industrial* society, wealthy dads did not have more kids.  

Right.  No doubt in some pre-industrial societies, wealthy dads did not have
more kids.  There's a lot of variety in human societies.  But in most, they
had more, at least according to conventional wisdom.  In Europe, with fairly
good records of births and social standing, it was definitely the case.  I'll
wager it's also the case in any other large society with good records (e.g.
China or the Ottoman Empire) or we'd already have heard about it.

It is really too bad that it would be absolutely impossible for you to sue
them (and win).  I wonder if an attempt would generate significant media

Did anyone videotape any of the episodes of Future Fantastic in which we
appeared? The BBC producer who made the show seems to have vanished and we
never received copies. Not having cable TV, we didn't see the shows. If you
could loan us them -- to be returned promptly -- we'd be grateful.

Actually, I think it's a very good thing that he can't sue and win.  60
minutes has as much right to irresponsible speech as anyone else, and I
for one wouldn't have it any other way.  If there's any crime here, it
is that too many people buy into the pretense of objectivity of the
media, or expect the media to be fair.  Far better we should teach our
children that /all/ speech is biased, there are /no/ reliable sources,
and you must make up your own mind.  Caveat Lector.

I think this is a reasonable concern, but note that each act of 
"natural conception" is also an "experiment" and the rate of
"natural" birth defects is significant. One could screen parents to
look for whether double recessive genes might appear thru
recombination but this is not commonly done. In fact, I saw a
married couple on tv that had children even though they knew there
was a one quarter chance each child would have cystic
fibrosis. Note, here, I am not arguing about whether screening 
should or should not be done. I mention this example to illustrate 
the fact that current default ethical systems do not prevent people
from creating progeny even when the danger of birth defects is high.

I fully grant that the more explicit you can make your reasoning, the
better you and others can trust it.  On the other hand, formal
explicit reasoning takes more time and is more costly.   The choice
between them depends on the extra costs and benefits in any given
situation. 

I just don't agree that the costs of formal explicit reasoning always
outweigh the benefits as soon as you deal with social issues or try to
persuade other people.   Things are really much more complex that
that. Nor do I agree that the predictive value of informal
analysis falls to zero in such contexts.  

Our ordinary lives are full of social issues and persuasion contexts
where we appropriately use just as much hueristic analysis as you do
when driving.  No need to feel guilty about driving heuristically nor
about heuristic social analysis.  But of course one's confidence in
any one prediction should take into account the type of analysis used,
the solidity of the data it was based on, and the strength of
connection perceived between the data and related models and predictions.

That does make sense except that libel (according to legal definitions)
crosses the line from speech to action.  Of course, it is still wise to
consider bias in any work.

Well, I am planning on taping them this coming sunday when they're supposed
to repeat in sequence on TLC because I missed a few but Regina taped the
Cryonics one I missed last night which you two were probably in.

I would have thought that Extropians would be the last people to believe
in 80 year cycles.  We're supposed to be the people challenging the notion
that the future will be a repetition of the past.

The daily program is called "Science Frontiers". The weekly focus was
called "Future Fantastic", hosted by Gillian Anderson (Scully on the
X-Files). The episode in question with Max More on Extropians was called
"The Immortals" and aired 10:00 pm EST (and again later at 1:00 am) 
Thursday Night 6 March on TLC (the learning channel) here in the US. 

I only saw Wednesday's episode on colonizing space, Thursdays episode on
cryonics, nanotechnology, Extropy, Up-Loading, , and Fridays episode on
meeting other life in the universe. My machine ate my tapes. I would love
a copy of the entire series, as well, if anyone comes across them. What I
saw was incredible.

We can only make the future different if we recognize the cycles and
then do something to change them. As long as we refuse to recognize the
cycles we are determined to repeat them. Recognizing cycles is one of
the major observations which makes prediction in science possible. Very
fundamental.

Ah, this is a fun subject. The ultimate form of terrorism, as somebody on 
the Omega Point Theory List put it. 

My favorite way of destroying the universe is the Tumult (as Gregory 
Benford called the concept): if our kind of vacuum isn't the "true" 
vacuum but a metastabla state, it might be possible to somehow make it 
decay into true vacuum. This would start a catalytic process, as the true 
vacuum would spread at lightspeed and cause the release of immense 
amounts of energy. In the true vacuum our particle states would no longer 
be stable, and other particles would be stable i.e. total destruction of 
the Universe As We Know It. 

Another fun idea was presented in Peter Nilssons excellent novels
_Rymdvaktaren_ and _Nyaga_ (unfortunately only in Swedesh AFAIK). In his
quite elaborate cosmology (essentially, universes are partially built by
the knowledge from previous universes by jupiter brain-like beings
preserving all information) it might be possible to hack the laws of
nature - by introducing the right information into the universe you could
sabotage it, making it unravel completely.

Well, I could imagine something like a spreading army of von Neumann
machines that build copies of themselves and launch them, then build
megastructures around stars to control them, and start to move the stars
around to cause a Big Crunch-like effect (might be used to close off a
portion of the universe for an Omega Point if the universe is flat or
open?). It will take a lot of time, of course.

Objective reality is the least common denominator of shared, exogenous
reality. It is for me, the least interesting facet of reality. It is
important for many to "dedicate" their minds to it in order to further
extroverted science, but it completely ignores and often denies
subjective or endogenous realities. I find a much higher pleasure, and
even ecstasy, in interacting with a select group of people who I have
cultivated similar experiences with so that we can penetrate truly
unexplored and hitherto unknown realms of subjective reality.

It is because so many people have dedicated their minds to objective
reality and because so few people haved dedicated their minds to
subjective reality that we find ourselves rapidly expanding science and
technology while as a whole we have not matured much at all in several
thousand years. 

There is an overwhelming taboo in society to prefer endogenous space
over exogenous space. So it has gone undeveloped, unaugmented. Whos to
say that if we had not spent the last 500 years focusing on internal
augmentation rather than or in combination with external augmentation
that we would not have discovered by now how to do for ourselves what we
now require external objects for? What if we had spent all this time
developing mental tools for observing our own minds, like we have
created so many tools to observe the exteranl world, e.g., microscopes,
telescopes, etcettera? What if we had started emotive education 500
years ago, and cultivated the skills for observing endogenous reality?
Why do we not teach visualization skills in our schools? Why do we
insist on being blind to what lies within? There is a whole frontier
waiting for us that we have not begun to explore. Are you certain that
if we had not focused on the external and had rather focused on the
subtleties of the internal that we could not have discovered telepathy
rather than radio? Are you certain of that? According to the Future
Fantastic series, the CIA and many reputable scientists [in contrast to
the CIA] are not so certain of that.

What propelled external science was its tools for observation which made
prediction possible, but we have never rigorously developed the mental
tools for observing endogenous reality. Most people cannot even hold an
image in their mind, not to mention keep it sharp and unmoving. Very few
people have ever attempted any form of bio-feedback, and fewer yet have
been successful at it. These things require more discipline than most
people are willing to have. We REQUIRE government because we lack
self-discipline, we are blind to and mostly ignorant of an entirely
different paradigm of reality because we lack self-discipline.

Our minds are unbelievable technological devices, yet we have put out
relatively little effort to understand them firsthand, we'd rather probe
at someone elses rather than enter our own. Its like trying to
understand a computer by looking at a monitor while using a multi-meter
to probe whats happening on the circuit board. We are completely
ignoring the operating language. In this case our emotions. What is
better, the psychiatrist that "cures" a persons depression by giving
them a drug, or the psychologist who cures a persons depression by
teaching them to think in a new way and thus to change their CNS
chemical content directly themselves. The former person is dependent on
the drug, where the latter needs no drug. The latter has a better
understanding of the operating language where the former only
understands the hardware.
   

Stripped of religious idealogy, I believe a subjective science could be
created that would eventually surpass or at the least, seriously
augment, objective science in its usefulness, but we are lazy.

laziness, laziness, laziness, laziness.  

Our minds are more powerful than computers are today. We have idiot
savants to show us just how incredible our potential is. Yet we choose
to create computers rather than to truly enhance our minds. 
  
Lets say we developed skills of internal observation, visualiztion,
emotive sensitivity, etcettera, and then we developed skills of
bio-feedback, the ability to control autonomous bodily functions. We are
matter, localized energy, whats to say that with sufficient
intermiediary steps that we could not move on from bio-feedback to
controlling our energy in new and profound ways. We are always
discovering new and profound things via objective science. We would do
the same if we took the other path. So just entertain me for a moment as
I scenario-spin what must sound absolutely ridiculous to you, but if we
did at some point learn how to directly manipulate the energy that makes
us up, could we not then eventually overcome our needs for shelter,
food, air, etcetera. Could we not travel great distances by merely
changing the structure of our own energy, modifying ourselves so that we
could propel ourselves at and sustain high speeds. 

I believe people cannot imagine such today in the same way that once
people could not imagine a round world, or traveling to the moon. You
might say that what I am talking about has been tried before, and it has
failed, but it has not truly been tried before, not in the way objective
science has. The tools for observation necessary for subjective science
have never been adequately developed, and even when one person begins to
develop them, it is difficult to find another person with the
self-discipline necessary to do the same. Such has almost been entirely
defered to religion, which has its own goals which hinder the kind of
advancement I am speaking about. And even in religion, relatively few
religions teach basic observation skills, that which is most
fundamentally necessary to ever realizing an endogenous science. 

We are so incredibly unaware of ourselves, and instead of developing the
enabling skills necessary to become directly aware of ourselves, we
create a stethescope, a middleman to do the job for us. There are many
people who are aware of their pulse and their breathing, people who can
even modify their pulse by merely thinking about it, people who can
modify their body tempature by merely thinking about it. But in general
we are too lazy to do for ourselves what we can create an object to do.
And thus we remain ignorant of our own workings and potential. Its much
easier to take a couple aspirin to reduce a fever than to spend a couple
weeks to a couple months learning how to reduce a fever via
bio-feedback. Again its laziness. Anything our body does autonomously we
can learn to become aware of and to modify ourselves. We could learn to
boost our own immune systems and not even require medicine, but we are
crude people. 

Fear and dislike of self: These two things compound our laziness in
hindering the realization of an endogenous science. Most people are
terrified of psychedelics. But its not the psychedelics that scare them,
its the confrontation with their endogenous reality that scares them,
the confrontation with self. People see demons and have repulsive
thoughts and then are repulsed by themselves. But instead of accepting
that it is a repulsion of self and a lack of discipline that causes
their bad trip, they say its the drug. The drug is evil, the drug is
bad. The drug caused their bad trip. Most people have no desire what so
ever to enter endogenous reality. The thought of it is terrifying and
potentially there really isn't anything more terrifying. The
subconscious is where these people have spent their life repressing all
their trashy thoughts. Once they see whats there, they are so
overwhelmed they never want to return. Its much safer in the objective
world. There are lots of people[automotons] to comfort them, and
thousands of tasks to keep their minds preoccupied so that they can live
a productive life without ever truly getting to know themselves.

Eventually I imagine the human species will branch off into new and
separate species following different evolutionary courses. I don't find
it likely that we will continue evolving along the same path forever.
Looking at evoltion as a whole, it actually seems very unlikely that we
will not branch off. One thing that may affect this branching, perhaps a
hundred years from now or two thousand years from now or more, will be a
choice between endogenous and exogenous reality, internal augmentation
versus external augmentation. 

So in conclusion, no, I do not plan to dedicate my mind to the task of
discovering what everyone shares, e.g. objective reality. That is the
path we take by default. There are plenty of people on it. We seem to be
genetically predisposed to make that decision. My mind is dedicated to
endogenous reality. Dead end? Perhaps, but science of any sort is about
taking chances. My sudden interest in Extropy has been in its interest
for attaining immortality. Though perhaps I might be delusioned, I'm not
dumb, objective science has a big head start on attaining immortality,
and if it makes such possible I will be the first to jump on that wagon,
buts once [if] I become immortal, I have forever to develop endogenous
science, endogenous realities, and thus a degree of autonomy that could
never be obtained via objective science which requires so many levels of
symbiosis, dependency, and conformity with the other. Nature is pretty
damn cool, but if I had several billion years, I think I could create
something a hell of a lot cooler.  

It is very easy to deny what you have never made a sustained and
disciplined effort to experience and more importantly to develop. The
scientists who speak most adamantly against endogenous science are those
who are most ignorant of endogenous reality.  

Objective science is a tool for observation. And every tool has its
limitations. I am suggesting the development of another tool, subjective
or more accurately, endogenous science [because its not absolutely
subjective, just as objective science is not absolutely objective] to
augment and perhaps one day [for some] to replace the former. This has
nothing to do with superstitions, mysticism, blind faith, or
irrationality. It is actually a response to the superstions, selective
blindness, and irrationality of objective science. Endogenous science is
about circumventing external tools of augmentation, and particularly
external tools of observation which are not necessary. Its benefits are
all the same that emotive education offers plus the realization of a
level of autonomy that could never be achieved via external
augmentation. The greater our autonomy, the less we need and are
influenced by the other [nature, people, government, devices, drugs,
etcetera], and thus the greater are our chances as immortals, to truly
live forever. Endogenous science is fantasy now in no less the same
sense that objective science is what science fiction was.

And with all that said, I still consider myself Extropian. Of the five
principles it is only the fourth that I must clarify for myself. For I
am all for intelligent technology, but if its possible for me to develop
my brain to do something as quickly and effectively or more so than
external technology can, then I will opt for the former. It would be
ludicrous for an idiot savant who has the ability to rapidly count or do
arithmatic to use a calculator, he/she can do so faster than he/she
could even turn the calculator on. I will not use technology as an
excuse not to take responsibility for my own self-development. Again
what is better, the psychiatrist that "cures" a persons depression by
giving them a drug, or the psychologist who cures a persons depression
by teaching them to think in a new way and thus to change their CNS
chemical content directly themselves. I believe the latter active person
has several distinct advantages over the former passive patient. Deny
them if you will. I guess its easier to just give someone a drug. We
should probably stick to whats easiest. A dear friend of mine went to a
psychiatrist for the first time, she had not been there more than 20
minutes before the psychiatrist prescribed prozac to her. Its nice that
we have such simple solutions today.


Its easier to be disciplined by the government than to discipline
oneself. Its easier to be disciplined by a drug than to discipline
oneself. Its easier to be a passive recipiant rather than an active
participant. Its my understanding that Extropians are advocates of
self-governing, self-responsibility, and dynamic participation ... then
why would we choose external technology solely over internal technology.
Why would we choose dependency on external objects when we can
potentially do the same for ourselves via a better understanding and
more disciplined control over what we already have? Humans are a
wasteful lot. I have simply chosen to attempt a degree a balance.  


"And how could there exist a 'common good'! The expression is a

refined, and, in sum, all rare things for the rare." [Nietzsche]

Gregory Houston writes a long piece on developing his "natural" mental
abilities in a scientific fashion, as an alternative to exploring the
"objective" world.  This is interesting to me as someone who spent many of
his younger years studying Asian ideas, cultures and history.  He writes:

As a matter of historical fact, I think the answer to the first question lies
in the predicate to the second statement, as illumnated by Joseph Needham's
magnum opus "Science and Civilization in China".  Years ago, Needham asked
himself the question, "Why didn't China, with its highly developed
civilization, never have an industrial revolution?"  He died still writing
one volume after another of answers to this question.

In his piece, Gregory basically descibes the goals, disciplines and
techniques of "yoga", classical Taoism and Hinayana Buddhism in its various
forms, including Zen.  Anyone who makes even a superficial -- but open minded
-- study of these subjects can't help but be impressed by the deep insights
into the nature of consciousness and powerful tools for effective living
developed by their purest devotees.

The problem, and the reason why these philosophies and disciplines were
ultimately dead ends up until now, was the very lack of objectively correct
connection with the external world possessed in the great minds who developed
them.  Crippled by only the most primitive understanding of "objective
reality", most of these yogis and masters were unable to avoid a slide from
insight into and development of their own "software" and "operating systems"
into completely misguided beliefs and assertions about "objective reality"
and metaphysics. The very best of them -- who surely rank with Einstein and
Newton as amongst the greatest minds produced by the "natural" human race --
realized their ignorance about objective reality and tried to avoid such
explorations and assertions.  But, in doing so, they were cut off from some
of the most important truths and tools their other accomplishments could have
built on.  If only Gautama had known a little basic physics or biology!  If
only Lao T'zu had had a basic chemistry lab at his disposal.  We'd probably
all be speaking Hindi or Mandarin now.

But they didn't and we don't and there's a reason.  The reason is that their
civilizations did not have within them the seeds to generate the scientific
method, those seeds being a foundation of individual liberty and the
associated social structures of a free market that ruthlessly disciplines
refusal to understand and come to terms with "objective reality".  It is with
deep sympathy that one perceives the mental and social contortions the great
Asian thinkers went through to deal with this cultural handicap.  The Buddha
raised conceptual walls against metaphysical speculation that most of his
followers ignored.  Lao T'zu founded a tradition of eccentric hermeticism to
avoid the stifling social bonds and restrictions of Confucianism.  But in
doing these things, the great Asian thinkers crippled the power of their own
insights.

Only in the West, with its cultural roots in the Agora of Athens and the
Roman virtues of civitas, could the power of human technological engagement
with "objective reality" be unleashed.  Only in the European bourgoise
societies of the Renaissance could that power be limitlessly amplified
through the feedback mechanism of the scientific method.  Has the West, with
its ignorance of "the inner path", been somehow fundamentally poorer because
of its focus on the "outer" world?  In a sense, yes.  But, as the "goals,
disciplines and techniques" of extropianism highlight, it may also have been
the only way to give birth to possibilities that are literally infinitely
richer.  

Is it time to look back to the "wisdom of the East" and look inward to
untapped riches within?  As visionaries like Huxley and Leary foresaw, I
think the answer is a resounding yes.  However, we must seek a new synthesis
that vigilantly guards against the unfortunate -- but as I point out above,
inevitable -- errors of the traditional wisdom of the East.

For a rich technomad running a business over the Net, emigration is merely
a matter of getting on a plane to another country. While I was travelling
around the world last year few people noticed that I was in a different
country every few weeks and several people offered me contract work
(sadly, horrid Windows programming) over the Net. As communications
technology improves location becomes increasingly irrelevant for business,
and people will have a strong incentive to, say, work for an American
company for American salaries but live in Thailand.

If most business can be moved online, then we enter a situation where
countries will become the kind of proprietary communities I was talking
about earlier, vying with each other to attract the most successful
technomads in return for their taxes. This may be one important route
towards the kind of societies we talk about, and is probably one important
reason why governments are trying hard to screw up the Net.

It's also worth remembering that before the last election the media polls
were predicting a Labour win by several percentage points (with only one
percent error in the polls), yet oddly enough that didn't happen. Being a
recovering socialist nation people don't like to admit that they are
selfish folks who might vote for the Conservative party so they tend to
lie to pollsters. This left many prominent market research organisations
with several tons of egg on their face. 

So all in all I won't be surprised if Labour win, but I wouldn't bet on it
either. In fact the Deputy Prime Minister was today claiming that he
expected to win the election by sixty seats. If the polls really are false
and that makes more Conservative voters turn out then he may well be
right.

That is not correct.  It was published in 1983 not 1984 in _Science_ (the
year before the U.S. announcement) with full peer review.  It was sent in
1983 the all AAAS members (100,000 members?) and 30-35,000 ASM members in ASM
News (I've been a member since 1976).  How convenient to forget this.  See
also _Manual of Clinical Microbiology_ 5th Edition page 1011 and 1020. 
 
The search for a viral cause of AIDS ended in 1983 when the Pasteur Institute
(Barre-Sinoussi et al. Science 220:868-871 1983) blabbed their ( 10
scientists) research too fast and the American's (13 scientists) saw an
opportunity to steal the discovery of one of the causes of AIDS.   
 
HIV is probably the easiest causes to find since it has been found in
millions of AIDS cases.    But, my theory is there are many more causes than
HIV since this is a syndrome there are usually multiple causes.  HIV was
simply the easiest cause to find.

Now just wait one minute here. . . This is a contradiction in terms "AIDS"

I disagree:  What about the spontaneous cancer remission cases.  No theories
on the immune system helping in that?  I seem to remember several theories in
JAMA on that.  I just can't help think we have not found all the human cancer
virus (besides HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) as in the non-human roux sarcoma retrovirus
cancer virus.

Of course, retrovirus RNA directed DNA synthesized DNA is trapped in all
humans due to the incorporation into the human genone and transfered each
successive generation.  The immune system apparently has a hard time finding
DNA made by this process.  So the human cancer virus might not exist as a
virus anymore having just become part of the "normal" human genone.

You might like to look at some older studies/reports on HIV-2 since it may be

1.  Ayanian et al. HIV-2 in U.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 320:1422-1423, 1989

320: 953-958 

(Also look for HTLV-3 since that is what HIV used to be called before the
name changed.)

Have you read Steven B. Harris, M.D. in _Skeptic_ Vol. 3 No.2 1995 esp. p. 51
. . . etc.?

More reports (too many?):  The first report of HIV-1 Group O AIDS infection
in the U.S. is reported in _Emerging Infectious Diseases_  Vol. 2 No. 3

But that is not required.  HIV can cause a lot of damage and set off a chain

many cells in a body.  That's why it is a "syndrome" after all.  Retroviruses
inducing cancer gene activation is a theory for example.   _Clostridium

being present at all, through neutotoxin formation.  Human cells infected
with HIV making some changes in cell/organism metabolism, like a neurotoxin,
is another theory.

In 1983, Gallo published a paper in Science in which he claimed that a
retrovirus called HTLV-I caused AIDS [Gallo, R.C., P.S. Sarin, E.P.
Gelmann, M. Robert-Guroff, and E. Richardson.  Isolation of human
T-cell leukemia virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Science 220 (1983): 865-867.].

In 1984, under dubious cicumstances, he took credit for isolating a 
retrovirus he called HTLV-III from a number of AIDS patients.  This virus 
was later renamed the HIV virus.  His paper claiming this virus as the cause 
of AIDS was published in April of 1984 in Science [Gallo, R.C., 
S.Z. Saladhuddin, M. Papovic, G.M. Shearer, M. Kaplan, B.F. Haynes, 
T.J. Palker, R. Redfield, J. Oleske, B. Safai, G. White, P. Foster, and 
P. D. Markham. Frequent detection and isolation of cytopathic retrovirus 
(HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and at risk for AIDS. Science 224 ]
(1984): 500-503.]

More than one week BEFORE the publication of the paper claiming that 
the virus later renamed HIV causes AIDS was published in Science, 
Gallo's and his employer, the Department of Health and Human Services, 
sponsored a hugely attended press conferences at which Margaret Heckler 
declared this new virus was the probable cause of AIDS.

How convient to substitute a paper on another virus for the one we are

I was wrong. It was Davin C. Enigl, (Sole Proprietorship) MEAS who 
posted that reply.  My appologies.

But I'd still like to read the new paper reporting this chimp study that
is so add odds with the ones I am already familiar with.

Gen X is not the only generation around, is politically weak for its
size, and need not be an indicator of future generations to follow.
"that book" predicts otherwise.  Why do you hate it?

How many of you have memorized "Atlas Shrugged"?
I'm looking for a passage to quote.  I read AS just once,
about 11 years ago, and don't care to re-read it just to
find that page.  So I appeal for help in narrowing the
search.  The passage I want is where the planners tell
Reardon about the Steel Unification Plan:
	"You're going to love it."
	"Don't tell me what I think of it - tell me what it is

Business:  	Transhuman Posters
		1.  From Cat Woman to Transhuman*

Business:  I have reopened my commercial poster design business. This time,
I will not be using my 4-color serigraph press because of the toxic fumes.
Therefore, I am looking for anyone who has access to an electronic printing
system such as an Iris or Canon.  If you either work for such an electronic
printing operation, or have an investment in same, please contact me soonest.

To further your interest, please let me highlight:

Concept:  Transhumans of tomorrow illustrating figurative images with a mix
of savior-faire, extropic thought and daring.  

*FIRST DESIGN: The first poster image will be a remake of my father's award
winning commercial photo of Cat Woman (Julie Newmar) of  "Batman."  The
image depicted her standing in a shinny gold swim suit on the beach with a
harpoon.  (Other models who posed for him were Raquel Welch, Sharon Tate and
Jill St. John. )  The transhuman rendition of my father's image will be a
Transhuman Woman in silicon skin.  The beach will be another environ, the
harpoon might be a different wepon, perhaps something with which to compat
death with.

(Note:  these images will in no way be gender biased.  In fact, in
pre-production are men, and other genders.)

Thank you.

IAN: My first inclination was possible legal action. But by libertarian
lines of argumentation, such is not necessarily an ethical course. They 
have a big megaphone, I have a smaller megaphone.  I slam those subsets 
of society I disagree with, they slam those subsets, like me, that they 
disagree with. I slam with facts and logical analysis, they slam with
innuendo and suppression of truth, such as the truth that my claims
were not false but based upon verifiable witness accounts from the
major media itself. I now have a copy of the 60 Minutes smear job.

With the article I've co-authored with reporters Pierre Salinger and Mike 
Sommer to be published in a major European magazine next week, I suspect 
I've only seen the beginning.  I suspect 60 Minutes was just a shot 
across the bow. I'm ready for battle. The FBI has been harassing and 
threatening several of my research associates, but we're standing strong. 

Of the three research associates I cited as on my crash-analysis report,
two have been hit on by the FBI. The FBI is threatening one, Marshall
Houston, with search warrants.  They seem to think he has too much 
evidence, he does not. They fear he has the satellite data or a video 
of the missile hit, but he does not. Richard Russell, the former crash
investigator and American Airlines pilot who wrote the "anonymous
internet document" now has the radar tape, and the major medias
have seen it and willfully ignore it, except in Europe. 

Knowing the full story, anyone can see this is a massive cover-up and 
the small-time investigators are getting stepped on because we are on 
the right track. The long short, is that the Military Industrial Complex
(MIC), clearly implicated in the TWA 800 disaster, owns so much, is tied 
in with so much, that they have far more power to control the social flow 
of information than the majority of people realize. The FAA, Boeing, CBS, 
other media,... almost everyone in the deal is in bed with the MIC.

Even if by law I could sue them, from a libertarian line of ethics, 
I cannot sue them for having a bigger megaphone, that's my tough luck. 
If I don't like the heat, get out of the kitchen. But in fact, the more 
muck they throw at me, the more fuel they put in my engines. What 60 
Minutes said about my work only tells me I'm kicking their ass, and 
they know it. I'll soon cite it in whole, but in sum this is what 
Lesley Stahl said as she pointed to my TWA 800 graphic:

        "Shouldn't this be expunged? ...[because] it is 
        spreading fear and suspicion of the government..."

Having that said against one is the dream of all freedom writers.
We should fear the government,  and most particularly IF we can 
make a honest and logical case for such fear, which is what I've 
done and what I seek to do, and always based on reason and honesty.

If you want to slam "the establishment" you have to take the slams 
youself, 60 Minutes was one of them. The difference is that they will 
do it with innuendo, by false and misleading misrepresentation of facts 
in forums that negate retort with claims that no one can verify for 
themselves, while I'll do it with logic, facts and claims that people 
can verify. I try to avoid making claims that rest on my shoulders.

Check out the April 1997 issue of High Times, page 38,
on the shelves right now. There you will find a report 
I wrote on drug testing. High Times is an excellent
source of reliable news not available elsewhere.
You can also find this report here:

   http://www.erols.com/igoddard/drugtest.htm

I'm kind of upset that they made some changes to the 
article they did not clear with me.  They gave it a 
title I did not write, one that makes it a jab against 
private industry only. Such a jab is founded, but the 
basis is the State and Statism. Private sector profiteers
merely feed off the primary aggression of legal mandates 
effected via the apparatus of coercion that is the State.

I realize that to many of you, extropian ideals are philosophical. Well,
fair enough, but I consider myself a scientist, and I feel that there's no
room for pretention in science. First of all, the idea of a human or
posthuman or transhuman or anyotherprefixhuman with silicon skin isn't even
a concept out of science fiction, it's a concept out of stupid people trying
to be trendy. The crystals of pure silicon (Si) used as semiconductor chips
are used for the semiconductor properties of silicon. In addition, silicon's
crystaline lattice structure is very rigid (another reason it's used for
chips .. I don't think that "flaccid state components" would be a very good
marketing selling point), so that if someone did, in fact, have silicon
skin, they wouldn't be very mobile. So if a physicist did in fact develop
silicon skin, they would be considered the next Steven Hawking. Although,
not so much a brilliant physicist as an immobile one. A much better choice
for the skin of this transhuman woman would be a carbon (C) compound, since
so much of nanotechnology depends on organic chemistry, biochemistry, and
molecular biology. HEY! wait a minute! Our skin *IS* made of carbon .. How
do you like that? The future is here today. 
Drop the pretension, honey, it makes us all look like idiots. If I wanted
future fantastic with no basis in science, I'd read Mondo 2000 (and I do).

>(Note:  these images will in no way be gender biased.  In fact, in

I think that the images are kingdom biased! What about plants? eh?
Paramecium have a right to exist!! Don't they? .. speciesist ...

        A quick word from the wise: stick around on the list for awhile
before you make irrational insinuations.  The only pretension I've seen in

Given nanotech, transhuman/posthuman skin may look like anything we please.
See the active tattoos in Snowcrash, or flicker cladding in Rucker's
Software. Our virtual bodies in virtual worlds could easily look however we
want. Whether in VR or not, why shouldn't future skin look like silicon?

All silicon compounds are rigid, huh? I suppose all those women with
silicone breast implants must be really solid upfront then.

Drop the rudeness, buddy. You're new to this list and need to learn how to
communicate effectively. If you can't make your points with finenesse, go

	I believe that you have seriously misunderstood the intent!

	I have a few points to make here.  Transhumanism is a very
reasonable and scientifically sound philosophy, but we also make use of
imagery and creative talent, not always sticking with dedication to our
scientific principles in our art.  But that is the point.  Art exists, in
a large part, not only to express, but to inspire.  Art is not bound by
physical law, we are able to express situations that are beyond
our current ability.  I suggest that you refrain from trying to smother
our forward movement in your pessimism.  If you have valid, logical
disagreements, we will certainly hear them,  but please don't make wild
assumptions and accusations.

I'm amiss here.  I was referring to a bathing suit skin structure. Silicon
has various elements, according to my references. Because silicon dioxide,
or silica, has a low thermal coefficient of expansion, it is used in objects
subjected to wide ranges of heat and cold. And also, any of a group of
"semi-inorganic polymers based on the structural unit R2SiO, where R is an
organic group, characterized by wide-range thermal stability, high
lubricity, extreme water repellence, and physiological inertness and used in
adhesives, lubricants, protective coatings, paints, electrical insulation,
synthetic rubber, and prosthetic replacements for bodily parts."

You do have a point here, and one to consider from the perspective you
offer.  However, it is limited in scope. Perhaps I could have spent more
time in my post emphasizing what skin textures I will be presenting, but
that was *not* the intent of the post, clearly.

This manner is childish and silly. How can any comment you make be taken

Dear RavnStCrow (Nadia)  

Hello!  From Rudi Hoffman (RUDIHOFFMA@aol.com)

You write,

< I agree, but the sad fact is, most people think that we are sort of
incapable
 of rational actions, never mind being good... I have watched grown men sit
 and say that the only reason we don't commit mayhem on a regular basis is
 because we have something to fear ( God's wrath ) and/or that we have been
 ordered from on high, by a devine source...>

Part of the whole libertarian/ athiest/ extropian orientation, and a rather
foundational part, IMHO, is the concept that people *are* basically "good".
 Of course, there is quotes around "good" to acknowledge that this is a
rather ill-defined overused "line-drawing" word, but I think most of us have
a reasonable idea of what is meant by "good" here. 

It is interesting to me that the authoritarian approach to life, which I
would define as the opposite of libertarian/ athiest/ extropian assumes
people are basically "evil".  

Or at least, if we are left to our own devices, that our basic "evil nature"
will out.  The authoritarians therefore decide their infinite wisdom to
proclaim from "on high" what we may or may not do, think, or say.  

Perhaps there is a time for such a "revealed truth" type of orientation, when
we are not dealing with educated and knowledgeble adults.  

But for the FDA to tell me as a knowledgeable adult that I may not use a drug
or procedure that may save or improve my life, for example, is RIDICULOUS!  

Do you remember a few years back our "friends and protectors" at the FDA were
trying to pass regulations that would require prescriptions for megadose
vitamins and herbs?

Outrageous!  Fortunately, this was such clear cut violation of good sense and
good science that it did not happen, but equivalently "off the wall"
interventionists tactics are threatened by "do-gooders" continually.

"Thank God for athiests and freethinkers!" :)
 
 <Anyway, thanks for responding in an intelligent way to my joking about
 definitions, there has been some attempts lately to "redefine" extropy... in
 sometimes  bizarre ways...>

There is a listing somewhere written by Max More (I think) of some extropian
principals.  It is outstanding!  If anyone reading knows where this may be
posted on some board or other, please let me/ us know. 
 
< Not that your statement was bizarre in any way-  your 4 things, atheist,
  skeptic, cryonics ( life extension) and Libertarianism, are pretty much
 Extropic staples, I guess...>

 <"On with the Automorph">

I am intrigued with this. What does it mean?

Warmly,

Rudi

Does size really matter that much? It's not the size that counts, it's how
you use it. Seriously. Fuck the voting system. We all know voting means
very little when bureaucracy is involved.

>and need not be an indicator of future generations to follow.

Why is that?

>"that book" predicts otherwise.  Why do you hate it?

Exactly what you said. It's a bleak depressing look at the future. It's an
interesting concept but there are multiple things the book hasn't
meantioned that occurred but didn't fit into their meme. Besides each past
generation has had to become accustomed to the trends of the new. The
spiritual Awakening turn will not solve the problems meantioned in the
unraveling. Just because there alot of people complain about homosexuality
and how it conflicts with christianity won't mean that during the spiritual
awakening homosexuality will go away, people just adjust and become
accustomed to it and their so-called problems 'go away'. Catastrophic
events occur but they aren't linked to social behaviors. Also they meantion
that this book is an american true story. How does the rest of the world
fit into this? Many things going on around the world built up to WWII, it
had nothing to do with the state of society in the unraveling. If this
pattern were true, different societies all around the world would be in
different turns altogether due to cultural differences. How these turns
might interact could bring about different eras if this were true. But they
claim that all of society runs on this central clock. How do they explain
this? Celestial influences? Sunspots? Our location in relation to the rest
of the galaxy? Gravitational influences of the other planets? It's trash.

If I'm the boss and the state works for me then I should be able to fire the  
state whenever I want to. Unfortunately I can not, because I am not the boss 
and the state won't let me quit.
              

        >I *do* agree that this is often not the case today. 


On of the great understatements of all time.
                

        >The problem is that government is too corrupt and influenced         >(usually even set up) by economy. 


True, but that's not because we were just unlucky and elected the wrong 
politicians, it's inherent in the system. Suppose I want to make $10,000,  
there are two ways to go about it. I can work to repeal hundreds of special 
interest laws, each one costing me a few dollars, or I can lobby for the 
passage of one more special interest law that will give me and my friends
$10,000 and cost everybody else a dollar or two. The second method makes much 
more sense, it's far easier to pass one law than to repeal hundreds .

This sort of lobbying won't work in the free market. If I want an executive  
at GM to be promoted to a  position of greater power there is only one thing 
I can do to help that come about, purchase the product that the executive has 
been advocating. Bribery will help the executive's bank account but it will 
not help his chances for advancement, it will hurt it because his boss will  
note that his decisions have been poor and do  not made economic sense. 
The stockholders will note the same thing.

All this causes a lot of problems for government, the main trouble with 
theft is that it's  mostly a net loss, not just a transfer of funds. 
For the victim it is of  course a total loss, but what about the thief? 
A thief has a job and like all jobs it involves labor and expenses, in this 
case legal costs and loss of his livelihood when he's in jail. The net 
benefit in the interaction between thief and victim is only a small part of 
his income. He will likely expend 9$ worth of labor, labor he could have used 
to make money in other ways, in order to receive 10$ worth of stolen property.

This situation in no way changes when government is the thief. Individuals 
pay an enormous cost to try to protect themselves from this thief, 
accountants,  tax lawyers, and most important of all, the organization of 
resources to  minimize taxes rather that to maximize the generation of real 
wealth. The results is that  the net loss is close to or equal to the amount 
stolen by government.                    


        >For government does not have a general interest in acting  "evil",

What on Earth is evil about selling something to somebody who wants to buy it?

              
        >- pay  fewer taxes 

What on Earth is evil about protecting you possessions from theft?
              

        >- get rid of competitors          


There are two ways a company could get rid of competitors.

1) It could become more efficient than the competition. This would mean that    
   the company would be producing a product that individuals chose because   
   they liked it better than the alternative. In the name of human freedom    
   this horrible state of affairs can not be allowed, the government sees to   
   that.

2) The proper way to deal with a competitor who makes a product that is 
   better and cheaper than yours is to use your "clout" to lobby the    
   government to regulate your industry. I can't emphasize enough that 
   purpose of this regulation is only to increase individual freedom, and of    
   course the best way to do that is to have government agents use force or    
   the threat of force to stop anyone from making a product superior to mine.  
   What better way is there to promote free competition?
              

        >- get state subventions 


OK, you got 1 out of 4 right, that IS evil.

I fail to see the distinction. If you're making a ton of money then yours 
must be a great business to be in. I'm going to get in too, and I'm going to 
do my best to make an even higher  profit rate than you do.
              

        >those who do the hardest physical work (workers in factories,         
        >farmers  etc.) usually get the fewest money in  capitalist systems 
              

Yes, brute strength is the very easiest thing to automate. If a surgeon was 
going to cut me open and then put me back together again, I would hope he  
could demand more money for his services than somebody whose only skill was 
the ability to dig a ditch.


        >If companies invest, they do not invest in employees but in what

In other words they pay their employees what they're worth not what they want, 
just what you'd expect from an organization that is not a charity. If I can 
find somebody who can do your job better than you can and is willing to work 
for less, what is wrong with that? Look at it from the other side, suppose 
you found somebody who would pay you twice what you make now for fewer hours 
of work, would there be anything immoral in you quitting your present job?

Let me see if I have this straight: The problem with the world is that there 
are too many greedy people and you want more money. Most are too materialist 
and you want more material things. The poor want a more affluent lifestyle,  
the rich have figured out a way to obtain it, but the poor are more 
intelligent.  Is that about it? Have I missed anything?
              

        >Capitalism is the true pyramid system. 


If that's the way you feel about it then the solution is obvious, don't be a  
capitalist. I really don't see what your problem is.


        >I only see one motivation that drives all Libertarians. It's not        
        >the desire for  freedom or the desire for justice. It's pure greed.         
        >Oh yeah, and in some cases it's  stupidity.
              

Oh, now I see. You think you're morally superior to us and are far more 
intelligent. You think we're too stupid to make decisions for ourselves and 
for our own good you must do it for us. You'll make us become socialists   
whether we want to or not. Erik, can you see why such a policy might cause  
some resentment in your subjects? 

As for your other insults, I am not ashamed of my opinions, if I didn't think 
freedom and justice were good things I would not lie about it, I would just 
say so. You will note that I have not said so. If what you say about "all"
Libertarians is true then almost everybody on this list is an unjust freedom 
hating greedy moron who lies about their motivation. Why do you even talk to 
us?

[As usual, I would like to hear suggestions for improvements of this
document. It resides at

Physical Improvements of Humans

By Anders Sandberg

Based on the discussions on rec.arts.sf.science, August 1996. I have stolen
ideas and some sentences from the participants, which I hereby acknowledge.

This page is devoted to modifications of the human body that are mainly
surgical, chemical and genetic; bionics and genetic engineering have their
own pages.

Many of these ideas are general improvements of bugs or atavisms in our
body, while some are outright changes. While some are likely to be popular
among all humans (like production of vitamin C and improved organ
suspension) others (like becoming amphibious or furry) will probably be used
by only some people.


Skeleton

There are many possibilities for strengthening the skeleton, but it is
important to keep the lightness and avoid making it too brittle (metals are
too heavy). One idea is to use buckytubes or diamond composites instead of
calcium phosphate crystals as the hard component of the bones.

Arms and Hands

Hands are definitely the area (beside the brain) where people have the most
ideas.

Generally, many would like to extend their capabilities with extra opposable
fingers. At the same time, while the thumb is strong and dextrous, it is
rather slow and not suitable for fine manipulation. Having fingers of
different sizes is useful, and many would like to have longer fingers.

The formation of the fingers are due to a gradient of morphogens, which
induces the different changes. By influencing it, we can get more fingers
and quite possibly two thumbs. It seems likely that the shape, number of
joints and strength of the fingers can be changed this way.

Adding more fingers might decrease motoric and sensory acuity if the cortex
is not extended, but the brain is believed to have quite a bit of reserve
capacity in this area.

Adding two extra arms is a popular idea, although this would require some
rather complex bone restructuring in the torso to attach them. A more
radical idea would be two tentacles (octopus-style) extending at the
shoulders (this would add a new way to manipulate objects)

The medial nerve and the tendons for the thumb go through the carpal tunnel,
which is clearly limiting and often gets into trouble. They should be
diverted.

Legs

Many people complain that the knees are easily damaged; they are actually
quite optimal, but might profit from a few more ligaments.

The feet can be redesigned to prehensile feet, although that would limit our
ability to walk long distances or run very fast in exchange for increased
dexterity.

One radical possibility would be to add an extra pair of legs. This is
complex, but one idea is to add an extra hinge point to the torso so that
the arms and head could be raised (much like a centaur); we could walk on
all fours while using our hands normally. This could be combined with
widening the pelvic arc, and perhaps with making the first pair of feet
prehensible (the arms are used for dextrous manipulation, the forefeet for
manipulation requiring strength).

Altering the proportions of fast-twitch, slow-twitch muscle fibers might be
desirable for some people; muscle cells do not divide, but can
enlarge/shrink depending on use. It might be desirable to add the option of
some regrowth, especially to deal with accidents and wounds.

Torso

The main problem with the torso is the spine - it is easily overloaded and
damaged. One possibility would be to add a few short ribs to the lower back
to attach tendons, improving overall strength and resilency, but decreasing
the twisting ability. It is probably likely that it could be modified in
other ways to work well with our new ecological niche as seat-dwellers (this
could be combined with modifications of gluteus maximus).

One idea is to suspend internal organs from the skeletal system, perhaps
using tendons, instead of letting them lie on diaphragm. This would prevent
many forms of hernia.

Gastro-Intestinal Tract

The symbiotic intestinal flora might be improved or made "smarter", for
example by adding genetically designed versions (overall, our entire
microflora could be improved, for example to produce clean or pleasant
smells).

One possibility would be to modify the urinary system to output its waste
into the GIT, but caution has to be taken to limit the risk of infection.

Circulatory System

Since we are bipedal, our circulatory system has to work much harder to pump
blood vertically. It might be a good idea to add an extra heart or several
"helper hearts", perhaps based on the peristaltic hearts of insects, along
the aorta or in the legs.

Adrenaline thickens the blood, it becomes more likely to clot; very sensible
in a natural environment, but downright deadly in a stressful modern city.
Unlinking the fibrinogenic system from adrenaline control would definitely
lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease.

Breathing

The human breathing system has some drawbacks, primarily the risk of choking
on food. Ideally breathing/speaking would be done through another orfice, or
at least there would be a spare opening that could be used in desperate
situations or for integration with scuba gear and similar technological
add-ons.

Most air in the lungs is rather stale and is not vented with each normal
breath, but this is a minor problem since the primary purpose of the lungs
is to went carbon dioxide instead of absorbing oxygen (which is very
plentiful). A uniflow system would be much smaller, but would loose heat and
water faster than our current countercurrent system.

Aquatic breathing is a classic idea. Making human amphibious or wholly
aquatic is more complex than modifying the breathing system, it would be a
good idea to add a thicker warming layer of fat beneath the skin, make the
arms and legs more suitable for swimming, fill the ears with water to enable
underwater hearing and modify the eyes (for example by adding clear
nicticating membranes).

One possibility would be reserve air storage, for example by improved red
blood cells and myoglobin. But the main problem is getting rid of carbon
dioxide.

Reproduction/Sex

Built-in contraceptives are a quite popular idea; some might be interested
in removing menstruation, PMS and menopause entirely. Ideally, ovulation
(and ejaculation) would be under voluntary control.

The female pelvic girdle is a bottleneck, both due to our large heads (see
the head section for some ideas) and our upright stance. It is surprisingly
flexible, but might still be improved judging from the number of cesarian
sections and deaths at birth in general. A radical solution would be to use
a pouch instead, like kangaroos. This would allow the head to grow without
any traumas, and allow men to bear children too (assuming the embryo grows
inside the mother, then leaves and climbs into the pouch of the father or
mother). Some psychologists have suggested that this would reduce birth
trauma a lot and enhance mother(father)-child bonding.

Some people might like genital taste buds and other improvements in
innervation. Since the taste cortex is very close to the primary sensory
cortex of the tounge, it appears likely that genital taste buds could be
implemented and linked to suitable cortical regions by piggy-backing on the
normal sensory pathways (most likely the taste sensations will be different
from oral taste). Erogenous zones are apparently partially culturally
dependent and often individual, but it appears likely that there are some
neural pathways that could be added to create new erogenous zones (or remove
them).

Some find it unaesthetic to place the urinary tract in or close to the
sexual organ, and would like another solution (like emitting urine into the
lower intestine)

Metabolism

We are adapted to a diet of a projectile-predator on the East African
savannah, not to living in a techno-agricultural niche. Our metabolism can
definitely be modified to fit our current lifestyle better, and avoid many
common problems (such as cholesterol plaques; predators manage this nicely,
but as omnivores we have problems with excessive intake).

Make weight and metabolic setpoints more easily changed; some peoples have
problems in storing surplus food, so that the are more susceptible to
malnutrition, while others tend to store too much fat and develop diabetes
and heart disease.

Humans are among the few mammals that cannot manufacture vitamin C. Adding
this capability would appear very simple, and it might have useful effects
as an antioxidant and immune-enhancer.

Skin

Pigment levels should ideally be easier to control, so that it would become
darker to avoid sunburn before it occurs.

The amount of hair that appears is apparently genetically determined
(although beard growth is positively correlated to testosterone levels). It
might be desirable to find ways to increase/decrease the amount of hair. Fur
is a distinct possibility, together with adding patterns to it (this might
be done to the skin too, creating "tigers" or "leopards").

An increase in sensitivity in some areas is probably desirable, and quite
probably pleasurable.

Head

The human head is a evolutionary bottleneck; making it any bigger would
complicate birth enormously, and probably incur a greater chance of brain
damage. One possibility would be to influence bone and brain growth so that
more development can occur outside of the mother's body. There are still
some limits to the size of the head, especially since it has to balance on
the spinal column and the neck muscles.

The skull is a good protection for the brain, but maybe not optimal.
Especially intracranial hemmorages are very dangerous, hard to detect in
time and mostly due to badly arranged blood vessels. Ideally the numerous
small and easily damaged veins between the skull and brain should be made
more flexible, removed or replaced with reinforced larger veins.

Update the sinuses to belong on an upright biped - our noses tend to clog
instead of drain.

Human teeth are problematic, due to our long lifespans and our tendency to
eat food that are bad for them. Inducing the growth of several sets of teeth
instead of just the milk- and adult-teeth seems to be a good idea (unless
one want to replace them with wholly artificial systems a la Jaws or use
resilient ceramics).

Remove the vomero-nasal organ (VNO) to become independent of pheromones.
This will likely make a person less likely to become romantically involved
with others or react strongly to the body odors of people, but might suit
those who want to keep their emotions entirely under their own control.

Eyes

Adding ultraviolet vision is possible, since our receptors can detect it
(partially by fluoroscence) but the lens absorbs it; by replacing the lens
UV-vision becomes possible. Unfortunately this increases the risk for
retinal damage, and there would be some problems with chromatic aberration
(maybe we could develop a double lens system to fix this).

Infrared sight is hard to do well, since the eye would only be able to see
objects warmer than itself.

One idea would be a pair of extra eyes specialized for UV or IR vision
(perhaps like the heat-sensitive pits of certain snakes), and another would
be to add nicticating membrances to limit the part of spectrum we look at.
This could also be protective and useful for aquatic living.

Brain and Nervous System

Humans are easily addicted by pleasurable stimuli. It might be a good idea
to add a taste-flip, so that a repeated stimuli after a while is not as
pleasurable (this would have to work around the fact that most addictive
drugs influence the mesolimbic dopamine system and nucleus accumbens; the
mental interpretation of this would have to be possibly reversed by
introducing habituating interneurons). This would be similar to how boredom
makes repeated behaviors slightly unpleasant, keeping us active.

The chemical senses of the brain are subtle, and are often able to detect
quite well if some nutrients or chemicals are lacking in the body. These
senses might be strengthened and made more conscious (as sometimes happens
during pregnancy), which no doubt would improve healthy eating. In some
diseases smell becomes more acute, which shows that it is possible to
enhance senses in a biological way.

In the same way, it might be desirable to be able to control the strength of
sensory stimuli, to avoid being overwhelmed. This could involve the ability
to "close one's ears" and suppress pain (pain is an important signal that
something is wrong, but should not incapacitate us)-

Sleep is important (probably to integrate memories during REM sleep and to
let the immune system function well), but should be easier to control. Since
it is possible to train oneself to become an "efficient sleeper", it is
likely that it could be speeded up biologically. The ability to temporarily
suppress sleep is desirable, although long-term effects are probably rather
bad.

The "fight-or-flight" stress response tends to "white-out" higher mental
functions and replace them with instinctive reactions - very efficient in a
dangerous natural setting, but less useful in a technological world where
dangers seldom can be avoided by instinct. Ted Sturgeon suggested that the
response would be rewired so that the higher functions become more active
and speed up under serious stress. This would require some rather complex
rewiring of the brainstem, but is probably feasible (for example, the
noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus have a generally activating
effect on the whole of the brain, and are linked to this response).

There are many subtle errors in normal human cognition, which cause various
problems in the modern world. For example, we tend to mix up implication
with equivalence, judge risks in a very irrational manner (more people are
afraid of flying than of driving) and make incorrect generalizations. If
deductive/inductive reasoning could be instinctively learned during early
maturation just like language, or these errors corrected, people would
become less likely to fall into logical traps or irrationality.

"Temporal Lobe Personality" is a term sometimes used to describe some
people, who have increased activity in their temporal lobes: sexual drive is
suppressed, paranoia, they tend to become almost monomaniac, extremely
obsessed with details of the work and often have grand visions. Apparently
both Dostoyevsky and van Gogh suffered from this condition. It would be
useful if the more positive symptoms of TLP could be replicated and
voluntarily controlled.

Our bad memory is a common complaint. While long-term memory is very good,
we are not as good at retrieving necessary information (this can be
trained). And short-term memory can only handle 7+-2 chunks; if this could
be extended we might become much better at handling several trains of
thought at once.

Immune System

The immune system is excellent at fighting intruders and antigens, but tends
to overreact, especially in places of high living standard where there are
fewer dangers (the mast cells, which normally fight parasites seem to cause
allergies when they are "out of work"). Ideally, its level should be more
easily controllable, so that it could be kept at a safe level most of the
time, and increased when shifting environment. This could be combined with
the possibility of decreasing its attacks against certain antigens (but not
all) to enable implants or some forms of surgery.

Hormone System

Our emotions are strongly influenced by hormone levels, which tend to swing
out of control during adolescence or in some situations. It might be
desirable to have conscious control of how much hormones are released, or to
make the brain less susceptible to their influence.

Decline in hormone levels due to aging should naturally be lessened; this is
actually one possible origin of many aging signs and diseases.

Aging and Development

Slowing aging is high on almost everyone's wishlist.

In our society, we would need a longer maturation time, ideally with no
fixed end. One possibility is to make maturation and aging slow down more
and more, so that everyone eventually reaches a steady state corresponding
to the 20's (which are optimal in many ways).

"Youthful idealism" might be partially hormonal, a way to make young males
restless and leave the tribe to found new tribes. This apparently declines
in most people as they age and become settled, but it might be possible to
extend it (an idealism supplement?), which would probably be very healthy to
do from time to time to prevent mental aging.

You still don't say anything about the first discovery in France.  Why not?

I just don't follow you.  So what, HIV was renamed from HTLV-III.   It is the
same virus.  Changing of nomenclature is normal in microbiology.  What's so
abnormal about that?  

There is nothing strange about Gallo finding HTLV-I in an AIDS patient.  He
said he had isolated it from AIDS patient but was not sure if it actually
caused AIDS.  Again, not unusual.  HTLV -1 was the first human retrovirus
discovered in 1976 by Asher Gibbs and Gajdusek. Latency of HTLV-1 is very
long 10-40 years (MCM 1991 page 1024), like HIV.  HTLV-I and HTLV-II are
prevalent in IV drug users.

This is a problem with our government:  Laws are bought, but the costs
of entry into corruption are high.  It takes a lot of money and expertise
to bribe a congressman, and I can't even begin.  It's cost-effective for
corporations to spend $100K to get a bill passed that will net them $1M.

I've thought that it might be more fair if laws were bought and sold openly,
rather than secretly as they are now.  Imagine if, instead of Congress
voting on a bill, voters pledged money for or against it.  People would
have to put their money where their mouth is.  People would straighten out
their priorities pretty quick if they had to back them up with cash.
For example, I think you'd see that, though people are eager to restrict
other people's freedom when it doesn't match their code of ethics,
they'd be a lot more tolerant if they had to shell out dough to ban
homosexuality, etc.

For another thing, if Wal-Grain Inc. wanted to pass a big farm subsidy bill
that would cost everyone in Iowa a dollar in taxes, a million people
sending in a dime each could stop it.  Postage could be a barrier at this
level, but there are ways around that.  Under the present system, the
farm subsidy bill could not be opposed financially unless there were
already a watchdog special-interest group just waiting to oppose farm
subsidy bills if they arose.  Which would hardly be worth the cost of
setting up the organization.

It's hardly an irrational insinuation, although it may be a brash one.
There's nothing irrational about immutable laws of physics. (Except
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, but that's another trend). As for my
name, it's from Letterman, I used it as an alias, and it stuck.

Future skin. That's the problem.. I don't object to art for art's sake, but
you can't seriously think that in the future we're going to have silicon
skin. If you do, you're entitled to your opinion, but I think it's
irresponsible to make that the view of a movement. As we've learned from the
past, the future's going to look alot like it looks now. Quite frankly,
silicon skin is a cliche from bad scifi.

Aha! Silicone! Not Silicon. Silicone is a silicon compound. That's like
saying that because Iron (Fe) can't be dissolved in water, neither can any
Iron compounds. I didn't say all silicon COMPOUNDS, that would be incredibly
stupid. But the element Silicon (Si), used as a semiconductor is not a
compound, it is the element.

This post of mine didn't make it to the list last tiome I sent it:

Sitting on my ass waiting for the bus at the busstop on my way back from
college today I pondered the question of how we're going to integrate the
new technology of interactivity and three dimensional graphics such as
virtual reality with movies to create a new medium. Radio and Movies merged
to create broadcast telivision. How will movies evolve? So I conceived the
idea of "Theme Worlds". In a theme world you can select what role you wish
to play in the world. The world will have a limit to the number of people
who can be in there with you or extra people will be extras (probably just
browsing and passing through). There will be a small group of people
(usually referred to as the main characters of a movie). You will be able
to choose to play the role of one of these characters in the Theme World.
Multiple sessions of these theme worlds will be running and you would
select which character you would like to play the role of from a screen
showing profiles and statistics of each of the characters (aka avatars) and
upon selection, the program would dump you in the open slot in one of the
many sessions. There will be no fixed plotline or if there is one it will
gently nudge you along with obstacles or spontaneous orders where if one
character is playing his/her role, all others must follow in sequence or
else their avatars die or something because of the way the world is setup
or such to keep the action 'pace' (thanks Regina) going and preventing
boredom. Theme Worlds could be set in different universes, on different
planets, or in different periods of history. Each character would have
different skills, powers, whatever so you could experience these people's
virtual lives through their eyes. Have you ever wished you were a character
in a movie? Perhaps when you were a child? Ever wish you could see the
world in a book or movie through the hero or heroine's eyes? If this is the
future of entertainment then I predict it will be more real than we have
ever experienced. Has anyone written a book on this concept cause if not, I
will! I'm just overloaded with inspiration on this one right now! Damn how
can I write to Wired!!!

I didn't object so much to your idea, but to using it to represent the
extropian movement and ideology. Silicon skin is a scifi cliche, and makes
us look stupid. I realize this is a matter of symantics, but Silicon doesn't
(and can't) have multiple elements, because it is an element (it does have
multiple isotopes, but that's irrelevent). Indeed Silicon can form different
compounds, among them Silicon Dioxide. Silicon Dioxide is also found in
quartz sand, and was recently been found to be the cause of the "singing
sands" phenomenon.

Well, first of all the kingdoms of life thing was a joke, humour, sarcasm?
And it was emotional wrath, it really hurts me that you don't distinguish
between the real future and an imagined future. I consider myself an
extropian in that I believe that we can only improve our lives through
science and technology. What I don't believe is that we should make the
future look incredibly alien. The future is never alien. 5000 years ago,
society had more in common with today's society than it does different. It's
blind theorizing like that which makes all future oriented people look foolish. 

This will be my only other reply. If you got offended, if I shook your ivory
towers at the root, too bad. Guess what, there's always going to be people
who disagree, and to the guy who was afraid I'd "smother" his movement with
my "pessimism", I say, WAKE UP! Guess what, the future won't be that much
fun. With increased power comes increased responsibility. The price of
liberty is constant vigilance. If you only look at one side of it, you can't
see anything, ok? If I could smother the entire extropian movement (Which I
consider myself a part of) by expressing one contrary idea, well, let's just
say it's on shaky ground to begin with. 

Can I suggest you all go take a refresher course in chemistry and physics?

Aside from the obvious point that a piece of art does not dictate a 
movement, I suggest that you read up on the persons who have responded 
to your posting thus far.  I believe you'll find that they in part 
founded the 'movement' in question (have we come to the point of considering 
extropianism a movement?  Hum, a question for another thread).

You may enjoy rudeness for the shock value, but it won't carry you 
very far on this list.  We value creative, skilled, informed and civil 
discussion here.

Sorry, I didn't know people could own a mode of thought. Should I be paying
royalties to Karl Marx now? Furthermore, I'm aware of who responded to my
message. I'm not going to keep my mouth shut for fear of offending
"important" people any more than "unimportant" folk.

First off, that was sarcasm. Secondly, I did not expect anger. I did not
reply with anger, in fact I replied with great sadness. I take it very
personally when scientists are made to look foolish.

You say WE alot.
As for government being a requirement I agree.
Even an "anarchy" is a bunch of sovereigns.
I have declared my sovereignty 
and consider the law of the nature of the universe my government.

We could.
We are particles.
Propulsion systems are particles too.

Be afraid/calm.
I went from 110 to 136 beats/minute in 3 seconds lying still on my back.
I repeated this 3 times and had one witness.
I probably had 150 when I was not looking.
It was quite an experience.
I wonder if hospitals keep records of ECGs.

Are your actions not natural?
Coolness is determined by subjective value projected upon it.
Change your values and you can enjoy anything as much as you like.
Oddly enough white walls can be quite erotic. :-)

Relax.

Take a deep comforting breath.

Relax.

Take a long slow blink.

Now I present some views of subjective/objective reality.
They are a bit unorganized but here it goes.
Subjective reality is the reality the subject sees.
The subject sees what it sees, 
so any reality seen is subjective.
Objectivity exists only if the subject viewing it is the objective.

Is it possible for a subject to be objective?
I do what I do based on the law of the nature of the universe.
I live in nature. 
My actions are simply reactions to stimuli provided by nature 
from within and without.
An action and reaction are one continuous action.
If it was not we could not believe in any action 
larger than the smallest particle interaction.
No longer would an atom exist, 
for it is the sum of the actions of it's particles 
which have banded together.
The universe is one action [uni = one, verse = turn].
My action is the action of nature 
because none of my parts exist outside the influence of nature.
I can not seperate my action of being from the action of the universe.
If it did not exist I would not exist.
If I did not exist it would not be what it is. 
As far as I would be concerned it would not exist.

Speaking of not existing, think of this.
Matter and energy can not be created nor destroyed.
I am matter and energy.
Therefore I can not be created nor destroyed.
I was not born, I will not die.
I have seen a baby with a brain stem and no brain.
It acted like a normal sentient baby.
Taking this into account is brain death really accurate?
When does it begin or end?
I do not think it does.

I want to present enough evidence to convince everyone  
but I tire of writing this.
I hope some one learns some thing.
Feel free to let me prove your arguments wrong.
How's that for dynamic optimism?

Hopefully... but it sounds just like the Digicash beta trials which failed
to take off as a real currency in spite of our best efforts, and legally
speaking you'll probably have to pay tax on this income at some rate
picked at random by the IRS.

What are the long-term operating costs of solar-powered

Silly question.  Zero.

Then is it fair that the FCC sell rights to use spectrum for 
low-power digital wireless networking to the highest bidder, so they 
can then sell metered usage?

We have this already; it's called roleplaying.
It began with tabletop games; now we have online text-based games,
that will soon become online 3D games (a development which I despise
and which will sap the vitality from the games IMHO, but I digress),
and, I suppose, the full VR-type stuff later.

	You're entire description sounds vaguely similiar to Neil
Stephensons "Diamond Age", or rather, one of the concepts that it puts
forth.  Forgive me, for I don't remember specifics, but the protaganist is
at one point taken to a ship with a group of people.  This ship is
designed to provide entertainment, interactively, to it's customers.  Each
individual may or may not get a role in the "plots" of the night (for
depending on who and where you are, you may or may not have  a plot, or
plots), and even more, they may or may not know whether they are part of
the experience, or just a spectator.  It combines both virtual reality and
augmented reality to create an atmosphere of any style or make, and of
course this aids in the entire personal experience for the individual,
making everyones experience different.

It might be interesting to look at some quantitative data to see how well
it matches the cycles predicted in TFT.  I was thinking of public opinion
polls where people are asked questions like whether they believe in God,
or whether they generally feel optimistic about the nation's prospects.
You could graph the percent who answer yes and see if it has a cyclic
structure which is consistent with the predictions.

Are there any such surveys which go back far enough?  I believe (thanks
to Robin's correction) that we are supposed to be replaying the WWI
through 1920's era now.  So if we had data which went back to 1900 it
would provide at least some overlap between cycles.

HIV was renamed from HTLV-III.  But the paper you cited, that Gallo published
in 1983, claimed that ANOTHER virus, HTLV-I, caused AIDS.  It was not
until a year later, in 1984, that Gallo published his arguments that HTLV-III 
causes AIDS.  So when you said Gallo's paper arguing that the virus later
renamed HIV "... was published in 1983 not 1984", you are wrong. Do you
follow that?

The FCC has powers.  With these, it sometimes seizes our rights.

That the FCC has laid claim to the electromagnetic spectrum should give rise
to more outrage than the claims that the US made to the West in the 1800s.
 What has the FCC done to "improve" the airwaves?  Control over spectrum,
like ownership over land in the state of nature, should vest the person to
first put it into productive use.  (For the theoretically minded, the cause
of action would arise not as a property right but as a claim for tortious
interference with business relations or the like, as nuisance, or as
contract.)  Planting a flag in one corner of a continent does not suffice;
nor should statists' claims about the "public" airwaves.

By a very defensible definition of "fair", no.  But note at any rate that the
FCC gives only sharply delimited rights.  It exercises considerable
regulation over use of the spectrum that it "sells".  Were the FCC to sell
off the rights en toto and then get out of the way, a Coasian would applaud.

Such a one-time sale of complete title to electromagnetic spectrum represents
a morally imperfect solution, but an excellent exit strategy.  The statists
get their big pay-off, the telecoms get free reign, and the FCC turns to
other matters.  This exit stategy would, ideally, leave room for spectrum
analogs to such real property notions as easements and averse possession.
 "Regulation" would follow via common law suits.

David Cary:
A metal/carbon composite. Interesting. We would have to worry about 
unequal
thermal expansion and a few other things ...

I'm still amazed that a rope of "Buckyfiber" can hold over 100 times as
much weight as the same size rope made of Ti (500 times as much weight 
as a
steel cable). (Bishop got this number off the web, so it must be true 
:-).

[[Actually, I've heard the two to three times diamonds tensile
 from several sources. For a little more on Al/Ti/C
composites check out Tom McKendree's paper at the 
Molecular Manufacturing Shortcut Group (MMSG) chapter of the
National Space Society. It is much easier to get the materials from an 
asteroid. In
"The Interworld Rapid Transit System" is a proposal to shoot raw 
materials 
from various asteroids to the construction site. This paper will be in 
*The Journal of the British Interplanetary Society*.]]

>The question is what the elasticity of the matrix it is cured
>into is.

Yes, the properties of small fibers don't help any; it's the bulk 
material
properties that are important in this application.

Lorrey's comment has caused me to wonder how much these "Buckyfiber" 
cables
will stretch when we start spinning the station. (Note that the answer 
to
this question requires measuring the "modulus of elasticity", a 
completely
different material property than and yet confusingly similar-sounding 
to
Elastic Strength).

[[Young's Modulus (modulus of elasticity) for Buckyfiber is probably 
similar to Carbon Fiber- on the order
of  100 Gpa (a total guess). One more sweet thing about Carbon Fiber is 
the extremely 
low coefficient of thermal expansion-- for some flavors it is even 
slightly negative (translation:
the fiber doesn't expand in length when it is heated, it can even 
contract). Composite material
engineers use a blend of fibers and matrix to create parts that don't 
change their shape when 
they are heated up. This property might also carry over to Buckyfiber.
Once the thing is spun up, slagged and pressurized, these expansion 
effects retreat 
to the second or third order.]]

Bishop makes the almost prescient guess that
>> >The
>> >fiber should be wound at a slight angle, maybe 10 degrees

Cary comments that
>> I think that 1980's technology "graphite-fiber" pressure cylinders 
use the
>> optimum 26.6 degrees.

[[Yes, for cylinders under uniform hydrostatic load.]]

Or maybe lots of ropes or "sheets" connecting the axis to several 
lateral
lines running the length of the cylinder. The slight extra curvature (I
have to climb to the top of the mountain to reach the rope anchor) 
would
improve the safety factor.

[[A catenary-ish cross-section for the cylinder would be nice, although 

harder to make. The presumption was the circumferential tensile 
strength
is great enough to remove this requirement. ]]

Interesting. With a very "short" cylinder (almost looks like a toroid)
(length << radius), one could build a large (curved) mirror collecting 
all
the light from full end-on area facing the sun (pi*r^2), and focus it 
down
to the much smaller farmland area (2*pi*r*length), to get the full
Earth-standard amount of sunlight at distances much further away from 
Sol
than Earth.

[[I think Lorrey means 'the axis of rotation collinear with the orbital 
axis'.
Do note the period of the 1000 Km, one gravity design is .558 hour 
(33.5 
minutes).

I don't understand this.

I originally thought you meant side-by-side like this:


    spinward
        ^
  N====S  S====N
                        v
                  spinward

but that loose fiber would still be almost as dangerous if they were
side-by-side like this:
    spinward
         ^
  N====S

  S====N
        v
    spinward

[[I meant the second version. 
This reminds me of the story of
the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO), a space telescope launched 
in
 the late '60's. This (very expensive) package was spin-stabilized for 
launch. When it
was in orbit, a small weight on a string wrapped around the body of the 
satellite 
was supposed to be released, like a yo-yo. As it unwound, it carried 
off the angular momentum and 
slowed down the spin rate. Well, a little problem came up when the 
apogee motor
burned out. While its empty shell was still attached to the end of the 
satellite, the
configuration was unstable about the long axis, and so the thing went 
into a "flat spin".
So now ground control had a little dilemma: they knew that when they 
released the apogee
motor that the satellite would flip back onto the right spin axis, but 
there was a 50-50 chance
of it spinning the wrong way, meaning the yo-yo wouldn't work. Well, 
Murphy stepped
up to the plate, and last I heard the observatory is still up there, 
spinning away. If they
had installed a second yo-yo wound the other way this would have been 
covered, but 
all the spare yo-yos were left on the ground.]]

Assuming the ends are sealed, what would pull atmosphere at the axis 
away
from the axis ? I see that Earth's gravity pulls atmosphere at high
altitudes down towards the surface, (the force due to gravity varies by
less than a factor of 2 from the surface clear out to the typical Space
Shuttle orbit), but there is no such force near the cylinder's axis, 
right?

[[No, not a force per se. But consider a particle in the space around 
the axis (this
is vaguely similar to the Ringworld stability problem). Any non-zero 
velocity 
component will send it back to the walls or ends of the cylinder. This 
will be
the case for gas-kinetic models. For continuum models, the force is 
'centrifugal'
transferred via viscosity.


BTW, the Buckyfiber Open Air Habitat is an original proposal of mine, 
and first 
aired on the Extro and >H lists.

I am interested in silicon dioxide, actually. Your comments on silicon and
its glass like texture makes sense.  Yet, the use of abrasive solid hard
surface structures for protective devices, like an armor, has a visual
element that I like. 

More appropriately, I like the combination of multiple textures for
skin-like protective membranes. I envision textures that will change color
and design. The environments we will be spending time in will also influence
what textures will be appropriate.  And, the time frame is important: how
far into bio-tech beings we are.  

This is a topic where scientific suggestions could be insightful. What
suggestions do other have for mid-transhuman to late-transhuman stages?

I've gotten two great leads for access to electronic printers, but I'd
certainly appreciate any further suggestions.

Let me reiterate:

I have reopened my commercial poster design business. This time, I will not
be using my 4-color serigraph press because of the toxic fumes.  

Therefore, I am looking for anyone who has access to an electronic printing
system such as an Iris or Canon.  If you either work for such an electronic
printing operation, or have an investment in same, please contact me soonest.

Thanks!

Let's not forget live action roleplaying. With some augmented reality, 
this could become quite interesting. 

I spend far too much time plotting in our ongoing Vampire: the Masquerade
LARP... on the other hand, I have definitely become a better schemer than
before. 

I don't think there will be a single future entertainment medium. 
Roleplaying demands activity, and I think many like to have passive 
entertainment (unfortunately). This reminds me of Donald Norman's 
reflexive and experiential forms of learning... worth thinking on...

Why sadness?  You took a post with an intention to locate a printing press
and singled out a visual idea and made it into a scientific debate.  Then
you began attacking values and accusing intent without fully comprehending
the concept. Your blatant comments were based on an area of interest that
you consider yourself to be adept at, but you missed all else.  Rather than
ask questions, your made assumptions and claimed them as facts.

No, but one should carefully distinguish science from art (although I'm
myself as a scientist quite interested in depicting scientific results as
art). Without the poetic exaggerations, art would not be as inspiring, and
art is necessary to create a rich and dynamic culture worth living in,
while science provides the understanding and technology needed to make it
run.

You're just talking about carbon based lifeforms - thats carbon
chauvinism! Let's not forget inanimate matter or life based on other
media, like knots of vortex-lines in the superfluid mantle of neutron
stars or beings in the fourier transform of our universe :-)

See David Pearce's _The Hedonic Imperative_ (on the net) for some
interesting ethical and neurological ideas about how to enhance the
quality of life for other kingdoms (at least those with nervous systems). 
Uplifting is an interesting subject, although I'm not sure a cat would
want to become a trans-cat if given the chance (let's try it though!).

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is not irrational, it's just bizarre.  
It's strange that there is a limit on how much knowledge we can have on the  
position and momentum of something, and Heisenberg is far from the strangest 
aspect of Quantum Mechanics. Take the famous 2 slit experiment for example, 
shine a light on 2 closely spaced slits and it will produce a complex  
interference pattern on a film, even if the photons are sent out one at a  
time.  If a photon goes through one slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the 
other slit, the one it didn't go though, was there or not, but it does!

Or place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over one slit, and one set at 
90 degrees over the other, and the interference pattern disappears. Now place 
a third filter set at 45 degrees between the slits and the film. The 
interference pattern comes back! Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does not 
enter in any of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and we
just don't know which one, it goes through both slits, and neither.
            

        >the element Silicon (Si), used as a semiconductor is not a compound,

That is a gross oversimplification. In the first place the Silicon is not 
pure, it must be doped with small but very precise quantities of impurities  
or it won't work. In the second place the same isotope of the same element  
can have vastly different properties. Graphite, diamond and Bucky-Balls are   
different allotropes of the exact same element, carbon.

Actually, Pat, I never replied at all.  I've been out of town.  I don't know

I read about the chimpanzee study in the New York Times.  I don't know if it
has been published in a scientific journal.  I will try to find where it
came from and report back.

I'd like a high income, too. High enough to allow me to pay my phone bills, finance 
my computer activities, realize myself. But is it still self-interest to accumulate 
millions or even billions? Is it need? If this wealth was shared, nobody would have 
to starve. There would be no poverty. Everything would be great, fantastic, perfect.

The problem you ignore is accumulation.

Pat, 

Not exactly a Nature article, but suggestive nonetheless.  Might I ask, why
are you so into this?  I thought Duesberg had a point too, until I started
looking into it.  There's a terrific book you should read by a woman AIDS
journalist that kind of blasts all sides of the AIDS debate, she's from
Florida, I can't remember her name, but I'll try to find the reference, the
next time I go to the library.  


2/ 4: Twists and Turns in Chimp AIDS Research

By DAVID BERREBY


  It was not easy for scientists to decide to use chimpanzees for AIDS
research back in the 1980s. But as much as they hesitated to give the animals
a fatal disease, researchers believed that they could console themselves with
two thoughts: the chimpanzee would turn out to be a useful model for human
AIDS, and the animals would come down with the disease soon after being
infected, and thus would not suffer long. 

  Both assumptions turned out to be wrong. Years passed, grants expired and
still the HIV-infected chimps did not come down with AIDS. Researchers
shifted to other animals. 

  Meanwhile, confined to windowless quarters and attended by caretakers in
biocontainment "spacesuits," the chimps spent year after year living under
conditions that were only supposed to last two or three years. Just last
year, for instance, the Yerkes Regional Primate Center in Atlanta installed
windows in the building where it keeps its HIV-infected chimpanzees. 

  Now, nearly 13 years after the first infection of a chimp with HIV, one has
died and a few others are sick, apparently from AIDS. Jerom, a 13-year-old
male who was first infected in 1985, died early last year at Yerkes. Another
chimp at Yerkes, a male named Nathan, received a transfusion of Jerom's blood
before the first ape's death. 

  "We're certainly studying the effects on Nathan on a virological and
immunological basis, and possibly looking at other chimps as well," said Dr.
Frank Noviembre, a biologist who does AIDS research at Yerkes. "It's going to
be interesting to look at what happened to Jerom and what's happening in
Nathan and what possibly is happening in other chimps and try to correlate
that with humans." 

  HIV isolated from Jerom's blood was introduced into two more chimpanzees
three months ago, one by injection and the other by application to her
cervix. They have shown a steady decline in CD-4 blood cells, the immune
cells that are attacked by the AIDS virus, said Dr. Patricia Fultz, a
professor of microbiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who is
conducting the study. Two more chimps will be infected anally within the
month, Dr. Fultz said. The purpose of the experiment, she said, is to develop
a model of how HIV is acquired through different mucous membranes, which will
be used to test and evaluate the effectiveness of possible vaccines. 

  Some AIDS researchers are focusing on factors that make the virus more
easily transmitted. For example, a recent paper by Dr. Preston Marx, based on
work done in monkeys at a Westchester County research laboratory owned by New
York University Medical School, suggests that vaginal transmission of the
virus is enhanced by progesterone, a hormone whose synthetic version is used
in birth control pills. Such work on methods of transmission might be another
area in which chimps could prove useful to researchers. 

  "I think we can use long-term infected animals," Dr. Fultz said. 

  Not all researchers are convinced that Jerom died of human AIDS, but
"there's a strong possibility that the consensus will shift," said Dr. Marx,
who is director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York. "There
is at least a variant of HIV-1 that is causing an AIDS-like disease in
chimpanzees," Dr. Marx said. "The question becomes, How different is that
strain from the human strain?" The chance that larger numbers of chimpanzees
could once again be used in AIDS research "has emerged," he said, "where a
year ago that possibility did not exist." 

  The prospect that some or all of the country's 150 to 200 HIV-infected
chimpanzees will come down with AIDS raises a host of ethical questions. How
much care, for example, should an AIDS-inflicted chimp receive? Should the
animal be given AZT or protease inhibitors? At what stage of suffering, if at
all, is euthanasia appropriate? If chimps with AIDS live on for decades, who
will support them? 

  "It's a problem of economics more than anything," explained Noviembre, who
said that he had not made up his mind about the question of euthanasia. 

  "If you have these chimps that are not progressing to disease," and another
strain of HIV is available that scientists want to test, Noviembre said, "but
you have no other building, well, should you not do that research because you
won't euthanize the chimps you have?" 

  He said: "When I first presented some of our results last year at a
conference, I was talking to a guy from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and he said,
you realize you've opened a big can of worms because the NIH is about to say
chimps aren't needed in AIDS research? I said, I know, but what can we do,
really? We're just reporting what we're finding."

Not you are the boss. The population of the country is the boss. If everyone decides
that they don't want the state anymore, the state can be "fired".

Nope. In many cases the state does quite good work. But all these cases are more and 
more "privatized", leaving the state as a vampire who takes much from the many and 
few from the few, while doing few for the many and much for the few.

Which essentially means: If the decisions the customers make are right, the right 
people will have the power (although monopolies will form) and the right products 
will be produced. The problem is that the customers' decisions are usually not for 
the best product available but for the product most advertised.

I agree that the "government bug" is inherent. There are ways to change it, though. 
In order to do it, we need more state, not less, and better information for those who 
influence the state.

Look at Japan. Much state influence. Great country. Imagine Japan had started with 
free markets after WW II, they'd be like South Korea today.

Read the sentence. I didn't say that THIS was evil, but the effect is. (No one is 
evil in this game, that's why I usually don't use this word.) As a consequence, the 
state will be corrupted and thus provide worse services.

> What on Earth is evil about protecting you possessions from theft?

I have nothing against rich people who spend their money in big cars or houses etc., 
the money stays in movement. But it is "evil" (to use *your* words) if companies and 
banks invest money in the stock market where it just circulates. This is where the 
big money acucmulates. To nearly no one's benefit. The money invested in stock 
markets gets to (large) companies again. But these large companies tend to re-invest 
the money in stock markets instead of making investments in their company, for the 
stock market promises a higher profit! So the money available decreases, few people 
get richer and richer but without *using* the money -- only to get richer. And the 
amount of CIRCULATING money decreases.

This is why the capitalist system will break down faster if it's liberated.

Ah yeah, free decision again. Your catchword.

Free decision is, of course, an illusion. A decision can never be free, for the 
decider is influenced by various sources. A buying decision is mainly influenced by 
advertising. For to decide which product to buy, the consumer must know

 - which products are available (biggest problem)
 - which products promise to be best
 - why the products are best

Linux has not become a comfortable standard operating system for PCs because most 
people don't know about it. But even if Linux was told about in all larger computer 
magazines (impossible because Microsoft's influence is there, too), most people would 
buy Microsoft because of its better advertising.

Advertising manipulates. Manipulation of all kind is much easier in free markets.

Everything would be fine if all information would be accessible AND centralized in 
one archive (for why should the average user ever visit a Linux website?). But this 
is not the case with the web, and even the web would probably not be preserved in 
free markets for economic reasons. Don't forget that the really large net capacities 
are owned by the state.

There are lots of different companies, but the largest of them are owned by very few 
investment banks. There's your competition -- it's a fake.

No one has an interest in making superior products in free markets except for moral 
reasons, for 

	- investments in stock markets promise the highest profit to large companies
	- simply killing other companies with force is much cheaper, and if you 
	  control the media, no one will learn about it

Who runs my trousers? Do my trousers work? Who runs me? Do I work? Am I an anarchy?  
Philosophical questions..

Is English or the internet a geographical area where people live together? 

Let's take a deeper look at the net. 
Most of it is dull entertainment and worthless information. The newest web browser 
with Live3d plugin or Java for spying your computer, the latest sex page, 
advertising, advertising, advertising, private homepages containing useless 
information about strange people.

Then there's mail and news, continually being spammed, the more serious newsgroups 
being flooded by nazis and other scum. Of all services, these two are most useful. 
IRC - usually nonsense talk, everybody is surprised if a serious discussion results. 

Even in the web it becomes obvious how large companies try to crush users who publish 
unwanted information, even in the entertainment area. Without laws, companies will be 
able to do that much easier.

Anyway, the internet works. Sure. As long as no serious things are done there, 
everything is fine. As soon as big money circulates, goodbye net.

The distinction is that the real money is controlled by monopolies, the investment 
banks I mentioned.

If someone sits in a bureau all the time and just signs or rejects given proposals, I 
would hope he could demand less money than someone who works all day so hard that he 
even carries away physical and psychological damage from it.

They don't pay anyone what he/she's worth, but everyone is paid the fewest money 
possible. So if someone is paid 2$/hour in one company, he will get only 2$/hour in 
the neighbour company (while there IS still competition -- usually there's just 
monopolies after a short period in free markets). 

I'm not talking about the "better" jobs, the "worthier" jobs. BTW, didn't you 
criticize that I valued people? Don't you always get totally upset if I call the 
majority of the American population uneducated? But their work is worth less than 
yours, so if they do work with which they can't earn a living, are they stupid? Of 
course they aren't, for they don't have the choice. Maybe they are uneducated because 
of media influence and bad education (much worse in free markets).

I'm talking about the jobs in the industry. The hard work. There's always a high 
demand for this work, but a lower and continually decreasing supply. Tell a worker in 
Germany that he should quit his job and try to work for more money. The reaction 
would be funny. For if you quit a work where the supply is higher than the demand, no 
one will pay you more if there are thousands of unemployed people willing to work 
at minimum wages. Ah, I forgot, in free markets, there ARE no minimum wages.

But no matter what you call it, the effect would be that more and more people would 
fall into poverty and more and more people would get very, very rich. 360 people 
owning 50 % of the world's wealth. That's market control *today*. Do you think that 
one of these 360 guys (I think that most of them *are* guys, that's market 
emancipation) is able to spend even 1 per cent of his/her money?

Yeah. The wealth must be spread. The point is that nobody should possess more than he 
or she is able to spend, as otherwise the wealth will be no longer wealth but only 
money, and it will accumulate with no function.

There are no realizable alternatives, so the only way to make it is to make the 
pyramid as big as possible in order to reach transcension before the collapse. But if 
the market is liberated, the collapse will come faster, and billions of people would 
have to die of the effects of hunger. Explanation: The collapse would lead to a 
feudal system like that of the Middle Ages. Foreign trade would be impossible but is 
absolutely necessary in our society.

No. I don't know if you, John Clark, are greedy. I don't think that I'm more 
intelligent than you. But I know that you don't have the knowledge necessary to 
decide whether free markets are a useful thing or not, and I *think* that I do. You 
can prove the opposite any time, but so far I haven't heard any working argument from 
you.

I already said it, free decision is an illusion. 
I'm not talking about intelligence, but about education, a difference you seem to be 
unable to make. The less you know, the higher is the probability that your decision 
will be wrong.

Freedom and justice are good things. The problem is that free markets make people 
unfree and the world unjust. The problem is further that freedom of markets is 
usually directly transferred to freedom of the individual. The other problem is that 
freedom and coercion are not clearly defined and that usually only state pressure is 
considered as coercion.

The main problem is: Libertarians don't think enough. Like religous fanatics or 
fascists (NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO RELATE YOU TO THESE PEOPLE! But you will probably 
still tell me that I do...) they manage not to think about certain things. Barriers 
in the brain. You will unconsciously leave out certain parts of this message when you 
answer it (if you do). Parts you don't [want to] understand.

And one thing I especially dislike: the tone of your answer. You grabbed one single 
word of my posting and included it in the subject. What I said in my original posting 
was: "If someone is not greedy and a Libertarian, he/she must be stupid" [meaning he 
doesn't know better]. But don't you always say that greed (using a different 
phrase like desire for self-realization or sth. similar) is perfectly OK and 
_everyone_ should be greedy? 

As for my other insults, I haven't insulted anyone anyhwere. But maybe you'd prefer 
if I wouldn't say directly what I think? Sorry, that's a wish I can't fulfill.

I really must ask what you mean by this statement.  Most 
transhumanists have had at least the basic scientific training and we 
presuppose a base of support for scientific endeavor that is 
reflected in all our areas of expression--research, engineering, 
philosophy, art.  What, then, has been done to make scientists look 
foolish?  How can an artistic endeavor so threaten the basic laws of 
physics as to render them in need of an attack on the artist in 
question?   

I myself have begun to write my first piece of science fiction and 
expect to be asking some technical questions myself.  If I choose to 
approach persons on the transhumanist lists, I know from prior 
experience that I can expect an enthusiastic and positive response.  
And if I do make some egregious scientific error, I expect to share a 
good laugh about it with the scientist who discovers it.

We don't ignore the problem, we just have better than a 3rd-grade
understanding of economics.  Your puerile fantasy above assumes
that "accumulated wealth" is like a big pile of food being hoarded
but not eaten by anyone.  Let's examine one particular accumulator:

Not one single dollar of Bill Gates' fortune is being unproductive.
Most of it exists in the form of Microsoft stock, actively feeding
the 12,000 families of MS employees, their distributers, suppliers,
disk makers, retailers, consultants, trainers, magazine publishers,
and all of the other productivity that MS created; some part of his
wealth is being consumed in his fancy new house, cars, travel,
entertainment, etc.--employing lots of builders, auto makers, plane
mechanics, movie producers; the remainder of the money is personal
investment, such as bank accounts, personally owned stocks, bonds,
venture capital, etc.  This amount, even though he may have a bank
receipt saying that his account has $1,000,000, the fact is that 
the bank is then lending that money to new couples to buy houses
and cars, to small businesses, to developers.  Banks typically only
have on-hand less than 10% of the actual deposited amounts; all the
rest is in investments working.

If you think wealth redistribution reduces poverty, then prove it. 
The historical evidence is that it has been tried and failed every
time.  Actions must be judged by their rationally expected results,
not by their motives.  A hungry man prefers actual, physically
existing food to a society that /wants/ to feed him but does not.
Capitalism feeds people.  Socialism steals their money and leaves
them begging.  Results are what matters.

Is there anything besides diet and exercise?
Drugs are part of your diet 
and any action is an exercise of your will.
Doing anything requires disipline.
Very early in your life you had to learn how to use your muscles.
Learn how to use your mind's willpower.
A good beginning mental exercise 
is sitting absolutly still for at least 5 minutes.
Relax and do not try to breathe much.
Do not try to think.
At first it may seem uncomfortable 
but think about how long you stay still when you are asleep!
If you have trouble doing these things think about inertia.
If it becomes a part of your life 
it will stay a part of your life 
(or at least part of your neural programming).
I suggest reading about meditation, 
even though it's as simple as sittinng and thinking.
Control your mind and body, 
do not let it control you.

Ok, . . .  
 
1.  You are pessimistic.  You admit it.  You love it. 
 
2.  You are not even realistic, but admit to be far into pessimism (which is
not being realistic).  In fact, I think _even_ being so called "realistic" is
still being pessimistic because improvement is given up on. 
 
3.  You say you "know" the future, the "real" future not just imagined?
 That's more than I can say.  How are you doing that.  Fill me in on your new

4.  You think the future will not be all that much fun?   Do you still want

Please show me why I have misinterpreted you.

<<  As we've learned from the 
 past, the future's going to look alot like it looks now. >> 
 
"That's right, we will all keep living as we now do, in communities on Earth
and plowing our fields with tractors driven by human farmers.  New human
bodies and  designs are totally irrational and can never be improved much as
we have learned from the past 4-5 million years.  More powerful brains and
artistic body systems are "not even" science fiction, they are fantasy; would
cost too much to develop and build, plus can not be made with any existing
technology nor any foreseeable technology."   
 
------------------------------------------------------- 
Strategy to overcome new ideas.  Try to foster the following memes: 
 
1.  Anything wildly different from what we have now is not just speculation
but totally out of the question and a waste of time even to talk about
because of violations of solid scientifically proven laws of nature.  Since
99 out of 100 new research ideas end in failure, it is not cost effective to
work on any new research projects. 
 
2.  If you think you can try this:  "I've been a research scientist
(microbiologist, physicist, etc.) for over 20 years and I should know.  I
have never invented anything and know it's useless.  To better humanity, I
have tried my hardest to point out where new ideas will fail in order to
prevent any time/money wasting projects."   
 
3.  Only ideas that are obvious are worthwhile, only those should be talked
about, no "brainstorming" or modifications of the fantasy ideas.  If an idea
might not work the first time, such as a new kind of human skin,  tell those
people where they will (not just might) go wrong. Do it right now and save
them a lot of trouble.  Even better, slap them down a couple of times and
they will learn to be pessimistic and not be so bold the next time.   
 
For example make sure people don't waste time questioning the TWA crash or
that HIV might not be the only (100%) cause of AIDS or our carbon based skin
is good enough, we don't need silicone.  Come up with enough negative
references and that should change their minds.  I call it: "Dynamic
Pessimism."  
 
4.  The worst thing you can do is try to show those silly "silicone" people
where they might modify their idea and make it work.  That only encourages
fantasy ideas not science and makes fools out of legitimate scientists and
engineers.   
 
5.  Its much better if you "forget" to point out small semantic corrections
until you can pounce on the ideas giver:  For instance if they protest your
negativism, say:  "I didn't say  all ________________, that would be
incredibly stupid.  But, _______________, is used as a ______________ is not
as you said a _____________.  Obviously.   So I think you can now see where
you were wrong and I know the correct nature of  ___________ ", (fill in the
blank with their idea or project.  This implies that the idea giver is stupid
or foolish or is not knowledgeable, or forgetful and will then be unworthy of
consideration. 
 
6.  Don't be satisfied letting them think what they want.  Actively try to
change their minds: "Preach."  But don't be too brash or they will catch on
to you.   
 
. . .  You should tell them "You're entitled to your opinion, but I think
it's irresponsible to make that the view based on the scientific evidence and
known reference material.  All good science is based on what we've learned
from the past.  We know the future's going to look a lot like it looks right
now."     
 
Then, make it real for them by filling in their project's or idea like this:
  " ___________ is a cliche from bad sci. fi.."  Or, " ___________ is BEYOND
science fiction and could never be achieved.  It is a _fantasy_ that
encourages bad science and even religious cults.  If I wanted to read bad
science fiction based on nothing, I'd read ____________ ."  (name of any
legitimate creative idea publication nut be careful not to use Extropy or
WIRED, use Mondo 2000 possibly)."   
 
7.  Further Reading:  _How to Loose Friends and Alienate People_.   
 
8.  List of powerful words and phrases to use for squashing fantasy ideas: 
abuse of science (scientific data),  
betray, bizarre, bureaucracy, 
collapse, crisis, consequences,  cynical as in "I don't want to be cynical,
but. . . "  
destructive, destroy, devour, disgrace science,  (let me be a) devil's

endanger,  (will be an) enigma for all time, (it's not) ethical, 
failure (fail), fantasy, foolish, force, 
government (anything the government is in will be instantly negative),
 greed, goofy,

(your idea is) "just" a ______, (pipe dream, fantasy, etc.)  
kill, 
lie, (there are) limits, 
money, mandate, (it's not moral) 
never, not, nothing,  
(only your) opinion,  obsolete, obviously.  
pathetic,  (too) permissive, (I don't want to be) pessimistic, but. . . " 
quit, quite (-the opposite"), 
red tape,  
sick, shallow (thinking), self-serving,  sensationalists 
taxes, they, them,  threaten,  
unrealistic, 
violates (science), 
waste, whim, wrong,  
x-rays killed the discoverer, zero (denoting no progress),  
you are young (implied "and foolish"), years-and-years (pessimistic
denotation), 
zig-zag (implying not well thought out), zany,   
 
9.  Words and phrases _not_ to use on the ExI list when trying to be
"Dynamically Pessimistic" about new ideas: 
active, alright, astute observation, 
better, because, building,  
change, challenge, courage, children, compete, commitment, care, creative,
choice, 
dogmatic, debate,  dream (not "dreamer"),  
evolution, (help the) environment, eliminate (death, sickness, etc.),  
freedom, (to be) fair (then state to opposition's opinion), 
glad, great, good, goals, 
happy, healthy, honest, 
(new, good, creative etc.) idea(s), incentive, initiative,  information, 
joy,  
knowledge, kind,  
limits (there are none, or few),  legacy, liberty, listen, learn, leadership,
light,  
movement to future goals, mobilize,  
nanotechnology,  
optimistic,  
prosperity,  provide, principles, premise, (life is) precious, (new) pristine
future, 
(advantageous) qualities,    
rights, restore, repaired, 
share, success, strength,  
truth, teach,  
utility, use, unencumbered,  
vaccine, valued, verge (of discovering),  
wealth, weather (control),   
 
10.  Other words of special interest to the ExI list: 
 
Don't use "big business" ( as in: it's nothing but), that's a tip off phrase
to ExI list members as are the words: Liberal, Socialism, socialist,
Libertarian, and capitalist.  If you want to be Dynamically Pessimistic don't
get involved with the words, there are too many opportunities to be
optimistic. 
 
"Control" is a dangerous word, see coercion. 
 
"Coercion": Non-coercion is OK but be careful using "coercion."   The
libertarians (like me) will start reading more carefully.  You don't want
that to tip them off to your negative intentions. 
 
Use "radical" only when meaning _unrealistic_ when being Dynamically
pessimistic,  otherwise ExI List members might think "radical" is good and
could mean "a creative optimistic technology."  
 
"Sociable" is however very good to use to hide your Dynamic Pessimism, and is
one of the basis of libertarian people getting along with each other in
peace, outside of government forced peace. 
 
"Selfish":  Can be used positively/optimistically (e.g., Ayn Rand) or
negatively pessimistically (non-Rand) 
 
"Unrealistic"  is very good when being Dynamically Pessimistic.  After all
most people, think "being realistic is good."  Unrealistic is a fast way to
stop idea flow;  a very effective meme.   
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
On second thought.  The people on the ExI list are too smart to be lead into
pessimism.  You might just as well get infected by their optimism and
contribute optimism to the list if you can.   
----------------------------------------------------------------

I think a far better armour could be achieved by using a net of diamond
crystals ,connected in a manner that would let the material flex. Depending
on the shape of these crystals, they can be almost entirely diffuse, and
therefore not transperant. In addition, diamond is an incredibly strong
substance, and not very heavy.

The point was that this is a poster that will be seen by many people, making
the extropian concepts, and related concepts (nanotech especially) look like
scifi. This doesn't help the scientific world's impression of these
technologies.

No, not intentionally, but the to the general public this sort of art makes
scientists interested in nanotech and futurism look like space cadets. Not
an image builder.

Diamond crystals would reproduce beautifully. These crystals would have to
be rather tiny and fully spaced apart with the flex connectors, I would imagine.

You are absolutley, unequivicably incorrect. Nanotech is not "scifi", or
better known as SF. New skins, and biotech bodies are not SF. The fact that
we are beginning to design new skins is not a myth.

You've re-invented the Sagas which fill most of the lives of the immortal
inhabitants of Diaspar, in Arthur C. Clarke's wonderful 1956 novel THE CITY
AND THE STARS, one of the most important sf novels ever published.

	I'd like a high income, too. High enough to allow me to pay my
	phone bills, finance my computer activities, realize myself.
	But is it still self-interest to accumulate millions or even
	billions? Is it need?

We've all got projects to finance.

	If this wealth was shared, nobody would have to starve. There would
	be no poverty. Everything would be great, fantastic, perfect.
	The problem you ignore is accumulation.

Fascinating.  Tell me how a confiscatory tax on savings would improve
the distribution of food.

And how sheep's bladders may be used to prevent earthquakes.

	Not you are the boss. The population of the country is the boss.
	If everyone decides that they don't want the state anymore, the
	state can be "fired".

Since the state's officers are part of the population of the country,
the state will never be fired under such a rule.

	> [JKC describes the market]

	Which essentially means: If the decisions the customers make are
	right, the right people will have the power (although monopolies
	will form)

(false)

	and the right products will be produced. The problem is that the
	customers' decisions are usually not for the best product available
	but for the product most advertised.

Whereas voters and politicians, since they have no reason to care about
the results of their decisions, are far more enlightened.

	[...]
	Look at Japan. Much state influence. Great country.

High cost of living, tiny apartments, social regimentation, high rate of
"suicide" (including family massacres) ...

	Imagine Japan had started with free markets after WW II,
	they'd be like South Korea today.

Oh, so it was free markets that caused a hostile neighbor to appear?

	[...]
	I have nothing against rich people who spend their money in big cars
	or houses etc., the money stays in movement. But it is "evil" (to
	use [JKC's] words) if companies and banks invest money in the stock
	market where it just circulates. This is where the big money
	acucmulates. To nearly no one's benefit. The money invested in stock
	markets gets to (large) companies again. But these large companies
	tend to re-invest the money in stock markets instead of making
	investments in their company, for the stock market promises a higher
	profit! So the money available decreases, few people get richer and
	richer but without *using* the money -- only to get richer. And the
	amount of CIRCULATING money decreases.

If the money supply decreases, prices fall.  Big deal.

	No one has an interest in making superior products in free markets
	except for moral reasons, for
	- investments in stock markets promise the highest profit to large
	  companies

If stock speculation is the best way to profit, I wonder why anybody
ever bothered making anything.  Why did anybody ever build a railroad
or a factory, instead of just playing the stock market?

	- simply killing other companies with force is much cheaper,
	 and if you control the media, no one will learn about it

Thank god that politicians, and not industrialists or bankers, control
the police, the army and the media.

	[...]
	There are no realizable alternatives [to capitalism], so the only
	way to make it is to make the pyramid as big as possible in order
	to reach transcension before the collapse. But if the market is
	liberated, the collapse will come faster, [...]

The USSR's economy collapsed first because it was too free?

Gee, your so protective of us, thanks! But no thanks.
Look, we are talking about an image here. 

Extropic Art will be judged as Extropic Art. 
It will not be judged as science, or Extropic philosophy or as Extropic
technology. 
People will look to the scientist, nanotechnologists and philosophers to do
their job, which may be quite artful in it's OWN right.. 
ART. Poignant, evocative, prevocative, ART. 

Sci fi is also taken as art, a genre that provokes and stimulates, and is
good in itself.
Sometimes it's actually helpful in congealing ideas! As Aegis said we can all
benefit from constructive helpful ideas for our art, not put downs or rude
pessimistic comments.

I think people can tell the difference between something created out of
beauty and grace, and the true progresses of science, technology  and
biomedicine....people have that much sense.

This reflects more about your own obvious lack of understanding of Extropian
concepts (as your dogma,  pessimism and rantings about the future show) Next
time,  perhaps try and contribute rather than flail away in anger or sadness
or whatever emotional conflicts this future (and IMO very tender sounding )
piece of art brings up in you...

On the other hand, the new libertarian colony can use the proven 
and immensely successful "academic" strategy.  Not many people would
just emigrate to a place where they have no ties of any kind.  A free
education will create those ties, and the mentioned barrier becomes
negligible---who wouldn't spend a semester or two in an exotic place?
In other words, create a place one wants to return to, not escape to.

Active Fabric, A Skin for All Seasons
 by Forrest Bishop
Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering, Seattle, Washington, USA
http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb

An ideal spacesuit should be skin-tight and able to move effortlessly 
with the body. If it is made of a fabric that can change its area, as 
well as continue to maintain a particular "springiness", a suit made of 
it would 
be able to maintain a one-atmosphere pressure against the wearer's skin 
even as she moves around. The inside surface of this second skin can 
have a second circulatory system embedded in it to supply oxygen and 
carry away 
sweat from the underlying skin.
    One way of making such a suit  is with something I call "Active 
Fabric", a material that can change its area. This stuff is made up of 
layers of plates in shapes that tile the plane [Penrose], such as 
squares, rectang
les or hexagons (Figure). Two or more layers of these tiles are offset 
from each other by half the width of the tile. For human bodies, these 
plates can be quite large by nanotech standards, from a few microns to 
perhaps 
a millimeter across, and made of either diamondoid (carbon or silicon), 
ceramics, or possibly even metal. The layers of plates are connected 
together by sliding joints similar to my XY Active Cell interface 
[Bishop]. For 
square plates for example, the movement is at 45 degrees to the edge of 
the plate. This allows, (without considering a cascade of plates) an 
areal variation of something less than 400%, much more than is really 
needed for
 the spacesuit proper.
   To move two layered plates apart, a rack-and-pinion might work 
[Globus, Drexler], or a comb of linear molecules with "beads" on them 
that can take up various positions along the molecule [REF]. This also 
is what provid
es the two-dimensional compressive strength of the fabric. Buckling is 
prevented by the pressure of the enclosed body.
   To bring the sets of plates together, a network of fibers is 
attached to some of the inside layer of plates. At one end of a fiber 
might be a nanoscale winch, driven by a tiny motor, or something like 
the molecule that
 the {bacterium harpoon from Foresight gathering}assembles and 
disassembles on the fly [REF]. These fibers also only need to extend 
for twice their length, so some molecule that does this with suitable 
chemical or electri
cal prompting might make a clean solution, akin to muscle fiber 
contraction [actin REF]. Another possibility is so-called 'memory 
metal", or Nitinol, which can be made to contract when it is cooled.
   With this basic core of the fabric, different flexiblelayers can be 
laminated on either side, for other purposes than simple vaccum 
environmental support. The layer against the skin of the wearer can 
contain embedded s
ensors for pressure, temperature, water, chemicals, and so on, to help 
make things comfortable. An active gas circulatory system might 
maintain a very thin nitrogen/oxygen gas layer between the skin and the 
suit, tricking
 the natural sensors of the living skin into thinking they are in free 
air (nude). This only works on shaved areas. Variable reflectivity 
layers can help with temperature control, as can the circulatory 
system.
     The exterior layers can be almost anything. For harsh chemical 
environments, a teflon or neoprene coating  could be used, much like 
what is already available. For more general use, one would probably 
want an active o
ptical surface of some kind, perhaps Phased Array Optics [Wouk] to 
generate three dimensional displays. This kind of display, along with 
optical sensors and digital signal prossors (DSPs) can form the basis 
of a "cloaking
 device", or invisibility suit similar to the one the alien wore in the 
film "Predator". A TFT-style flexible membrane like on a laptop can 
display clothes, pictures, or movies for more sociable occasions.

Would your fog be like utility fog, or vapor fog? Would your Terminator
metal be the morphed substance that changes from a liquid state to a
luminary solid state?

The reason I have not already replied to your messages is due to the false
hope you would stop sending them. I have never seen a series of messages so
totally self-righteous and off base. You have no idea who I am, and there's
no way you could, yet you analyse me. I would appreciate if you kept your
immature, uniformed, and insulting pop psychobable to yourself. You have no
right to judge me, only my ideas.

Share the accumulated wealth and you have no investment. No investment, no
jobs, no progress, lots of poverty.

Of course it's self-interest to accumulate millions and billions. If I had
billions I would be funding technologies starting with life extension to my
benefit. I'd be delighted that many other people would benefit too, but
certainly it would benefit me.

If you think that simply having wealthy people give away their money to the
poor will abolish poverty, you're so far from the understand of the
economic world that Extropians have that this discussion doesn't belong on
this list. This list is not intended to debate such basics. Read the

We don't all have to agree to buy the same sort of car, why must we all agree

Let me ask you something straight out, do you really think people should get

Ridiculous, violence is always expensive. If necessary I would spend every

I wish everybody could get paid 2000$/hour, I wish everybody was immortal too, 
but wishing does not make it so. The sad fact is that neither is possible, 
at least not yet. If there is a huge number of people who want to work, 
can do my job as well  as I can and are currently making 1$/hour, then nobody 
is going to pay me more that 2$/hour to do the same thing. You wouldn't pay 
me more yourself, unless I was your friend and you wanted to give me charity,

No, that doesn't make me upset, what upsets me is your wish to enforce your  
opinion on others. In your posts you have said that people read the wrong 
books, watch the wrong programs on TV, go to the wrong movies, buy the wrong  
products, use the wrong computer operating system, send foolish E-mail and 
visit bad web pages. Well, perhaps so, I have strong opinions on some of 
these things too. What scares the hell out of me however is when you make it 
clear that you intend to make others have the same opinions about these 
things that you do, whether they like it or not. Eric, no offense, but I 
wouldn't trust anyone with that much power.

there must to a villain lurking about determined to make people's lives

there is simply not enough wealth for everybody to live as they would like to.

No I do not, that means that the vast majority of their money is not used for 
personal luxuries but is used in ways that the billionaire thinks will make 
even more wealth. Considering the fact that the man was smart enough to make 
all that money in the first place, do you really believe that politicians 
could use that money to increase the net wealth of the world more than the

 Was Darwin's theory that man evolved from simpler organisms "proper
science"? Can you measure the statistical significance of its outcomes?

 I'm surprised that you omitted the first person to leave earth's
atmosphere - Yuri Gagarin. Do you really think reaching the bottom
of another gravitational well (the moon) is more important than leaving
a gravitational well for the first time? I'm sure the leaders of the
Mudball^H^H^H^H^H^H^H Planetary Society think that way, but I would
expect you to try expanding their perspective.

 While Strauss & Howe are worth reading, their predictions do not
appear to be specific enough (at least in Generations) to be clearly
IMPORTANT, and I doubt they can produce more specific predictions
without being wrong on a majority of predictions.

 Here is part of an email that I sent to Robin a year ago on this
subject:

 I have been excited in the past by cyclical theories of history in
the past, and that excitement has always produced frustration about
the difficulty of producing accurate forecasts from those theories.
For instance, Klingberg's theory looked quite impressive in the 70s
when I read it. It did a good job of predicting when the public's
mood would turn against the Vietnam war (1968-1969), and could have
predicted the declining support for NASA and international airline
traffic if it had been phrased a bit more broadly. I was eager to
profit from this theory in 1989 by buying military stocks or Pan Am,
but found no confirmation of the theory at that time.

 Generations' descriptions of economic cycles (p. 355) is inconsistent
with Kondratieff wave analysis, and appears to be much less supported
by the evidence than Kondratieff's theory. I wonder how many other
claims in Generations would look suspiscious if I checked them out
carefully.

Yes, absolutely.  If it weren't, he'd be just another popular author
selling meaningless gobbledegook like _Fourth Turning_.

Evolution made specific, measurable, experimentally falsifiable
explanations and quantitative predicitons; and those explanations
have not been falsified (despite many lame attempts by creationists
and other nutcases) and many predictions came through.

Predictions were things like parallel evolution of similar life
forms on separate continents; measureable phenomena are things like
the simple fact that for every fossil in the record, there appears
a similar but not identical fossil in earlier records; the fact that
mathematical models of the time scales necessary for evolution do
not conflict with the time scales actually measured.  The fact that
mathematical models with conditions similar to life do in fact
cause the same effect ("genetic algorithms").  The fact that matching
DNA sequences between species, especially organelle DNA, shows
common ancestry.

And the most important, measurable, quanitifiable statistic imaginable:
Of the millions of species of life on Earth ever studied, /not one/
has ever been found that is not explainable by evolution.  Put one of
your social theories to that test: if you postulate that some age
was "the age of heroes" or some such nonsense, show me that /everyone/
on the planet at that time fit some definable profile.

It's certainly not rude to do so, but it's not necessarily a good thing.
I don't want to rehash my old thread on the value of rudeness and the
intellectual pathology of taking offense, but I have to say that he is
absolutely correct that /ideas/ stand on their own merit; to put value
on the originator of ideas is a fundamental mistake of epitemology.
He has expressed some valuable ideas here, albeit in a course manner,
and is likely to express more in the future, and I for one wouldn't
want to miss them.  Even those with whom I have severe disagreements,
like our Mr. de Lyser, are valuable to me, because they give me insight
into the kinds of arguments used in favor of dangerous ideas like
democracy, and help me prepare better arguments against them.

One should know something about a speaker to better interpret odd use
of language or cultural background, but once ideas are expressed and
understood, they /must not/ be judged by their source, only by their
objective value.  Our esteemed Mr. Carwash has some interesting ideas,
and my mind is not so fragile that I allow his brashness to interfere
with my making use of them.

My mail program sorts mail from the 25 or so mailing lists I'm on
into separate folders, so when I read mail I read all ExI mail at one
time.  I have not found a kill file necessary or useful for this list,
or indeed for any of the lists to which I subscribe.  The only things
I filter out at all are known unsolicited commercial spam sites, and
those I block at the IP address level, not because of any particular
person's idea, but because the ISP as a whole does not enforce terms
of service that prevent real economic loss for me, so I choose not to
accept any packets from those ISPs.

I didn't even think of this, even though I often carry on my business via
e-mail while I'm travelling and have even considered Costa Rica as a possible
personal emmigration destination from which I might be able to carry on some
of my business in the States and elsewhere as the Net gets a little better.

First of all, I did not insult Natasha as a person, I just disagreed with
her idea. Secondly, I did not judge you, plural, I gave my opinion on *a*
poster, singular. The only judgement I have about you is that you're a
suck-up and a yes man. Next time you express an independent thought come
back to me, ok? In the mean time, don't start creating "sides" in an issue
where there are none. If you want to be part of something where everyone is
in constant agreement, go join a religious cult, because last time I
checked, there was something in extropia that encouraged the free exchange
of ideas, popular or not. There's no *we* buddy, only you.

Yes!  Peter, you are absolutely correct. It's not that I didn't put his name
down because I thought it wasn't important, I was making leaps. Actually,
the perspective you are looking at, leaving gravity, is far more forward
thinking than emphasizing dropping to gravity.

The question is, should I?  From what I understand (i.e., Eric Watt Forste's
posts), that the Planetary Society is part of the JPL mind set of only
robotics to space, not transhumans. On the other hand they were supportive
of SETI. So, clue me in.  Is the World Space Society far more advanced than
the Planetary Society? I've tried expanding perspectives in the wrong venue
before, and can be a lot of effort for little or no gain.

The idea of silicon and your comments regarding its properties have shown
that there are certain specific issues to consider if silicon and silicone
are to be used. You have also suggested on the "Physics" thread an
alternative that I rather like.

Disagreeing with concepts can only propel new ways of thinking and new
ideas, if the reasons for disagreeing are substantive. The insult was not to
me, but to the opportunity of expanding our creative thinking. This is my
reason for bringing that aspect of the project to this forum. If I present
an idea, I must be open to objections, disagreements, and creative
insightful opinions. The final decision will be my own.

This thread has only continued my thinking about how the new transhuman
images might look. There is no doubt that they will be at a mid-transhuman
stage. Early transhuman is now and I wouldn't want to spend time trying to
depict the "fight or flight" aspect of our emotions.  Rather, the
mid-transhuman will have certainly expanded to the refined emotional stage
and still have some sort of "body" with which to travel.

I must appologize for my prior posts.
My conclusion is they were a lucid dream gone awry. :-)
I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me.
Fanciful nonsense filled with important words 
tends to have a way of confusing people into believing it 
and I do not want to spread any unrealistic memes.
I will try not to let religion become involved in my future discussions.
It was not well thought out.
Sometimes my emotions become too envolved.
To think I could explain things as complex as that is absurd.
I should have known better.
When it comes to science I'll leave that to the experts.
Hopefully I be able to stop chasing the impossible dream 
and learn to see all the things I have missed.
All that wasted time could have been put to much better use, 
like paying attention to family and friends.
Where has my social life gone?
I have forgotten the the most important thing in life, 
the true beauty of everyday human interaction.

Actually, this is the original reason why i began to investigate Libertarians
in the first place, which led me to Extropy,  it seem highly probable that
such an anarcho- cap world might occur spontaneously (before I ever
encountered S.O) through the very offworld nature of 'cyber- business', with
the chaning territories eroding the govt controls slowly bu t surely....and
Libertarian ideas were the closest to "workable" that are around. However I
still see many areas that are not ironed out and hope that people do not
stick dogmatically to a premise that has yet to be ground tested. IMHO, and
it is humble, believe me, we need a NEW paradigm. I did  not like Harry Brown
telling me in his book how much better the fifites were.. and how we can
return the constitution andour selves to the past...

Religious leaders on the commission? Isn't this close to a

We need to put a more positive spin on this, Steve Edwards gave me

What if cloning could be accomplished with the DNA of those no

This number was determined fairly precisely last year by Smalley's group at
Rice.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the number on line given a few minutes
of search.  I did find an estimate of 1000 GPa in a paper from the group
that apparently predates the more precise measurement:
http://cnst.rice.edu/TIPS_rev.htm.

Young's modulus is usually 30 to 100 times larger than the breaking strength
of a material.  This is equivalent to saying most materials can be stretched
by 1% to 3% before they snap.  Obviously, it's bigger for rubber-- more like
100%.  But strong materials tend to be at the low end of the range. This is
annoying, because the larger this percentage, the less susceptible the
material is to crack propagation.  That's why glass cracks easier than
rubber, even though glass is much stronger and stiffer.  

Buckytubes put under stress tend to unravel into one-atom-thick carbyne
strings, which are stronger than the original tube, but also chemically
reactive (http://cnst.rice.edu/images/tube1.gif).  It would be cool if
streching a rope made of buckytube would convert it into something even
stronger!  Probably won't work, though-- carbyne strands will react with one
another.  Even if a stretched fiber turns into a chunk of amorphous carbon,
that would be great, because that's fairly strong stuff, and it's a lot
easier doing engineering with a material that retains *some* of its strength
when its limits are exceeded.

It occurs to me that if the entire filter were due to events like this
then for 1000 light years around we should see planets with advancing
life.  This would be a billion systems, so if we were the most
advanced, it wouldn't be by much.

Interesting - a star trek like universe out for 1000 light years, and
then a vast emptiness from there on.

One of the most interesting predictions/controversies was that the
evolutionists claimed the age of the Earth was much more than the scant
million years the physicists (and geologists) at the time believed. The
physicists, led by Lord Kelvin, pointed out that if the planet was as old
as the biologists claimed it would have to be in order to fit their
evolution model and reasonable rates of species change, then it would have
cooled off through thermal conduction until it was entirely solid, which
it obviously wasn't the case (volcanoes). The evolutionists claimed 
something must be heating the Earth. 

This controversy was a real danger to evolution, but as the evolutionists 
had expected, a reasonable energy source was found (radioactive decay) 
and later evidence (from comparisions of drill cores and sediment 
layering) supported their model. A quite fine case of how a scientific 
controversy in the long run forced new research.

In The Fourth Turning, Strauss & Howe cite many other sources of
data like this, including a 200 page '69 monograph by Peter Harris in
"Perspectives in American History".  But it would be great if someone
could collect all this data, so we could graph it all and do some more
careful statistical analysis.

If you're looking for specific stocks to buy, I agree that this has
limited value.  But in The Fourth Turning they give lots of other
advice that seems pretty valuable to me (assuming they predict well).

I think they may well be guilty of overreaching.  They give lots of
good support for their basic generational mood theory, but then keep
telling us how everything else under the sun correlates with their
cycle.  And they probably haven't looked very carefully at all this
other stuff.  

I would have preferred they wrote an academic style book, making fewer
claims and being more careful to defend them.  But that doesn't make
them wrong about their core claims.  

I encourage you and others to challenge them on such overreaches at
the discussion section their web site.  They seem to reply there quite
often.

Since Science mags online site doesn't have the full text of issues from
1983, I had to go to my local universities micro-film stash. I found 2 articles
by Gallo from the same issue in 1983 [Gallo, R.C., P.S. Sarin, E.P.
Gelmann, M. Robert-Guroff, and E. Richardson.  Isolation of human
T-cell leukemia virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Science 220 (1983): 865-867; and another article immediately adjacent to
that one called "Proviral DNA of a retrovirus, Human T-cell Leukemia
Virus, in 2 patients with AIDS"].  Here is Gallo's [et al.'s] own words:

"We have been testing the hypothesis that AIDS is caused by a human
retrovirus.."

"that the viral genome of HTLV was found to be integrated into peripheral
blood lymphocyte DNA in 2 of 33 AIDS patients tested thus far may
reflect an etiologic association..."

"Since HTLV is endemic in southern Japan, the apparent lack of epidemic
AIDS in this region may argue against a causative role for HTLV in AIDS.
However...people in southern Japan may have a greater resistance to
the T-cell suppressive effect of the virus."

"Since HTLV is a T-cell tropic virus it can be linked hypothetically to other
human T-cell disorders." 

"Since HTLV can also infect marmoset and other primate T-cells, should
this virus be established as the causative agent of AIDS, it may also be
possible to develop an animal model of the disease."

"Our results, if they do reflect an etiologic role for HTLV in AIDS, suggest
a possible mechanism of disease induction."

I submit a fair reading of the evidence from the horses own mouth suggest
that Gallo was arguing that HTLV-I causes AIDS in 1983.  Others concur.

"In 1982, Robert Gallo from the National Cancer Institute in the USA, put
forward the hypothesis that the cause of AIDS is a retrovirus. One year
later, Myron Essex and his colleagues found that AIDS patients had
antibodies to the Human T-cell Leukemia virus Type-1 (HTLV-I), a virus
discovered by Gallo a few years earlier. At the same time, Gallo and his
colleagues reported the isolation of HTLV-I from AIDS patients and 
advocated a role for this retrovirus in the pathogenesis of AIDS."

Greg Burch is much too kind in response to Gregory Houston's rant - 
and it was a rant: accusing "so many people" of "completely ignoring" 
their minds, out of "laziness, laziness, laziness, laziness".

Gregory thinks that subjective reality can be studied objectively and 
that this has not been tried before.  Most of his examples are yogic 
feats of self-control or idiot-savant abberations.

There's a nice little place Gregory might like where his approach has 
been practiced for thousands of years.  He could join the 
inward-looking Brahmins in contemplating the various degrees of 
ecstasy and the endless patterns of homologous forms, memorizing the 
Vedas, and so on. Leaving us Kshatriyas (politicians), Vaisyas 
(scientists) and Sudras (menial mundane masses) to our "lazy" pursuits 
of physical and cultural development.  Or, Gregory could be a little 
bit more high-tech and join the Solipsist Nation described in Greg 
Egan's _Permutation City_.

A while back, Gregory provided a useful URL to some essays by Claude 
Rifat.  I found some interesting information on psychedlics and 
neurochemistry, and some appalling philosophy.  (From 
http://www.dog.net.uk/claude/dreams.html)
<Just see how people are running into exceedingly primitive 
computer-generated virtual realities. Imagine what would happen if all 
people could go, at will, into the ultimate virtual reality of their 
own mind!!! The mercantilistic society which now prevails would just 
become extinct as, in our endoreality, we can achieve everything we 
want at no cost at all. The only cost is learning. In such a future, 
life would be more tranquil as people would obviously cease to compete 
and desperately run after "exoreal" objects in order to run, instead, 
after their own informational objects.>

Where does he think the models for our internal "informational 
objects" come from if not from experience in the exoreality?! Claude 
then goes on to relate his wonderful visions of buttocks turning into 
bananas and mushrooms turning into tables, along with the ecstasies 
that can be made to accompany these revelations. Yet, for some 
perverse reason, most people (who, BTW, also dream these things every 
night, and are also, for the most part, only too aware of their own 
emotions) persist in such "lazy" exoreality activities as eating, 
drinking, breathing, working, playing, raising families, contributing 
to their community...

Apparently having primarily the reference of "a select group of people 
who I have cultivated similar experiences with", Gregory seems 
ignorant of the extent to which other educated people, both scientists 
and political types, have already explored (and documented) their 
subjective realities while still maintaining productive contact with 
objective reality.

I make an effort to examine and catalog every dream I can recall. Not 
having had access to LSD for many, many years, I sometimes thrive on 
the effervescent patternist trances provided by piracetam (among other 
things). I enjoy discovering the fundamental forms, feelings and 
forces that pervade both my fantasies, friends, family and exoreality 
functions.  But, after over 20 years of this exploration, I find that 
while these flights of fantasy are fortifying and occasionally 
enlightening, they are, after all, cartoons, caricatures, and have 
value (aside from entertainment) only so far as they can be applied to 
exoreality.

I have no problem with the solipsist who is truly so and minds his own 
business; but, when he starts bothering me with his begging bowl... 
Well, talk about biting the hand that feeds you!

Consider the Australian aborigines, certainly connoisseurs of the 
Dreamtime, but they hardly use their visions to just contemplate 
endless abstractions (or turn themselves into calculating 
thermostats), they use them to gain insights into the creatures, 
plants and harsh environments they must understand so well in order to 
survive and thrive.  The real pleasure, and the only true creativity, 
comes when we are able to merge the endo and exo realms.

In his 1994 novels, Poul Anderson offered some insights on the future 
extremes of endo vs. exo approaches to life:
<09/10/94. Finished Poul Anderson's "The Stars Are Also Fire": The 
inorganic intelligence of the Cybercosm and the Teramind seek the 
"transfinite": "Within the finite time to singularity, an infinite 
number of events can take place, an infinity of thoughts ... Whether 
the transfiguration be freezing or fiery, awareness will endure and 
evolve forever. Long, long before then ... it will know all things 
that exist ... and lovingly set them aside. Its own works - arts, 
mathematics, undertakings, unimaginable for ages to come - are what 
shall occupy its eternity ... By its nature, the cybercosm must seek 
for absolute knowledge; but this required absolute control, no wild 
contingencies, nothing unforeseeable except the flowerings of its 
intellect. The cybercosm was totalitarian." On the other hand: 
"Demeter Mother [her awareness replicated & distributed among the 
birds and bees, the flowers and trees, perhaps in some nanotech, viral 
manner] is the ancient life, organic, biological ... She will always 
be of the material universe and its wildness, its chaos, its 
mortality. Never will her intellect be pure and wholly free." As She 
says [in "Harvest of Stars"]: "I am content, but I can never be 
fullfilled. No living creature ever can be; and that is the real 
miracle of life.">

As for Gregory's claims that
<We are matter, localized energy, whats to say that with sufficient 
intermiediary steps that we could not move on from bio-feedback to 
controlling our energy in new and profound ways. [Snip] Could we not 
travel great distances by merely changing the structure of our own 
energy, modifying ourselves so that we could propel ourselves at and 
sustain high speeds.>

I have studied Carlos Casteneda's investigations of these 
possibilities for decades and, given some *useable* holonomic model of 
reality, there may be something to these type of claims for a 
'non-technical'  distributed existence.  Certainly Moravecian platonic 
materialism seems to be moving in this direction. But (in Casteneda's 
case), talking vaguely about human beings as 'energy fields' is not 
science.  Also, even the advanced shamanic disciplines described by 
Casteneda recognize the need for the complementary practice of *both* 
'Dreaming' (remote-sensing / passive witnessing) and 'Stalking' 
(telepresence / interaction) with the physical world under 'altered' 
states of consciousness.  Dreaming is concerned with remapping the 
'sensory homunculus', while Stalking is concerned with remapping the 
'motor homunculus', and 'Seeing' is the ability to comprehend 
every-day reality, in some non-local way, with these remapped mental 
models.

The point of the above discussion, of some fascinating techniques that 
I'm nevertheless very skeptical of, is that even these advanced 
shamanic disciplines do not try to create some false dichotomy between 
the 'inner world' and the 'outer world'.  You can lose yourself in 
solipsism like Poul Anderson's Teramind, or you can engage the 
objective reality in a biotechnical way.

I really think you need to understand something at at least a basic
level before you can reject it this strongly.  Strauss & Howe do give
a plausible causal influence story, they don't try to explain
everything, they do address geographic variation, and whether
something depresses you is no indication of whether it is true.
Please either learn the basics here or say you don't know.

Not quite- consider the mixing that occurs as star systems circulate
about the galaxy. An initially spherical 'dead zone' 2000 ly diameter
will first be stretched into a prolate ellipsoid over a few tens of 
millions of years, then bent into a crescent shape. Stars will enter 
and leave this volume on time scales of hundreds of millions of years,
eventually diffusing it to unrecognizability. The ensuing structure of 
dead (or unicellular life) and (complex)living systems might be more of 
a scattered 3D mosaic, peppered with the more recent dead zones.

This might explain the 'hard step' between unicellular and 
multi-cellular life: single-cell life is relatively 'easy', given 
autocatalysis and self assembling vesicles, and is fairly radiation
resistant. Multicells are much less resistant, and need several hundred 
million years of radiation-quiet time to evolve.
On Earth, single cells arose quite early- before the crust even cooled,
but it took several billion years before multicell life. Perhaps
these occasional massive radiation events kept bombing us back to
single cell forms during this period, and then we got lucky.

Steve,

Thanks for taking the time to track down the article on chimps I asked for. As you
say, it is not exactly a Nature article, but I try to keep up on this debate so
I wanted to see this evidence.

Since HIV didn't seem to me to be acing like a typical infectious disease, I 
carefully considered the arguments of Duesberg and others [his and some of their
papers are nicely collected at www.duesberg.com] and found that their arguments
were persuasive to me. And when I ran for governor of PA for the libertarian party in 
1994, I was asked to answer a whole slew of questionairres, one of which was from
the League of Gay and Lesbian Voters. They had a few questions on AIDS, and so I
felt the need to answer responsibly to their questions. Duesbergs recent book and
the video I just got are very persuasive, IMHO. 

Thanks again.

And it ought to be remembered that even if you interpret 'killing' in a
milder sense, as in 'doing dirty deeds on the market', that too, is
expensive (e.g. collusive monopoly is almost always too expensive to
maintain, and can only be guaranteed by force, by government).

Some thoughts:-

It is usually far less costly to deal straight, especially in a  society
that is ruled (i.e. ordered) by the principles people  live by (embodied
in law) and not by people.

And even in a society that is ruled by people, a pool of people who rule
themselves by principle form a strong attractor for society as a whole,
and may in the end inspire society as a whole to do the same.

The political stance of libertarianism is to live and exemplary life, to
embody one's principles in one's activity.  Organisation is always a
secondary consideration, creating and maintaining institutions is always
a secondary consideration.  First consideration is always: "Am I living
by my own principles".

If this isn't sorted out first, one's organisation of others, and one's
ideas for the organisation of others, is poisoned by hypocrisy.

Freedom is a state that must be won first of all from *within* - this is
the lesson of the Sixties, in both the success and the failure of the
politics of the Sixties.  

This is the real reason for the resurgence of classical liberalism, in
its dual 'entryism' as libertarianism in the Right, and the gradual
ditching of 'top-down' solutions in the Left.

Oops, you're right.  But it would be plausible for our solar system
all the way out through our bound comets to be teaming with life.

If multi-celluar life on a planet gets destroyed every 100my, then
this should happen on average 100 times over 10by.  So the chance it
never happened at any one place is exp(100) ~= 10^-43 (assuming a
poisson distribution).  So how big is a sphere enclosing 10^43 stars?

This is really too much.  You described the book as "resonating" with
your own feelings, offering no epistemology by which it should be
properly judged, and then you criticize someone else for dismissing it
based on his feelings.

A few days ago, I spent about an hour reading their web stuff to
determine whther or not I should read the book, and I couldn't find
a single word that actually said anything.  Every paragraph looked
exactly like astrological descriptions: vague, uncommitted, hedged,
inspecific--a cold read.  There's not one single claim made to which
specific dates and specific results--even statisical ones--are tied.
There's just the right mix of disasterbation and hopefulness to make
it a bestseller and no real content to make it disprovable.

In short, I decided early on it would be pointless to waste valuable
time, money, and brain cells on it.  This was not a matter of evaluating
its merits based on depression; it was not the case that I judged it by
its emotional effect; it was that I judged it by its flawed reasoning,
and my emotional reaction to that evaluation followed.

But the filter may well not be due solely to such events.  Colliding
neutron stars, nearby supernovae, having your solar system drift through
a dust cloud, having a superjovian in your system to throw comets at
you... there could be a bunch of astronomical filters which we don't
easily know of because they were all absent for us, by definition.

I've just read Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_, in which he
tries to look at the environmental factors behind Eurasian dominance.
Mostly "we" had more domesticable plants and animals than any one else,
on a bigger continent, oriented along a main climatic zone.  It may in
the process shred L. Neil Smith's ideas about development and extreme
Ayn Randism.  1000 John and Jane Galts dropped into Australia 40,000
years ago would still get hosed by English convicts.

But it's given me more filter ideas.  One, if developing technology can
be that dependent on environment, it helps my intuition that developing
intelligence might be as well, so until we learn more intelligence could
well be extremely improbable.  Two, there is no guarantee a bunch of
hunter-gatherers will get out of that state.  If there's a shortage of
domesticable plants (flip side: if Earth/Asia was improbably blessed),
or say if Africa had been a separate continent, so that the domesticable
large mammals of Eurasia got wiped out before their domestication was
needed, food production might never have happened, at least not in any
large way.

[Large animal thing: domesticated large mammals consist of 13 Eurasian
animals and the llama, the dog not being counted in this size class.
America and especially Australia hardly have any large mammals --
possibly because their first experience with hominids was with
Cro-Magnon hunters, who could have hunted them out of extinction
quickly.  African and Eurasian animals had closer to a million years to
evolve a fear of large bipeds.  My personal theory for why Africa lacks
domesticable megafauna is that they had too much time to evolve a fear
of bipeds; a few Eurasian species were still working on it, and thus
weren't too vicious or panicky.  If Africa had been separate, Eurasia
would also have met Cro-Magnon, not proto-hominids, and their megafauna
might have gone poof.]

Diamond and Sulloway may be spearheading the turning of history into
science, although I'm quoting Michael Shermer of _Skeptic_ here.  I
suppose _The Fourth Turning_ might be part of it as well, although I
admit I'm more suspicious of what I've heard of those ideas.

Wouldn't it be a smaller region?  If the galaxy was peppered with
events which normally wiped out a sphere 1000 ly in size, and we
waited long enough that almost all the galaxy would have been
covered a few times, then there might be a few places which were
left uncovered. They would be little cracks among the bulk of the
galaxy which had experienced the explosions.  So I think we would
expect to find ourselves within one of those thin areas just outside
the boundaries of several nearby explosions.

My compliments to Natasha, as opposed to E. Russell, for her calmness in

reading of Carwash: "making the extropians concepts ... LOOK like
scifi."  Nanotech may not be scifi, but associating it with posters
showing people with skin of pure silicon may well cause people to think
of nanotech as pulp scifi.  Johnny Carwash being an existence, although
not a frequency, proof.

Why would you want a silicon, or silicon-compound, skin anyway?  If you
have that kind of tech, and want semiconductors in your skin, use
diamond circuitry.  Much more useful would be diamondoid plates.  Or
perhaps buckyhair.  How does buckyfiber rate on the Kevlar scale?  For
more decoration, artificial quartzes, corundum, or diamond, with
impurities in some particular pattern.

} It's certainly not rude to do so, but it's not necessarily a good thing.

On the other hand, some people have high enough volume, and few enough
worthwhile ideas, that I have found it worth filtering them out.  Deleting
lots and lots of messages takes some time, and more annoyance.  Actually
I have four levels of filtering, manifested as four mailboxes:

/dev/null, for the few, the proud, the worthless.

junk, for those whom I normally don't read, but who occasionally say
something interesting.  I figure if they do, someone will followup to
them and I'll be notified by the included text, and I might be able to
go back and read the original.  If there's any need.

extro, for the bulk of the list.

select, a recent addition.  The idea was that I might prefer to read
only a few guaranteed people when I was really busy, and ignore the bulk
list unless they flagged something interesting.  I've actually generally
been able to follow the main list as well.  

But, at Robin's suggestion I'll make that filter available to anyone who
asks.  Send mail to 

select@ugcs.caltech.edu 

and about once a day I'll send you my select mailbox, probably with the
advantage of having been thread-sorted.  Usefully replying to it won't be
possible; you'll have to go through the main extropians list to respond
in public.

Current selectees, in no order:

Anders Sandberg
Carl Feynman
Damien Broderick
Damien Sullivan (me)
Greg Burch
Tom Morrow
Max More
Robin Hanson
John Clark
Hara Ra
Hal Finney
Eric Watt Forste
Eugene Leitl
Alexander Chislenko
Jay Reynolds Freeman

I can think of other people who might be on the list, but they're either
gone or they've been very quiet.

ObDisclaimer: non-selectees are not considered worthless by any means.
They just haven't written what I've found to be consistently provocative
or amusing enough posts.  I don't know if I meet my own standards, but
I've gotten some praise at least, and it's my filter.

I respect your grounds for rejecting the book, that they haven't
presented their theory and evidence in a formal enough way to meet
your standards of persuasion.  Chris, on the other hand, seems to just
be seriously mistaken about what the book says.   

I have said nothing even close to liking the book because of
`"resonating" with your own feelings'.  Please provide a direct quote.

Sounds like a great idea (and not only because I was on the list :-). 
Ideally, many of us might provide our personal select lists, so that you 
can enhance your mail by joining a select-list belonging to somebody you 
generally agree with.

Hmm, I see some fascinating applications for sociological cluster-analysis
software here to help people find their ideal select lists. One could even
use set operations to personalize further... Sasha, this is quite close to
some of your old proposals. 

As a transhumanist and net.resident, I applaud this idea. We need more 
proactive people!

Oops again.  We're only looking at about 1 billion years of

Well, domestication _was_ a process of co-evolution.  According to
Diamond some areas were domesticating plants, but they started late and
went slower.  Mesoamerica, using corn, or the Eastern US, using things
they quickly abandoned once corn finally came up to them, would be
examples.  Australia and California would be examples of agriculture not
happening at all.

But the evidence covers 13,000 years, and you're suggesting 10 million
years of hunter-gatherers, so you may have a point.  Or dogs or llamas
could have been bred to other purposes.  Or guinea pigs could have been
bred to be really big, if someone saw a point.  On the other hand, if my
idea of why African megafauna wasn't domesticable is correct, exposure
to hominids might just cause animals to be more vicious and wary.  With
any more docile animals getting eaten before their value could be realized.

This would be one of the kinks in the Great Filter.  The previous idea
was that was optimal for the origin of life, Earth for the survival, so
life would require origin on a Mars-like planet and transmission to an
Earth-like world.  My kink would be an Africa-Eurasia setup, where
animals can be exposed to us for long enough to survive skilled hunters
but not so long they're impossible to domesticate when needed.

 My compliments to Natasha, as opposed to E. Russell, for her calmness in

 reading of Carwash: "making the extropians concepts ... LOOK like
 scifi."  Nanotech may not be scifi, but associating it with posters
 showing people with skin of pure silicon may well cause people to think
 of nanotech as pulp scifi.  Johnny Carwash being an existence, although
 not a frequency, proof.
 
 Why would you want a silicon, or silicon-compound, skin anyway?  If you
 have that kind of tech, and want semiconductors in your skin, use
 diamond circuitry.  Much more useful would be diamondoid plates.  Or
 perhaps buckyhair.  How does buckyfiber rate on the Kevlar scale?  For
 more decoration, artificial quartzes, corundum, or diamond, with
 impurities in some particular pattern.

I have not been even trying to be calm ( in fact i am quite pissed off about

concern for artists here is that Extropians are being censored. 
Are we only allowed to publish nonfiction now? Is sci fi not to be considered
Extropic? When did this occur? Who will decide what art is correct? IMO, it
should be the free market.

 A good calm discussion would be lovely, redining and honing the artist's
ideas until they cwith more scientific realities... but that  was not
apparently what Mr. Carwash" had intended, and Natasha quite obviously
returned the debate to that level. Your post, for example,  is quite polite,
helpful, and suggestive. But the dirisive and insulting language that was
aimed at Natasha's piece ( which if anyone bothered to read tha post was
based on an image honoring her father) did not seem to be positive or
uplifting, it actually belittled and abused. She chose not to respond in that
manner. 

Now he backtracks and says it was constructive, but let's try and not confuse
Natshasha's natural grace with the actual intent.

Upon rereading your post of the 5th, you're right.  That was an unfair
characterization of your actual words, which just said things like
"important", "probably right", "crucial" and such.  I extrapolated from
my memory of this further than I should have, and I apologize.

I suppose much of my reaction to that particular post may have been
that you also described the book as "supported" (whatever that means)
by both Clinton and Gingrich, as if that were something positive.  It
took considerable effort on my part to not immediately dismiss it on
those grounds alone, but I did manage to overcome my revulsion and
spend some time reading the web site so I could dismiss it with a
clearer conscience.

Oh, hogwash.  You're not being "censored" in the least--you're just
being evaluated.  That's what art is for--to provoke reaction, and it
did precisely that.  The fact that one particular reaction was "hey,
that's a stupid idea" is just a manifestation of the free market we
all value.  No one is suggesting stopping you or anyone from making
whatever art you please.  We are every bit as free to judge works by
our freely chosen standards as you are to make them--and to criticize
us for not evaluating art by your standards.

I'm compiling a list of technologies that accelerate overall technological
progress, especially those technologies most relevant to augmenting the
human body and brain. The list also includes creative machines, i.e.,
software that generates novel results. My existing list follows. I'd
appreciate any suggested additions or details on things already listed (or
places where I can find the details, preferably on the web).

What I'm looking for are examples not of technologies that directly
constitute changes to humans (such as cochlear implants, artificial
retinas, etc.), but technologies that accelerate the development of such
things.


Things that accelerate progress in ways that may speed up development of
technologies that augment humans:

Faster chips.
DNA computers, protein memory.
Quantum computers.
Optical computing.
3-D modelling of biochemistry.
Fuzzy logic search algorithms to detect patterns in genes.
Hypertext, agents, database search tools for digging through massive
amounts of information. (Specific examples of such tools?)


Technologies that accelerate development of human augmentations:

Computer-aided design.
Simulation of biochemical systems to discover effective new drugs (specific
examples of this?)
Faster genome sequencing.
DNA chips for testing sequences of DNA to determine function. (Also
positional cloning to discover disease-causing genes and maybe
ability-carrying genes.)
MRI, PET, and other brain scanning technologies.


Computers creating new things:

The Argonnes Lab automated problem solver that solved the Robbins problem.
(Mathematical creativity.)
Drexlers suggestion of automated engineering.
Dawkins Biomorph Land program and artificial life such as Tom Rays
Tierra. (Anyone have a URL for info on Tierra?)
Genetic algorithms.
Economic models using bottom-up analysis (letting models of individuals and
firms generate their own results).
Computer novelists. (Specific references for stories and novels written by
computers appreciated.)
Examples of learning algorithms?

Thanks,

Max

I am aware that this might be a little off subject but it is one of my
hobby's to argue with theists.  I am aware that I do not have a chance of
changing their views.  Right now my current goal is having someone say,
"That's a good argument, but I still believe."

I'm posting this now because I actually met someone who I did not have to
give them a God to believe in.  Usually a theist's conception of their god
is so underdeveloped the first step is to get a definition.  I'll outline
my best argument so far.

First, I ask a question:
Is God omniscient?

If the answer is no, than I'm sunk because then my arguement is that a
person could become God and that sort of blasphemy tends to block the minds
quickly.

If the answer is yes, than it gets interesting.

I use the maximum possible definition of ominiscent.  At this point I
eliminate many other people who just don't follow what comes next.

If a being is omniscent then it knows the position and state of every
particle in the universe.  Of course, to get that kind of resolution, the
being would need the entire universe as a storage device.  Since adding any
thought to this being would result in more information in the universe we
are left with the problem of infinite simulations within simulations.  This
leads to paradox and a paradox is the conclusion of a negative proof.

I need some feedback on this.  I want to refine this arguement until there
are as few scientific holes in it as possible.  I would appreciate all
help.

The problem you ignore is the numbers. You aren't doing your math.
Confiscating the wealth of the top 20% and giving it equally to
everybody wouldn't do squat. The total wealth of the entire world is
estimated at $50 trillion. With over 5.5 billion people, thats less than
$10,000 per person, as a one time payment, once, thats it. One hell of a
big party and its all over. A 6 month socialist paradise...... hooey.

I meant that the sun would be in the plane of rotation, so that one side
of the ring would eclipse the opposite side, thus sheilding it from
direct exposure. The fresnel lenses would be an extension of the
cylinder, so that the opposite face would get light bent around the
north and south ends of the ring. Yes, using this, more light could be
gathered when further away from the sun, but the downside is that with
structures of such intermediate size, the "day" would equal the period
of rotation, and would be more like the minute hand on the clock.
Possibly a seriously disorienting experience, going through 48 light
cycles in a day, but possibly balanced by artificial lighing. They could
however, alternate between reflective and refractive states, thus
allowing natural lighting for  the full circuit, and having colony wide
day and night cycles.

Contact Linda Cannon at her website, The Linda Cannon Gallery. One of

        I apologize for the fact that my emotions got ahead of objective

occasionally.  I am not being a "suck-up" or a "yes man" by saying this, but
I think a general apology on my behalf is in order.

        *However*...I still find Johnny Carwash's posts to be rude and
condescending in the least.  I sincerely hope that this conflict of ideas is

My recent posts [on this thread] were a little out of line, and so I
apologize and want to get on to the future.

I don't think that buckyfibre is terribly practical as a clothing material.
Simply put, the applications for buckytubes are for storing other things,
such as fuel or whatnot. Since most fibres are polymers, (like Kevlar), it
would be very possible to make a super Kevlar, a lighter stronger Kevlar,
through nanotechnology. By arranging the atoms manually, all the problems
associated with Kevlar can be eliminated. In fact, I think a good design
would be strands of super Kevlar joining nanoscale diamond crystals. Since
they're all carbon based (diamonds being pure carbon) it may be possible to
chemically bond them. I'm not sure though, I'm not an organic chemist.

has anyone heard of Netscape plugins that allow filtering? I've got
navigator 3.01 and haven't seen any of this sort of feature here. WHile
going to a more specialized mail reader has its ups, I prefer the easy
browser/mailer compatibility of netscape. Any feedback?

One the filter space ideas that Sasha had a while back, this would be an
interesting java applet to put on the exi page. I've seen clustering
apps elsewhere.

I've noticed my own tastes focus over the past several months, which
would explain why I've been posting less than I used to, besides having
more work to do elsewhere, and having to screen through more messages.
Mostly, though, the conversations have seemed to be getting more
mundane, snippy, and banal. Sorry folks, the flaming over silicon skin
was really lame... I've noticed my own attitude toward banality has
shifted from feeling the need to reply to avoidance just to reduce the
clutter......

I was at a family get together this weekend in Rhode Island, a 60th
birthday for an uncle. i was sitting with my parents, and several uncles
and aunts when the subject of cloning came up (they are all practicing
Catholics). I stated that I could not understand how anyone who was
pro-life could be anti-cloning, as cloning is simply one more option for
creating life. 

They replied that cloning was not a natural act of creation, to which 
I asked them if they were for in vitro procedures and use of fertility
drugs. They said yes. I said that those practices are not natural, and
use of fertility drugs frequently causes the production of clones in the
womb (commonly known as twins), and if cloning were to be outlawed, then
twins, triplets, etc would have to be aborted to comply with laws.

Given this, they then said that they didn't like the concept of
individuals going off and having their own children and raising them as
single parents (hidden message: anti-gay parenting, anti-single mother),
which was in their opion enough of a reason to outlaw it. I said that
the procedure would most likely be used in cases where one parent in a
couple is either infertile or has a genetic trait that would cause undue
suffering and hardship for the child, giving parent the option of having
a clone of only one parent (the "clean" one) that they can both raise.
They replied that parents can be artificially inseminated and can use
surrogate mothers, to which I retorted that given the total disregard of
the courts for surrogate parenting agreements, as seen in numberous
custody battles in the courts, causing extensive harm emotionally and
financially to the families involved, it is a better solution to keep
things as much "in the family" as possible, which is what cloning can
do. There would be no third party source of genetic material to
complicate things legally.

Given this, they agreed that cloning was indeed a pro-family
reproductive option.....

God's existence or non existence is a matter of faith. There's no evidence
that will make a very pious individual become an atheist. In any case,
there's nothing about religion that is for or against nanotechnology.
Judaism has always adapted to changes in society, and the Dalai Lama said
the physics would not change for Buddhism, Buddhism would change for
physics. You'll never conclusively prove God doesn't exist, simply because
no one who believes will accept it. Similarily, it's nearly (but less)
impossible to prove that God does exist.

My idea has been to promote cloning as a limited power in response to God's
awe inspiring might (this is of course, if I am arguing with a theist).  We
still need a mother for the clone.  We still need the basic building blocks
of life (or creation), that is, DNA and all other cellular apparatus.  The
amount of dependence on nature that cloning involves is incredible.  There
are foods that involve more chemistry than cloning (or at least I think
there are, I cannot provide evidence at the moment).

Just wondering, what did I leave out of my original post that showed an
ignorance of this?  I cut down the quote and it seems to have the same
message of your response.  I am just doing this as a hobby.  I know I
cannot change anyone.  They must find the true path within themselves
(religious terminology used loosely, and not at all seriously).

NSS is in essence a mouthpiece for government, aerospace and military 
entities.
Have a look at their sponsors, and at Ad Astra (their newsletter) 
articles.
I have not seen any support from them for private space initiatives,
although they might have, and certainly individual members do. Mostly, 
it looks like "business as usual".

Nothing, I'm not correcting you, just giving you my opinion. I happen to

I think the problem with your argument is that even though we define the
universe as everything, I find theists generally consider god to somehow
be "outside" of the universe.  I don't think you're going to change their
opinion on this.

However, one argument I see theists constantly using is that of teleology.
They will point out that if anything is complex, it must be made by
someone.  If we see something complex like an airplane, it must be made
by an intelligent creator( in this case, human beings)   Then the theist
will ramble on about how amazingly complex the human body is, how if the
human genome was in book form, it would fill the grand canyon multiple
times, etc., etc.  Anyway, if you are making a precise map of the
mandelbrot set, it will overflow an infinite number of universes, so the
human complexity thing is a bit of a silly argument meant to awe people
into a faith in a higher power.

	Anyway, if a theist ever tells you that the universe is too
complex to have just "popped" into existence, you've got them nailed.  The
problem with saying that complexity must have a creator is that it has no
end.  If the a deity created the universe, then logically this deity is
more complicated than the universe.  For this deity to be THAT
complex(according to theist logic), it MUST have a creator.  So there has
to be a God version 2 basically that created version 1.  And it goes on,
and on, and on.  To what end?  Wouldn't it be simpler to just to let the
universe stand on its own, or to have multiple universes popping into
existence like virtual particles?

	I disagree with Johnny Carwash's statement that some are too pious
to be swayed from their faith in god, or that faith and science can
coexist(although I think he actually said faith and nanotechnology)  I do
not see how faith and Pancritical Rationalism can exist together, and PCR
is really what is necessary for a workable scientific method.  An
unshakeable faith in god means that you could just as easily have an
unshakable faith in lamarkism.  Of course, thinking that god probably
exists, and that god irrefutably exists are two entirely separate things,
as separate as science and faith.

The dynamic optimisit in me tells me that no mind is closed, since all
minds are in constant flux, and where that flux will lead is too chaotic
to predict.  Even the strongest belief can be a temporary thing.

Maybe I can put some insight into what I was trying to say. I come from a
somewhat religious Jewish background, although I am an atheist, and I have
had many debates with people who believe in God over whether or not God
conflicts with science. To me, and to many others, there's nothing in
rational thought that conflicts with God. To many people, including Albert
Einstein, the incredible complexity of the universe, and how it all works so
beautifully, is proof of God itself. There's nothing in the bible that
negates the rational concepts of science. In Judaism, most people are not
fundamentalists, and there is something of a consesus, (surprisingly very
commonly in the very orthodox groups), that the Torah is designed for
interpretation. Commentaries such as Rashi, and the Talmud go one step in
that direction. The next step is the mystical discipline of Gematria, using
numbers to learn more about the nature of God and of the word. In this way
science and religion can coexist. The more we learn about the nature of our
universe, the more we learn about God. The higher we ascend as a species,
the closer we come to God. Keep in mind that the afterlife is a xtian
concept, not a Jewish one. Faith in God doesn't go against science, it
encourages it.

You may want to include all of the groupware programming, the 
software that allows individuals to conference electronically, 
whether over the Internet, web sites, or internal computer networks.  

Especially the applications that allow multiple off-site users to 
mark changes on design plans.  Usage of these applications has 
drastically cut travel time, meeting time and increased the pace of 
adapting to last-minute engineering problems.

even done this, however many PhD's have done at least _some_ research (if not
most PhDs).

That really does not matter except you could have gotten training by
participating in those activities.   If you wish, I would like to help you.
 Keep reading.  You are very motivated in this subject and I find that
refreshing. 
 
----------------------------------------------------- 
Scientific papers are divided into the sections following: 
I.  Purpose 
II.  Introduction/Background  
III.  Methods and Materials 
IV.  Data/Results Section 
and 
V. The Results and/or Discussion (Where the data is discussed and where
future research direction is speculated on based on the data and the
experience of the authors.)  Most of your quotes are from this section (and
rightly so, on your part). 
------------------------------------------------------ 
(I will use you post as an example because you seem very intrigued with this
subject.) 
 
The (Gallo et al's) discussion section speculates on future research
possibilities based on his data and research experience.  That is what the
discussion section of a scientific paper is for.    The introduction section
is  
 
1.  Gallo et al. says "IF" HTLV plays a role at all and NOT that HTLV
actually _does_ play a role. 
 
Do you see difference?  You read "IF" as "DOES."  . .  .  "Our results, [ if
 ] they do reflect an etiologic role for HTLV in AIDS, suggest a possible
mechanism of disease induction." 
 
2.  He says HTLV-like virus and does NOT say HTLV-I (or HTLV-II, HTLV-III or
HTLV-V).  Do you see the difference between a class of viruses and a specific
virus?  This is normal in microbiology.  So, you should be careful what you
"read-into" the discussion section.  Scientists usually should use hedge
words to minimize any misinterpretation by the scientific community. 
 
You read "HTLV" as "HTLV-I". .  .  So, you misread the virus class as a
specific virus.  "Our results, if they do reflect an etiologic role for [
HTLV  ] in AIDS, suggest 
a possible mechanism of disease induction."   
 
Also notice they (Gallo et al) was the words "suggest" and "possible."  Again
they are not sure and are making very sure trained scientists know they are
not sure.  There will be no doubts, with trained scientists, that Gallo et al
are not suggesting that they have discovered a virus or a mechanism causing
AIDS.  
 
This is significant because in the popular press (and layman's language)
"suggest" and "possible" are considered as powerful hedge words (or
speculation words) as in a scientific paper.  This is where you will have to
"put on your scientist cap" and learn how to read the scientific papers
differently than a layman's news report.   This is an important area.  You
will see this again and again and may not be sure how to interpret the
author's scientific dialect. 
 
3.  There is also nothing in the (Gallo et al) purpose about proving HTLV-I
causes AIDS;  Only that they (Gallo et al) wanted to test if a retrovirus of
some kind involved in the AIDS.  And they know that is all their research
suggests:  "We have been testing the hypothesis that AIDS is caused by a
human retrovirus.."   
 
This does NOT say that they did anything more than try to find a retroviral
cause of AIDS.  It was a very proper thing to do since at the time (the early
1980's) nobody knew what was going on with the cause of AIDS. 
 
4.  "that the viral genome of HTLV was found to be integrated into peripheral

blood lymphocyte DNA in 2 of 33 AIDS patients tested thus far may 
reflect an etiologic association..."   
 
This set off bells in scientists in France (and around the world) where they
were looking at different research directions to go to in.  Secretly, they
already had started the peer review with their own paper (also published in
_Science_ ) and they were probably very happy when Gallo et al vindicated
their own speculations about a viral cause of AIDS independently.    
 
Because 33 AIDS patients were positive for retrovirus (HTLV-like) this was
very strong  evidence an HTLV class virus is involved.  However, since the
HTLV retroviruses are so close in genone it was hard for them (Gallo's group)
to tell them apart; or if the HTLV class viruses were incidental or an actual
cause, hence the hedge words used in the discussion section of the paper.   
 
Again HTLV-I is NOT the only virus suspected by the authors.  In fact,
because they were so unsure (and careful not to be called wrong by peer
review) they did NOT single out HTLV-I as the only possible cause.   They
invited further research by others to find a new virus, possibly related to
the HTLV class of viruses.  And, they _were_ careful, they were apparently
RIGHT!  (at least for one of the causes of AIDS)  But Gallo's group was NOT
sure at the time this article was published and they did not get credit for
the viral discovery of AIDS at the time.  The Pasteur Institute beat him to
it.  Yet, Gallo got the credit after all, partly because they were lead in
the right direction by the Pasteur Institute's virology group paper and
getting viral samples from France group. 
 
5.  "Since HTLV is endemic in southern Japan, the apparent lack of epidemic 
AIDS in this region may argue against a causative role for HTLV in AIDS. 
However...people in southern Japan may have a greater resistance to 
the T-cell suppressive effect of the virus." 
 
So, they argue _against_ even the whole class of HTLV viruses as the cause of
AIDS.  That does not support your premise that they were arguing only for the
HTLV class of what we now know as several viruses with similar genome.   
 
Notice how each Gallo et al statement agrees with what I said in my previous
posts.  Gallo gives a fair speculation and assessment of HTLV and a possible
reason for HTLV not being the cause.  He should and does speculate on a
reason for the endemic virus resistance.   
 
6.  "Since HTLV is a T-cell tropic virus it can be linked hypothetically to
other 
human T-cell disorders."    
 
Gallo said "can be" not _is_ and not as a cause but as a speculation.  Also
Gallo does not even say HTLV-I, but uses the correct HTLV class name for what
became HTLV-III and is (currently at least) called HIV.   
 
7.  "Since HTLV can also infect marmoset and other primate T-cells, should 
this virus be established as the causative agent of AIDS, it may also be 
possible to develop an animal model of the disease." 
 
Very good and proper future research direction. 
 
8.  "Should this virus be established"  is another speculation and not a
direct argument for the virus being established; only a future research
direction.  That is what good scientists do when they are not yet sure or has
not felt that they have proved their point.

I hope this helps you become more familiar with scientific paper
interpretation.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Some errors here:
 
1.  "In 1982, Robert Gallo from the National Cancer Institute in the USA, put
forward the hypothesis that the cause of AIDS is a retrovirus."

No, it was 1983.  You found that error yourself probably already by the
Science paper you posted.

2.  One year later, Myron Essex and his colleagues found that AIDS patients
had
antibodies to the Human T-cell Leukemia virus Type-1 (HTLV-I), a virus
discovered by Gallo a few years earlier. 

Misleading.  HTLV-I was found in 1976 by Asher, Gibbs and Gajdusek. 

3.  At the same time, Gallo and his colleagues reported the isolation of
HTLV-I from AIDS patients 

Misleading over simplification.  Just the retrovirus HTLV-like genome class
of "gag" type vriuses were reported.  He never specified HTLV-I.

4.  and advocated a role for this retrovirus in the pathogenesis of AIDS."

As you saw he did not "advocate." He stated possibly future research
directions.  (The popular press has invaded everywhere I guess).

>>[Papadopulos-Eleopulos, E., V.F. Turner, J.M. Papadimitriou, Has Gallo
proven the role of HIV in AIDS? Emergency Medicine 1993; 5:5-147.]

I don't think this was a peer reviewed publication.  In any event,  the
editor should have corrected the misleading statements.

Hinde sight is 20:20, so now many people are giving credit to Gallo, but I
don't.  The Pasteur Institute did far more than Gallo IMO.  Yet, they don't
even get "honerable mention" sometimes.
----------------------------------------------------------------
I liked  Dr. Duesberg skeptisism.  Duesberg had on the surface, some
interesting oints but what tiped me off was his unwillinness to look any new
data from 1990 forward and at the clinical significance of the CD4+ levels.
 He also included non-AIDS defined patients in his "proof."  This was not
science, nor speculation and seemed unfair to me.  This is when I stopped
trusting him.  It was a great disappointment for me because I was at the
University of Wisconsin when Temin was  there and (I attended) lecturing on
roux sarcoma (the first retrovirus ever discovered) and (I don't know it you
know this but)  Dr. Duesberg wrote a really nice paper on "my pet roux
sarcoma virus."   I used to respect him.  I hope I will again someday.

I am lacking something here.  How can something destroy complex life on
both sides of a planet but leave the single-celled life unkilled?  Do
these explosions last for a whole day of gentle frying, or does the
radiation flash right through the earth?  Forrest, are you saying that
single-celled life just starts right up again every time?  Not that
that seems impossible since Kauffmann, but isn't there evidence that
microbes from billions of years ago are related to us (i.e., evidence
of a continuous line of life since then)?

Hmm, funny.  Recent stray metaphysical ponder was that maybe the universe
is a big compression algorithm running on itself.  That maybe, in fact, the
difference between past and future is how far the compression has progressed.
Puts a funny spin on the phenomenon of memory.  & it means it's freeing up
space all the time.  Kinda like RAM Doubler.  Also has tie-ins to Teilhard
du Chardin, Paolo Soleri and, er, sorry, is it Tippler who screwed the
light bulb into Big Socket at the end of time?

But more directly, is there necessarily a paradox with infinity?

Btw, you're familiar with St. Anselm's "ontological proof of the
existence of God"?  The synopsis I remember (a verse from "Thus Spake
Saint Anselm") is sung to the tune of "Walzing Matilda":
	If that than which nothing greater can be conceived
	can be conceiv-ed not to exist,
	Then t'is not than which nothing greater can be conceived--
	This is irrefutable (?), I insist.
(The supposed upshot here, logically, is that it's impossible to conceive
of there not being a God.  So if you think there isn't one, you must be
wrong!)
	Thus spake St. Anselm,
	Thus spake St. Anselm,
	Thus spake St. Anselm with weighty intent.
	And we're awed as we read his proof so ontological.
	Would that we could understand what he meant.
The "greater than can be conceived" bit combined with the paradox sounds
a lot like your proof!  Find the right theologian and you might be in for
some real rhetorical adventures.  Armed with a versatile proof/disproof,
you could go on to discover the switch that makes reality appear and
disappear.  If you do can I be the first one to try it?

Is Kevlar similar to polymers such as cellulose, proteins and silk, or those
synthesized in laboratories and sold commercially, such as plastics and
synthetic fibers?  What I like about polymers is that they consist of up to
millions of repeated linked units, each a relatively light and simple molecule.

I was just reading briefly about Baekeland's synthetic shellac plastic
material is made from formaldehyde and phenol.  (Sounds like my old printing
press - toxic -)  What I find interesting is that Bakelite products were
used initially for electrical insulation.

But with polymers we are getting into the "rubber" concept, which I would
rather steer clear of.  First, it is over done, second it looks cheap, and
third its passe'. I'm more interested in what is possible and what serves a
multiple-purpose:  functionality, design and bio-tech.  Especially as
prosthetics become more and more a part of our physiology.

Please explain then our complete lack of emotive education in our
schools. I believe Greg Burch explained quite lucidly why emotive
education has failed in the past, but I believe he also made it clear
that such may very well be feasible today. 

 
> Gregory thinks that subjective reality can be studied objectively and

Yes on the former, and on the latter, it has not been tried before in
the sense that I am seeking. It has not been attempted in the rigorous,
scientific, somewhat standardized fashion, necessary for it to be found
beneficial in our current educational settings. No one that I am aware
of has developed an evolving curriculum of emotive education that would
be suitable and beneficial in our current educational settings. This
will first require the development of basic skills and exercises for
observing and measuring emotive events. Just as in purely objective
science we require standardized methods of observation and measurement,
we will require the same in order to apply the scientific method to
emotive science. We will require the same to help objectify what is
intrinsically subjective. These rudimentry skills and exercises should
be simple enough that a kindergarten student could begin developing them
so that in each consecutive grade those skills could be built upon. And
from the get go, there should be an emphasis on how these new skills can
be applied to effectively augment the students cognitive skills.


> Most of his examples are yogic
> feats of self-control or idiot-savant abberations.

Yes, very few people currently have either the discipline or the
biological anomoly to manifest these skills. Very few people. Perhaps it
is not all laziness. What I am proposing IS something new, something
that as Greg Burch clarified so well, may only now be feasible. And that
is to introduce emotive education in a non-esoteric, non-religious,
non-mystical fashion. It is to assimilate emotive education into our
current cognitive educations. This may take some time, but it is my
intention to develop an emotive curriculum for primary and secondary
educational institutions. In the same fashion we can begin preparing for
calculus at a very early age by learning arithmatic, we can prepare for
advanced levels of emotive intelligence at a young age by learning the
fundamentals of emotive education.  

I will not tout emotive education as an absolute requirement. Emotive
education will be offered specifically for the careful consideration of
private educational institutions. However, I imagine that its
overwhelming competitive benefits, may economically neccesitate its
future adoption in most if not all schools, and thus we may find it
becomes as ubiquitous to our schooling as mathmatics is today.

I have only stressed the dichotomy because as I see it now, that is how
it is most often percieved. Our society has a very strong bias towards
the 'outer world'. Our primary and secondary education is almost
entirely directed towards the study of the 'outer world'. But in the end
I am pushing for a bridging of the gap between the 'inner' and 'outer
worlds' so that we can realize and effectively employ an
emotive-cognitive continuum, a continuum of consciousness. In the end it
is not so much about separation, for that is what we have now, but it is
about reconciliation, a reconciliation between the subjective and
objective, between the emotive and cognitive. I will often push for the
extreme, in which case I take a binary stance, but this is only in the
hopes that we can reach the true goal, which is a balance that we are
very certainly lacking in education as a whole. I have often found it
easier to achieve something, if I shoot for something well beyond it.
With that said, I will be more careful in the future to speak of degrees
within continuums rather than abstracted dichotomous absolutes.


Crosby, do you see the potential benefit of assimilating emotive
education into our current cognitive educations? If so, I would be
particularly interested in what you believe should be avoided, and what
should be given special concern in creating a model or proposal for
such. It is my intention to develop and create such a proposal, and
before I release it, I want to have something rigorous, realistic, and
fairly easy to implement. I want to have something that will not be
immiediately discarded as flaky or new age ... which it is most
certainly not to be. As one of my greatest critics, I would appreciate
it if you might take a moment to temporarilly entertain the idea that
you are embracing the concept of assimilating emotive education into our
current cognitive educations. If you were the president of an
educational institution, what would it take to sell you on the idea of
implementing emotive education? What would immiediately compel you to
discard it? You have already mentioned a few things that are directly
critical of what I have been currently espousing, but can you offer
constructive criticism beyond that point? I believe this would expediate
our process while helping to avoid needless arguments. 

Actually, I am most interested in what anyone on this list would have to
say on this matter.   

I hope to offer a proposal which is congruous with Extropian,
Libertarian, and Transhumanistic thought. Thus the opionions, comments,
and suggestions of those on this list is greatly appreciated. Once a
tentative proposal is furnished, development can begin immiediately.


I believe that it is now evident that an emotive education could prove
beneficial and that such is now realistically possible. I would like to
move on to an intermittant discussion of what such should or should not,
and may or may not entail. What should be avoided and what should be
emphasized.

Is anyone interested in a think tank?   

Cheers,

I must say, I am so busy working that this discourse has continued on
without me. Let me point out, Johnny disagreed with silicon, and for good
reason. 
We are not far beyond that. What we are doing now is taking a look at other
possibilities.  The posters will be figurative and photographic because this
is an area I am experienced in.  The posters will also be based on as much
scientific and technological fact as possible because this is how I produce
my work. I wouldn't have it any other way.

I don't think that's the way to go, it's only a paradox if things are finite. 
If the universe is infinite then God's mind could, as required, have an  
infinite number of parts, so He could know exactly what was going to happen  
in the Universe and He could also know exactly what He Himself was going to  
do now and a billion years from now. In other words, although we have free 
will God would not.

Suppose God was made up of an infinite number of the old Z80 computer chips  
and, of course, a operating system so they could work together. You could 
assign 10 chips to analyze and predict what one chip could do, if that didn't 
do the job make it a thousand chips or a million, if that still wasn't enough 
assign an infinite number of chips, remember the definition of an infinite
set is that you can make a one to one correspondence with a proper subset of 
it. Strange things happen in the arithmetic of infinities, each chip without 
exception could have an infinite number of chips packing an infinite amount 
of computing power making predictions about what that one finite chip would 
do, and you would still have an infinite number of chips to do other things, 
like figuring out what would happen next in the universe.

I think a better strategy is to ask the theists if God is omnipotent, if they  
say yes ask them if he can make a rock so heavy he can't lift it. Then ask 
them if good and evil are independent of God. If they say yes then God has 
nothing to with morality, except He is supposed to act that way, just like
everybody else. If they say no then the statement "God is good" is a vacuous 
tautology.

In 1998 it will be the one hundred year anniversary of the discovery of the
electron which if not for it 'electron'ics and the internet would've never
existed including this very text you're reading. This breakthrough empowers
us to glide past the industrial era and rocket into the information age. We
MUST NOT miss the opportunity to celebrate the very basic particle which
has enriched our lives and enhanced the quality of life. If allow this
opportunity to pass by, generations from now our children's children will
look down on us as being an insignificant, dim-witted society. The electron
represents humanity's struggle to crawl out of it's evolutionary hole.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

A few months ago, I came up with this idea for a new technique I like to
call "Site Cloaking". It's possible to create a Perl CGI script that would
grab a file or webpage from another site & display it for the user without
telling the user the original location like a proxy. This way you could put
a CGI script on your website with links to country-specific censored texts
or webpages and not tell anyone the site locations so that they can't shut
them down. A person could put up a so-called subversive webpage in that
specific country and tell this proxy the address and thus protect the site
without giving out it's real address forcing the ISPs in that country to
scan ALL WEBPAGES on their servers making the process more difficult. You
could put up any so-called subversive and censored information on your
webpage and people could access them without getting shutdown because only
the CGI script would know where the source site is and you could even
cipher the script's site list so even the owner of the proxy website can't
locate the sites. You could then have a website or even a web search tool
where you'd load all these sites into and acquire even more sites because
you'd be offering protection and the sites would stay up indefinately. If
the FEDS get pissed, simply wipe the file and the list is gone but the
sites remain. 

A person I talked to over IRC claimed that a CGI Perl script such as this
isn't all that difficult to do but I myself have zero experience in
programming Perl. Perhaps someone on this list who can program in Perl can
try it?

some of these topics arise again for further debate. I will be merging the
information relating to these topics gathered in the past to my website
which is currently heavily under construction and will be dedicated (in
Wired magazine style) to the ultra high technologies of the future. I will
repost any of these previous posts for newer list members who weren't
around for the first round of debate. Not all of these are posts though,
some are just concepts occasionally meantioned within a thread or two and I
may not find them again. Please browse the topics and see if anything here

IAN: Make that all three. The FBI just hit Richard Russell (retired
crash investigator and American Airlines pilot) taking the radar tape 
with them. They came in with a federal subpoena for the radar tape. 
Apparently FBI chief "investigator" Kallstrom may hold a press 
conference today to denounce the tapes as bogus.

This is done to head off upcoming and already published news about
the radar tapes. Here are two of the publications already out:

  Report says missile may have shot down jetliner
  March 10, 1997
  10.30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT)

  RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Newly disclosed evidence "points to a 
  missile''as the cause of the explosion that killed all 230 people 
  aboard TWA Flight 800 off New York's Long Island, The Press-Enterprise
  reported today. 

  The evidence includes reddish residue found on several seat backs 
  that laboratory analysis showed to be "consistent with solid missile 
  fuel'' ingredients, the newspaper said. 

  It said information from FBI and National Transportation Safety 
  Board documents and investigative sources indicates the plane may 
  have been a victim of a terrorist missile or "friendly fire'' -- 
  a Navy weapon gone astray.

I'd say that Kevlar has the most in common with artificial fibres like Nylon
and Orlon. I've actually made Nylon in the lab, and I wouldn't call it
anything like rubber. In fact, polymers are everywhere. Everything from hair
to vegetables are polymeric, and there are many inorganic polymers. Nylon
made in the lab (and that's the only way to make it) starts out as a goo
that must be pulled like toffee and dried as a monofilament. Ostensibly the
individual molecules could be linked at a nanoscale level by an assembler of
some sort. Polymer just means a string of identical (or a pattern)
molecules. The only connotations with rubber come from polymers not being
used for much else in consumer technology.

Dan,

I've tried this argument before.  What I ususally get back is a
redefinition of "absolute onminiscience" along the following lines:

"Hey, to be absolutely omniscient you only need to know every principle
that relates to a particle or system.  You do not need to know every
characteristic about every particle and system in existence at one point
in time.  Besides, since god is also omnipotent, he has an infinitum of
time periods at his behest. he can store the knowledge eons from now"

Dan, theists are predictable in that they always default to semantical
legerdemain.  You'll soon get sick at their changing the meaning of key
words as you try to nail down their inconsistencies.

There are usually three ways they finish any argument:

	1) Antics with semantics as mentioned above.
	2) "Hey, you gotta believe in something!" ...as long as it's an
	    animated supreme being.
	3) "Reason is rooted in faith."  This is actually part of "finish #1"
	    mentioned above but it deserves special notice since it's usally 
	    the ending argument that most scholastic theists use. See 	    	  
"Pan-critical Reason" at the Extropian FAQ.

I've got to admit that I miss arguing with theists about gods existence.
I spend most of my time these days arguing politics and possible
extropian futures.  Most of the people with whom I argue are "well
educated" but seem to not know the basics of neither economics nor the
history of western civilization. At least most theists know religion!

I've had the same thought, and called it social inertia.  It's why I
think the Singularity will not happen.  Something interesting will
happen, certainly.  But it will not involve more than a small fraction
of the population, because most people don't *like* change.

So, a few people will transform themselves, then a few more, then a
lot more - but it will be gradual: not a Singularity.

  I now work professionally on ACF (Automated Collaborative Filtering)
technology at Firefly, and I hope to have chance to apply it to a mailing
list sometime soon (this year?).  Technologically, it is not very different
from
collaboratively filtering Reuters newsfeed that Firefly is going to do in near
future.

  As for the sociological implications,  I am writing an essay on the subject
(see URL below), and would be happy if you could read and comment on it.

No, although the retort "So you mean God exists outside of the set of
things that exist?" at least is fun to say.

Yes, this is a very common argument. I like to explain to tell them about 
the regular hexagonal pattern of Rayleigh-Bernard convection, and how it 
appears as patterns of stones on the tundra, the shells of some species 
of snails and in many other places in physics. It is complex and ordered, 
who created it? Generally, theists often do not realize how prevalent 
self-organization is in the universe; even if you ascribe it to the will 
of God it is obvious that the will must act on the mathematical level 
(since otherwise formal alife simulations would be provably interfered 
with by God) and not on the physical level. Unfortunately most theists 
just assimilate this argument, by conveniantly ignoring its implications.

Well, it is (almost) unprovable whether person A can not be swayed. One
might consider something like the "purgatorium" idea in Tipler's _Physics
of Immortality_, where an omega-being tries to convince an evil person
without directly changing his brain. This is a finite game, since after a
certain, very long, time the person due to his finite brain will start to
repeat himself, so the number of "game positions" (mental states) is
finite. Tipler asks the question if there are winning strategies in this
game, and one might ask the same for the "swaying game". But it is rather
theoretical, in practice most people can be influenced given enough work
but some are very stubborn.

A lurker wrote to me --
	I'm afraid I'm new on this list and not aware of the history of

	diametrically oposed to socialism? That is the message I'm getting
	out of your recent posts and I'd like to understand better what it
	is you're trying to say and the theory supporting it.

The question seems to me important enough to reply in public.

Socialism is the principle that the means of production ought to be
owned and controlled by the People as a whole - which in practice means
the politicians control everything.  Libertarianism holds that the people
are better off if ownership of the means of production is widely
distributed among individuals (or voluntary groups) under the discipline
of a free market.

Socialists hold that free markets lead to monopolies.  Libertarians
say that's clearly not true, but even if it were, it's no reason
to create One Big Monopoly.

Socialists tend to treat the People as a single mass - it's not a defining
feature of socialism, but they tend to talk that way.  Libertarians (at
least the philosophical ones, not necessary the pragmatic-economic kind)
insist on methodological individualism - we don't *deny* that there is
or can be a collective Will of the People, but we say that *if* it exists
it will manifest itself through the voluntary actions of individuals --
and that any use of force to impose the Will of the People is evidence
that it is bogus.

In one sense, libertarianism is *not* opposed to socialism at all, though
socialism *is* opposed to libertarianism.  (What?!)  A libertarian world
tolerates voluntary socialist enclaves (say, the utopian colonies of
the American Midwest in the XIX century) because there's no ethical rule
against them.  A socialist world does not tolerate libertarian enclaves:
if you tell the taxman that transactions within your Capitalist Club are
not subject to his rules, he'll laugh at you.

I hope I've answered the question.

                    THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL MEDIA

                         VERSUS THE INTERNET

                 60 Minutes Anti-conspiracy Slop Job


      by Ian Williams Goddard 

      The major media have launched a disinformation war designed
      to smear the Internet.  The Internet represents a heretofore 
      unparalleled level of informational competition for the major 
      media.  A primary pretext for these Internet attacks focuses 
      on the "conspiracy theories," or alternative news and views, 
      that the Net allows the public to freely access and express.

      Most recently the CBS program 60 Minutes (02/1/97), using 
      false and misleading claims,  attacked conspiracy theories 
      and alternative information on the Internet such as my work.  

      60 Minutes anchor Lesley Stahl, while arguing for the removal 
      of undesirable information such as mine from the Internet,  
      promoted the hysteria-inducing fear that freedom of access  
      to conspiracy theory is a threat to the minds of the children. 

      After showing my TWA 800 web page with my name prominently 
      displayed, Lesley Stahl pointed a finger at the lead graphic 
      I created (http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm) saying:

                STAHL: Shouldn't this be expunged ? 

                GUEST: On what grounds?

                STAHL: That it's wrong, that it's 
                inaccurate, it's irresponsible, that 
                it is spreading fear and suspicion 
                of the government; 10,000 reasons.

                GUEST: Ooh, sedition I see. So it's 
                anti-government, so it spreads fear.
                But who should regulate it? ... 

                STAHL: So you think it's better 
                to leave all this junk out there? 

      Now let's see how accurate the claims of 60 Minutes are.
      My graphic, or "junk," which 60 Minutes calls "wrong" and 
      "inaccurate," contains one sentence making three claims:

                (1) The "streak of light"
                    reported to "hit the plane" 

                (2) "followed the course like 
                    the outline of a parabola" 

                (3) not unlike a guided missile.

      (1) The New York Times (07/19/96) said that eyewitnesses
      reported a "'streak of light' hitting the plane just before 
      it blew up."  An eyewitness I've interviewed, Roland Penney, 
      told Newsday (09/01/96) that "the thin white line" that raced 
      upwards toward TWA 800 "hit that plane." This is just a small
      sample (more here: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm) 
      of the massive body of available missile-witness accounts that 
      60 Minutes wants you to believe are "wrong" and "irresponsible."

      (2) As quoted on my web page, The New York Times (07/19/96), 
      citing the evidence that "the airplane was hit by a missile 
      fired from a boat," reported the following: 

              Paul Angelides, who lives in West Hampton
              Beach... saw what he described as a "red 
              meteor with a smoke tail" that followed 
              the course like the outline of "a parabola." 

      (3) A streak of light that shoots across the sky leaving the 
      smoky and curving trail cited in claim 2, is by definition 
      "not unlike a guided missile." The two primary possibilities 
      are that this streak is  (a) a meteorite or  (b) a missile. 
      The radical degree of curvature sighted in my graphic, which 
      is consistent with most accounts, eliminates (a) leaving (b); 
      and therefore it is indeed most like a guided missile. 

      That's the kind of logical analysis CBS wants to have 
      "expunged" from the human record because it spreads fear 
      about the government, and specifically about the U.S. Navy, 
      which the owner of CBS, Westinghouse, works for [1].

      So, each and every claim I make that 60 Minutes would like 
      you to believe is "wrong," "inaccurate," and "irresponsible," 
      is IN FACT logical, true, and accurate according to over 150
      eyewitness accounts cited in major media sources. Therefore, 
      the claims of 60 Minutes are, to the contrary, the only 
      claims proven to be false and inaccurate. 


      WHAT 60 MINUTES IS NOT TELLING YOU

      While Lesley Stahl may have laughed at web pages claiming 
      that the major media are not telling all about TWA 800, the 
      fact is that the major media routinely suppress verifiable 
      information that should spread fear of the government. 

      For example, CBS has the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) 
      video from Waco, TX (4/19/93) that shows the FBI shooting 
      machine-guns into Mount Carmel, the Branch Davidian's home, 
      most heavily as the fire started and people tried to escape. 

      Not only has a top FLIR expert evaluated the video [2], 
      concluding that it shows gunshots toward the building, 
      but according to Gordon Novel (head of investigation in 
      the Ramsey Clark Waco lawsuit, who acquired the FLIR video
      from the quickly dead former head of CIA, Bill Colby) CBS
      even had the video examined by the independent laboratory  
      Infraspection Institute of Berlington, VT,  which also 
      concluded that the video shows machine-gun fire toward 
      the building. 60 Minutes did its homework and was ready 
      to run the FLIR video with the findings.

      However, Novel reports [3] that all it took was an angry 
      call from the Justice Department for CBS and 60 Minutes to 
      cave-in and opt instead to suppress the truth by not runn-
      ing the FLIR program.  Because it seems CBS does not want 
      to spread any fear or suspicions about the government, CBS 
      viewers can be sure never to see the shocking FLIR video. 

      Contrary to Ms. Stahl's laughter at the claim, the major 
      media,  even her own program,  are willfully suppressing 
      powerful evidence against the US government and in so do-
      ing are willing to sacrifice the interests of the American 
      people for the security of those in power with the blood 
      of men, women, and children all over their hands.  Then, 
      after covering up mass murder in Waco, 60 Minutes moves 
      on to smear and suppresses evidence suggesting that the  
      US government killed all 230 people aboard TWA 800. The 
      pattern is clear: serve the State, screw the people.


      MAJOR MEDIA vs THE INTERNET

      While the major media work to smear the Internet as an 
      unreliable source of lies and rumor, the facts are that 
      the Internet has proven to be more reliable in terms of 
      getting the truth out more quickly than the major media.  

      A case in point is the recent coverage the ABC program 
      20/20 (01/17/97) gave to the compelling evidence of fore-
      knowledge by the federal government of the Oklahoma City 
      bombing [4]. While 20/20 called this report "an exclusive 
      investigation," the fact is that every detail they "scooped" 
      could have been found on the Internet a year beforehand.  
      Indeed, ABC took the credit for the leg-work of many grass-
      roots investigators, whom the major media had been smearing 
      previously as the "paranoid nuts" that lurk about in the 
      dark and fearful world of the Internet.

      The chaotic dynamics of Internet-information processing 
      is light-years ahead of the major media, which can only
      hope to keep pace with the rapidly evolving information
      structures that form the electronic world of cyberspace.


      DYNAMICS OF INFORMATIONAL FREEDOM 

      As on-line researcher Thomas Shoemaker [5] observes [6], 
      the process-focused nature of the Internet's informational 
      structure renders the Net too dynamic and fast-paced for 
      the outdated product-oriented media behemoths, which the 
      Internet threatens to cut down to size:

              The media of which Lesley Stahl belongs 
              to is failing. They achieved dominance 
              years ago, when there was less competition 
              from other information systems: their main 
              worry was about what other members of their 
              monopoly were doing. Now they are in decline 
              and denial. They have and continue to view 
              the "news" as a "product" which is massaged, 
              molded, dressed up, packaged, promoted, and 
              then delivered to the consumer as a finished 
              commodity.

              The internet is perceived as a threat by 
              Lesley, her co-workers and their bosses, 
              because it is not product-focused,  but 
              process-focused. They cannot successfully 
              cope with the creative, turbulent decentral-
              ization of the internet...it is just too 
              free for them. Their idea of news is an 
              address to the peasants (us) from the 
              royal family (the media, of course).

      The process nature of Internet informational-structure allows 
      a story to unfold spontaneously in such a way that the whole 
      decentralized society is free to become active participants 
      in a public investigation and analysis of available facts, 
      free to make the input that Lesley Stahl wants "expunged" 
      from the human record.  

      But even as their Internet smear campaign, frequently focusing 
      on TWA 800, may signal a fear in CBS of the chaotic and spon-
      taneous nature of informational freedom, CBS may smear those 
      proposing that TWA 800 was hit with a U.S. Navy missile simply
      because CBS is owned by the large military-industrial-complex 
      contractor, Westinghouse, which works for the U.S. Navy [1].


      ON THE INTERNET, GOOD INFORMATION DRIVES OUT BAD

      The fear that bad information threatens the good on the 
      Internet fails to observe that over time and with the input 
      of thousands of minds, we have a greater ability than ever 
      to see all sides of the story. The instant input of so many 
      people who know parts or all of a give topic allows the 
      Internet as a whole to more quickly drive out bad informa-
      tion than the major media where few are permitted input. 

      When I write an essay and post it to the Internet, instantly 
      people with other ideas or expertise in an area I cover can 
      critique it for all to evaluate.  While many replies offer
      only empty insults expressing rage rather than constructive 
      analysis, on the whole, this system of automatic feedback 
      and input accelerates the process of "social learning."

      The major media of all varieties make their case in forums 
      that are insulated from the instantaneous and equally visible 
      input and critique of others.  It's exactly as Tom Shoemaker 
      observed previously, that the major media wants to address 
      the public like the royal family addresses its sea of 
      peasants, where rebuttal is discouraged and denied. 

      To a larger degree than at any time in human history, the 
      Internet puts us all on the same level; the Internet is a 
      great equalizer.  Let us honor this gift to humanity, not 
      disparage it as those who still live in the old ways seek 
      to disparage the new and empowering media that is the Internet.

Memetic immunity of the majority but a few novelty-seekers has in the 
past sure contributed to a society's fitness. Even in this century, large 
human metanimals have screwed themselves profoundly, resulting in Mdeaths.
Conservativism comes from an attempt to shelter things in face of a savagely
storming change. A wise course, at times. But.

Local victims, of both colours there are, but on the large scale, progress 
can be considered satisfactory.

Yes. 
We will see gods walking among mere men, soon.
And the surest way not to be trod upon seems to be becoming one.

PhD PROJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL, UK

Investigating Structure and Properties of Protein/Biomaterials Interfaces
with Multi-Mode Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM)

Interfaces between proteins and biomaterials will be investigated with
scanning probe microscopy (SPM).  A better understanding of these
interfaces is important for both the development of passive and active
biomaterials which promote the restoration and repair of body tissue and
for the improvement in the materials used in drug delivery devices. The
multi-mode scanning probe microscope (SPM) is a relatively new tool which
allows the study of the interfacial structure and the mechanical and
chemical properties of the interfaces with sub-nanometre (< 10-9 m)
resolution. The expected results of the study will lead to models which
relate the interfacial composition, structure and the process parameters to
the performance of the interfaces and, hence, enabling improvements in
these interfaces through purposeful surface engineering to be achieved.
This is a joint interdisciplinary project between the biomaterials group of
the department of oral and dental science and the scanning probe microscopy
group/bio-polymer group of the physics department.

I thought someone later demonstrated that the blood sample might have been
contaminated by HIV in the lab? Or am I thinking of another old case?

P.S. Being pedantic, he wasn't diagnosed in 1959, a blood sample from 1959
was found to contain HIV.

The current list archive on the Web is about 400k of subject lines and
authors, which makes it rather slow and unmanageable. Could this be
modified somehow to split the archive into monthly or weekly segments? I'm
only downloading mail about once a week at the moment, but can read the
Web version at work. With a file of that size I have to wait several
seconds for Netscape to redraw the main page after I've read a message.

You can access the archives using
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/date00.html
to get a view of *this year's* messages where each line is a URL 
pointing to the titles for a block of 100 messages.

Until a week or two ago, this provided access to all messages since 
the List became open last July.  Now, it only provides access to 
messages for this year.  I wonder if last year's messages are still 
available in this manner somewhere?

What source did you get this from?  It's an impressive piece of research if
true.
BTW, even then it's not enough: it of course has to show obesity during 
primary childbearing years.

I won't quibble over words this time.  I agree that the effects of DNA are
not limited to protein synthesis, nor even to subsequent behaviors.  And,
yes, *if* there are 100 causally linked events, then even the last is 
selected genetically.
But the basic question still remains: can those links survive the
turbulence of society?  I still suspect not.

We seem to be agreeing a lot more than disagreeing.  I think we have 
succeeded in narrowing the issue down to a small grey area that requires 
tremendous research to clarify much further.  Shall we allow this thread
to retire gracefully?

If this was the case then, as you said, God would have no free will.  The
universe in general has no free will either.  Therefore, God and the
universe would be synomous.  Besides, if I could convince a theist that God
had no free will, that would probably be close enough to make the jump to
non existence.  

Of course, if the universe is infinite than it would be possible to have
multiple omnipotent and omniscent beings.  Then they could fight it out.

I'm not exactly sure where the connection between these two things are.  I
have tried the rock one and mostly I just get people to roll there eyes. 
They have encountered that one enough so that it loses meaning.

If it just happened, then it sounds like someone got your disclosure on

There are researchers experimenting with implanting chips inside the
retina that run on photovoltaic power, and can create images of 10x10
pixels. WHile this may seem like not that much, it is better than
nothing for a blind person, and they promise greater advances in
resolution in the future....

The following is from a message I got recently regarding an apparent
feature of Microsoft Internet Explorer that keeps a record of all of
your email, even when you've deleted it and emptied the trash folder.
This is very interesting from a privacy standpoint, because if this is
true, this means that anyone who can hack into your system can also read
your "trash" like any PI going through your dumpster.

I'd appreciate any feedback.....

Channeling is *kool*--for other people that is.  It reminds me of Daniel
Dennett's wondering about the sudden sprouting of "Multiple Personality
Disorder" cases.  You give people a new model for how to run their brains
and they flock to it.  Also reminds me of Hakim Bey's talking about
dirvishes and the need to get into not-normal modes to escape the spectacle,
essentially.  Also reminds me of *A Course in Miracles,* a Bible-sized
channeled book I haven't got past page 65 of.  Here:
   A major source of the ego's off-balanced state is its lack of
   discrimination between the body and the Thoughts of God.  Thoughts
   of God are unacceptable to the ego, because they clearly point to the
   nonexistence of the ego itself...

But!  *A Course in Miracles* led to Gerald Jampolsky's "Love is Letting Go
of Fear," which was an important book to me.

The future's really big, hard to get your brain around.  You see someone
on TV seeming very Positive and Forward Looking and you might jump to the
wrong conclusion.  The scary thought comes to you: it could happen.
We could *succeed*--at steering head-first into the integrated-circuit
grids of our Positive Forward Looking Wired consumer culture navels, pull
the navels in after us, and leave any notion of a natural, outside world
behind.  And you realize, my programming tells me how to go along with
such a fate, not counter it.

It just might make you want to set the controls for Canis Major.

This is scary.  I just checked it out on my system.  It is no longer a
mystery why Microsoft has not been hit with antitrust lawsuits.  I have
always been skeptical of conspiracy claims, but now I am ready to believe. 
Of course, this poses little security risk to me and might be a convienent
way to spy on the leeches who use my computer.  Now, if only I could get
them to do something interesting....

Gee, I can see why the government might want to spy on people.  The idea is
fun even when there is nothing to spy on.

Effectively, there's nothing really shocking about filed not really being
"deleted". The files are still there, and will remain there until
overwritten, Microsoft or no Microsoft. Data recovery techniques can recover
data that has been written over or reformatted 8 or 9 times. If you think
that this one little bug (let's call it a feature) is all that stands
between you and secure computing, I have a lovely bridge to sell you. If you
want total safety, use a laptop, and use removable drives with it, and keep
those drives somewhere safe, like on your person at all times. Fortunatly,
encryption pretty much makes this a non necessity. In any case, chances are
you don't have any truly secret data anyways. I know my data aren't terribly
secret, and if someone reads my email, they'll probably be too bored to do
anything, unless they're nuts.

By way of addendum to my earlier biography of Hypatia:

An article in today's paper indicates that, according to letters 
written by students of Hypatia, she invented several scientific 
instruments, including an astrolabe, a water distiller, and a 
hydrometer.

Also, according to three recent books on women inventors, it seems 
that the Countess of Lovelace (1812-1852) is more authoritatively being 
credited with inventing the first binary computer programming language.
Because she wrote it for a computer invented by her husband Charles 
Babbage, and because of the laws of that time, all of her work would 
have been owned by her husband, and this led to some confusion as to 
the extent of her role.  

The National Women's History Project has set up a web site with links 
to info about female technologists at http://www.whp.org

Tony, then you REALLY MUST see Future Fantastic! They show experiments
where they allowed a guy to see lines and colors by putting a chip on the
optic nerve. I'm very sure you will get your vision back. The optic nerve
doesn't atrophy with that disease correct? I sure hope not.

The problem with Retinal Degenerative Diseases like Retinitis Pigmentosa
and Age Related Macular Degeneration (of which most people will develop
unless aging is slowed)  is that the retinal cells die. How will these
chips work with inactive cells?

The optic nerve remains intact but there are claims it is too difficult
to attach to. This amazes me since my sisters cochlear implant and newest
speach processor have returned almost all her hearing. How is the optic
nerve so much different from the auditory nerve that we can successful
interface with the auditory nerve but not with the optic nerve?

There is a Cuban doctor that claims he has developed a way to bring these
cells back to life using a combination of ozone therapy and electric
shock. Despite claims from his patients  that ithe procedure returned
some of their vision, the international medical community have not
verified the results, nor been able to monitor the Cuban implementation.

Other research on retina's I'm aware of include: 

Nutrition: a 7 year study concluded in '92-93' by the RP Foundation,
Fighting Blindness determined 15,000 IUs of vitamin A palmitate could
reduce retinal degeneration in RP patients by as much as 7 years while
400 IU supplements of vitamin E seemed to accelerate retinal
deteriouration. Bilberry extract has also been used to enhance night
vision. 

Cell transplant: experiments have been done in rabbits that demonstrate
that transplanting healthy epithelial cells into a diseased retina may
halt further deterioration (rescue) but not rejuvenate dead cells
(recovery)

What I've read so farindicates that  whole retinal transplants are
impractical due to the delicate, thin nature of the retina, and that
whole eye transplants are impractical due to inability of connecting to
the optic nerve.

Corning makes an amber colored photo-sensitive glasses lens that is used
to enhance depth perception and reduce glare. I wonder if this kind of
thing could lead to some sort of cornea cover for  normal sighted people
or, fearing decline in sale of sun glasses, would the Optics industry
thwart it.

 If we can incorporate CCTV  magnification technology, OCR (Optical
Charachter Recognition), and light filtering mechanisms,  with
biological/artificial eyes,  subcutaneous computer chips, and the optic
nerve, we'd be in a good position to cure many forms of blindness. We'd
also greatly enhance human ability to use our sense of sight in far
greater ways.

 Can you imagine not needing pigeons in U.S. Coast Guard Search & Rescue
helicoptors to search for shipreck victims because the human eye is even
more acute? Can you imagine periodically going into the shop to recieve
new eyes as our old ones deteriorate? Far range vision, macro-micro, UV,
IR, thermal imaging, photo sensitive shading, downloading everything you
saw that day to computer backup, - endless possibilities.  The ultimate
would be interfacing computer  output directly into your optic nerve
without needing a monitor to give new meanings to the terms  VR and
portability .

peace, love, and understanding

Artificial organs, chemical sensors, intelligent materials and molecular 
electronic devices are just a few of the promising applications for 
supramolecular science, a bold new discipline where researchers explore 
"chemistry beyond the molecule."

Full (but very brief) article in the Nikkei Weekly for March 10, 1997 
describes this area of research of interest to extropians and 
transhumanists.

After a carefully crafted and rational argument by Greg Burch to 
Gregory Houston about the need for a "new synthesis" between 
inward-looking visionaries and outward-looking scientists, I ranted 
about Gregory Houston's implied solipsism and false sense of 
separation between subjective and objective sciences.

After Gregory Houston's response, I wrote to him privately and said
<I realize it was unfair to accuse you of solipsism when it really 
appears that you're primarily interested in emotive education. (To 
tell the truth, I was probably using your post more as an opportunity 
to rant against Claude de Contrecoeur's anti-materialist philosophy 
than anything that you specifically proposed.)>

I also admited to being ignorant as to what "an evolving curriculum of 
emotive education" might involve.

I did an AltaVista search on "emotive education" and was surprised at 
the two URLs (other than book ads) that popped to the top.  Both 
seemed to be surprisingly extropian references and might just be 
useful for a new sort of basic academic curriculum.

The first URL was http://www.iret.org/essays/teorebta.html
a brief essay called "The Essence of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy 
(REBT)" by Albert Ellis, Ph.D., which contained a concise listing of 
"12 Irrational Ideas That Cause and Sustain Neurosis" and 
corresponding rational ideas to counteract them that could, IMO, be 
used as a basis for Extropian psychological principles.

The second URL pointed to the Web site of Peter Small and his 
interesting take on the philosophy of object-oriented programming and 
the design of software brains along with some unpublished chapters on 
"emotive decision making" from his book LINGO SORCERY.  See the 
following URL for a site map:
http://codwar.netmare.co.uk/Silicon_Grove/petersmall/siteMap.html#ancho  
r1796955

Particularly interesting in the context of this thread was Peter 
Small's CD-ROM called "How God Makes God" (see 
http://codwar.netmare.co.uk/Silicon_Grove/petersmall/HomePge.html) 
from which I quote:
<"How God Makes God" is a thought provoking CD-ROM which provides an 
unique explanation of human life in terms of probability, game theory 
and computer concepts.  [Snip] The conclusion of "How God Makes God" 
is that the human race is now on the verge of creating machines with 
virtual brains which might one day provide mankind with a route to 
unlimited expansion and evolution in the universe.>

My take on Ellis's REBT principles is that we should basically view 
ourselves as intelligent, responsible, self-owned agents who, 
nevertheless, have to fit into a ecological / economic environment 
over which we shall never have full control.  Though I have not 
checked it out, it seems to me that Peter Small's "How God Makes God" 
CD-ROM, describing the systematic principles underlying the 
spontaneous order we have to survive in, along with Ellis's REBT 
principles for self-ownership, might indeed be a good foundation for a 
basic rational-emotive education curriculum.

Interesting.  I'd be curious to know what the size of the debt is now, 
and whether you think this is the only thing stalling further progress on 
this project.  Perhaps now that you and the other co-founders have had 
time to step back from the day-to-day problems you should consider a 
reunion to take a fresh look at the project.  With the continued growth 
of the web and of "all things internet" in the past two years, it might 
be easier to generate interest.

Could you elaborate on this?  Are you approaching this from a "freedom 
to", rather than a "freedom from" standpoint?  From the Terra Libra-esque 
position that freedom begins with the individual, and that once one 
decides to be free that they are?  This personal liberty versus political 
liberty dichotomy is one that I've struggled to resolve.

Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) appears to be a good point of
departure. With minimal adaption, it may prove to be an effective means
of avoiding and reducing irrational thought and neurosis, thus
facillitating improved cognitive abilities.   

What REBT appears to lack from an initial an cursory exploration of it:

1. REBT lacks methods for individuals to determine personl patterns of
irrational thought that may not be included in the "12 Irrational Ideas
That Cause and Sustain Neurosis". 

2. REBT lacks thoughts on, and ideas for, effectively applying emotions.
There seems to be two important aspects of emotive education, (1)
reducing the control our emotions have over us, and (2) increasing our
control over our emotions, increasing our ability to effectively employ
our emotive intelligence. REBT may prove useful for the former, but
another system(s) will be required for the latter. 

3. "REBT is based on the assumption that what we label our "emotional"
reactions are largely caused by our conscious and unconscious
evaluations, interpretations, and philosophies." However, REBT is sort
of like a shotgun blast into the dark, hoping that we blow away the
shackles which are pulling our rationality into the depths of
irrationality. In other words, REBT lacks methods of exploring the
subconscious. REBT does not appear to require such to be effective, but
such may augment REBT while certainly facillitating other concerns of
emotive education.

The following is a list without descriptions of the "12 Irrational Ideas
That Cause and Sustain Neurosis":

1. The idea that it is a dire necessity for adults to be loved by
significant others for almost everything they do.

2. The idea that certain acts are awful or wicked, and that people who
perform such acts should be severely damned.

3. The idea that it is horrible when things are not the way we like them
to be.

4. The idea that human misery is invariably externally caused and is
forced on us by outside people and events.

5. The idea that if something is or may be dangerous or fearsome we
should be terribly upset and endlessly obsess about it.

6. The idea that it is easier to avoid than to face life difficulties
and self-responsibilities.

7. The idea that we absolutely need something other or stronger or
greater than ourself on which to rely. 

8. The idea that we should be thoroughly competent, intelligent, and
achieving in all possible respects.

9. The idea that because something once strongly affected our life, it
should indefinitely affect it.

10. The idea that we must have certain and perfect control over things.

11. The idea that human happiness can be achieved by inertia and
inaction.

12. The idea that we have virtually no control over our emotions and
that we cannot help feeling disturbed about things.


And here are the three main differences from REBT has from other
schools, also without descriptions:

1. De-emphasis of early childhood.

2. Emphasis on deep philosophical change and scientific thinking. 

3. Use of psychological homework. 

For full descriptions see:
http://www.iret.org/essays/teorebta.html


Though "Peter Small's 'How God Makes God' CD-ROM, describing the
systematic principles underlying the spontaneous order we have to
survive in" is not a system within itself. I agree that issues of this
nature will be important to implement in Emotive Education.

I wasn't particularly thrilled with the project on Emotive Decision
Making. Though in concept it was striving for something beyond
traditional attempts at AI, in execution it all boiled down to the same
thing. I believe what is missing in this area, and what may be missing
for some time to come, is computers that can truly experience feelings,
pleasure and pain. Is anyone aware of research into the development of
such peripheals? I know we now have touch sensitive robotics, but has
anyone taken that a step further, attempting to create an actual
experiential discomfort or pleasure in the robot? I don't think we
really understand this well enough yet to mimic it.


For those interested, I have now devoted the Triberian Institute and its
newly refurbished website to Emotive Education. I would greatly
appreciate constructive criticism on any area within it that you may
find yourselves particularly attracted to. Nothing is final, everything
is open to refined and ceaseless evolution.

I found something on the web that might be of interest, but your
question of how these chips will work with atrophied retinas is a great
question.  I think Chris has it when he says the optical nerve is a good
idea.  This device I read about on the net displays images on the retina
directly.  Eventually, they want to reduce it to the size of
sunglasses.  They have an article on people w/low vision, and how this
VRD(Virtual Retinal Display) can help them.  It seems the lab is working
with VR from looking at their projects.  Here's the URL:

http://www.hitl.washington.edu/projects/vrd/

Go ahead and check out their other projects.

Ahh, but it was once too difficult to get off the surface of
earth(although, it still is too expensive, but hopefully, with the new X
series of vehicles, it will provide a cheaper means of escape).  There
were claims the earth was flat.  There are all kinds of claims that have
been proven wrong.  I believe that we can do it.  It may take a while,
but it's not impossible.

Hey, imagine if we started working on similar technologies for the ear
implants.  The ability to hear distances greater than we can normally
hear now.  The ability to hear a whisper without straining.  The ability
to adjust our level of hearing based on who's speaking(I have this
problem at work with a soft spoken co-worker), the ability to filter
backgroun noise.  The ability to "turn off sound", so as not to damage
our ears(kind of like ear plugs).  All kinds of possibilities.

This is similar to the VRD that I mentioned above, except instead of the
Optic Nerve, it works with the retina.  I'm sorry it probably won't be
able to help you, but it's a start on something.  Don't forget to check
out the page.

There has been much press in teh NYC area about Adam Cohen who
recetnly won the Westinghouse Sciense Talnet Search. He was credited
in the local paper w/ making a printer that lets you print words in
small places (50 words into the size of a human hair).

According to the CNN sci-tech www site, Adam has made a STM, that
would be useful in creating semiconductor based IC's.

I'm wondering if he has created a STM that can "chip lithography" or 
if he has just make a plain old handmade STM.

In any case it would seem that the popular press has very little
knowlege in how to report this sort of thing.

There is nothing particularly surprising to a computer scientist that
"deleted" data is not really gone; in fact, that's SOP for almost any
data storage system, including the OS itself, all databases I know of,
and probably many other email programs.

The suggestions given are about as useless against a real enemy (such
as the FBI) as a $5 padlock or a fifth amendment.   There are commercial
programs you can buy, like Norton's "wipefile", that claim to do a more
complete job of erasing data from a disk by physically overwriting it
many times with different values, but even these can be overcome by a
sophisticated snoop.  The only secure way to erase a hard disk is with
something like thermite.

The following book, recently published, may be of interest to subscribers of

"Evolution of Parallel Cellular Machines: The Cellular Programming Approach",
Moshe Sipper, Springer-Verlag, 1997.

Information is available at:

Back-cover text:

Nature abounds in systems involving the actions of simple,
locally-interacting components, that give rise to coordinated global
behavior.  These collective systems have evolved by means of natural
selection to exhibit striking problem-solving capacities, while
functioning within a complex, dynamic environment.  Employing simple
yet versatile parallel cellular models, coupled with evolutionary
computation techniques, this volume explores the issue of constructing
man-made systems that exhibit characteristics such as those manifest
by their natural counterparts.

Parallel cellular machines hold potential both scientifically, as
vehicles for studying phenomena of interest in areas such as complex
adaptive systems and artificial life, as well as practically, enabling
the construction of novel systems, endowed with evolutionary,
reproductive, regenerative, and learning capabilities.  This
self-contained volume examines the behavior of such machines, the
complex computation they exhibit, and the application of artificial
evolution to attain such systems.

According to SciAm, they build at least a part of it (or was it the Diff. 
E.?), using machined parts, at accuracy available at that time. It worked 
allright. One of the cyberpunks authors, dunno whether Sterling or 
Gibson, wrote a (purportedly) readable novel about an alternative

                        STANDARD SOCIAL CONTRACT

                Between ___________________________ and

                THE GOVERNMENT OF CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA

WHEREAS: I wish to reside on the Central North American Continent and;
WHEREAS: The Central North American Government controls the area on which I
wish to reside and;
WHEREAS: Tacit and implied contracts are vague and therefore unenforceable;

THEREFORE, I, THE SIGNER BELOW, agree to the following terms:

SECTION ONE.
        I will surrender a percentage of my property to the Government, such
percentage to be determined by the Government and subject to change at any
time at Government discretion. The amount to be surrendered may be based on
my income, my net worth, the value of my purchases, or any other criteria
the Government may choose.
        To aid the Government in determining the percentage, I will apply for a
Government Identification Number which I will use in all major transactions.

SECTION TWO.
        Upon Government demand, I will surrender my liberty for a period of
time to be determined by the Government, typically no less than two years.
During that time I will serve the Government in any way it chooses,
including military
service in which I may be called upon to sacrifice my life.

SECTION THREE.
        I will limit my behavior when and as demanded by the Government,
including but not limited to the following: I will consume only those drugs
permitted by the Government; I will limit my sexual activities to those
permitted by the Government; I will forsake religious beliefs which conflict
with the Government's determination of propriety.

SECTION FOUR.
        In consideration of the above, the Government will:
        A. Permit me to seek employment, subject to any limits which might
be determined by the Government, such as choice of career or wages I may accept.
        B. Permit me to reside in the area of North America which it
controls.          C. Permit me to speak freely, subject to limits to be
determined from time to time by the President or his authorized
representatives, the Congress and/or the Supreme Court.
        D. Attempt in good faith to protect my life and my claims to any
property it may have allowed me to keep.
                [Note: I may not, however, hold the Government liable,
                 or responsible, or accountable in the event it fails to
                 successfully protect my safety or my property. The fact
                 that the Government may deny me the right, or the means,
                 of self-protection places no responsibility whatsoever
                 upon the government for any injury or loss I may suffer
                 as a result.]

SECTION FIVE:
        The Government may offer various services to me, the nature and
extent of which shall be determined by Government and subject to change at
any time, and for which I may be charged at whatever rate is determined by
Government.

SECTION SIX:
        The Government will determine whether, and when, I may vote for certain
officials, and the relative influence of my vote. The influence of my vote
will normally vary inversely with the total number of voters, and I
understand it typically will be of little or no consequence.
        I agree not to hold any elected Government official liable for acting
against my best interest or for failing to uphold oaths or promises, even if
those promises motivated me to vote for them.

SECTION SEVEN:
        I agree that the Government may hold me fully liable if I fail to abide
by the above terms in their entirety. In the event of such failure on my
part, the Government may confiscate any property that may remain in my
possission, and may imprison me for a period of time to be determined by the
Government. I also agree that the Government may, at its discretion, alter
the terms of this contract at any time.

InScight has a short shallow summary of two recent papers in Nature which
are about determining the structure of a protein (hepatitis B virus core
protein (HBc)). The Nature articles are interesting because of:

       the novel technique the researchers used to derive the protein's
       structure--an electron microscope rather than the old standby, x-ray
       crystallography--heralds a new approach to resolving the structure
       of molecules that resist forming crystals.

Here is adams' bio as posted on the Westinghouse WWW site:

Adam Ezra Cohen, 17, of 500 E. 63rd St., New York, entered an
engineering projectQmerely the most impressive of his many
inventionsQin the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.  His technique,
which he calls near-field photolithography, creates extremely small
patterns on various surfaces as building its fundamental component, a
shas won honors on the math team. He also competes on the soccer,
cross-country, and track teams. The son of Drs. Joel and Audrey Cohen,
Adam hopes to study physics at Harvard.

A good intro to RET/REBT is: A NEW GUIDE TO RATIONAL LIVING by Albert Ellis
and Robert A. Harper (Wilshire Books, 1975).

A good supplement to REBT may be Nathaniel Branden's work with sentence
completions. I've found these can be effective at understanding emotions
and their source. Branden didn't invent sentence-completion exercises but
uses them extensively and gives many examples. A good way to investigate
Branden's recent work is to read TAKING RESPONSIBILITY: SELF-RELIANCE AND
THE ACCOUNTABLE LIFE.

If you can read French, here's the latest TWA 800 report 
from Pierre Salinger, Dr. Mike Sommer, and yours truly:

http://www.parismatch.tm.fr/actualite/twa800/framedepart.html

The radar images the FBI has been working overtime 
to keep out of your sight is also to be found there.
I suspect that we will be attacked in the press soon.

To print this with the FBI foaming at the mouth about 
any release of evidence or wrong thinking about TWA 800,
Paris Match proves it has more guts than the entire U.S.
major media. I just heard over the news that the FBI told 
NYANG Captain Chris Baur to stop talking to the media. 
Here's what Baur is saying that they want silenced:

Pat Milton, for the Associated Press reports (03/12/97):

    NEW YORK (AP) - An Air National Guardsman who
    witnessed the explosion of TWA Flight 800 repeatedly
    told authorities he thought a missile had struck the
    plane, a source said. 

    After searching for survivors the night of the crash,
    Capt. Chris Baur, a helicopter pilot, returned to his 
    base and ``told officials immediately he thought he 
    saw a missile,'' said the source, who spoke to The 
    Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 

    Baur ``saw a track of light and saw a hard explosion, then
    another explosion,'' the source said. The pilot then shared
    his observations with the FBI, the National Transportation
    Safety Board and investigators from the Joint Terrorism
    Task Force.

I've recently been thinking about time-reversal symmetry in physics.
This is one of the basic symmetries of existing theories, and John 
Cramer's transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics seeks to 
explain nonlocal correlations by back-and-forth-in-time ("zigzag")
causality.

If time-reversal symmetry is real, it ought to be possible to have 
beings like ourselves whose "arrow of time" points the other way.

Is there something paradoxical about the notion of *communication*
between ourselves and countertime beings? Or could we build a
time-reversed robot that reports on the future?

In the case of time paradox via wormhole, the most popular idea
is that just when two wormholes comes within range of causing a
closed timelike curve, they will be destroyed by vacuum 
fluctuations which will repeatedly traverse the neighborhood of
the CTC until the energy density is sufficient to destabilize the 
wormholes.

In the case of countertime communication I see no such convenient
physical mechanism to avoid paradoxes of the form: at time t,
countertime machine A tells "forward-time" machine B that B sent a 
signal at time t+dt, and B is programmed not to send the signal if 
it receives such a message from A. So perhaps countertime entities 
aren't possible, or communication with them is not possible, but 
if so, why not?

(Time reversal has been explored a bit in science fiction:
in a short story by Greg Egan; in Brian Aldiss' *Cryptozoic*;
in Ian Watson's "The Very Slow Time Machine"; probably in
Philip K. Dick, and possibly in Stephen Baxter. No doubt
Damien B can suggest a few more...?)

Drexler, "In collaboration with Dr. Merkle, I set out to develop an
atomically detailed design for a far smaller molecular manipulator than
previously had been considered - one intended not to do the whole job of
molecular positioning, but to serve as a "hand" for the final, precise step
of applying a molecular tool.  The resulting design uses fewer than 3,000

It seems that if you can even recognize that another being ( or another
universe? ) is reversed in time to yourself, you have enough information
transfer to be able to communicate sufficiently to trigger the above
paradox.
Therefore, either 1) we can't even know of their existence, or 2) we have
a paradox.  Separate universes?

Hmm...maybe a third possibility is one-way communication, but that 
argues against symmetry...I'm in over my head here.

Gibson and Sterling collaborated on _The Difference Engine_ which is
referred to as "steampunk".  The premise of the book is: Imagine if we had
calculating machines 150 years ago. There is some very interesting flights
of fancy about programmers, software and the social and political
ramifications of computer technology. Its a good yarn involving internal
combustion vs steam engines, sudden wealth, competing dinosaur theories,
massive air pollution, Luddites (the originals) all set among (one
presumes) the little known realities and quirks of "modern" life in the
early 19th century. The ending was a disappointment in the usual Gibsonian
mold - vague murky conspiratorial goings-on I found impenetrable. But it
was a fun ride along the way.

BTW, the SciAm article tells an interesting story. I always assumed that
Babbage never completed his inventions because he'd become obseesed with
ideas for improvements that would of course delay project completion. In
fact he was held up by some of my EE professors in college as a classic
case of "creeping elegance" - "Don't let this happen to you!" Now I realize
that he couldn't get funding because he couldn't convince the British
government of the utility of such a machine - a different lesson altogether
and one entrepreneurs the world over can relate to, I think.

I think the generally accepted explanation for time asymmetry goes to
boundary conditions at the beginning and end of the universe.  For some
reason the early universe had very low entropy, so if you look at it as
a four dimensional object you see a gradient of increasing entropy in the
time direction away from the origin.  This is what we perceive as the
arrow of time.  (I don't know if there is a good theory for why this
asymmetry in the buondary conditions exists.)

You could imagine a situation where some parts of the universe had low
entropy at one end, and other parts had low entropy at the other end.
Then for this to lead to a consistent solution, the existence of what
we would perceive as causality paradoxes must be prevented somehow; only
universes in which such paradoxes never happen to occur would be legal
solutions to the equations with those boundary conditions.

These kinds of considerations are often invoked to explain what would happen
in other causality-challenging situations, like the closed timelike lines
which appear in some exotic systems of GR.  You simply postulate that only
the universes in which the local laws of physics are observed can exist.
However this ends up looking like the Hand of God reaching down to stop you
from doing things which would produce a paradox.

I remember a comic book I read once where Superboy tried to go back
into time and prevent the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  Oops, he
ran into some red Kryptonite which paralyzed him for just long enough
to prevent him from changing history.  This kind of thing would be
happening constantly if time travel were possible or if you had the
kind of bi-directional entropy gradients described above.  The harder
you try to outwit the universe, the harder it would fight back.  It seems
like a pretty implausible way for things to be.

With current methods of cloning you still need a mother, but their are  
probably other ways to do it. Standard recipe to  clone a human:

1) Take an egg cell from a female and remove all the DNA from the nucleus.
2) Take a cell, any cell except a red blood cell, from the person you want to   
   clone and put it in a test tube for 5 days.
3) Only feed the cell 5% of the food it normally uses so it goes into a state   
   of quiescence. 
4) Place the sleeping cell next to the egg that has been robedof its DNA.
5) Give the 2 cells a small jolt of electricity so they merge and watch them   
   divide.
6) When they reach the 8 or 16 cell stage transfer them to the womb of the   
   host mother.
7) Wait 9 months.

Sperm is in no way involved in any of this, as far as test tube reproduction 
is concerned men are as obsolete as vacuum tubes. Perhaps women are not 
needed either, an animal's womb might work, already horses have given birth  
to test tube zebras. As for a human egg cell, as many as 7 million could be 
gotten from the ovaries of a human female embryo, John Eppig at the Jackson 
Laboratory in Bar Harbor Maine has done it in mice. A human egg might not 
even be needed, in an editorial in the same issue of "Nature" that announced 
the cloning results, they say it would be interesting to know if a human egg 
cell is really needed to clone a person, one from an animal such as a cow  
might work. Of course, then the human clone would have cow mitochondria DNA, 
but that might not be a problem.

The Senate hearing on cloning was on C-span today, with one exception 
everyone was screaming about how evil human cloning would be, even Ian Wilmut, 
the man who invented the technique. By far the most interesting remarks came 
from Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, he said he disagreed with the 
president's decree on this subject and he didn't think he had the 
constitutional authority to do it, then he said:

 "This has enormous potential for good, There should be no limits on human  
  knowledge, none whatever. To those like President Clinton who say we can't   
  play God, I say OK, fine, you can take your side alongside Pope Paul V who 
  in 1616 tried to stop Galileo, they accused Galileo of trying to play God 
  too. [...] I don't think cloning is demeaning to human nature, to attempt   
  to limit human knowledge is demeaning. It's not legitimate to try to stop  
  cloning. What nonsense, what utter, utter nonsense to think we can hold   
  up our hand and just say "stop". Cloning will continue, the human mind will  
  continue to inquire into it. Human cloning will take place and it will take 
  place in my lifetime, and I don't fear it at all. I want to be on the side  
  of the Galileos and those who say the human mind has no limits, rather than  
  trying to stop something that's going to happen anyway."

I has a strange feeling when I head him talk, it was like the words were 
coming out of my mouth, it made me think about how important genes are to 
personality, for although I have never said one word to the man and have  
never even seen him in person, Senator Harkin is my cousin.

My Mom always said Harkin's father was the stupidest man in the family and a 
total embarrassment. Surprisingly despite these excellent qualifications he 
did not go into politics, but his son did. That branch of the family still 
causes me embarrassment, I don't like being related to a politician, but I
must admit he made me proud today.

Perhaps is he hadn't wasted so much of his time trying to convince the King
to steal his stake for him, but had appealed to real entrepreneurs across
the Atlantic, things might have been different.  But then I wouldn't have
expected a socialist propaganda rag like SciAm to see that angle.

was beginning to despair that libertarian voices on this issue would be
drowned in the flood of anti-tech I'd been hearing.  But the facts not
only that he said it, but that it got airplay, encourage me.  Among the
rarest events humans may occasionally witness, like solar eclipses and
bright comets, you may include hearing me praise a Democrat: your cousin

The key is in realising that the book is narrated by the AI - the Analytical
Engine.  Moreover, this AI is a kind of quantum consciousness, so that the
story involves a series of superposed alternatives.  I was uncertain of this
interpretation, so I asked Bill Gibson, and he said, `Of course'.

Are the techniques for cloning the most likely techniques for germ-line
gene therapy, such as eliminating genes for Down's syndrome?

If so, can someone come up with a list of syndromes with genetic
causes, that we can use to write letters to our local newspapers
pointing out the benefits of cloning technology?

Subject: Re: TWA 800: Paris-Match is OUT
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I only speak a little French, but with all the news coverage on this
story I have tried to understand what the Paris Match magazine is
saying about the radar images.

http://www.parismatch.tm.fr/actualite/twa800/framedepart.html has 9 photos
(purportedly) from the radar image which show activities in the minutes
surrounding the accident.

http://www.parismatch.tm.fr/actualite/twa800/twa1.html shows one big and
three small images from about the same period.

The TWA flight is shown on the screen in the big picture as follows:

    TWA800
  / BET*37 H
 C

This has the flight number, TWA800; a designation of its departure route,
BET; a speed indication, 37, for 370 knots; and the H for "heavy", standard
designation for large airliners.  In the later images the BET is replaced
by an altitude indication, for example 137 for 13,700 feet.  I believe the
actual location of the plane is at the "C".

The images on the page with four pictures has the above geometry,
while the page with nine pictures has a slightly different one, with
the label to the left of the "C" rather than to the right:

   TWA800  \
   129 37 H  \
               C

This suggests to me that the two pages are taken from different data sets,
since the time of their images overlaps, but they consistently have these
two different label formats.  There are also differences in the scale and
the position of some other labels.  The relative plane positions are
consistent between the two series of images, though.

Large circles on the display are 10 (nautical) miles apart, I believe;
this is how the FAA typically lays out controlled airspace, and it is
consistent with the indicated speed of TWA800 and how far it travels
between images.

There are four objects marked on the various pictures.  The red circle
shows a USAir flight which to the south and higher than TWA800.  The
yellow circle shows a US Navy P3 Orion plane, which is apparently not
in communication with the FAA ATC system.  The USAir and Orion blips
approach each other, and they almost touch at the exact moment that
TWA800 explodes.  This is apparently just a coincidence; they are two
or three miles from flight 800, and presumably the planes are all at
different altitudes.

The page with the nine photos also shows two other objects.  A light green
circle marks the unidentified object which I think is supposed to be the
"missile".  It only appears on two of the images, west of TWA800, and
doesn't look to me to be moving very quickly.  There is also a later
object marked with a blue square a few minutes after the explosion,
a Navy helicopter.

The explosion occurs at 00 h 31 min 17 sec (according to one of the
pages), which is the 6th picture in the 9-picture sequence.  The
green-circled object appears on two images, one 41 seconds before the
explosion and one 34 seconds before.  One question is whether it is
moving fast enough and in the right direction to reach TWA800 at the
moment it explodes.  My impression is that it is not.  It is hard to
be certain given the small scale of the images, but the object appears
to be about 6 or 7 miles west of TWA800 in the first picture, and
still 6 or 7 miles west 7 seconds later.  In fact, I measured with a
piece of paper and it is slightly farther from the "C" indicating the
position of flight 800 in the second picture than in the first.  So it
doesn't appear to be catching up to TWA800 at all.

It would be very dramatic and exciting if it turned out that there were
a big conspiracy to cover up an accidental missile hit, but the radar
pictures which Paris Match is displaying don't make the case as far as
I can tell.

In the 16 Jan Nature, News and Views, there was a piece on neurons
possibly being more complex than had been thought.  Nonlinear responses,
multiplicative instead of additive functions, and shifts in dendritic
membrane potentials, which the researchers thought could be another
storage mechanism.

This could make uploading harder, if they're doing more computation and
storage in themselves, not just as a network.

I've been spending the past while doing lots of thinking about things; about 
all kinds of things --  

I've been playing around with ALL kinds of things in my environment; studying 
*everything* very intently, seeing what I can do with various kinds of objects 
and discovering the properties, features and usefulness of everyday items, 
such as::  my hands, pieces of cloth, strings and rope, pipes and dope,  with 
bedrooms and mushrooms, paper and pens, there's just so many things I can do 
with my hands!  

And yet I feel like I'm just beginning -- I see so **many**  //possibilities\\ 
for further exploration, for further playings with my reality ((all safe and 
hygenic, of course)).

I'm essentially turning the whole world into my playground, and now it doesn't 
seem so big and terrifying any more.  Now things look interesting and fun and 
full of possibilities.  I know sometimes I or others will make mistakes and 
sometimes people will be hurt, but I _also know that we will learn from our 
actions and the actions of others, and we will improve our performance, become 
less harmful, less wasteful, more careful and mindful in all of our actions.

Whether our world is terrifying, violent and destructive, or whether our world 
is safe, inviting and comfortable, is almost entirely up to us.  We choose how 
we behave, and we choose what sorts of environments we create.  We can 
basically decide what kind of a world we want to live in and then create the 
sort of reality we love. 

We are the masters here; we are intelligent, and we learn quickly; we study 
the world and learn how it works and how we can manipulate it to be the way we 
want it to be.  If something isn't quite right, we'll work on it and make it 
right.  We are in the process of continual improvement, and this process has 
been continuing on for longer than I can fathom right now.  

This is just so amazing!  This whole reality is so fascinating to me; the more 
I learn, the deeper my curiosity grows.  I want to understand it all; it's so 
beautiful; and it's right there in front of me and all around me and through 
me.  It  - i s -  me.  

Now ^there's^ an interesting idea;  I am all that I am aware of and all that I 
influence.  I have a certain pattern to myself; I am unique; and the influence 
of what I am spreads all around me in various ways as I make changes; as I 
think and move and communicate.  My influence spreads everywhere; tending to 
become mixed up in larger and smaller processes.  I can cause the atoms in my 
hand to move faster, by rubbing it on something else;  I can influence the 
minds of other humans by presenting them with attractive ideas, which they 
incorporate into the process of themselves.  I can also observe and be 
conscious of much of the world, through various means --- I can use my senses 
to gather information, and I can notice patterns and regularities in that 
information and understand the signifigance of my experiences and eventually 
perceive the larger patterns and processes I'm involved in.

As I grow, my awareness and my influence also grows  --  I *AM* my awareness 
and influence.  I seem to be woven seamlessly into other people and into the 
elements of the physical world -- we all influence and are aware of each other 
to a high degree.  There are still differences between us; every system seems 
to be unique.  There are individuals.  We are also all deeply connected to 
each other; each individual connected to all others in a relationship which is 
itseslf unique among all relationships.  The relationship itself is also an 
individual.  Hmmm.....interesting thought space around this idea....

..... .
 ... ...
  . .....

You know, this writing is actually quite good for having eaten as much 
psychedellic mushrooms and cannabis as I've been eating.  I don't know why the 
popular image of these plants is that they are harmful and make you stupid.  
The state of clarity I'm experiencing is very beautiful, and my intellectual 
and physical abilities seem quite available to me; in many ways; I feel 
ENHANCED; I feel much better than I did before I started using this stuff.  
Although, most of that has to do with the discipline of mind that I've been 
developing, but the herbs do seem to be helping me out a lot.  Without them, 
I'd still excell (actually I'd just find a way to manufacture the same kind of 
chemicals the plants do in my own body; the body can make all kinds of 
chemicals, especially the brain... make your own dope, right inside your own 
body, custom-made, just how you want it!  What a deal!)  

It's the people that use drugs improperly that give them such a bad 
reputation.  It's not the drugs that are bad; the drugs simply exist; it's how 
we use them that may be good or bad.  When used properly, drugs can be very 
beneficial; but when they're used improperly; they can become deadly.  Very 
much like knives in that way -- beneficial when used carefully and 
intelligently, but dangerous when used unthinkingly and ignorantly.

Well, my mind is full of ideas, and I don't want to download all of them into 
this message, so I will end it shortly, but I exist, and will share my 
summations and creations of reality with you often.

Thank you for your attention,

Really? I totally missed that! How did you figure that out? Was there a
clue or tipoff that I missed? 

Or

Are you pulling my leg? 

That explanation makes sense (I think). Is it also the explanation for the
end of _Neuromancer_ ? Unfortunatekly Occam's Razor tells me that they
didn't have a coherent way to end the story and it just ran out of steam
(pun intended). The other stuff sounds like justification after the fact to
me. YMMV

I'd like to thank Davin C. Enigl <enigl@aol.com> for the obvious time 
he took in writing his last post on this subject.  I apologize for the delay 
in replying, I had to look up a few things.  

I have contended that our government announced that the virus later 
re-named HIV was the probable cause of AIDS in advance of the 
publication by Gallo of his evidence.  The press conference announcement 
was on April 23, 1984, Gallo published in Science over a week later.

You said I was conveniently forgetting about an article Gallo published in 
Science in 1983.

I pointed out that in 1983 Gallo was arguing that HTLV-I caused AIDS, 
and that HTLV-I, not the virus later named HIV, was the focus of 
Gallo's 1983 article.

You countered that Gallo was careful not to emphasize the HTLV 
sub group 1 over any of the other HTLV family in the quotes 
I cited from the article:

>Davin C. Enigl <enigl@aol.com>
>He says HTLV-like virus and does NOT say HTLV-I

I thought I remembered Gallo singling out HTLV-1, and returned to the 
library [this time commandeering a microfilm reader that had a printer!]. 
Gallo did emphasize the HTLV sub group 1 over the other retroviruses 
of this family in his 1983 paper:

"Virus from the U.S. patient was isolated and characterized and shown 
to be related to HTLV subgroup 1.  Whether or not HTLV-1 or other 
retroviruses of this family with T-cell tropism cause AIDS, it is possible 
that patients from whom the virus can be isolated can also transmit it 
to others."

"...the slopes of the competition curves in homologous RI-PA's for p24 
in cell extracts from both cell lines were very similar to those for p24 from 
isolates of the HTLV-1 subgroup, indicating that the isolate from patient EP 
is closely related to the HTLV-1 subgroup.  By this assay the new isolate 
appears to be less closely related to the HTLV-II subgroup. Analysis of the 
nucleic acids of the HTLV isolated from EP also indicated its similarity to 
viruses of the HTLV-1 subgroup."

[all above quotes from Gallo, R.C., P.S. Sarin, E.P.Gelmann, M. Robert-
Guroff, and E. Richardson.  Isolation of human T-cell leukemia virus in 
(AIDS). Science 220 (1983): 865-867.].

Gallo himself acknowledged in his November 1986 sworn declaration 
before the USPTO, that in the Spring of 1983:

"...our thinking at the time was that the AIDS virus was likely to be a close 
relative of HTLV-1" [Declaration of Robert C. Gallo, 11/8/86, p.10].

The virus that the Institute Pasteur (IP) isolated, which Gallo later either 
misappropriated or contaminated his own samples with, first called "LAV" 
[for lymphadenopathy-associated virus] appeared to be distinctly different 
from the known human retroviruses, HTLV-1 and II. As the Staff Report 
on Oversight and Investigations Committee on Energy and Commerce of 
the US House of Representatives reported:

>"During the first critical months of research on HIV, the work of the 
>Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology [LTCB] scientists was far behind that of 
>the scientists at the Institut Pasteur [IP].  The reason the LTCB scientists

>In early 1983, scientists at both the IP (Montagnier et al.) and LTCB

>AIDS virus mistakenly placed that virus in the "HTLV" family (see, e.g., 
>Medical World News, August 14, 1982, p9).

>By Dr. Gallo's own admission (see below), his misunderstanding of the

>and its true defining features identified, Dr. Gallo fought a losing battle to

>rather than HIV.

>The IP scientists recognized early on that their virus, first called "LAV"
>...appeared to be distinctly different from the known human retroviruses, 
>HTLV-I and II.  

>Meanwhile, throughout all of 1983, the only contribution the LTCB scientists 
>made to the scientific literature and dialogue concerning possible causes of 
>AIDS was to reiterate that "HTLV" was "...a very attractive candidate" 
>(Gallo remarks at 7/18/83 meeting of the NCI AIDS Task Force)."

[This draft Staff Report of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation 
of the Energy and Commerce is now available at
http://www.nyx.net/~wstewart/CelebratedCases/GalloCase/GalloCase.html]

As Celia Farber wrote in an article in the June 1992 issue of Spin titled 
"Fatal Distraction":

>"By 1983, he [Gallo] was publishing papers trying to convince his peers 
>that it [HTLV-I] also caused AIDS..."The whole thing about HTLV-I 
>and AIDS was ridiculous, but nobody would say a word against 
>Bob Gallo," recalls Dr. Sonnabend [a pioneering AIDS researcher and 
founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AMFAR)]

I still maintain that a fair reading of the evidence indicates that in 1983,
Gallo was advocating HTLV-I, or a close relative [not LAV, 
later renamed HTLV-III by Gallo] as the etiological agent in AIDS.  

Some other points:

>Davin C. Enigl <enigl@aol.com>
>Because 33 AIDS patients were positive for retrovirus (HTLV-like) 
>this was very strong  evidence an HTLV class virus is involved. 

Gallo reported "...the viral genome of HTLV was found to be integrated into 
peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA in 2 of 33 AIDS patients tested thus far..." 
He didn't say all 33.

>>Fallon:
>>"Since HTLV is endemic in southern Japan, the apparent lack of epidemic 
>>AIDS in this region may argue against a causative role for HTLV in AIDS. 
>>However...people in southern Japan may have a greater resistance to 
>>the T-cell suppressive effect of the virus." 
 
>Davin C. Enigl <enigl@aol.com>
>So, they argue _against_ even the whole class of HTLV viruses as the cause of
>AIDS.  That does not support your premise that they were arguing only for the
>HTLV class of what we now know as several viruses with similar genome.   

I would point out that here Gallo is not cautioning us that HTLV may have 
no role, as much as he is anticipating an obvious objection to the etiological 
role of HTLV [HTLV is endemic in southern Japan, but AIDS is not epidemic 
there], and arguing that HTLV STILL might be the cause ["however ...people 
in southern Japan may have a greater resistance to the T-cell suppressive 
effect of the virus."] Note the use of the word however.

I'm not sure how many high tech venture capitalists there were in North
America in 1830-50. Even if there were, Babbage was probably taking his
best shot with the British Government. Having raised $12M in venture
funding for a startup years ago I can tell you its a long, drawn-out
arduous process even in the age of the fax machine and jet airplanes. It
grinds you down, especially if what you really want to do is design high
tech stuff, not explain to people with lot's of money why you can do what
no one else has thought of or has tried and failed. Its even worse if you
have no "credentials." (Been there, done that - its a real pain)

"steal his stake for him" - ??

"real entrepreneurs" - British companies started colonies all over the
world and set up trading posts like Hong Kong in the hopes of "making their
fortunes". They also set up botanical gardens which were biological
laboratories for finding new plant-based products like tea and rubber. Read
Neal Stephenson's fascinating article about the transatlantic cable in
Wired a few months back. It sure sounds like Lord Kelvin had
entrepreneurial spirit to me. But I digress...

Babbage was pouring what funds he had into experiments and the prototype as
well as financing the search for funding and putting food in his own mouth.
I suspect he felt he couldn't afford the time or the money to chase
investors in America who were probably (in his mind) less sophisticated
technically and therefore less likely to finance a venture in England where
they couldn't easily keep watch over their investment. And besides, US
nationalistic pride might discourage investment in the former ruling
country that had burned down the White House in 1812. That is, if in fact
he didn't look for US funds. Does anyone know if he ever tried to find US
investors?

BTW, I thought that Scientific American was a well written and respected
popular science magazine. Why do you characterize it as "socialist" or
"propaganda" or a "rag "? What have I been missing all these years?

             Stud Dud Cigar Might Be Cloned 

Associated Press Thursday, March 13, 1997; 4:01 p.m. EST 

NEW YORK  Cigar's owner thinks the cloning of Cigar, two-time
horse of the year, would be an interesting experiment. But
that's apparently all it would be.
          
"We're certainly looking into cloning,'' said  Allen Paulson,
who has the right to buy Cigar back should the 7-year-old horse
prove sterile. 
  
If Cigar were to be cloned, however, any resulting offspring
most likely would be barred from racing by the Jockey Club. 
     
Paulson told the Associated Press from California that cloning
was not his idea. "I didn't start this,'' he said. 
            
He said he was contacted by the New York Post's health and
science writer, Roger Field, who asked him about cloning Cigar
in light of recent experiments in Scotland involving the cloning
of a sheep. 
 
"I said it might be an interesting experment," Paulson told the
AP. "If somebody who is qualified wants to come and get a patch
off him it would be all right.'' 

Barry Simon, farm manager for Ashford Stud at Versailles, Ky.,
said last week that 16 of 36 mares bred to Cigar had been tested
and none was in foal. After Paulson retired Cigar last year, the
horse was sent to Ashford Stud in a deal valued at $25 million.
Cigar's stud fee is $75,000. 
  
"There's no life in his sperm at all,'' Paulson told the Post.
"They've checked over 20 mares, and all of them are barren. It's
a big shock.'' 

Paulson said he owns Cigar but sydnicated him for stud, keeping
10 shares and selling 30 shares to Coolmore Stud, which operates
Ashford. 

When a stallion fails at stud, he becomes the property of the
insurance company. Paulson said he would buy back Cigar from the
insurance company. 

Scientists in Scotland who successfully cloned a sheep told the
Post they don't know when, if ever, they will be able to clone a
horse. 

"It's been done once in sheep, and whether it's transferable to
other species, we don't know yet,'' said Dr. Harry Griffin of
the Roslin Institute. "Other attempts ... will be in cattle and
then probably in pigs.'' 

Dr. James Stewart of the American Association of Equine
Practitioners told the Post there might be problems with a
cloned horse's offspring. 

"When the clones start to breed, they'll bring out recessive
traits,'' Stewart said. "You'll open some problems you don't
want to think about.'' 

"I don't think the Jockey Club would allow cloning,'' Paulson
said, "because it doesn't allow artificial insemination.'' 

The Jockey Club, which registers American thoroughbreds and sets
rules for breeding and racing, bars from competition the
offspring of mares impregnated by artificial insemination. The
rules do not specifically address cloning, but soon will, a
spokesman for the organization said today. 

The Jockey Club's regulation for registering a foal states the
foal must "be a result of a stallion's natural service of a
brood mare,'' said James Peden, vice president of corporate
communications for the organization. 

"This regulation specifically excludes artificial insemination
or embryo transfer'' Peden said, "and I expect the Stewards of
the Jockey Club to add the words 'cloning by any means.' '' 

Cigar ended his career at age 6 as the richest horse ever, just
shy of $10 million. He was retired to stud after he finished
third in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Oct. 26 at Woodbine in
Toronto. 

It was his second consecutive loss and third in four races since
the end of his 16-race winning streak, which matched the modern
record of Citation. The streak included a 10-for-10 record in 1995. 
            
Cigar won an allowance race on Oct. 28, 1994 at Aqueduct, then
didn't lose again until he was second to Dare And Go in the
Pacific Classic on Aug. 10, 1996 at Del Mar.

MKdoesV.  The QT spin is surely justification *before* the fact, since it
occurred to me as I was reading, rather than after Gibson confirmed it
(unless *he* was pulling *my* leg, which may be what you're suggesting.)

I figured it out the way a chicken sexer does it, through codes invisible to
the human eye - I'm just *very good at it* as a result of an injudiciously
large amount of sf reading over, um, 40-something years.  I wish I was as
efficient in some skill that paid $$$...

BTW, it helps your enjoyment if you notice that many of the characters in
DIFFERENCE ENGINE are from Victorian literature: e.g., Sybil Gerard, Dandy
Mick and Egremont are from Disraeli's 1845 SYBIL.

I read Duesberg's book several months ago. Though it is repetitious, I
agree
with most of Duesberg's points. The main idea is that HIV is a benign
virus
which replicates avidly within an immune system which has been
compromised in
some other way. Duesberg's book makes many other points which I will not
repeat
here - go read the book.

I live in Santa Cruz and have a few friends here. However my "community"
includes
my Email associates, Extropian and Cryonic. This goes beyond exchanging
email
messages - I have exchanged lodging and made loans to folk I have met
through
this medium....

If you want software to go along with this, look up Terence McKenna's
"Timewave Zero" software, which you can run via the "hyperborea" web
page (I lack the URL but it is easy to find). I know both Terence and
the person who wrote the software for Terence....

Just for fun we looked up the "harmonic convergence" (remember that
one?) in Timewave Zero --- which said nothing happened that day....

I believe I've mentioned Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_, and
that I found it to be a spiffy book.  One of his provocative (although
not too important for his main point) asides was his belief that modern
hunter-gatherers are more intelligent than most modern "civilizeds" at
least in practice, and possibly genetically.

His case (somewhat vague, again it's just an aside for him, at least in
this book) is based on long observation of New Guinean peoples and the
favorable comparison he makes with your average urbanite.  His
theoretical argument is necessity -- since everyone is approximately
responsible for their own survival, they have to be more competent and
knowledgeable about their environment.  More importantly than simple
knowledge, he feels that they're more curious; they play with their
environment more, because that's what a hunter-gatherer does.  "Ooh, new
plant, or rock; what is it good for?"  Missionaries and colonialists no
doubt have smiled knowingly at the primitive playing childlike with
simple artifacts of civilization, like a lighter or paper clip; but I
suspect your average Western tourist would ignore most of the novelty
around themself, or else if confronted by it retreat and whimper.

His argument for genetically superior intelligence is that
hunter-gatherers -- at least some of them, others apparently can be
placidly dull, ignoring an unprecedented helicopter (whereas those he
favors "would be trying to charter it") -- have been living this way all
along, and been selected for greater intelligence and adaptability.
After all, hunter-gatherer conditions are apparently the conditions
under which we developed intelligence in the first place.  Urban
Eurasians, on the other hand, have primarily been selected for the
ability to survive the diseases we get from our domesitc animals.

What noticeable change could have happened in the past 13,000 years is
open to question.  Still, even without genetics, some hunter-gatherers
might retain the flexibility of their heritage while switfly picking up
modern culture.  Which leads me to my main point: whether               
hunter-gatherer peoples (those who have survived our diseases, achoo)
might not be the proper heirs of the human race.  With a good technical
education, and their own flexibility and (I hope) lack of monotheistic
religious baggage, they might be the ones best suited *as a group* to
picking up transhuman mindsets.  Cryonics and genetic engineering and
whatnot should, in Diamond's painting, just be more tools to play with
to them.

Just a thought.

I recently read the latest Wired and I followed it up with downloading and
installing Pointcast on all the machines in the cafe and I must say
Pointcast Network (www.pointcast.com) is an incredible technology. Imagine
being able to recieve the latest high technology breakthoughs delivered
right to your desktop. Pointcast Network makes news a whole lot more
entertaining the way it's presented like a presentation with everything
moving all over the place. Just wait till they get streaming realvideo
which they intend to use. People walk into the cafe and become mesmorized
by the news/sports/business headlines scrolling flying and zipping all over
the screen. It's VERY entertaining. But if only we had an Extropian or
Transhuman channel. Breakthoughs could REALLY put this to use. You can
download the i-Server which allows you to create a channel for an
evaluation period. I should download a copy and try it out. That would be
incredible.

We've had push media for a long time. It's called television. The media
conspiring to eliminate interactivity is not good. The media sees (with some
exception) the internet as a slow expensive television. Do we want that? I
think Pointcast is a pain in the ass, and I thought it was several months
ago when it first appeared (not when I saw it in Wired). If I want to get
news, I'll get the news I want when I want it. Pointcast is an overrated
screen saver.

 				Order a headstone: The browser died on Wednesday. 

It was the victim of two new standards proposed that day. Two new
standards
that create new ways to receive channels of information over the
Internet. Standards that pave the way for push broadcast to dominate.
And
browsing to fade away. Of course, browsing will always be around as an
option. Just like you have the option to traipse out each morning to buy
a newspaper. 

The old Internet was based on pull, which entailed searching for
something
useful. But with 2 million different URLs out there, it's too ridiculous
to have
to hunt for what you want. The new Internet is based on push, or direct
delivery. Pull is what we did because we weren't smart enough to figure
out
push yet. Just like in the early days of the telephone network. Back
then,
human operators manually plugged cables into switchboards, until we were
smart enough to figure out automatic switching. (Of course, you can
still get
an operator. You just don't need to very often.) 

Don't get me wrong. People won't be pushing anything your way without
your permission. You'll be subscribing to what you want, be it news,
sports,
weather, Web site updates, whatever you fancy. 

In brief, here's what killed the browser. Microsoft proposed a way for
any
channelany push broadcasterto plug into Internet Explorer 4.0 (which
is
due out this summer). At the same time, PointCast proposed to open its
popular broadcast system to any Web site. You can get the details in the
stories linked at the side. By the way, Netscape is expected to follow
soon
with a proposal of its own. 

But the main thing you need to understand now are the implications: 

Netscape will have to respond or its browser will fall out of favor in a
hurry. The impending conflict is likely to make it more and more
difficult for Navigator users to receive broadcasts from publishers
using Microsoft's approach (and vice versa). 

Content will be king, dethroning technology. At last, we will be able
to make information-gathering decisions based on content (and
maybe some minor features)rather than whose technology works
better. Which means the Internet will be a true new medium. 

It's time to start thinking about how you're going to push your Web
site. If you choose to do it on your own, you need to investigate the
proposals from Microsoft and PointCast. And if you choose to
partner, you have to be very careful. Because most of the 30-some
odd push vendors will be out of business in a year or two. 

When all is said and done, you can expect to see three major standards.
One from Microsoft. One from PointCast. And one from Netscape. Does this
remind you of anything? How about the three television networks that
arose
in the 1950s? The Internet is right where TV was back then: on the verge
of
becoming the next major medium. 

All we're waiting for now is the Internet equivalent of Milton Berle.
Berle
hosted the television show that galvanized America in 1957. Convinced
millions it was finally time to bring home a TV set. And firmly planted
a
headstone atop that medium's skeptics.

The suggestions given are about as useless against a real enemy (such

many times with different values, but even these can be overcome by a
sophisticated snoop.  The only secure way to erase a hard disk is with
something like thermite.

Yep - this has been a recurring discussion on Cypherpunks for at least four

destroy your computer, place a booby-trap destructor in the PC...)

We should never forget Admiral "Amazing" Grace Hopper - and yes, I am told
the moth is still in the logbook at Anapolis (sp?)  Their computer actually
used electromechanical relays!  I do wish I had ever had the opportunity to

With all this talk about augmenting our bodies and selves through technology, 
let's not forget to use the resources that our brains and bodies already have 
built in, as features, which we can expand upon through discipline and 
practice.  

Our muscles can become stronger and more versatile through intelligent use (I 
can provide details of some of the work I'm doing with my muscles later.

All of our senses can become several times stronger simply through paying more 
focused attention to sensory information.  I also like to turn my music and 
the television way down to the level where I can still hear it well enough to 
enjoy it, and as I listen to it on that level for a few minutes, it starts 
seeming very loud indeed, so I turn it down a little until it is not so loud, 
and I keep doing this until the signal is very faint, but I'm still picking it 
up loud and clear.  

I also like to improve my senses by walking or running around outside, 
wandering around the park and hiking in the mountains.  I have disciplined 
myself to maintain a sharp awareness of my environment, and I am becoming more 
able to consciously process a tremendous amount of sensory information and 
link it to my memories and knowledge.  When I get really intense, a minute can 
seem like several hours and I can learn a year's worth of material in a day.

All of this with just my biological body and mind.  The systems we already 
have can do far more than we've realized yet.  Good martial artists and yogis 
have known this for thousands of years.

My advice is to use *everything* you have available to you, including the 
resources of your bodymind and the technological creations of other bodyminds, 
including the plants and animals in life -- evolution has come up with some 
pretty ingenious solutions to difficult problems (look at the elaborate and 
technologically advanced termite Civilizations).  We can learn from all the 
world around us and extract lessons to apply to our lives.

Find usefulness in everything.

What is thought to be a major breakthrough/development in cancer therapy
has just been announced in the national Danish media. It should also have
been published in "Nature Medicine" a renounced medical journal.

An international/Danish research group working for the Danish cancer
society, headed by German scientist Michael Strauss, has removed cancer
cells ranging from 05 - 1 cm in size in rats. They dissapeared in the
course of 10 - 12 days.

They are ready to start testing on humans, and they are certain they can
cure tumors and pretty shure it will work on methastasis (Hope thats the
right english word, can't find it in my dictionary.) It won't work on
leuchemia or cancer in the lymphytic system.

The method is that the take a common cold virus and encode it with 2 genes
that stops the cell (darn another english word i can't remember)
multiplying/splitting? The virus is used as a carrier for the gene.

Popularly explained (wich was all they did) the reprogram the cancer cell
to a more normal state where it will destroy itself like normal cells.

Perhaps some of you guys with more medical knowledge can check out the
magazine. It sounds like a variety of the same process can be used in
stopping ageing?

They figure it will be between 7-10 years before it will become common
practice on humans.

Is this definition in keeping with the new neurobiological

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

The discussion of Mr Carwash's response to Natasha's "BUSINESS: Transhuman
Posters" post seem to have turned on two aspects: intially, it's rather
inept rhetorical style, and, more recently, it's scientific content. There
is, however, a third issue raised within Johnny's diatribe, which concerns
the interpretation of Natasha's proposed piece of work. And, indeed, it may
be that there is a point to be made within this context. However, to
discuss it further I want to get away from the original post (although not
entirely), and at the same time, hopefully, distance myself from the
previous debates it has generated.

So, let us suppose that a piece of art is created showing a concept which
violates a fundmental physical law. This being the case, one can consider
the bases upon which it can be criticized. The fundamental realization here
is that there is a discourse between the observer and the artwork, and that
the involvement of the observer allows for multiple interpretative
frameworks to exist of a single picture.

The portrayal of scientific impossibility is not, of itself, inherently
critizable. As an analogy: the works of Escher aren't seen to undermine
mathematics simply because they use optically deceptive techniques to
portray three-dimensionally impossible topologies. Similarly, religious
iconography escapes criticism from some (though probably no-one on this
list) despite containing images which are considered pure fantasy when
post-Enlightment rationality is brought to bear to the exclusion of other
considerations. Criticism is dependent on the read meaning of the piece
(which is not necessarily the intended meaning), and that meaning is
constructed by the observer on the basis of pre-existing cultural
information: 'A guy on two bits of wood' becomes 'Jesus' to the vast
majority of people brought up within Western society.

And yet, of course, scientific anomaly in art may be critized for itself,
if the observer interprets the piece as intending to present a scientific
prediction or analysis. Such an interpretation may arise through a reading
of the piece itself, or through the application of external knowledge to
inform the reading of the piece. Johnny's interpretation of Natasha's
proposed work is as a representation of predicted science, and that
interpretation arises, perfectly reasonably, both through discussion of the
piece on this list, and the naming of the piece by Natasha as a 'Transhuman
poster'.

The wider issue is that Extropic Art, labelled as such, and/or disseminated
by artists associated with Extropianism carries a message beyond its
self-contained information. Interpretation of this artwork will either be
informed by knowledge of Extropianism, or will take on a function of
conveying Extropian concepts, or, most likely, both.

Extropianism is not a purely scientific endeavour, and, as far as I know,
has never been 'marketed' as such. And yet, even in its more political and
'self-empowering' aspects it calls upon a Western rationalism which finds
its basis in the scientific endeavour. It would be facile to suggest that
Extropic Art intrinsically undermines that scientific endeavour, or
dissociates that endeavour from Extropianism. But, the producers of any
artwork explicitly associated with Extropianism, or even any artists who
are recognized as Extropian, whether or not they consider their art
Extropian, should be aware that they will be perceived as conveying an
Extropian message. The effect of that message is observer-dependent.
'Incorrect' science may be perceived as artistic licence; it may reflect
purely on the artist, if the observer is 'au fait' with the existing schema
of Extropianism; or it may serve to undermine the Extropian message. This
is, of course, true of not just the scientific discourse produced by
Extropian Art, but equally any political, moral, etc. content.

Art is a discourse, and the creators of Extropic Art act as a voice for
Extropianism; indeed, they may define Extropianism. Without a central
authority, either person or text, to ratify such definition, there is a
real risk of representation which does not reflect the views of the
majority, but does reflect upon them.

On Thursday, March 13, 1997 12:06 PM, Kathryn Aegis cited Gregory 
Houston's quote from the Rational Emotive Based Training (REBT) 
essay:
<3. "REBT is based on the assumption that what we label our 
"emotional" reactions are largely caused by our conscious and 
unconscious evaluations, interpretations, and philosophies.">

Then she asked:
<Is this definition in keeping with the new neurobiological 
discoveries of hard-wired emotional systems (recently discussed on 
this list)?  I'm all for learning to control these systems more 
effectively, but I sense an underlying assumption here that they don't 
even exist.>

I sense that too, or at least the idea that if they do exist we can 
learn to consciously control them.

For example, in Re: SOCIO: Friends, on Saturday, March 08, 1997 6:23 
AM, Gregory wrote:
<What is better, the psychiatrist that "cures" a persons depression by 
giving them a drug, or the psychologist who cures a persons depression 
by teaching them to think in a new way and thus to change their CNS 
chemical content directly themselves.>

And David Musick more recently claimed:
<I'd just find a way to manufacture the same kind of chemicals the 
plants do in my own body; the body can make all kinds of chemicals, 
especially the brain... make your own dope, right inside your own 
body, custom-made, just how you want it!  What a deal!) >

It seems to me that we start off with these "hard-wired emotional 
systems" that roil our lives in many ways under various circumstances 
and, lacking the time or insight to analyze the responses at the time, 
particularly as children, the emotions become subconsciously 
associated with certain circumstances, and eventually build up into 
neurotic reflexes, reinforced by cultural taboos and stereotypes. 
 Even if we can learn to free ourselves from these associations by 
self-evaluation, that still doesn't free us from the underlying 
reflexes, things like "fight or flight" reactions, or sudden anger if 
we find ourselves in untenable positions.

While yogis and others have supposedly demonstrated amazing feats of 
physiological self-control, and biofeedback can be useful for things 
like controling blood pressure and pulse, we're still along way from 
even understanding all the hormonal and neurotransmitter interactions 
that go on in our bodies and brains, let alone being able to control 
all of these via our rational faculties and select our feelings as if 
from a menu.

Yes, it's important to abolish neurotic _ideas_ and understand the 
bases of our subconscious imagery, but that alone won't provide 
control over the underlying, hardwired emotional mechanisms.  I 
suspect that, in many cases, it is a genetic chemical imbalance that 
creates depression rather than some kind of 'improper' way of thinking 
that can be corrected through self re-evaluation.

We need BOTH a curriculum for rational thinking AND chemical 
'switches' or 'enhancers' when there's either a genetic imbalance in 
our neurochemistry, or a set of undesirable neurochemical interactions 
that are too tangled to be resolved by biofeedback.  As long as we 
still live in a world of material scarcity, most people simply won't 
have the time to practice the type of disciplines that David and 
Gregory espouse.

It's a typo. I read english like a native, and speak it like an american
;-) but I have some trouble writing it fluently.

Well Denmark has been in constant war with germany for about a thousand
years except for the last 50 years. So maybee it's genetic. :-)

No the carrier virus should only affect the cancer cells. But who knows.
Nature allways seem to have a way to fight back.

That's a very important "largely" in that first description.
Although a responsible scientist prefers more specific numbers to
weasel words like that, I think one probably could quantify this
better by anayzing how twins raised apart respond to questions
about their emotional reactions.  My own guess, absent any such
data, is that the "largely" is over 80%, though you are correct
that 100%--the "tabula rasa" idea--is clearly false based on
overwhelming evidence.

I know from my own experience that I can train my own emotional
responses to a large degree.  How else could I get angry at Statist
and Theist propaganda when I was raised a Baptist and Democrat?
It would be just as silly to take either of the extreme positions
of this debate as it is any other nature/nurture debate.  The only
questions are percentages, consequences, and techniques.

          LIBERTARIAN WRITER TRASHED FOR OPPOSITION

                TO VIOLENCE AGAINST HEMP USERS

    And The Establishment-wide Crackdown on TWA 800 Inquiry


   by Ian Williams Goddard

   In a crude and pathetic example of yellow journalism, the 
   Long Island newspaper NEWSDAY (03/14) [1], in an effort to 
   smear independent TWA 800 crash researchers on the Internet, 
   used Ian Goddard's principled libertarian opposition to the 
   initiation of force -- i.e., violence -- against nonviolent 
   hemp users [2] as a pretext for condemnation and counter 
   argumentation against TWA 800 Navy-missile theorists. 

   What is more, as NEWSDAY makes all too clear, a Navy missile 
   could not have hit TWA 800 because Ian Goddard's webpage links 
   to a webpage that links to a webpage that shows, God forbid, a 
   woman's "bare derrierre." So much for his crash-damage analysis.
   I even hear he posts his nude sketches on his art webpage, and 
   to think I thought military zone W-105 was activated... oh well.

   The mind boggles at the depths to which the major media will 
   sink to defend the Military Industrial State that most clearly 
   killed 230 people off Long Island on July 17th, 1996. The NEWSDAY
   smear job by Geoff Mohan <mohan@newsday.com> is only one example. 

   The entire major media is uniformly assaulting TWA 800 researchers. 
   See my rebuttal of the 60 MINUTES smear job on my TWA 800 research: 

           http://www.erols.com/igoddard/rebuttal.htm

   It's time to shutdown this Goddard with all his wrong thinking. 
   Most of my fellow researchers who believe the Navy shot-down TWA
   800 have been hit-on by the FBI, had their property seized, and 
   we have all been hit with an avalanche of mass-media disinforma-
   tion. It's no secret: as pro-FBI CNN (3/12/97) [3] reports:
 
           The FBI this week launched a criminal 
           investigation, hoping to stop missile 
           theorists. 

   There it is folks: the use of law to stop wrong theory, to stop
   wrong thinking.  This is a for-real, all-out Establishment-wide 
   totalitarian crackdown on the few souls with the guts to question 
   the so-called "investigation" by federal authorities into the crash 
   of TWA 800. The FBI wants to extricate "wrong thought" from society.  
   Right after the FBI seized Richard Russell's evidence, his two Inter-
   net connections, each on a different server, where cut for 24 hours
   as the media slandered him on national TV, surrounded his home, and 
   even entered his property disguised as maintenance workers. I wish
   the media would investigate the government with the same zeal and 
   ferocity that it investigates those who question the government.


   TOP-SECRET GRAND JURY

   As widely reported, a grand jury on the TWA 800 case has been 
   convened and no one in the press knows what the legal basis is 
   for this top-secret grand jury, particularly since the FBI says 
   there is  NO EVIDENCE  of any criminality in the TWA 800 crash. 
   But what we do know, is that all the secret-grand-jury does is 
   intimidate and terrorize independent TWA 800 researchers.  My 
   friends tell me it's likely the FBI will also target me with
   some type of "legal" force in order to shut me up. Indeed:
  
   Legal action may be activated to force me and others to remove 
   from our websites the photograph of a cruise missile off Long 
   Island on the night TWA 800 was hit with another missile. This 
   photograph is proof that there were live-missile tests off 
   Long Island that evening in the activated military zones.
  
   See it while you can: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dir.htm

   Once the photograph of the missile is suppressed, the FBI will
   indeed be able to say: "There is no evidence of  Navy-missile
   activity that evening." The manufacture of reality by brute 
   force -- a shocking aggression against the entire nation,
   against human freedom, and against the truth.

Good reminder.

During our early-transhuman stage (now), we can make enormous strides by
developing our physical and mental muscles.  It makes sense to be as fit as
possible until advanced augmentations are available.  I also appreciate this
view because it is actively using what tools have been used in the past
successfully, while we work towards future tools. For example, TM works
before yoga.  Weight lifting works nicely after sex.  Laughter works nicely
before or after an arduous debate -

Ian, I saw this CNN report also. The lady reporter (can't remember her 
name) called Salliger's people "so called investigators", and the 
interviewed FBI suit was a waffle. One thing he said was to the effect 
that the radar tape had been confiscated by the FBI to prevent it
being misinterpreted- he made it sound like they had the tape in 
protective custody!
 No evidence fron the other side was presented. 
 Although I'm not sure what happened to the aircraft, there is 
certainly a disinformation campaign in the works.

This could provide some problems.  The twins would have to be raised in
different cultures for genetic influence to come through.  I am assuming
that the cultures reaction to certain traits not related to emotion, but
presumably genetically based, are not to be counted as genetic emotive
behavior.  Identical twins are probably too similar in other respects to
construct a simple evaluation.

I disagree.  I have never heard of a philosophy, a movement, or a 
religion that has been defined by its artists or by their artwork.  
If anything, the artworks themselves have either defied or expanded 
the boundaries of the particular source of inspiration.  I find the 
idea as dangerous as Michael Lorrey's suggestion that we act as 
"cheerleaders".  To make artists definers or cheerleaders imbues them 
with the role of becoming a mouthpiece for ideologies, when in fact 
our role involves the challenging of assumptions and the exploration 
of new avenues of thought.

"At last!  I can go back to being a couch potato!  The burdon of real
choice was wearing me down!  Please!  Give me the false sense of choice
I get from *subscribing* to something, then shower me in constant numbing
stimulus!  I want to believe in 'news' again!"

Yeah, having my computer be more like a TV is it, man, that's *IT*!
Oh, orgasms, orgasms!  My heart's desire!

Although I admit I've been entertained by the zip-zip-zip, here-it-is,
there-it-is attract-mode style of PointCast, I can hardly believe the
articles I'm seeing are written by people thinking seriously of themselves
as--what, users? victims? beneficiaries? subjects? recipients?--of this
technology.  Instead I get the feeling they either just love to "predict"
the next obvious market success, or else they are seeing things from the
point of view (and with the desperate hopes) of the dying-but-don't-
realize-it-yet broadcast and serial print media.

Meaning, basically, "Content Providers" will be king, not
those nerds who make technology.  Us media types will wrest back Control,
instead of the world falling into that horrible, unfamiliar anarchy of
individual choice and exploration that was threatening to happen.

The whole media-business idea of "content" as this mass-produceable
stuff, that you squeeze out of difficult "talent" and "newsmakers", or
synthesize with the help of press secretaries, homogenize, and mix with
ads and press releases, to be funnelled through channels to the public,
fits *so* much more nicely with push technology, don't you think?  Now,
finally things are starting to make *sense*...

...to brains with incurable Hollywood syndrome.  It's as if the sharks
in suits are getting into such a frenzy that they're forgetting their
human masks.  It's embarrassing and yet strangely fascinating the way it
confirms the old suspicions.  I mean, there really *are* aliens in our
midst!  They Live while We Sleep.

Sure, the idea that something outside should be able to initiate a transaction
with, or even sustain a flow of information to my computer makes sense in a
totally boring technical way.  Like, yawn, oh, you mean Netscape didn't
already have that?  Huh, yawn, that's interesting.  Hey, and besides,
*technically*, there's no reason operating systems *shouldn't* be able to
handle the security and stability issues involved, instead of crashing
the way they currently always do under the burdon of One More System
Extension, or reporting your personal life--by accident, of course--to
Prodigy or Microsoft central, right?  (Of course watching a computer
crashed by PointCast was full half the entertainment value, I admit,
I admit--The Tragic Fall!  Poom!)

But when has my tongue itched so with the cliche, "Get real!"?

(oh god tell me it's not Them that's real.)

 Strauss & Howe's theories can clearly be tested against statistics
as quantifiable as that. For example, opinion polls that measure
how protective U.S. adults feel about children should, if Strauss &

 I'll do that after you show that all of those millions of species

If they have done such research--and to be statistically valid,
announced publicly the research they intended to do before they
actually did it--then putting those numbers somewhere on their
Web site can only strengthen their theories, and they have no
reason no to do so.  That's what Web sites are for--there are
no constraints on book size, audience level, marketing needs.
Since only those who go looking will find it, there's no reason
not to put up /everything/ that might help your case.

Their web site contains not one piece of verifiable information.
If they want to put it there, I'll go back and look at it.

Freshly-constructed algorithms, with absolutely no programmed goals
other than existence, based on the underlying mechanisms of duplication,
mutation, and selection that we can observe today, exhibit the
phenomenon of adaptation in quite remarkable and unexpected ways.
This is not post-hoc, since the phenomenon emerged from something that
was not programmed to produce it, and the few simple instructions the
programs were given are directly obsevable, not postulated.  It is a
waste of my time to repeat the whole case against the absolute idiocy
of creationism; Dawkins _Blind Watchmaker_ and a dozen other sources
do that quite competently.  But I point this out to specifically
counter the question you asked.

You mistinterpret my claim.  To be precise, it is (1) Evolution is
quantitative, testable, and falsifiable.  (2) Not one single fossil
falsifies it.  I did not claim that (3) every fossil /confirms/ it, 
or (4) that we understand how every feature of every species came
about.  Nor do I, or does evolution, claim that (5) every feature of
every species is an adaptation.  That's nonsense; any engineer knows
that mamy features of even the most carefully designed systems are
historical accidents.

Creationism, as you correctly point out, passes test (2), but then
so does every other theory.  That's why you need to add (1) for a
theory to be meaningful, otherwise it's not even a valid hypothesis.
You can attack (3) through (5) all you like.

This is a compelling image, but I don't quite understand how this could wipe
out.  Gamma-ray bursts are very brief events and planets are excellent
gamma-ray shields.  The burst would sterilize half the planet but the other
half would be unaffected.  This is far less damage than the end-Cretaceous
meteor strike, which killed all large animal species on the planet.  I
suppose ther could be atmospheric effects from decomposing tissue, but
offhand this seems like it wouldn't be enough.

It was a moth. Its wings got caught tween some relay contacts. I've seen
the photo - the moth was taped into the logbook. There is a Journal of
the History of Computing published by the ACM, it's in there in one of
the early issues (first 4 or 5 years)...

There are numerous utilities which perform a true deletion by
overwriting the area released by the file deletion. Norton Utilities for
one. Many others can be found in the Simtel archives under Disk
Utilities and File Utilities for the platform of your choice.

Some time ago I noticed my Netscape Gold also doesn't really delete
Email even if you empty the "Trash" folder. And, the Inbox file also
just gets larger and larger. Well, I have a simple fix for this. The
trick is to ensure that the "Mozilla" entry goes away too (just deleting
the files reinstates the Mozilla, which gets old after a while). If
anyone wants the details I will post the .BAT files here. (Sorry, I use
DOS and Win 3.1 here...)

1. Gimbal mount tiny (1mm) fans in a flexible array. Should be do-able
by methods currently in use to make tiny silicon gears and the like.

2. Nanotechnology. Nanosystems states that electrostatic motors can

Some difficulties here:

1. Time seems to be a macroscopic idea, ultimately based on storing
memory or events in a sequential order. It is difficult to imagine a
reversed time device capable of accumulating information.

1a. Though time is a very useful idea in physics, it can be seen in
terms of how to organize events in the form of information. Time as we
know it may not exist. 

2. Acquiring and processing the energy required for 1) is also hard to
imagine.

3. Just as many possible futures evolve from the now, so do many
possible pasts converge.

Sirs:

Our agents among the mortal herd have brought to Our attention
your recent product entitled Windows '95. Therefore We now give
you statutory notice of intent of proceedings to be taken against 
Microsoft by the Many-Angled Ones.

With this suit We will show that Windows '95, and to a lesser
extent all of the Microsoft range of products, infringe upon the 
recognised "look-and-feel" of the Elder Gods, for the following 
reasons:

o   Windows '95 is a crawling abomination from the darkest
pits of Hell;

o   No man can be in its presence for too long without being
driven into gibbering insanity;

Ahh but can you customize precisely the programming you'd like to recieve
on your television or choose from many unofficial sources of programming?
How about create a user profile like firefly or my-yahoo to use collective
intelligence so that the profile learns what you like and fits the
information specifically to your liking and enjoyment. This sort of
technology could inspire quite a number of people. Imagine the sort of
individuality that will grow and blossom out of having a profile created
exactly to your liking and changing as you change. Anonymities will also
allow the growth of individuality which will bleed out into everyday life.
No ones going to browse the web for hours on end looking for news with
search tools. Mass media may recognize push technology as slow television
but the truth is, everyone will be able to broadcast push technology just
like this mailinglist was pushed into your inbox. Microsoft is designing a
batch of HTML tags specifically so that everyone can generate push-media.
See the false image of push-media being like television will cause
advertisers to pour onto the scene and along with them, $$. Push-Technology
isn't a replacement for the web, it only serves as a front door to it. It's
merely a way to deliver your favorite websites and all their content
directly to your PC automatically saving you all the time of net congestion
or overly busy websites. This is NOT an end to personal choice and very
very far away from simple channel flipping. No, no. This stuff 'learns' all
your interests and even suggests new information. You can follow links on
incoming pushed information to take you anywhere that may cause you to have
new interests which you can also subscribe to have pushed to you which
alters your profile and continues the perpetual cycle. The future of your
identity will no longer be your social security # or DNA, your personality
is the only thing that is 'you'. Profiles will be infinately important as
well as brainwaves. Get ready for profile-based dating systems, book
recommendations, music recommendations, etc. The future is SMART.

That's partly because these philosophies, etc. have already defined by
myriad other cultural devices. So interpretation of their artwork is
necessarily tempered: as I said, art is a discourse based upon existent
information. (Yet, ask someone to describe Jesus and they'll come up with a
bearded young bloke - essentially a representation of Zeus, with a little
Alexander the Great thrown in: and this is simply because of early
Christian artwork. For that matter: God's this old bloke with a white
beard. And yes, _you_ may question this, but others would not: that's
because art is a discourse between work and particular observer.)
  
>To make artists definers or cheerleaders...

Nobody makes them such. They _are_ such because they are presenting
Extropianism to and audience with no, or minimal, prior information. They
don't need to have authority vested upon them. If I created art-work
showing graphic and cruel vivisection, called myself an Extropian artist
and displayed all over Britain, how many people would question my view
vocally and publicly enough to undermine the imagery placed in the minds of
those who attended the shows? Even if Max et al. publicly denounced me I
suspect the image of Extropianism in this country would take years to recover.

>...our [artists, I assume] role involves the challenging of assumptions
and >the exploration of new avenues of thought.

A piece of artwork cannot challenge generic 'assumptions'. It can only
challenge the particular assumptions of its audience. Very few people have
any assumptions at all about Extropianism, so artwork has the ability to
create, rather than challenge, any assumptions about Extropy. Another
example: if I paint a series of pictures showing Max wearing flowing robes,
in front of a cross, preaching to people, then how many people do you think
will not consider Extropianism some wacky cult. (To avoid argument the
paintings would bear the legend 'Saint Max - Extropian leader' in an halo
around his head.) Of course, some people, not brought up within Western
Christendom, may not see the imagery, but that's my point exactly.)

Yes, I was thinking of something like this a few days ago; essentially it
would become an anonymous remailer for Web pages. The system I was
thinking of was something like: 

    Browser sends URL to proxy; this is encrypted with the public
	key of the proxy.
    Proxy decrypts URL and fetches the appropriate page. This page is
	also encrypted with the public key of the proxy, which decrypts
	it and passes it back to the browser.

This serves two functions; firstly, even if someone finds your web page at
the real host it will be encrypted so that only the proxy can read it.
This means that if the Feds ask you to decrypt the page *you can't*. You
would need the private keys of all the proxies in the chain to decrypt it
(of course, you'd need to keep a plaintext copy in case one of the proxies
goes down or changes the key). 

Secondly, a proxy which works in this way can be chained just like a
remailer. The encrypted URL can contain another encrypted URL to be sent
to the next proxy in the chain. Using five or six proxies should
complicate traffic analysis enough to keep your page hidden if the traffic
levels are high enough. 

Most likely you'd want the equivalent of a Web 'nymserver', such that you
could create a URL like 'http://www.nymserver/cool-illegal-page.html' and
the nymserver would read the full encrypted URL from a database. This
would also allow you to mirror pages easily, and could be used as a
justification for the site. You could sell it as a server allowing people 
to move their pages around but keep a fixed URL, and the 'remailed' URLs 
would just be a special case.

I think the situation is not entirely clear-cut. We certainly have
hardwired emotional systems, and some of them are very simple (note that 
we may have preconditioned fear responses to certain animals or things; 
most fobias are directed against insects or snakes, not cars or mousepads). 

Essentially emotions seems to be based on level of arousal (purely
physiological), and a quality which determines what kind of emotion it is
(hate and love might be high-arousal emotions, but differ in quality).
Most likely the basic qualities are hard-wired (I don't know if there are
any humans with unique emotions, there are no evidence for them). This
quality can in turn be interpreted by the rest of the mind in a variety of
ways, creating a bewildering array of emotions: they can be mixed into
ambivalent states, they can be reappraised, various mental tricks are
regularly used by us to turn one emotion into another and emotions are
analysed cognitively. It is at this level where individual variation and
personality becomes truly important, and I think it can be reprogrammed
quite a bit.

Interesting. The question is how to 1) make it target the cancer cells 
(the common cold virus doesn't care for (say) glial cells, so the carrier 
would not look for a glioma), 2) how to get it to infect all of them 
(otherwise the survivors would continue dividing, although the immune 
system would now be more likely to look for them if the others were 
dying) and 3) how to avoid making the changed cold virus spread (I'm not 
sure it would be healthy to have such a virus around, mutations happen 
all the time).

Develop a way of perceiving the world that makes sense to you; people who
feel connected to the world (be it through religion, marxism,
transhumanism or plain emotion) live longer and healthier than people who
feel disconnected from it.

Well i have an idea on how to use this kind of technology for something
usefull and legal.

It would be perfect way to fight back on organised crime. The mob in the
US. Here in Denmark it is generally recognized that a very well known biker
gang controls the drug traffic. Currently we are in the middle of a War
between the two leading bikergangs. Being fought with submachine guns and
anti panser rocket. (Even aginst jailed members.)

Most people don't dare to wittnes against these gangs. For the same reason
i don't think anybody would be very willing to put anti-crime gang info on
their private homepages.

It could be nice to have a website perhaps with a list of all the crimes
that these gangs have committed, just to remind us. Also other kind of
information like reports on people they have hurt, but who hasn't dared to
report the incidents, could be on the server.

I'm pretty shure theres a lot of information that can be put on the web to
inform against organised crime, and expose these people.

One thing that seems to be skipped over in time travel stories is that
presumably you'd have to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics from
your point of view. So if you went back in time with knowledge of the
future you'd have to introduce new entropy to the system so that the
entropy change was still positive (presumably when summed over all
possible outcomes). This would imply that going back in time to kill your
grandfather would require a massive amount of energy.

I'd suspect the answer is bandwidth... the aural nerves are probably
kilobaud links whereas the optic nerve is probably megabaud. Ok, they're
probably analogue rather than digital, but that should still give some
idea of the difference. 

Have you heard of the experiments which ignored the retina entirely and
instead used a grid of pins on the back to 'display' the output from a
camera mounted on the side of the head? According to Dennett in
'Consciousness Explained' blind people could soon learn to 'see' the
pressure from the pins as a low-resolution monochrome image.

Unfortunately (because as a frequent flyer I'd prefer to believe that some
idiot in the Navy shot it down than that 747s sometimes just blow up for
no good reason) I have to agree with Hal. Looking at the images on their
Web site the two circled dots clearly come very close to each other, and if
one were TWA800 I'd probably accept the missile theory. However, the dot
marked as TWA800 never seems to come within a couple of miles of the
supposed missile. Or perhaps that should be "the dot which appears to be 
marked as TWA800," since the number is hard to read.

OTOH, given the FBI's massive over-reaction I wonder if I've missed
something... One question I have is whether a modern traffic control radar
could actually pick up an anti-aircraft missile? I was under the 
impression that they now rely more on the aircraft's transponder replying
when painted by the radar than on the returns from the radar itself.

It's not the gamma ray burst that would do it.  The gammas wouldn't
even reach the ground; air itself is sufficient shield.

What *would* do it is the relativistic particles that are expelled 
from the collision.  These are thought to be the source of the gamma
burst (by folks building models of bursters at cosmic distances.)  
These particles would carry much more energy than the gammas,
and would arrive over a period of centuries (since the particles 
would not travel in straight lines, due to interstellar magnetic 
fields.)  They would induce radioactivity in the atmosphere and
produce secondary particles that would reach the ground.

As an expressive vehicle the artist acts as the barometer of an era. The
artist defines the personality and psychological condition of that which
the artist represents. The artist is the emotive aspect underlying and
outwardly representing any society or institituition. The artist
amplifies and accentuates the qualities of an organization while
revealing that organization's affectual ramifications. The statement of
an artist is first and formost a statement of condition, a state of
mind, a status of society. It is the testemonial of an organization's
member. 


Encountering an alien organization, we would first attempt to gage their
technology, the potential threat of the encounter. But its through their
collective art that we will be able to percieve their intentions. Its
through their art that we will be able to see what kind of people they
are. Art is the professor of truth in that it cannot be shackled. It is
what it is. It reveals the fixations, pleasures, motivations, and
general concerns of that which it represents. The aesthetic runs through
and directs the technology. Technology exists for the sake of art ...
that which pleases us. We create the technology because our
pscychological [creative] condition necessitates it, and then the art
reveals the condition itself.


Thus [objectively] the importance of the artist is the artist's 
revalatory capacity. The importance of a society's art is that arts
revealing of its society.


We create a system, and as members of that system we generate art, and
if that art shows problematic signs of neurosis, then we can and should
rethink the system. This is how the artist truely questions and further
aids to define that which is represented. 


Art is the ergonomics of technology. It is how the technology "fits" the
people. It is an ecquisitely insightful reflection of the people.  

Subjectively: Art is the manifestation of our pleasures.
Objectively: Art is the status of our condition.

Art can only aid in the self-definition of an organization to the degree
in which that organization is sufficiently aware of art's reflexive
capacity. To the degree that an organization uses art reflectively, to
that degree will art define the organization.


Thus, what role should art play in Extropian thought?

Subjectively: It should take full advantage of cutting edge technologies
to manifest our refined pleasures, which includes the expression and
transmittance of Extropic memes, a certain pleasure, while seeding
interest in the development of new technologies which will further
enable the manifestation of our progressively evolving pleasures.   

Objectively: It should be persistently analysed in order to access and
refine the psychological condition and ramifications of the
organization. [This is the responsibility factor; self-evaluation.]

The latter [objective] use of art should be expected from any
individual, organization, nation, or society. Its merely a refined sense
of self-awareness.

One last quick statement on censorship. Censorship is a denial of
problematic symptoms. Censorship itself is a symptom of an organization
or society which is unwilling to take responsibility for that which it
manifests. Censorship may put a bandage over art, but the "pimples" will
continue to emerge and inflame until the organization accepts its
responsibility in initiating that which is the cause of the art, and
thus when that organization seeks something greater than a topical
solution. The alternative to censorship is acceptance of responsibility,
and re-assessment of idealogy.

Art which tests the limits of our experience, tests and redefines the
limits of our existence.

Though, of course, exactly what is revealed is just as much, if not more,

What push media also creates is an end to serendipity. We won't be able just
to happen upon something. Furthermore, just learning for the sake of
learning cannot exist in a push based system. I think you're confusing
intelligent agents, which are a tool, with push media, which is a medium.
It's like saying that your remote control is the same as tv programming. TV
is the medium, your remote is the tool.

The same is true of looking at a sample of something through a
microscope. Exactly what is revealed to the scientist peeking at the
sample "is just as much, if not more, dependent on the observer." What
makes the scientist better capable of making useful observations is his
education.

That is why we have professionally trained psychologists and
psychiatrists, people who have rigorously developed specialized skills
in analyzing subtle symptoms. Via their education, these people tend to
be, by degree, less likely to respond subjectively, and more likely to
respond objectively. From large sums of learned data, these
professionals can make beneficial associations between symptoms and
neurosis. These professionals have developed a greater sensitivity to
ascertaing the condition of another entity.  

How we percieve art necessarily entails how we interpret it. Normally we
percieve art subjectively, indulging in it, and thus we interpret it in
a wholly different fashion than a person seeking to analyse that work
objectively, simply recording the symptoms that they have learned to
identify in order that those symptoms may be assessed in retrospect of
past tests and experiments showing certain corrollations between certain
symptoms and certain neurosis. 

Thus I believe the interpretation of what is revealed is potentially
much less subjective, and much more scientific than your response may be
implying.

Simply put, some people are more qualified than others. 

I believe a number of artists find comfort in the idea of art's elusive
subjectivity while they promote art's continued mystification. Artists
of this type are often unable and/or unwilling to express their feelings
directly to another, and thus, necessitated to express themselves in
some fashion, they choose art believing that their true identity will be
somehow veiled through their art. In this sense art is sacred to them.
But the science of objectivity has a thing with spoiling sacred ground,
and science can better learn to objectively interpret what the artist is
expressing, unbeknowst to the artist, and in many cases, more
affectively than the artist him or herself. For the artist, though
having a skill in creating expressive work, may have little education or
concern in interpreting all the depths of what that art may corrollate
to. 

Cheers!

(rewritten last sentence "does.")

Just as in science, one would like to be known as an authentic and reliable

sees his work as art.

I think that Gregory Houston responded to Sarah's post with great skill and
erudition.  

Also, some of Sarah's questions are answered, briefly yet cogently, in the
Transhumanist and Extropic Art FAQ which can be read at my URL. Here I have
stated by degrees how art can be considered extropic by the creative author
as well as the audience.  

Further, (and just a brief backtrack) Johnny had a problem with silicon and
I think that has been dealt with quite efficiently. We learned that there is
a difference between silicon and silicone, etc-;  I wouldn't say the
suggestion was inept: it was not appropriate for flexible skin, but was
appropriate for a stiff armour.  

In discussions with my brothers (a plastic reconstructive surgeon and a
internal medicine expert), I have been advised by their research of the
development of and future interest in designing synthetic skins, where
polymers are used.

Now, to add to Gregory Houston's response, and to answer questions about the
intent, articulation (rhetoric) of an artist (and this includes
cross-disciplines), the following phrases I wrote define extropic art:

Extropic art is produced by:

"coalescing imagination and reason, challenging all limits."

*Reason* is paramount.

With the direction of:

"...exploring how current and future technologies affect our senses, our
cognition and our lives.  Our attention to and comprehension of these
relationships become fields of art as we participate in the most immediate
and vital issues for transhumanity ..."

Paying attention to what sciences and technologies will help us to achieve
our transhuman goals. Our comprehension means our *knowledge.*  

And, 

"...utilizing high-end creativity, engineering skills, scientific data, and
automated tools to author ..."

This sums up the former:  Using creativity and reason while paying attention
to and developing a knowledge of the science and technology that will help
us to achieve our transhuman goals.

Also:

"We have no interest in focusing on self-defeating thinking or entropy."

How we develop ideas determines the integrity of our work.

Now, with the above information as the starting point for creative work,
there is a continuous balance, just as there is in life and with every
decision that we make, whether *art* or not.  Placing a censorship on art is
like placing a censorship on life and your own values.  Are you not the
judge of what you deem to best represent you and your actions?  Just as in
science, one would like to be known as an authentic and reliable source of
knowledge, an artist down the same, especially a scientist who sees his work
as art.  (State of the art?)

There are many extropian voices:

Dr. Ralph Merkle is a voice for his views about extreme life extension, he
is also an extropian. Yet, some extropians are not cryonicists.  Dr. Roy
Walford acts as a voice for low-caloric intake. Some extropians are not
slender, but Roy is an extropian. Hans Morovec is an extropian and also acts
as a voice for robotics. Some extropians think his work is science fiction,
rather than fact.  Minksy is an extropian. He is the "father" of AI, not
neural networks.

Extropic Artists act as a voice for their own individual extropic
creativity. (Extropy has been defined by Max More.)

You would not be an Extropic Artist unless the work was produced to provoke
an extropic view of such vivisection. 

There are many people who make false claims about who they are, from art to
politics to science.

According to the defection of Extropic Art, the art is extropic.  Basic.

And, thus, a reason for words.  

This point is interesting, but doesn't hold because extropianism is not a
stand-alone.  One venue does not have a monopoly on extropian ideas. Nor
will it.  Simultaneously, books are written about extropy, articles about

On Fri, 14 Mar 1997, David Musick wrote a very succinct and useful guide 
to self-augmentation. We need more practical stuff like this!

My personal tip for health improvement: stop using elevators and use the
stairs instead unless you need to climb more than X stairs (In my case X=4
or so). Cheap, daily exercise.

Yes, but not significantly harder. We already have quite elaborate 
cellular models, and given the technology needed for an uploading 
scan we can certainly learn enough about the neural trickery.

Do you really mean "defection?" If you use this word again, be very careful
you don't accidentally insert an "a" between the "c" and the "t".
Just joking! :-)
I think your work is very good really, majestic and enobling.

All such utilities are snake oil.  To rely on them is worse than
having none at all, because they give you the illusion of security.

This is a good point, especially technological aspect of transhumanism.

This is similar to what I was visualizing. A problem might be that
augmentations as internal, rather than external.  Also, a transhuman might
want to exhibit various augmentations so that they can be seen, as the
devices can be stylish as well as functional.  I'm not pleased with many
designs I have seen, although they might be graphically pleasing they are
hyped. Again, here is the balance between reasonable possibilities and
mystique - to put a damper on "poetic license."

I love it!  I'll make a serious offer to anyone who is more adept at
getting venture capital than I: I have the hardware, software, and
expertise to set up such a server right now.  What I don't have is the
$300-$500/month it would probably cost for the bandwidth, or the skills
to market and sell the service.  I would be happy to donate my own time
to set it up, and I would run it cheaply, and I would be quite willing
to go to jail for obstruction before I revealed any of its encrypted
information, and would sign a contract to that effect (the jurisdiction
of which would have to be the Caymans or something).

No!  No!  Don't do that.  You're forgetting about us lurkers, and making
the same mistake as some of those who argued against my earlier thread
on the value of rudeness: you are assuming that the purpose of argument
is to sway one's opponent.  That may be one goal of some arguments, but
the /purpose/ of argument is to clarify the truth for one's own benefit,
and in a public forum like this, for everyone's.

Your opponents initial claims were interesting, and I might have been
inclined to investigate them.  Though I generally felt that Duesberg
was a quack, I was not unwilling to listen to argument otherwise.  Your
wonderful job of exposing the case for what it is, and his subsequent
obvious evasion, clarify the issue for me greatly.  Evasion is easy to
recognize when you see it, but crackpots won't resort to it until
someone brings up enough facts to push them to it. 

Your argument has not failed; it has succeeded brilliantly, just not
in the mind of your opponent.  But who cares about him?

Your above statement represents only one definition of art, and it is 
one that I as an artist do not subscribe to.  As an artist I am fully 
responsible for my own visions, and they do not necessarily stem from 
the particular society that I live in, and to accept those types of 
boundaries would prevent me from exploring the transhumanist ideas I 
am interested in.  Moreover, I do not accept transhumanism itself as 
a criterion for what I write--rather, my transhumanist orientation 
frees my mind from barriers imposed by other ideologies.  To that 
extent, I consider myself a writer who happens to be transhumanist.

Natasha's comments in her post have highlighted my own discomfort 
with signing onto any art movement.  If she chooses to utilize her 
artistic skills to further Extropianism, that is certainly a worthy 
goal and one that I support.  But I could never accept such a close 
association between my personal philosophy and my art.  My own 
family history, one marked by escape from various repressive 
homelands, serves as a constant reminder to be vigilent, even against 
my own internal tendencies to impose an ideology.  

I know that my comments are not as erudite as Sarah's or George's, 
but mine come from the center of passion that produces the actual art 
in question, and I would hope that they would be considered in that 
light.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

They use a very simple technique. A syringe directly into the tumor (thats
probably why it has been so effective against known tumors. And why they
are in doubt if they can make it work on cancer that has spread.) They will
start testing in Germany on Humans with cancer in the large intestine colon
that has spread to the liver.

They do that by using several injections in the tumors.

3) how to avoid making the changed cold virus spread (I'm not

As far as popular media reports it's two genes that they can change in the
cancer cells. One is to make the cell stop dividing, the other is to make
the cell kill itself if something is wrong with it (like normal cells do i
guess.) They figure that a few normal cells will be killed to. But it's
over such a short timeframe that it shouldn't matter.

They have found no side effects on the test animals.

        The idea of an uploading scan presupposes that the new matrix one is
uploading into, is at least equal to if not more complex, efficient and faster
than the one you already posses.  My contention, is that the necessary
(nano)technology to create a better matrix than your brain, is much more
advanced than the intermediate technology necessary to augment or re-engineer
you pre-existing one.
In other words, unless you wait a considerable amount of time to take advantage
of nano-tech brain-augmenting capabilities you wont need to upload yourself.
Instead, you will enjoy the remarkable re-engineering of your brain/body as
bioengineering and nanotechnology continue to improve in capability and
effectiveness.

For the most part I also found Greg's post accurate. However, I do take
exception to his statement about observers analysing a work of art, that
"some are more qualified than others". With such subjective desciplines
as art, "expertise" is a chimera, and quite susceptible to corruption by
the so called expert's subjective feelings, which can be quite damaging
to progress if too much weight is given to the opinions of "experts". I
give as an example the ongoing literary scandals in AUstralia, where
anglo-saxon writers write under pseudonyms that are of aborigninal or
other ethic descent in order to get published, as well as the scandal
that destroyed the _Angry Penguins_, a modernist poetry rag down under.

After seeing the whole debate, I'd like to throw another bomb on the
fire by stating that I have a freind up here in NH who owns a company
that produces flexible circuit boards. While they are not chips, when I
visualized Natasha's first description, I imagined a black body suit
with metallic circuitry embedded in the suit, to help with augmentation
devices.

Even the PGP overwriting?  I can't remember what it said, but it claims
to be efficient at this.  I mean, not like I expect the Feds to come
running in and doing a search on my hard-drive, so I would assume it
would keep most people out of it, correct?  I suppose, though, if they
can revive a hard drive that's been tossed in a deep river, and regain
most of the data on it, then they should be able to recover the wiped
data, eh?  So, how the hell do you get rid of the data?  Smash the hard
drive?  Burn it?  Is anyone aware of the efficiency of the PGP wipe
compared to other commercial software?

This is a really good point.  What I like especially about Extropic Art is
that it is open-ended and not imposing.  (Although flaunting entropy under
the guise of extropy would be an imposition, to be sure.)

Subject: A non-destructive brain scan for uploading?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

A few years ago I read about a technique for seeing through opaque objects 
with optical LASER pulses of astronomical intensity but modest  energy, 
I remember seeing a picture of a newspaper taken through several inches of 
milk, you could still read it. I wonder if a device working on a similar 
principle could be used to obtain enough information from a non-destructive 
brain scan to upload a mind. 

When most photons that make up an image enter milk they are refracted off the 
many fat globules in solution, if any photons come out the other side of the 
milk container they have been bounced around so much that the information on 
where they originated is hopelessly scrambled, all you would see is a diffuse 
glow, not an image. However, a few very lucky photons, perhaps  one in a 
billion trillion, perhaps less, can make it through the milk without 
interacting with anything. Because these rare photons don't get bounced 
around but take a shorter direct path, they are the first photons to emerge 
from the milk. If you only looked at those early photons and ignored the much
more numerous later ones, you could see an image and not just a general glow.

I don't remember the researcher's name or the exact specifications of his 
LASER, but I do know that intensities as high as 10^18 watts per square 
centimeter and pulses as short as 10-14 seconds have been achieved with table 
top LASERS. You'd want to squeeze every bit of information out of the rare 
photons that make up the image, so just recording their amplitude, as in
photography, would not be good enough, you'd want to know their phase too, 
and that means Holography. As a bonus, you wouldn't have to worry about depth 
of field focusing problems, and the reference beam for the Hologram could act 
as a super fast camera shutter, use a different frequency for the reference 
beam pulse and put in a filter for the original frequency.

10^14 seconds might be too long for a safe brain scan at the enormous 
intensities required, and light can travel about a tenth of a millimeter in 
that time, but I'll bet a soft X ray LASER could be built with a lot shorter 
pulse than that, I just hope it can be made short enough that the brain is 
not vaporized.  Anyway it's just a thought.

OK, this makes sense.

Is a relatively (pardon the pun) nearby, but beyond the lethal radius (say
2000 light-years) neutron star binary collapse a plausible cause for mass
extinctions?  

I would think that if such events are truly as common as this, the prognosis
for long-term space colonization is poor.  It would be very hard for a
space-based civilization to sustain hundreds of years of hard radiation at
such intensity that an atmosphere is insufficient shield.  Even planetary
based nanotech using civilizations would be very strained by such events.

Yes, such programs would protect you from nosy neighbors and

Well, I see some limitations to this, some of which are a bit subtle. I
have thousands of interests, and a profiler is limited to what I tell
it. It may do well with the interests which I express a lot, but I
cannot hope for it to detect my lesser interests. Another limitation is
that there are *always* implicit assumptions in such systems, based on
its design and the bias of its programmers. Would I really trust
Microsoft to build a profile which truly represents my values? I think
not. Since it seems that push technology is a blatantly commercial
aspect of the Net, I expect there will be many hidden biases in the PTs
which I use. And there's always the privacy issue. Finally, if I am
inundated with PT selections I will likely spend less of my time
browsing at random, effectively reducing my scope in the direction of
the PT content.

After Push Technology - Shove Technology :-)

I regard sweeping claims about the nature of "Extropic art" with bemusement.
 Would anyone speak so broadly about "Extropian writing"?  Art, like its
proper subset writing, has no particular purpose beyond expressing ideas.  I
doubt that anyone would seriously assert that Extropian writing must, for
example, define Extropianism in the public eye, or challenge human limits.
 As our discussions on this list demonstrate, Extropian writings may merely
aim to amuse, or explain a point clearly, or refer to a useful resource.  So,
too, I'd think, Extropian art.

T.0.M.

The technology required to record the types and positions of the
molecules in an
object is likely to be much simpler that that required to use said data
to build
a duplicate object. And the duplicator will be simpler than an
editor/repair
device. As a cryonicist I expect I will have to wait for the latter. As
an analogy, think of the fact that duplicating a disk is simpler than
writing the software.

We are talking about two different things here: hard drive encryption, or 
repeated overwriting to reduce residual magnetisation. Both breaking 
long-key PGP, and scanning the (say, deep-formatted) drive are costly 
undertakings, not to be applied to a random miscreant. So, unless you are

I'd like to see image filter plug-ins applied as effects to tile 
backgrounds in realtime.

Can this be done with Java?

Does anyone know of an off-the-shelf library of functions for 
animating tile backgrounds, particularly in real time?

For example, see

   http://define.com/5.html

On this page, I used the "Ripple" plug-in.  I'd like to run the 
plug-in from a web-browser, and modulate the background tile waves in 
real time.

Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick is fairly well-known to Extropians
through his books "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" (1974) (which Nozick has
since repudiated), "Philosophical Explanations" (1981), "The Examined Life:
 Philosophical Meditations" (1989), and "The Nature of Rationality" (1993).
 I thought about doing a review of "Rationality" at one time, but just
couldn't bring myself to do it, I couldn't take the book seriously enough. 
It was filled with politically correct sops to the scientific left, it was
organized incoherently, and it tried to illegitimately slip in something
called "symbolic utility" into rational decision models.  Nozick is a good
list maker, something he did a good bit of in "Rationality", "Examined
Life", and "Explanations", but not much of a thinker.  Harvard has fallen
on hard times in its philosophy department, Nozick is no Santayana.

Anyway, Roger Kimball has written an essay about an Australian philosopher,
entitled "Who Was David Stove?" in "The New Criterion" March 1997, who
analytically ripped Nozick to pieces.  I like this guy, Kimball says of
him, "Whatever the subject, he finds the tenderest spot of the most
sensitive nerve; then he presses."

>From David Stove's review of "Philosophical Explanations":

  "An unprecedented expansion of communism took place immediately after the
second world war.  For the next twenty-odd years, any possibility of
resistance to communist expansion depended almost entirely upon America: 
no other country possessed both the requisite military capacity and the
willingness to use it.  But the outcome of the Vietnam war showed that,
while America's capacity for such resistance remained intact, her
willingness did not.  For that war was lost, not through defeat of American
armies in the field, nor yet through treachery among them, but through a
massive sedition at home.  The nation showed that it had become utterly
opposed to any further armed resistance to communism."

An excellent summary of exactly what happened.  The "massive sedition" was,
of course, what is sometimes referred to as "memetic engineering," fomented
by the Soviets through a well-funded disinformation campaign taking root
amongst the always left-leaning Western intellectuals and media types.  The
KGB archives recently opened up have been a real eye opener into just how
thorough the penetration of our cultural elites was.  The campaign was
helped along by the passive acceptance of scientific nihilism by Western
academia because scientific rationality was the only authority left on the
scene after the Enlightenment destroyed all notion of higher authority.

As a prime example of this seditious memetic engineering still with us
today, Stove examines Nozick's call for a "non-coercive philosophy," which
went so far in the utopian absolutist direction as to replace healthy
'arguments' with sickly 'explanations,' because it would be wrong "to get
someone to believe something whether he wants to believe it or not." 
Sheesh!  Why not just throw yourself in front of a bus and get it over
with?

>From Stove's review again:

  "The completeness of Nozick's composition is remarkable:  he touches
somewhere in the book, however lightly, almost every note of American
decadence.  Gandhi is there.  The necessary deference to feminism is there.
 The necessary reproof to 'racism' is there.  Carlos Castaneda is there,
referred to as though he were a thinker, which he is not....  Drugs of
course are there, and in no unfavorable light:  drugs may have their place,
Nozick thinks, in 'the treatment for philosophical parochialism.'  Has he
left anything out?  Is there anyone in post-Vietnam America who needs to be
placated, whom he has not placated?  This was obviously a worry, and there
is a nervous catch-all reference to 'children's rights, the treatment of
animals, domination and ecological awareness.'"

Ugh, these wussies who slavishly toe the anointed's ideological line do not
have unqualified existence.  Pah!  The pulse may be there, but where's the
cognitive sparkle?

Stove again:

  "...No ideal could be more destructive of human life than the ideal of
non-coerciveness.  [The only way] of producing a non-coercive human being
is to produce an autistic one.  But then, autism is really the conclusion
to which Nozick's conception of philosophy tends, just as it is the
conclusion to which American foreign policy in the same period has tended."

The First Commandment of the therapeutic welfare state is "Don't judge." 
This shares the same culture of death memetic lineage with Nozick's
"non-coercion" absolutist philosophy.  "Don't judge" is an axiom of
barbarism, Nozick's version of "non-coercion" is a philosophy of barbarism.

Miguel de Unamuno, in "Tragic Life", didn't refer to the conclusion of this
philosophy as autism, but his description of the consequences of its
practice amounts to the same thing:

  "The most fruitful ethic is the ethic of mutual imposition.  My endeavor
to impose myself upon another, to be and live in him and by him, to make
him mine, which is the same as making my self his, is what gives... meaning
to... human solidarity.  The individual qua individual, the wretched
individual who lives a prey to the senses and to the instinct of
self-preservation, cares only about preserving himself, and his sole
concern is to keep others from forcing their way into his sphere, to keep
them from disturbing him, from interrupting his idleness; and in return for
their abstention, or for the sake of example, he refrains from forcing
himself upon them, from taking possession of them.  'Do not do unto others
what you would not have them do unto you,' he translates as:  'I do not
interfere with others.  Let them not interfere with me.'  And he shrinks
back, and pines and perishes in this rut of spiritual avarice, in the
slough of the repellent ethic... of each one for himself.  And inasmuch as
each one is not himself alone, he can scarcely live for himself alone. 
Sloth, it is said, is the mother of all vices..., while it professes to
preserve us by economizing our forces, in reality works toward lessening us
and reducing us to nothing.  When spirit is in excess and man feels a
hunger for yet more of it, he pours his own spirit out and spreads it
abroad, and as it pours out it grows by contact with the spirits of others;
when, on the other hand, avarice takes hold, man withdraws into himself,
thinking thus to better preserve himself, and ends by losing everything,
like the man who was endowed with a single talent and buried it so as not
to lose it, only to find himself without it altogether."

This sloth, and this shrinking into oneself that Unamuno refers to, is
Stove's autism.  Nozick's "non-coercion philosophy" is based on the same
twisted translation of the Golden Rule that Unamuno pointed out 76 years
earlier, 'I do not interfere with others.  Let them not interfere with me.'
 The premise is utterly false.  Each individual interferes with other
living entities from the moment of conception onward.  We all continuously
appropriate other entities' space, time, matter and energy without asking
permission.  To not see this can only be accomplished by a wilful studied
ignorance of the unintended consequences of life processes, or
self-delusion.  Such self-delusion is widespread in our compost-modern age,
arising from the false judgment that is the consequence of programs to
coerce consent from unsuspecting populations, as outlined in my "Critique"
in "Extropy" #17.

Back in March of '95, I posted critiques of Sir Karl Popper's alleged key
characteristic of the scientific method, his propositional falsifiability
principle.  The thread was "PHIL: Questioning Popperianism" and the
absolutely fatal criticism of Popper's principle was drawn from Elliott
Sober's "Philosophy of Biology" (1993).  Roger Kimball has written an essay
about an Australian philosopher, entitled "Who Was David Stove?" in "The
New Criterion" March 1997, who analytically ripped Popper and his epigoni
to pieces.

David Stove died in 1994, but has left behind some very interesting, but
little known, books.  Kimball writes mostly about "Popper and After:  Four
Modern Irrationalists" which was originally published in 1982 by Pergamon
Press, but a new edition is being published by Macleay Press retitled as
"Anything Goes:  Origins of the Cult of Scientific Irrationalism".  It
looks like a doozy for all die-hard Popper fans.  Stove also wrote "Cricket
Versus Republicanism" (a collection of very politically incorrect essays
published posthumuously), "Darwinian Fairytales" (also published
posthumuously, Darwinism's absurdities highlighted between the boundaries
of human genetic vs. cultural evolution), "The Plato Cult and Other
Philosophical Essays" (1991) (seven essays attacking philosophical
idealism), "Rationality of Induction" (1986), and "Probability and Hume's
Inductive Skepticism" (1973).

I am quoting Kimball's account of Stove's critique of Popper:

  "The long struggle of empiricism since Bacon had yielded a
straightforward but powerful conception of science.  Scientific
propositions were distinguished from speculative or pseudo-scientific
propositions by the degree to which they were verifiable; the method of
science was essentially inductive, which means that it moved from the
observed or known to the unobserved or unknown; the procedures of science
were marked by caution; its results were held to be certain or at least
highly probable."

Stove's technical specialty within philosophy was induction, Popper's
speciality was deduction.  These two don't mix well, probably something to
do with New Age Harmonic Divergence.

  "Popper stood all this on its head.  In his philosophy of science, we
find the curious thought that falsifiability, not verifiability, is the
distinguishing mark of scientific theories; this means that, for Popper,
one theory is better than another if it is more disprovable than the other.
 Popper was apparently fond of referring to 'the soaring edifice of
science.'  But in fact his philosophy of science robbed that edifice of its
foundation.  Refracted through the lens of Popper's theories, the history
of modern science is transformed from a dazzling string of successes into a
series of 'problems' or 'conjectures and refutations.'  On the traditional
view, scientific knowledge can be said to be *cumulative*:  we know more
now than we did in 1897, more then than in 1697.  Popper's theory, demoting
scientific laws to mere guesses, denies this:  in one of his most famous
phrases, he speaks of science as 'conjectural knowledge,' an oxymoronic gem
that, as Stove remarks, makes as much sense as 'a drawn game which was
won.'"

It gets worse.

  "...Popper's ideas did not only propound an irrationalist view of
science:  they also helped to *license* irrationalism for an entire
generation.  Without the bedrock - or, rather, the sandbank - of Popper's
theories upon which to build, the other philosophers of science Stove
discusses - Imre Lakatos, Thomas Kuhn, and Paul Feyerabend - could never
have developed their own influential permutations of irrationalism.  And
without the example of these and other such gentlemen, the blas
irrationalism that infects the humanities and social sciences today - and,
indeed, that infects our entire 'postmodern' culture - might never have
achieved epidemic proportions.  Kuhn's famous book "The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions" (1962), which in effect denies that there is such a
thing as progress in science, has by itself done incalculable intellectual
damage to innumerable professors looking for excuses to deny the claims of
scientific truth."

Obviously the spread of irrationalism was extremely rapid, because
scientific authority lays claim to a political monopoly on all authority. 
Our Western democratic governments were founded on the notion of
rationality derived from the Enlightenment.  Science is largely government
funded.  Science must maintain its corner on being the sole authority on
what is to be labelled rationality.  If science loses its monopoly on this
authority, the particular form of government that feeds it loses its
authority, jeodarizing science's food supply.  Once a philosopher moves the
herd of state scientists in a different direction, stragglers are cut out
and picked off.  The herd has learned to move right smartly en masse,
survival of the fattest.

  "Irrationalism, to be plausible, must be disguised, and Stove devotes the
first half of his book to a brilliant analysis of the literary devices used
to achieve plausibility.  There are two basic techniques.  The first is to
neutralize what Stove calls 'success words'  words like 'knowledge,'
'discovery,' 'facts,' 'verified,' 'explanation.'  Such words carry an
implication of cognitive achievement.  No philosopher of science can do
without them entirely.  But the simple addition of scare quotes alters
everything:  'Galileo discovers x' means something quite different from
'Galileo "discovers" x.'  The element of ambiguity is essential:  consider
the effect of a sign advertising "fresh" fish.  The same trick can
obviously be used with words of cognitive failure:  'mistake,' 'false,'
'refuted,' etc.  A "refuted" theory is not the same as a refuted theory."

  "The second technique involves deliberately conflating the history or
sociology of science with the logic of science.  Stove focuses especially
on what he calls 'sabotaging logical expressions.'  By embedding a logical
statement in a historical context, one thereby undermines its logical
status while preserving the impression  that a logical claim has been made.
 A simple example is the difference between 'P entails Q' and 'P entails Q
according to most logicians.'  The first is a logical statement; the second
is a historical claim; it is what Stove calls a 'ghost logical statement': 
it poaches on the prestige of logical entailment without actually making
any logical claim at all:  it is therefore completely immune to criticism
on logical grounds."

Immunity to criticism on logical grounds is a very powerful memetic tool,
as long as the rubes don't see the trick.

  "Stove's analysis of how his authors manage to make their irrationalism
plausible to their readers is a tour de force.  So is his analysis of how
they made irrationalism plausible to themselves.  The key, at least so far
as Popper was concerned, was the challenge to Newtonian physics by
relativity and quantum mechanics.  As Stove points out, this 'changed the
entire climate of philosophy of science,' replacing the nineteenth
century's blissful confidence about the impregnable certainty of science
with a profound skepticism."

Radical skepticism is indistinguishable from nihilism.

  "Stove shows how Popper and his other authors, attempting 'to ensure that
no scientific theory should ever again become the object of over-confident
belief,' overreacted and embraced instead a form of irrationalism whose
philosophical roots go back to Hume.  At bottom, Stove shows, his authors
embrace irrationalism because of 'a certain extreme belief, by which their
minds are dominated, about what is required for one proposition to be a
reason to believe another.'  They all acknowledge that absolute certainty
is impossible; but they assume that only absolute certainty will do as a
warrant for rational belief."

I can't begin to count how many posts have been devoted to quibbling over
"certainty" on this list.  I hope certain individuals are taking this
critique to heart.  ;)

  "They exhibit, in other words, 'a variety of perfectionism.'  It is, of
course, a disappointed perfectionism.  Disappointed perfectionism has also
led to 'the frivolous elevation of 'the critical attitude' into a
categorical imperative.'  The principle result, as Stove notes, has been
'to fortify millions of ignorant graduates and undergraduates in the
belief, to which they are already too firmly wedded by other causes, that
the adversary posture is all, and that intellectual life consists in
'directionless quibble.''

Ha ha!  I like this guy!  If authoritative science proclaims that no
purpose and no meaning are anywhere to be found in the universe, then of
course, intellectual life must, by scientific definition, consist of
'directionless quibble.'  I call this stance 'smug nihilism.'  I wonder how
science itself escapes being 'directionless quibble'?  Could it be that
scientific laws don't apply to scientists themselves?  Why are scientists
so hungry for other people's money all the time if they are really just a
collection of random fluctuations of nothing?

The Australian historian Keith Windschuttle, mentioned recently here by
Damien Broderick, has an essay entitled "The Real Stuff of History" in "The
New Criterion" March 1997.  It is a tonic to see someone champion truth in
history, the fact that only one thing happens at once, regardless of how
many perspectives there are; and champion the incalculable role of the
individual in shaping history, in direct opposition to academic historians'
vogue of attributing history to quasi-deterministic forces out of the
control of individuals.  He is an important voice in the academic
wilderness providing reasoned ammo against the pervasive use of the word
"inevitable" when making prognostications of how the future will unfold.

When it comes to the recent rise of quasi-determinism, which was not
"inevitable," the French, as usual, come in for some heavy blame.  This
rise was not due to some mysterious historical force like class struggle,
or geography, or climate, or genetic factors, or memetic transmission laws,
but due to individuals, who can be named and held responsible for the
messes their ideas have made of our contemporary world.

Windschuttle begins with Fernand Braudel's conceiving of his famous book
"The Mediterranean" (1949) while being held in a German prisoner of war
camp.

  "For the Frenchmen of his generation, this event, coupled with the German
occupation of Paris without a shot being fired, plus the subsequent
collaboration of France with the Nazi regime, was a source of humiliation
and anguish.  The concept that most assisted Braudel to distance himself
from these events was that of the 'longue dure,' the structuralist view of
history.  Over the course of the longue dure, what did a transient event
like the fall of France matter?"

It is interesting to note the French response to cultural humiliation at
the hands of the Germans was to deemphasize the role of the individual in
history, essentially the socialistic response.  When the Germans, on the
other hand, responded to cultural humiliation at the hands of the French
during and after the Sun King's reign, they glorified the individual,
initiating the powerful Romantic movement that still captivated Ayn Rand
many years later.  Back to Windschuttle:

  "In the wake of the war, [English] historians were keen to [modernize
and] bury the last vestiges of the Victorian emphasis on the heroic
individual, especially the chauvinist accounts of imperial heroes like
Clive of India or Gordon of Khartoum that had dominated school textbooks as
late as the 1930s....  Modernization also meant taking on board the work of
the fast-growing field of economic history which had found that politics,
especially in democratic societies, was more a matter of economic
management than had previously been appreciated.  Up to the 1960s,
anthropology and sociology were still intellectually respectable and some
historians felt their own work should be more integrated with these and
other social sciences.  Braudel showed them how all these aims could be
pursued.  One of Braudel's most enthusiastic fan clubs was formed by the
generation of Marxists who came to prominence in the 1960s, especially in
Britain."

No surprise to see English Marxists fall in with quasi-deterministic French
socialists, they're still at it.  Note that Windschuttle correctly points
out that anthropology and sociology have long lost their intellectual
respectability.  The notion of "economic management" being important in the
history of democratic societies was taken to the extreme in "The Sovereign
Individual" (1997) by Rees-Mogg & Davidson.  I guess these fads have to
reach reductio ad absurdum before self-correction can occur.

  "The academic Left of the 1960s... preferred Braudel's insistence on the
irrelevance of individual action.  To [Louis] Althusser, individual men and
women have no part in shaping their world.  They are merely the bearers of
roles that are defined for them by the 'social formation,' little more than
robots programmed by the prevailing capitalist ideology.  'Men do not make
history,' [Braudel] wrote in the final passage of "The Identity of France",
'rather it is history above all that makes men and absolves them of blame.'

Well, isn't that special?  No wonder O.J. can bump his wife off, and the
Menendez brothers can bump their parents off with impunity, heck, they're
just subject to historical or social forces, no blame can stick.  The
connection is crystal clear.

  "In the wake of the failure of the attempted student revolutionary
movement of 1968, and the attendant recall of Charles de Gaulle and
election of Richard Nixon, this kind of historical determinism became a
comfort blanket for the academic Left.  There was no longer any need for a
radical to be politically active since activism could make no difference to
the great determining structures.  All that remained was to study,
theorize, and debate the nature of the structures themselves.  This was an
agenda perfectly suited to the academic world of seminars, conferences,
cafes, and bars, and to the careers, tenure, and promotions that have
focused their minds ever since.  By the 1980s, the tenured radicals had
dropped Marx and Althusser... but retained their structuralist baggage. 
Many looked to alternative gurus, notably the former French Marxists Jean
Baudrillard and Jean Franois Lyotard, who preached postmodernism..."

Truth hurts, and Windschuttle's account here of how our fine educational
system ended up in its current conceptual sewer is very painful.  My tax
dollars are going to universities which are bent on destroying the very
possibility of successfully launching extropic cultures.  Grrr...

Then Windschuttle talks about the writing of history itself, and why recent
historians have taken to simply writing fictional stories embedded with
thinly veiled political ideologies, instead of trying to get their facts
straight and placing us within the individuals living during a given
historical time in a given culture.

  "The Dutch historian Peter Geyl emerged in the postwar academic world as
one of the most widely read commentators on the discipline.  In particular,
his books "Napoleon:  For and Against" (1949) and "Debates with Historians"
(1955) were influential in establishing in the postwar mind the notion that
there could be no final truths in history.  In 1961, Geyl's book on
Napoleon was favorably acknowledged by the English historian E.H. Carr,
author of "What is History?", one of the most influential commentaries on
history writing ever published.  It was a required text in virtually every
course on historical method in the English-speaking academic world for the
next twenty years.  Carr repeats Geyl's argument that history is 'an
unending dialogue between the present and the past.'  Different ages take
different perspectives.  The best we can hope for is a continuous debate. 
While he says that historians should base their writing on facts, the real
stuff of history is not truth but interpretation.  Carr was the author of a
massive ten-volume study of the foundation of the USSR between 1917 and
1929 but, until his death in 1982, had remained a closet Marxist."

The massive Soviet penetration of our history departments, especially in
the departments that churned out history teachers by the bushel, should
come as no surprise to those who remember the communist axiom that those
who would shape the future must control the past.  It is also obvious why
Nietzsche, who wrote from the right, was picked up and sanitized by the
left who have never had a lick of respect for the truth.  Nietzsche asked
for this misbegotten adoption, which would've repulsed him, by being too
clever by a half in pushing Western civilization further into nihilism,
faster, in order for it to discover an antidote to nihilism quickly, by
emphasizing interpretation over truth himself.  "Oh, the tangled webs we
weave..."

But when truth is thrown out the door, as Gregory Houston recently did
here, then lies and propaganda walk in, such as denying the Holocaust ever
took place.

  "One of the consequences of the relativist position is that it cedes some
degree of credibility to anyone with an even vaguely coherent perspective,
no matter how vile it might be.  The consequence of the position that there
can be no absolute truths is that there can be no absolute falsehoods
either, so refutation ('prove the falsehood of') is beyond reach."

All too true, but there is a proper method of history, if the notion of
truth is not thrown out.

  "For every corroboration, there increases in geometric proportion the
probability that this event actually occurred.  Since we live in a finite
world, there comes a point where it is impossible for any scenario to exist
in which the Holocaust did not occur.  Every fact can itself be a
conclusion and every conclusion can itself be a fact in someone else's
explanation."

Windschuttle then dares to skewer the whole premise of multiculturalism,
the notion that all cultures deserve equal consideration.  We wouldn't even
be examining the history of other cultures if it weren't for Western
civilization's interest in them.  Other cultures didn't record their own
history, they saw no reason to.

  "History is an invention of Western culture, dating from ancient Greece
in the fifth century B.C., and since then its practice has been confined
almost entirely to the West.  Yet for all this time, there have been two
traditions of history contesting the field.  One derives from the first
genuine historian, Thucydides.  In the "Oxford Illustrated History of
Christianity" (1990), John McManners has argued that in the implications of
Christian belief there are encouragements to writing history in an austere,
uncommitted fashion, with wide cultural concern:  'Firstly, there was the
conviction that everything men do or think matters intensely and eternally,
as coming under the judgment of God; secondly, there was the concept of a
creator entirely distinct from his creation, ruling the universe by general
laws, whose ways are inscrutable, and who gives men the gift of freedom. 
Hence the obligation to treat seriously and with reverence all men and the
social orders they build, to study everything, to explain without
partisanship, insisting on the logical coherence of all things.'  From the
fall of Rome to the Renaissance, the idea of history was kept alive in the
industry of those many Christian monks whose chronicles of church and state
were imbued with ideals of this kind."

Other cultures did not have such ideals, did not take the individual
seriously.  The notion of the importance of the individual was a Western
idea.

  "Christianity, however, bore an additional dimension that in the last two
centuries has produced a second tradition within history.  Christianity has
held that, while the achievements of man are due to his own will and
intellect, they are also beholden to something other than himself, the
realizing of God's purposes for man.  From this perspective, men are the
vehicles through which history occurs but history has a direction and a
purpose decided by a force beyond man.  This Christian concept of history
also contained the idea of fulfillment.  It is this second Christian
tradition that has formed the basis of those theories of history that
conjure up great impersonal forces and undercurrents which purportedly
determine the destiny of mankind."

This split within Christianity between the two traditions is mirrored in
the split between ascetic Christianity, essentially entropic in nature, and
joyous Christianity, essentially extropic in nature.  The tension between
the rival traditions within Western civilization helped forge the pluralism
and ideal of toleration that underpins notions of liberty, freedom and
capitalism, and is a unique reason why none of those notions arose anywhere
else on earth.

Windschuttle sums up by emphasizing the individual's role in history, an
extropic formulation:

  "Rather than human affairs being impelled by great impersonal forces,
political history reveals our world to be made by men and, instead of being
'absolved of blame,' men are responsible for the consequences of their
actions."

Well, years ago a friend and I came up with a rough design for a
massively-parallel Z80 machine, but never built it. I forget the details,
but AFAIR there seemed to be some way to connect the chips together such
that you could use 'in' and 'out' instructions for inter-processor
communication without any extra hardware. With 20MHz transputers costing
hundreds of dollars each and 4MHz (6MHz?) Z80s at under five dollars this
looked like an interesting alternative for calculations which could be
split into many simple operations. 

I wonder how many Z80s you'd need for a fast DES-cracker? I suspect that
the price/performance would be worse than Pentiums once you include RAM 
and boards.

One of the maxims espoused by Eric Hughes on the cypherpunks list was
this: "all cryptography is economics."  This means that the purpose of
crypto is not to provide absolute security; nothing can do that.  Rather,
the sole purpose is to raise the cost to the opponent of getting the
protected information.

In this context, disk wipe software does indeed raise that cost, since
it prevents the commonly-available undelete programs from working.  it
is far more expensive to pull the disk platter out of its casing and
start examining it with a microscope than to run undelete.  It depends
on the value of your information whether the wipe programs are enough
for you or not.

This sorely mischaracterizes coercion, human life, and autism.  Indeed, the

both literally and figuratively.  Autism, in the sense of folding in on
oneself, follows from contact with a violent world--not a non-coercive one.

Stove's criticism makes the fatal error of confounding coercion with
intellectual debate.  Interestingly, given his apparently conservative take,
he shares this error with many lefties.  See, eg, Stanley Fish.

I disagree. A nanotech-ased civilization would find such an
event a minor hindrance (nanotech repair of biological radiation 
damage would render them highly resistant to radiation.)

The implication of this theory to me is that we should get cracking
building gravity wave detectors (LIGO and successors) that could spot 
closely orbiting neutron stars in nearby space before the final 
collision.

They respond just as subjectively: their subjectivity is merely more

This seems to imply that I made such a claim. And yet the very core of my

sweeping claims cannot be made except as statements of intent on the part
of Extropian artists.

Of course that may be its aim, but that can go wrong. One has only to think
how often comments on this list which are intended as jokes are taken

I didn't raise any specific questions in my post: were you thinking of any
which arise implicitly or by extrapolation?

Also, although the FAQs are very well-written and informative in describing
Transhumanist and Extropian Art, they don't address themselves to the
specific issue raised by my posts. They could be used to allow a
consideration of some of my general points in the more specific area of
these forms of art, but they don't directly confirm or deny my statements.

My point being that observers may not have any of that information, and are
therefore free to create their own interpretations which may be entirely at
odds with that of the artist. This is no big news, nor a criticism of art,
nor a call for censorship: merely, an observation yet to be refuted.

There's something I don't understand about all the excitement over push.
It seems to me that the push concept conflates two relatively independent
ideas: content filtering, and when-available delivery.

Content filtering is what lets you select what you are going to see.
That's what we have now when you do a web search on a topic, or when you
bookmark a web page which serves as an index or entry into a subject of
interest.  This is definately a good thing, but existing technologies leave
a lot to be desired.  I have a hard time finding all the information I want
on the web (but the web is still orders of magnitude better than any other
alternative I have used, primarily libraries).

When-available delivery provides you information as it happens.  This sounds
great for sports scores or the latest business news.  Lots of stuff happening
there.  But it's not clear to me that it applies that well to topics beyond
the most superficial popular subjects.  Most areas that I am interested in
don't have that much progress.  Maybe a new paper gets published every few
weeks or months that is really interesting or important.

What worries me is that it is just going to be TV all over again -
the lowest common denominator.  Those areas which work best with push
are going to be the ones where information dribbles out all the time -
corporate press releases, soap operas, headline news, the stock market
ticker, the same old garbage.  That's not what I go to the web for.
The web is an infinite library, holding all kinds of information.

The real problem is not in getting the information delivered, it is in
finding it.  Once I've found a web page that provides a reasonably complete
overview of a field, with lots of other links to relevant pages, then I
have a good source.  Yes, it would be useful to be notified when the links
change or some new information is provided.  Push does have a place there.
But it's not going to revolutionize my usage of the web, unless the web is
just going to turn into TV.

My consciousness may consist of vaporized atoms.
How would a bunch of vapor called U.Sov. 
control an electronic representation of U.Sov.?
Far be it from me to suggest it can not be done,
I am an optimist,
but I would like to know how it could be done.
Perhaps the vapor could be restructured 
to form the components of the representation
(instantaineous phase modification?).
That seems quite a chaotic idea with technology I know of.
It sure would help if I knew what death was, 
or life either for that matter.

 Wait a second.
I forgot I've seen a baby with only brain stem 
and a child with a hemispherectomy( half a brain ) 
and they seemed normal.
Maybe the brain is not as important as I thought.
Could I still be me without a brain?
Parden me while I get thrown for a loop.

 What am I?
Is there an organ I truly need?
Is there a particle in my body which I can truly not exist without?
Every moment I lose a lepton and I die.
At least I am no longer what I was, 
yet I am alive.
If I instantaneously seperated every system, organ, tissue, or cell in my body 
from each other,
it would take another moment for each to die.
If each was properly taken care of it may continue to live.
I could be in a zillion+ pieces yet none of them would be dead.
Could I do the same with a cell, 
seperate it's parts and keep them stable, 
waiting to be rejoined?

How well do we understand the universe 
when we say some things are alive and some things are not. 
They are mostly made of simliar fundamental particles,
often similar atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, systems, cultures, etc.
One being may have 130 lbs of living cells and be alive.
Another may 1,000 lbs of living cells with no electicity in it's brain, 
so obviously it is dead, 
right?
I'm not so sure.

How far have I come when I do not willingly accept simple answers 
to the most basic question?
What am I?

  U.Sov.

I disagree. First, uploading will not likely start out as a mental
enhancement, rather as at first as an interesting problem in neuroscience
and then as a radical way of saving a dying person (there is a strong
paralell with cryonics). In this case we are not interested at all in 
having a "better" matrix, which would be an invisible level anyway to the 
upload, we need a "good enough" matrix able to run the upload. This could 
presumably be done using a simple nano-CAM slab as Eugene likes to 
propose, or some other massively paralell nanocomputer cluster. Building 
such systems are very likely to be among the first applications of 
nanotechnology (nanocomputers are practically necessary for creating a 
real assembler). 

Being run on a huge pile of Z80s or a quantum dot cellular array would not
make any difference for the upload as long as he or she didn't try to
interact with the outside world (what I would like to call the
"Permutation City Axiom", after Greg Egan's book); what matters is the
user interface - you won't become smarter if your emulated neurons are
emulated in Lisp than in assembler, but if the user interface allows
improved access to information you become effectively smarter. Having fast
hardware is of course desirable, but this is just quantitative improvement
of the basic design. Becoming truly posthuman infomorphs would require
both a good matrix, a great interface to it and other resources and some
remodeling of our minds, a quite complex project. 

Enhancing the brain is not simple (if it was, we would already be doing 
it) and nanotechnology will certainly help, but is no panacea. To be able 
to improve it we need to understand it throughly (the second precondition 
for uploading), at least the relevant parts. Nano-neural interfaces, 
coprocessors and other fun stuff would be very useful, and most likely 
develop in paralell to uploading (I'm sure there will be a field of 
neural nanotechnology, and I plan to work in it) since both need the 
technologies and techniques being developed for the other. They 
complement each other neatly.

 Assuming opinion polls have no costs, then yes, they have no reason
not to do so. I make no claim that they are great researchers, only
that they have an interesting theory which can be confirmed or
falsified.

 Weak versions of evolution (that organisms adapt to their environment)
can certainly be subjected to good statistical tests. I don't see how
the stronger versions (e.g. that such adaptation explains the existence
of the species we see today) can be subjected to statistical tests which
are not post-hoc.

 I understood your claim about evolution perfectly well. What I don't
understand are the standards you are applying to Strauss & Howe's theory,
which are either stricter than those you apply to the theory of evolution
or else are standards which Strauss & Howe's theory can, if correct, pass.
 Of course it's much easier to attack creationism than to address my points.

With all due respect guys, this is going far beyond my original post. I
am merely scenarioing the possibility that someone could use the
security loopholes that are currently in Explorer to allow hackers of
any origin, whether independents or industrial/governmental, to look at
your hard drive, and read the email that you had thought you had
deleted. People do not just delete email for illegal purposes, but for
business and personal purposes as well. How many lawyers or doctors
compromise their patients confidentiality every day unwittingly when
their hospital's email system does not adequately delete confidential
communications that are supposed to remain private? We all know that
employers and insurance companies love to get their hands on such
information, to the detriment of employees and customer premiums every
day.

Given this, what sort of tools could people use to automatically
overwrite deleted email messages, as well as eliminating this "feature"
of explorer that stores deleted messages?

It all depends on what you mean by long term, and how far in space you
plan on colonizing. Considering that we are talking about astronomical
events which happen once every several hundred million years, I would
say that the odds give us a good sized window to get out of harms way. 

That technicium levels in molybdenum deposits indicate the existence of
such gamma ray bursters in our own geological past (supposedly the late
cretaceous), or that our sun was once eight times as bright as it is now
at that point in time (not bloody likely) indicates that this is a
phenomenon that we can outrace given sufficient technology. Once we've
expanded past the limit of possible extinction, then any such
catastrophe thereafter is simply a stumble in our march across the
skies. Once it happens, we've got 100-200 million more years to rebuild
and expand further. Besides this, I expect that technology will allow
the development of sheilding sufficient to protect any "Noah's Ark" type
preserves, possibly in the cores of asteroids or dead moons like our
own. Several hundred miles of solid rock in every direction should be
enough sheilding against anything two neutron stars can cook up from
several hundred light years away.

OK, again. _I_ know Max has defined Extropy, _you_ know Max has defined
Extropy, _everyone on this list_ knows Max has defined Extropy. Potential
observers of Extropic art do not know that. Why should they?

_I_ know that: the observer may not.

Perhaps my example was bad as it suggested a deliberate attempt to subvert

What isn't? If you mean the very few people, I think it is, regrettably,
and through no fault of anybody. Simply try expressing the number of people
who are aware of Extropianism as a percentage of 5 billion. Then do the
same with Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Michael Jackson, etc.

I agree with you entirely, and my entire argument is based on the viewing
of Extropian Art by people who have no other source (or few sources) of
information. That's why I'm suprised my original post has provoked such a
large response: it didn't seem such a controversial thing to say.

How can you say that? Push-technology has only recently entered the scene.
And profiles CAN detect slight variations due to comparing your profile
with other profiles highly similar to you. This will highly increase
individuality because as you're compared against other profiles your slight
interests will deviate even more away from other peoples, spontaneous
orders will naturally cause differences and will cause wide ranges of
individuality. With greater individuality you will lose accuracy though
which will cause people to wander back out onto the web unless something
better comes along such as metaverses (vr worlds) and this will also give
time for AI developers to enhance AI to sort through all the junk on the
net and create good search tools.

Algorithms are just formulas, how can numbers be biased? and Microsoft
doesn't build the profile for you, you do. You just select content off the
web you like and it's delivered to your screen constantly. You'd get the
same thing if you put your browser on a constant refresh where you're
continually downloading the website for the latest info. Third party
providers like my-yahoo or firefly could be plugged into the system to
compare profiles and make suggestions. Profiles may likely become a
standard control panel item.

And commercialization is a bad thing? You can set things up legally so your
profile remains private. Take a look at firefly.

You don't browse at random already, you see a web address somewhere and you
type it in or you use a search tool and find a website. The only time you
browse at random is if you tell a search tool to give you a random link or
you just pick a random word and goto www."randomword".com. There is nearly
no such thing as random surfing. This mailinglist is an example of
push-technology. You like it, you wanted more and the most recent
information so you subscribed. If you nolonger like it anymore you can
unsubscribe. This is exactly what push technology is except you can throw
in commercials too. Take a look at PointCast Network, not the screensaver
just the client. It's just news in web format, scrolling windows, scrolling
tickers, etc. All this stuff can be done with java or activex if needed.
It's nothing new except you can also have this stuff shown as a

theres a webbrowser where when you click on a headline or a video playing

However, there are often numerous pages, as well as others popping up or
dissapearing every now and again. Additionally, there are numerous
subjects one may be interested in, as well as degrees of association.
Several months ago we were talking about intelligent agents that we use
to hunt for webcontent that we are interested in, an agent that can
learn to fine tune its foraging to better reflect our real needs, as
well as evolve as our own tastes change over time. Push technology is
merely the beginning of such agents. 

Rather than looking at push as simply slow TV, think of it as customized
TV. Last month I was lamenting that the channels and shows I liked on
the tube were so spread out that it was a pain in the butt to hunt for
them and keep track of what I want to watch when, so much so that I
often miss things I wanted to see, and see nothing interesting when I
have the time available. Push technology is like a smart VCR. I would
love for the cable company to offer the ability for each customer to put
their ten or twenty favorite channels all in the 1-10 or 1-20 slots, so
you dont have to go skipping through the channel spectrum. This is a
need that is becoming more prevalent as more and more channels are added
to the dial.

Rather than lament this sign of media convergence, we need to recognise
that we are the exceptions, the elites in the new order. Our tastes are
not necessarily the same as the masses. THey are much more used to and
demanding of the practice of being led around by the nose ring. They
typically do not want to have to think about that which is not immediate
to them. Recognising this, we can use this trend to our advantage in our
memetic engineering. Seeing Reilly Jones' excellent commentary of Stove
critiques of irrationality in our intellectual and memetic landscapes, I
am struck by the idea of using push media to push extropic memes into
the mainstream just as irrationalist thinkers did the same in our higher
educational system. 

While it seems paradoxical to propose using entropic methods or media
techniques to spread extropic meme's, we need to recognise that methods
and techniques are not the message, nor are they themselves entropic,
merely that they have been used by entropic forces up to this point in
time. We need to realize that the masses will always demand watered down
versions of "the truth", they can't take 200 proof TRUTH without
overdosing and having an allergic reaction. Diluted doses of any foreign
agent builds up a tolerance over time.

The representation created by the artist is open to interpretation by
observer. Whilst the artist facilitates such interpretation and, in some
cases that interpretation will concur with the artist's intent, the artist
_may_ still remain unable to define a condition definitively, except to
his- or herself.

But since open to interpretation the statement of an artist is a statement
of conditionS, stateS of mind, statusES of society.

'Perceive' is the key here: this would be a perception; an interpretation.

Art is the professor of multiple truths, in that it cannot be shackled by
the artist. It reveals multiple possible fixations, pleasures, motivations
and general concerns through the multitude of things which it may be
interpreted as representing.

>and directs the technology. Technology exists for the sake of art ...

I've never found iron lungs or dialysis machines particularly aesthetically
pleasing. Equally, I'm not convinced that flint tools or spears came in to
use because they looked good: they were pleasing because they got food. Do
you define art as that which pleases us in any way (e.g. by saving our
lives)? 

>We create the technology because our

I agree that art reveals our creative condition. On the other hand, what
demonstrates that this condition causes us to create technology, rather
than merely facilitating such creation, driven by a desire to survive?

>Thus [objectively] the importance of the artist is the artist's

Revalation is not objective. The artist has to reveal to someone (even if
that is the artist her/himself), and that requires subjective observation.

Art may serve just as an important role in shaping the society, as in
revealing it.

I presume your talking about 'art' collectively here: the art of one artist
could just be a result of his/her own neuroses.

As a reflection of people art is only as insightful as those who interpret it.

>Subjectively: Art is the manifestation of our pleasures.
>Objectively: Art is the status of our condition.

You're going to have explain your meanings of subjective and objective
before I make sense of those two statements. But, either way, art is merely
an interpretation of our pleasures, and an interpretation of the status of
our condition (both by artist _and_ observer).

>Art can only aid in the self-definition of an organization to the degree

True. I was more concerned with external, than self-definition. The actual
use of art as a reflector is as much a function of the observer's
interpretation as it is of the artist's intent.

Back to the subject/objective dichotomy. What do you mean by this? Your
definition of a subjective role may be correct, but at most you describe
what Extropic art _should_ aim to do. You can never define what it _does_
do, more than saying the majority of people will interpret a piece in a
certain way (after its display), or that you expect them to so interpret it
(before its display).

Your objective definition seems to propose an 'objective' analyser. But
since this is self-evaluation, how can it be objective? That means all
creators of art would be objective, and yet I'm sure they would disagree
with each other. Unless by self-evaluation you mean evaluation by
'Extropians': but again, such a homogenous interpretation is unlikely,
probably impossible, within such a group.

But my self-awareness is not objective, is it?

>One last quick statement on censorship. Censorship is a denial of

I don't agree. Firstly, you cannot define a symptom as universally
'problematic'. At most you can say that censorship is a denial of syptoms
considered problematic by the censor. But then, how can that be a denial.
It is not a denial of the symptoms at all, merely an action designed to
suppress those symptoms. (It _may_ be a denial of the underlying _causes_
of the symptoms.)

>Censorship itself is a symptom of an organization
>or society which is unwilling to take responsibility for that which it
>manifests.

You're personifying 'organization' and 'society'. In fact, it seems
unlikely that the society or organization would both manifest and censor
the art. If the organization or society has control over censorship one
would have thought it would prevent production. The point is that within an
organization or society there are individuals, and it is difference between
the thoughts and relative powers of these individuals which allows
censorship to occur.

>Censorship may put a bandage over art, but the "pimples" will
>continue to emerge and inflame until the organization accepts its

Surely that which is the cause of the censored art has already been
initiated, even if that cause is stated as a negative. That is to say, even
if the cause is non-performance by the organization, that non-performance
is an initiated cause. The organization (by which _I_ mean those with power
to effect change) may respond to the art, and hence to the cause of the
art; it doesn't initiate that cause.

>and
>thus when that organization seeks something greater than a topical
>solution. The alternative to censorship is acceptance of responsibility,

What if the outcome of such acceptance and responsibility is a decision
that censorship is the best mode of action? (e.g. Making child pornography
illegal, effectively censoring it, doesn't seem such a bad thing to me, and
many others, even when I accept my responsibility and re-assess my ideology.)

Indeed.

Radio telescopes appear to be pretty good at picking these out,
and predicting their collision dates. Space-based VLBI versions shoud 
be even better. 
A set of space-based, 3D LIGOs separated by some millions of kilometers
 might be a cool way to creat a tomographic map of the gravitational 
waves.

It is speculated that half the Earth's biomass consists of single-cell 
organisms living in the crust, to depths of several kilometers.
These critters would survive even nearby events, and might provide seed
stock for the next expansion and evolution of surface life. This kind 
of life might be universal.

There's not just trickier to figure out; there's requiring more data for
storage.  John and Eugene have had their debates on how much data the
brain encodes; the article seems to be evidence for Eugene's position.
And it may argue against Drexler's extreme miniturization ideas; the
brain could be less shrinkable.

Sarah made three statements; which isn't accurate?  I know very few
people who have even heard of Extropianism.  If I give a short
description they assume it's a fringe group of nuts.  I tried that
experiment once.

I still doubt the mass viability of Extropianism in a world with a
tenuous grasp of the Enlightenment.

"The end of serendipity" is the argument that I hear most often against 
automated collaborative filtering and other agent technologies.
The "push"  part here won't be that different - in the end, readers, writers
and recommenders will all put their suggestions forward, and the final
delivery
will depend on the combination of all these filters.

My usual arguments for the serendipity issue in filtering systems:


1.   Ability to effectively choose among options is what constitutes the
difference
  between intelligence and lack of it.  So far, more intelligence usually
has been useful.

2.  Serendipity may be the best tool for finding occasional gems *in the
absence*
    of better mechanisms for finding these gems.  With much better mechanisms,
   there won't be much use left for serendipity.

3.  The same argument could have been suggested when people invented trains
and cars.
  "You can't wander around if you are on a road, and accidentally bump into
nice people".
  Sure.  If you want to wander, walk on foot.  Any technology is an
instrument that has
  limits of applicability.  Use it when you need it.  Nobody takes your
other tools away.

4.  Filtering, etc. can be used to *increase* serendipity.  Citing my own
essay:

"  The ACF methods should not necessarily be based on the straightforward
matching
of people's interests.  One group of people can be interested in materials
that another
group considers offensive or controversial; educators would pay special
attention to
things that students find too difficult or boring; researchers may be
interested in problems
that have puzzled their colleagues or have not received sufficient
attention; social scientists
and market analysts would study subjects experiencing rapid changes in
levels of public
interest or shifts of opinions; reviewers would look for new or unknown
material in

When you put the question that way (which you haven't before), it has
a different answer: I apply precisely the same standard of proof to
S&H that I would to Darwin; but S&H do not.  S&H publish a book full
of content-free musings without a single measurement or test or even
proposed tests.  Their theories /might be/ quantifiable and testable,
if they wrote them that way, but they don't.

In all honesty, many important scientific books fail in the same
way.  For example, Dennet's _Consciousness Explained_ and Ridley's
_Red Queen_ do indeed extrapolate a lot from scant evidence; but
there are large differences: (1) Both propose specific tests that
can be performed to confirm/falsify their theories, (2) Both men
have a reputation for honest, significant, rigorous science.  (3)
Both works a very limited in scope, and do not even come remotely
close to making wild claims such as what 5 billion free wills may
do in coming decades. (4) Both list many alternative threories,
and give their solid reasons for why they have rejected them.  In
short, they are men of scientific integrity, and they have earned
my trust.  S&H have earned only publicity and sales.

Time is valuable.  My time and mental resources can be spent on only
a finite number of books and other information sources.  From all of
the available evidence I have of S&H's books, including discussions
here and the content of their web pages, I see no evidence that taking
the time to read the whole book would produce any benefit for me in
terms of increased knowledge or skills or even entertainment, because
everything I /have/ read is meaningless nonsense and carefully-picked
biased sample sets.

The time I spend excoriating new-agers in public forums might also
appear to have little benefit to me, but at least I enjoy it :-)

Well, he's talking about the 'pgp -w' option which overwrites a file with
pseudo-random data. This is probably better than some commercial systems,
particularly if you run it on a compressed disk. However, one problem with
all these programs is that your disk drive may cache the writes and only
update the hard disk itself once after you've supposedly overwritten the
data twenty times, and another is that the operating system might decide
to move blocks around on the disk so that the new block you write is
overwriting a different free block rather than the old block of the file. 
This is more likely with Unix than Windows.

Even then, the technology was developed in the days of 40MB PC drives, not
4GB. As hard disk storage density increases, the cost of recovering old
data increases dramatically. Given the kind of technology required just to
read the current data on next-generation disks I'd be surprised if anyone
will be able to read much more than one generation back, if that.

IAN: You raise some good points. I've not reviewed the radar tapes,
in fact, the first time saw them was on the Paris-Match web site.
That's why the  FBI did not raid my property to seize the tapes
that "show nothing." "Nothing, do you hear me NOTHING, NOTHING...."

I believe that the seized tape was a genuine copy. It seems that
the Match has two other images with hits of the object that they 
did not print.  I don't know why; but it stands to reason that 
minus these images we cannot get a good picture. 

In an inquiry into the validity of the tapes, apart from the cite 
I posted yesterday where the official investigators are cited as 
having conceded the tape is real but that it only shows a passing 
"aircraft," it is also important to consider that what Russell's 
tape shows is exactly what was described by the Associated Press, 
just two days after the accident, as being shown on the original 
FAA radar tape. As the AP [*] reports:

       Radar detected a blip merging with the 
       jet shortly before the explosion, some-
       thing that could indicate a missile hit. 

The process of the blip "merging" with TWA 800 shown in the 
official radar data inherently implies the process of motion, 
which dictates that the blip was hit on several radar sweeps,
exactly as Richard Russell's radar tape showed.  The evidence
strongly indicates that Russell's tape was the genuine goods,
which further explains why the FBI was so quick to seize it.

Data Recovery Systems and other companies make a good living recovering
data from computers that have been in fires, floods, and accidental
erasures, and they are frequently hired by law enforcement agencies to
recover from intentional erasures--even sophisticated ones.  A single
"bit" on a hard drive comprises thousands of flux changes, and each time
it is written, the boundaries are a little different, and the intensities
are a little different.  The techniques are all very well known and well
reported for decades.  All you need is a reader that can produce a map
of the flux intensities about 100 times finer than the read head itself,
and good software will tell you what the last dozen or so written bits
were at each location, and analyzing the positional offsets can tell
you which bits were written at similar times.

If you don't believe it, just use one of those programs, then call
them up and pay them to recover it for you.  Won't be cheap, though.

My theory is that this is just a strangely strong example of a phenomenon
that happens a lot in writing about technology--one detail pushes people
over a sort of threshold where they're able to imagine a lot of things
all of a sudden, and they attribute these possibilities to the one detail,
rather than going back and a) asking what depends on what, or b) thinking
about their own previous lack of imagination.

This is part of the *real* process of mythologizing technology that I wish
people would study more.  It's not just that people view technology as
inevitable.  It's that they paste retroactive rationales and categories
on it, package-dealing things.  Marketing needs to create categories
and distinctions...  But why *journalists* play along *so* slavishly,
so eagerly, so...pro-distractively, I can't figure.  It seems partly
driven by a simple wish to appear to know what's what.

PGP has no access to primitive system functions. Assuming that pgp -w 
will write to exactly the same location is assuming too much, imo. It 
sure is probable, but it is not guaranteed even currently.

Yes. That's the reason fsck is more likely to find garbage after a hard 
power-off sans predcessing shutdown. But it sure increases drive 
performance, especially if you have lots of RAM.

I think magnetic proximal probe microscopy will have little problems with 
current, or near future, magnetic pit size. Making sense of the signal is 
much harder, however. So, overwriting the same track say 10 times with an 
adequate pattern (random?) should give the Shop some hefty trouble. 
(Conc. cryptography, your drive will sure keep quiet, but will you? You 
know, certain people can be... persuasive. Whereas erased drives don't talk).

Anyone who becomes so famous that they are recognized by the populace would
indicate that populace knew what extropy means. If the populace knows what
extropy means, then its authenticity would also be recognized. 

Con-artists (no pun intended -:) are masters at what they do in all trades.
It's unfortunate, but, "shit happens."

Sorry, I should have been more specific. Artwork can challenge the
suppositions of group or class of people. I'll give two examples: Robert
Maplethorp challenged basic assumptions about sexuality as well as same-sex
relationships. He challenged the general view of the sexual masculine as
something ugly and horrible and made it beautiful and elegant. Ophra Winfry
in her creative endeavors has become the most powerful woman in Hollywood,
challenging assumptions about being black and how fast one can customarily
rise to the top. The Empire States Building challenged an assumption about
how tall and sturdy a building could be.  VR challenged the assumptions that
we are limited to one reality.

This goes with the territory.  If we are introducing new concepts as
transhumans and especially extropian transhumans, how we present what could
be seen as threatening concepts that shake the ground people walk on --
then, a sense of diplomacy, presentation and marketing is essential. I can't
tell anyone else how to present new ideas, but I am sure that if I want to
be successful, I will take careful notice of how a public might respond. If
I want a pubic to respond with opened arms, I'll not hit them over the head
with threatening concepts, but attempt a warm and inviting constant.

Thanks, Sarah, for igniting my brain cells. Your posts are always so
well-written.

In a message dated 3/16/97 8:18:50 PM, Sarah Marr wrote that my professed
bemusement with sweeping claims (by unnamed parties) about "Extropic art",

>seems to imply that I made such a claim.

This looks like a good example of the variance between a sender's intent and
a receiver's interpretation!  I in fact concur with Sarah's argument that,

>since interpretation is observer dependent, []
>sweeping claims cannot be made except as statements of intent on the part
>of Extropian artists.

One corollary of the indeterminancy of interpretation:  "Extropic art" (if
defined by content) can come from decidedly non-Extropian sources.  (Beauty
in the beholder's eye, and all that.)

Another corollary:  A self-proclaimed "Extropic artist" could (under the same
definition) produce decidedly entropic art.  All too often, artists fail to
communicate what they intend.

These observations undergird my uneasiness with a content- or intent-based
definition of Extropian art.  Such a definition operates in the same way that
"Christian art" might; it comes uncomfortably close to describing propaganda.

Now, I like effective rhetoric as much as the next rabble-rouser.  Many types
of art, however, simply do not lend themselves to predictable
interpretations, and thus do not work well as propaganda.  Compare a dance to
an essay.  So a content- or intent-based definition of Extropian art will not
prove useful for many modes of communication.

Compare that sort of definition with one based on the community that gives
rise to the art--"Christian art" versus "American art", say.  Such a
definition loosely defines content, and yet avoids the possibly censorious
consequences of a content- or intent-based definition.  "American art" loses
nothing by attacking American institutions.  Such criticism characterizes the
community of artists in question.

I'm not saying I embrace the definition-by-community view; I just wanted to
point out an alternative to the content- or intent-based definition.
 Personally, I think that trying to define art accomplishes embarassingly
little.  Far better to just create it, share it, and enjoy it.

Not really.  Remember, in the famous binary pulsar, only one of the 
neutron stars is detectable by radio telescopes.  The other either 
does not radiate appreciable radio pulses (is too old), or the beams
don't sweep in our direction.

The trouble with this widely believed story is that, as you can easily

Push won't replace pull, it will just complement it and act as a frontend
to pull. There will be no major media networks as there are with
television, you will be able to have your content streamed from anyone
anywhere. You could put up a channel yourself just as you can put up a
webpage today. The only thing that scares people into thinking it's more
like television is how it's arranged very pretty like a presentation with
lots of movement on the screen and information scrolling, blinking, and
moving all over the place. PointCast Network or Microsoft won't be our sole
information providers because microsoft has defined the tags to create push
technology and released them to the public so everyone can do it and the
standards will be adopted universally.

This is where profiles come in to learn about you, compare and contrast
your interests with others like you and make suggestions aka "collective
intelligence".

Exactly what push technology is also. Imagine content SO FUCKING ADDICTIVE
you just want to sit infront of the computer/tv combo box 24 hours a day
because it's throwing all the information you CRAVE constantly at you. All
this information streaming in is aimed directly at your id. Of course this
content will come along with a advertisement or two aimed directly at your
id and you'll have to learn incredible will power to resist the urge to buy
"exactly what you were looking for".

Push technology is precisely the opposite while it may appear as that at
first. Through intelligent agents and collective intelligence, two mindsets
of the same type will begin to diverge to become more individualistic. Push
technology gives you more of what you like when you like and subtle
differences will begin to form which will cause the gap to widen between
individuals just as potholes in a road form due to ice expanding. All
content providers on the net providing webpages and the like will suddenly
be able to find their audiences though push technology and the suggestions
collective intelligence technologies will make based on their personal
profiles. The media companies may think they're winning the war on the net
and that media centralism will continue but they're dead wrong, it's
exactly the opposite. Alot of people on this mailinglist and beyond think
the same as us. We will be matched up with their profiles and we will even
be able to compare who is like whom. Through push technology we will also
be able to 'find' all the would-be extropians out there all over the planet
that haven't heard of us and will enable all of us to unite to form a power
of sorts to combat entropy worldwide. (It may sound a little unbelievable
but so is nanotech).

Wrong. This is the technology that will CAUSE individuality to rise faster
than it has ever before. You've already seen how the web can cause people
to find new interests by accidently clicking on links and even creating
ideas caused by that accidental clicking and causing two totally off the
wall ideas to converge. This is the perfect environment for breakthroughs.
The accidental clicking or even innacuracy of search tools may cause people
to notice a bit of interesting information they never realized before and
cause them to research it further and develop a new interest. Notice how
people can wander off topic when doing a search with a searchtool? You need
to go from point A to point B to find point C way off in another area. It
only gets better from here on out.

Actually, if the artist decides that the piece of art serves a 
particular purpose, then it serves a particular purpose.  Many 
artists have utilized pieces of art as political expressions, for 
example our own Western tradition of bardic poetry as practiced by 
such writers as Yeats and Brecht.  Hence the number of writers and 
artists currently languishing in jail under totalitarian regimes.

Or act as a visioning instrument, which I believe may be the most 
important role art can play within a transhumanist context.  The act 
of imagining the results and/or consequences of a particular new 
technology through a piece of fiction writing, for example, can 
reveal new possibilities or potential pitfalls.  Or, as shown by 
Vernor Vinge, art can be used to propose new end goals.

>My reason for doing so is that my art does reflect who I am as well as my

I wonder if that relationship between internal philosophy and external 
expression is easier to achieve in the visual arts.  In the realm of 
verbal expression, achieving continuity and plot coherence can lead 
to conflict over personal ideals versus remaining true to the central 
vision of the piece.  The dilemma becomes more intense if the story 
itself leads in a previously unseen direction that reveals something 
negative about a cherished idea.  

Allow me to illustrate by using as an example the story I am writing.  
In it there are three characters, two human and one transhuman.  As a 
group they encounter a particular danger, and frankly, things don't go 
well for them.  The temptation for me would be to spare the transhuman 
character through his utilizing a special ability.  In order to maintain 
the coherence and value of the story, however, it is required that he 
use that special ability to cope with the experience rather than to 
escape it.  The very act of moving forward in time with the storyline 
compels me to face the consequences of the plot and to maintain its 
veracity, regardless of my personal feelings regarding it.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

This isn't always true. The most an artist can do is hope that a piece of
art will serve the purpose she/he desires and do her/his utmost to create
the work in a manner which is most likely to fulfil that purpose. The
artist who wishes to demonstrate the selflessness and purity of Jesus by
painting him on a cross may only succeed in showing a criminal being killed
if the picture is viewed by peoples unaware of Christianity and its story.

Artists are as capable of failure as anyone else.

Not at all. They may know what Extropy means only through the
representations of the artist. Or, more likely, the may know of both artist
and other Extropians, but be more influenced by the artist.

The populace would believe the authenticity of that which they believe,
which is not necessarily that which _you_ would wish them to believe.

I didn't think I'd implied the opposite. In fact I have explicitly made the
same point already. However, as I've said, artists only challenge the
suppositions of the observers of their work. If no suppositions exist, then
they are created, rather than challenged.

You have just defined it then. You have defined art as something to be
created, shared, and enjoyed. This definintion corrollates directly with
my subjective definition of art: the manifestation of our pleasures, and
ignores my objective definition: that art is the status of our
condition. Specifically, the collective art of an individual reflects
the individual's condition, and the collective art of an organization,
nation, or society, reflects the condition of that society. You may deny
the latter definition, but in so doing, you deny arts scientific
usefulness; you regulate art to the ephermeral only.

Objectively, it does not matter what an artist intends when they create
a work of art, they may intend nothing in particular, or they may intend
something specific and not attain it, but either way, that art still
expresses their condition. It is difficult to see this in contemporary
art because we do not have the distance in time to be very objective.
Hoever look at art of any other period, start with the cave art of
20-25,000 years ago, and work your way up. In the same way that we can
look back at this art today and determine the general psychological
condition of those civilizations, people in our near future will be able
to look at our art today and do the same thing, and better than we are
now able to do with art of the past ourselves, for the people of the
future will have even better understanding of psychology coupled with a
great deal more data to make objective corrollations with.  


Kathryn Aegis wrote:

The fact that you do not subscribe to it does not make it any less real.
It only shows a determinism to deny that facet of art. I don't have to
subscribe to a definition of the earth which says the earth is round. I
can hold tenaciously to a belief that the earth is flat, but that does
not change the reality of what the earth really is.


Kathryn Aegis wrote:

Not true. It is fine to believe this, but it is wholly untrue. You
cannot *fully* escape the conditions of your time, and the very attempt
itself to escape or deny the conditions of your time is a response to
your time in itself. You are by degree, perhaps less than some,
determined by the limitations of your era. Even striving not to be
limited by your era is a response to your era itself. As much as you may
wish to avoid the truth of it, when you make art, you are making a
statement of condition about yourself, the institutions you are member
of, the nation you are member of, and the era itself you are member of.
And people of the future, and perhaps people from other worlds also,
will be able to look back on your art, and make objective observations
on it.

This is fine. If you do not consciously create boundaries for your art,
which few people do, and I do not personally recommend or discourage it,
the boundaries on your art will be set unconsciously. Either way, your
work can still be analysed objectively as a statement of condition.

As artists we like to imagine we are absolutely unique and uninfluenced
by outside forces. But this really is not the case. Some specific
boundaries that are set by an era, techniques that are possible,
technology that can be employed, ubiquitous concerns, conditions of
life, limitations of our current degree of knowledge. We can only
imagine things so far beyond what currently is and what is currently
possible. This itself is a limitation of any era; it is a limitation on
your art. 


TOMorrow:

Art can also express feelings, and conditions of existence.

No, not "just" as subjectively. Trained scientific professionals are
trained not to act "just" as subjectively. Trained scientific
proffessionals base their observations on collected scientific data.
There is a major difference between interpreting artwork subjectively,
"What do I personally think or feel about this work?", and interpreting
it objectively, "How do the qualities of this work corrallate with the
collected data at my disposal?"

I can look up at the stars and say, "Wow those are beautiful," and then
continue to make up all kinds of astrological fairy tales about those
stars, or I can seek to become more objective in my interpretation of
the stars and create a science called, astronomy. Again, if you chose to
believe in astrological fairy tales rather than astronomical facts, that
will not detract from the astronomical truth. You do not have to believe
in an objective definition of art for such to exist.

I agree, this is a new idea (I think). I see some problems with how to 
use it though: using some form of fast holography (since we need the 3D 
data) we only get optical information at a certain wavelength: how do we 
tell apart the different chemical states that are important for brain 
structure and function (like what neurotransmittor a given synapse uses 
or what state of LTP it is in) using optical information? Knowing the 
what the hardware looks like might help us deduce the internal 
properties, but this is likely to be highly nontrivial since it is hard 
enough to distinguish one cell from another using visible light. In order 
to get enough resolution we might need to go into the UV, and then we 
start having trouble with energy densities anyway.

Neural state is probably not important to achieve uploading, since
personhood is apparently well preserved in saved drowning victims in
northern rivers;  for a while their neurons are completely inactive due to
cooling, so their dynamic states are most likely lost. They emerge from 
the ordeal with a brief retogerade amnesia (apparently briefer than the 
amnesia of people with medial temporal lobe damage, suggesting that LTP 
in the hippocampus is preserved) but otherwise with no disruptions of 
self-hood (if the anoxia was not too severe, of course). 

If you want to upload yourself with perfect continuity, so that the 
transition is done in a conscious state, then you need to take neural 
states into account. But for a plain uploading, all you need to deal with 
is neural topology, chemistry and perhaps LTP state (+ similar things).

I thought that some of you might be interested on this, as the future
evolution of humanity, cultural revolutions, and transhumanism are all
viable topics, but the majority of mailings will be related to
traditional Evolutionary Theory.

Thom

I would like to inform everyone here that there is a new mailing list
for the discussion of Evolutionary Theory. Although there are many such
lists that exist for biology, most of them are aimed at a very specific
subset of specialists. The new list is designed for broad, intra
discipine discussions on evolutionary topics. It would be an excellent
resource for professionals to gather information about advances outside
their normal scope (i.e. it will allow fossil hunters to talk to gene
splicers).

This site should not be used for the evolution/creation debate! 


The easiest way to subscribe fir this mailing list is to just visit the
website and fill out the "quick form" right at the site. Point your
browsers at http://www.esosoft.com/evolution/ to join the list.

I don't know how shrinkable the brain is, but being the brother/collaborator 
of an Amiga demo programmer I know that a clever hack can achieve plenty 
of compression if you have the basic algorithm right. I'm fairly sure 
that once we have suceeded at uploading, we will gradually find ways to 
shrink the upload matrix.

Back to the subject: I think the truth is somewhere between Eugene
(neurons are tricky, simulate them all as carefully as possible) and John
(neurons are important mainly in groups) - neurons indeed do a lot of
amazing stuff, but they also work together in populations. Evolution would
favor beings whose minds had a fair bit of redundancy over beings where
every neuron matters (in situations where brain damage is likely during
the lifetime of the being). So Eugene is pointing out an upper bound to
upload matrix capacity, while John is speaking of the "compressed"
brain-algorithm (where we can chunk neurons). 

As a neural networks/neuroscience person I would guess that these new
properties would not increase the upper estimate with more than a
magnitude. If we assume 10^11 neurons with 10^4 synapses each, and 100
parameters in each synapse (I'll chunk the synapses and dendrites they sit
upon into one unit here), we get 10^17 state variables. Nonlinearity,
dendritic computation and similar stuff just makes calculating the next
state more heavy, and doesn't increase the storage needs much. Each
update, (say) every millisecond might depend on the other states in each
neuron + signals from connecting neurons, giving around 10^26 flops. 
Diffuse modulation doesn't increase the estimate much. Of course, this is
a very rough estimate and should be taken with a large grain of salt.

roots go back to Hume."]
I can't begin to count how many posts have been devoted to quibbling 
over 'certainty' on this list. I hope certain individuals are taking 
this critique to heart ;) >

Well, I can 'count' and I last recall *this* specific topic 
(certainty) coming up at the end of last Sep when Reilly had just 
finished citing a review of Windshuttle in the Sep96 _The New 
Criterion_ in another effort to extricate *us* from the "swamp of 
post-modern literary theory" and lead us across "the desert of Michael 
Focault's 'anti-humanism'". (Hmmm, folks were just discussing Focault 
here last week...)

At that time I wrote:
<certainty is a subjective feeling, not an objective truth. I'm also 
certain that we can never be completely certain about most *things*, 
as opposed to *feelings*.... I agree that the most important thing is, 
as you [Jeff Dee] say, to be always questioning, trying to reduce 
uncertainty.>

Some time after that I first read Jean Baudrillard's "Radical Thought" 
essay, the essence of which is the "radical skepticism", the "smug 
nihilism" that Reilly notes. Yet, I was also struck by how easily an 
extropic *approach* could be extracted, if one ignored the smugness 
and pessimism, the disdain for truth, the desire for the Void, for 
what I like to call "Jim Legg's free-for-all soup". Baudrillard says:
<The requirement of this thought ['radical thought'] is double and 
contradictory. It does not consist in analyzing the
world to extract from it an improbable truth. It does not adapt itself 
dialectically to the facts and abstract from them some logical 
construction. It is much more subtle than that, and more perverse as 
well. This thought consists in putting into place a form, a matrix of 
illusion and disillusion, a strange attracting force, so that a 
seduced reality will be able to spontaneously feed on it.>

Don't misinterpret me: Baudrillard seeks dissolution because he thinks 
this is an awful world, while I, as an Extropian, would seek coherence 
- drawing out the truth and beauty from amidst the overwhelming noise 
and decay.  But, is this not also a seduction of reality?

Then, Reilly says induction and deduction "don't mix well". My point 
is this: I, too, tend to favor empirical approaches and reliance on 
the coherence of our perceptual capabilities for establishing 
objective truth; but, to make the "extropic transformation", well, as 
Reilly puts it in his "A History of Extropic Thought" essay:
<Our conceptual capabilities go far beyond our perceptual 
capabilities. They do not merely categorize our immediate sensory 
stimulation, they categorize very general and abstract relations 
transcending temporality.... Our maps are always incomplete, but there 
is no limit to creative interpretations on them.>

I see these "creative interpretations" as deductions - I want it to be 
so, even though it is not yet so (or my interpretation is incomplete), 
so I will do my best to make it so! (Conclusions following from 
premises / results following from desires, rather than inductions / 
reasoning from current particulars to say that this is the way it must 
be.) If the particulars 'suck', and for many they do, then the 
seductive deduction is to reach beyond, to climb out of the asymptotes 
one finds oneself in, striving toward the top of the curve...

Reilly cites Kimball/Stove saying:
<Popper stood this all on its head. In his philosophy of science, we 
find the curious thought that falsifiability, not verifiability, is 
the distinguishing mark of scientific theories ...>

Now, I have not read Popper.  About all I knew about Popper prior to 
this was his notions of Worlds 1-3.  Until now I had associated these 
with Reilly's more elegant notions of ordered, chaotic and liquid 
realms. (Gee, now I'm so uncertain (-;)

I too prefer truth / verity rather doubt, problems and refutations; 
but, as Reilly has said in his "Extropic Thought" essay, "dualism is 
philosophy's perennial cop-out". And, a few paragraphs later in that 
same essay Reilly says: "Concepts are pruned to our desire for truth 
through methods of falsifiability or verifiability." I notice he says 
"or", not "and".

*But, BOTH are useful tools in the proper context: I would emphasize 
what has been verified when setting forth known history, or truth, 
from the past, but I would defer to what can be falsified when 
speculating about new possibilities for the future.*

Kimball/Stove spites the "irrationalism whose philosophical roots go 
back to Hume." Yet, in Reilly's Extropic Thought essay he notes "David 
Hume ... echoes the Taoist saying of 'the farther you go the less you 
know.'" Reilly contends that the farther we go, the *more* we know. 
While this is true, it is also true that the more we know, the more we 
realize how much more there is still to be learned. Acknowledging this 
does not mean one has sunk into irrationalism! Consider Reilly's 
ending quote from Miguel de Unamuno on his "Nozick's 'Non Coercive' 
Autism" post:
<"The will, the will not ever to die, the refusal to resign oneself to 
death, ceaselessly builds the house of life while the keen blasts and 
icy winds of reason unceasingly batter at the structure and beat it 
down.">

Am I to conclude from this that reason is inimicable to life? I think 
not - that would be a dualistic copout. Rather, BOTH will AND reason, 
empirical induction and conceptual deduction, will compete to make the 
extropic transformation. Which we *emphasize* does not depend on 
truth, but on perspective or, dare I say it, utility.

Also from Reilly's "A History of Extropic Thought" essay:
<We acquire knowledge by directing our internal searchlight at the 
metaphysical unknown in search of something we can call a problem to 
work on. As our searchlight sweeps the metaphysical night sky, we map 
what reveals itself in the beam and interpret the map according to our 
utility of the moment.>

Is this not similar to the functionalism (or was it utilitarianism) 
that you were criticizing Gregory Houston for a month ago? Is this 
"inventing purposes" or "pursuing truth", and how can you so certainly 
draw this fine line for someone other than yourself?

This doesn't work, since the nanomachines are just as vulnerable to 
radiation as biology. Building hardened systems might work, just as the 
radiodurans bacterium manages to survive intense radiation by using a 
large percentage of its energy for error repair. But it would require 
plenty of time of preparation before the radiation storm to build an 
ecosystem-wide nano-repair system.

Gazing


Let's gaze upon the future
And see where tomorrow lies,
Draw patterns in the starlight
And find rhythms in the skies;
Let's find ourselves a new day
And escape from the past's hold,
Let's build a new horizon
And remake the Manifold.
We'll see the space surround us,
We'll welcome the neo-night,
We'll create a Paradise
In our interstellar flight;
So let's look to the future
And find a way to fulfill
Our palpable potentials
And kineticize our will.

Nanotech isn't magic.  The diamondoid-style nantech that Drexler is proposing
would be excruciatingly sensitive to hard radiation - even one misplaced atom
wll take out the equivalent of a cell; by contrast, cells can generally take
a good number of hits.  Biology-style nanotech would share the problems of
current biology.  No doubt it could be made more resistant to hard radiation
than current cells, but how much so is unclear.

Absolutely.  Actually, since neutron stars are visible, just some very good
telescopes and a thorough cataloging effort might do.

Noah's Ark is a myth, remember.  You can survive in a "Noah's Ark", but a
civilization can't (nor an ecology).  Complex civilizations need very large
numbers of people to support them.  And imagine the chaos created if a solar
system-wide civilization discovered 99.9% of the population was going to die
in the near future?  I'd expect the fighting to destroy the Arks.

If you read Staurt Hameroff's "Ultimate Computing: Biomolecular Conciousness and
Nanotechnology" he proposes that the neuronal cytoskelaton (which is quite
complex in itself) is the root of our conciousness. Based on extensive studies
of the cytoskelaton, some have guessed that each neuron and its accompanying
cystoskelatal network is a small parallel processing computer.

If this is true, It would seem to seriously increases our brains processing
power and complexity.

Or maybe they should just follow the damned standard, which has had the
<link rev=supercedes> tag for over a year.  Actually, MS & NS won't
make any difference here; it's Yahoo, Excite, and Alta Vista you have
to convince to use those.  Everyone else would likely fall in line with
them.  But their history is that they're as deaf to users as MS & NS.

Gee, Chris, are you sure you don't work for the marketing dept at pointcast?

This sounds pretty nice, but as I said I'm not sure there is enough
information being produced in the world of the type that I CRAVE that
it can come in 24 hours a day.  I might have to settle with satisfying
my FUCKING ADDICTION only, say, 3 hours a day.  Poor me.

These collaborative filtering ideas are certainly intriguing, and I would
love it if some automated process could assemble for me everything new that
I would find interesting.  Whether it is then PUSHed to me or I have to
go out and PULL it in is unimportant.  The main thing is the improvements
in filtering.

Unfortunately I haven't seen many specifics of why changing the delivery
mechanism is going to magically cause these filtering mechanisms to appear.
So I will be skeptical about Chris's vision for a while longer.

Is there any software out there where you can tell it a set of web pages
that you like to monitor, and it will go out and check them all to see
which if any have changed since your last visit?  It seems to me that this
would provide a lot of the benefits touted for push.

The /story/ is a true one; the assertion (which no one here made, I 
might point out) that this is the origin of the word "bug" is what's
apocryphal.  But you don't really need to resort to tracking down
every early use to establish that: the story itself should be sufficient
proof that "bug" was a commonly used term when the moth was found;
otherwise the incident wouldn't have been funny.

This is insufferable misinterpretation of Popper, and with no excuse given
other than Stove's own emotional discomfort with carefully reasoned ideas.
The "foundation" metaphor of science is empty rhetoric; Popper /expanded/
the grand edifice of science by refusing to tie its future to the failures
of imagination of those past.  To strain the metaphor, Mr. Stove wants a
solid foundation, but refuses to allow science to build on land outside it,
or to tear it down when it is found inadequate, or to change our very
methods of building when better ones are found.

Mr. Stove seems uncomfortable with the obvious fact that expanding
knowledge implies expanding ignorance.  We all experience this directly
in our lives; the more we learn, the more we realize how much more there
is that we haven't learned; the more capable our imaginations become of
seeing outside our earlier unwarranted naive certainty.  Mr. Stove's
discomfort with "conjectural knowledge" is merely cowardice: he doesn't
want to admit that every act taken by every human being is a gamble on
the efficacy of what we call knowledge.  He seems dismayed by that
rather than enlivened and freed.  That's /his/ failure, not Popper's.

I don't think TOMorrow has done any such thing. He has stated an preferred
mode of use for art, but, given an object, his statement does not allow me
to say whether or not TOMorrow would consider that object 'art'. Put
another way: his statement does not say that everything which is created,
shared or enjoyed is art; nor does it say that art is everything which is
created, shared or enjoyed.

There objectivity will be more objective than our objectivity. In which
case our objective analysis of historic art will be surpassed by them also.
We may, in fact, be getting totally wrong. This seem's to be an

To an extent I agree: they are _more_ objective. They are not, however,
objective.

Why is the creation of astronomy more objective than the creation of
astrology and mythology? It isn't: it's just your preconceptions which
cause you to equate objectivity with post-Enlightenment rationality. This
is not a valid. (Or, at the very least, not the generally accepted version
of 'objectivity': the laying of stress upon what is external to the mind;
the placement of the knowledge of the non-ego as prior in sequence to the
knowledge of the ego.)

Put another way:

I flick a light switch and a light comes on. I interpret that as a flow of
electricity, because I apply all my knowledge of what others have said.
Someone else does the same, gets the same results, and interprets it as
magic, applying all his knowledge of what others have said. We are both
equally objective in our interpretations: there is no difference in the
process we follow to reach our conclusion.

>You do not have to believe

The point being, that the objective definition of anything, if an objective
defintion can exist, is temporally and culturally variant.

I stongly doubt the veracity of that claim.  Artists very often fail to
foresee how others will interpret and use their works.  Case in point:  Bruce
Springsteen hardly expected that his brooding complaint, "Born in the USA",
would surface as a Republican rallying tool!  Intent bears a relation to how
a work functions--especially with better artists--but does not determine it.

No, I've merely advocated a particular use of art.  A definition sets forth
terms that can stand in for the referent.  You cannot usefully substitute "a
thing created, shared, and enjoyed" for all uses of "art".  The phrase covers
things (eg, children, cookies, and feelings of good will) that in normal (or
even plausible) usage do not equate to "art".

(Enough of this sort of silliness!  In the name of Newton, I want to discuss
definitions of "definition" even less than I want to discuss defintions of
art.)

I am interested in writing a short story collection dealing with the individual's drive to transcend himself in spite of the naysaying public.  Between each story I'd like to include quotes from past scientific "authorities" who publicly knocked inventions or discoveries which later came to realization.  I'd appreciate any help in either locating sources (books, web sites, etc.) or even specific examples from the members of this list.  If you're going to send me specific examples, please include both the actual quote (if available) and the invention or discovery which overturned that quote.  If you don't know the quote itself offhand or have no easily available means of looking it up, go ahead and send me the details of what you do know.  If this project comes to fruition, upon publication I'll include a thank you list for the contributions I used.  Thanks in advance for your help.

The same holds true (perhaps even more so) of the individual's temperature,
pulse, drink of choice, favorite books, and so forth.  The putative
definition of art also holds at least as true of an organization's
membership, balance sheet, foreign policy, and the like.  All of these
attributes reflect their sources' conditions.  

I do not dispute that art says *something*; I disputed that it says what the
artist thinks it does.  Now, per Gregory's comments, I will also dispute that
it necessarily communicates "conditions" any better than a variety of
alternative measures.  I like art--a lot.  I do not, however, accord it
privileged status as a source of truth.

Sorry to disagree with you Reilly, but I have to say that Stove's
critique of Popper is complete bollocks - much as I enjoy Stove's acidic
style.

The point of 'falsifiability' is this: if you are serious about using
experience to test theory then the only way you can *logically* do so is
deductively: you deduce empirical consequences from a theory, and if
those experiences don't pan out, then the theory logically *must* be false.

But there is no such thing as a*logic* of induction: there is no
logical*necessity* to induction, no logical 'must', like you get in
deduction: this is what Hume showed.  (BTW, you can't escape this by the
Aristotelian/Randian route, because the truth of your theoretical
construct then depends upon the correctness of your identifications,
begging the question in a different way.)

If you think 'conjectural knowledge' is an oxymoron, then you must be
thinking of 'knowledge' as 'justified true belief'.  This isn't the way
Popperians think of knowledge.  For Popper, knowledge is simply
systematic truth.  Nowhere does he deny that we have got a hold of some
systematic truth, nowhere does he deny that it is possible to arrive at
systematic truth.

How that truth was arrived at is irrelevant to its epistemological
status as knowledge: if it's true it's true, because the world is the way
it is, full stop. In fact the 'justified' and 'true belief' parts of the
traditional definition are precisely what lead to subjectivism and
irrationalism, to the continuous oscillation betweeen scepticism and
dogmatism in the Western tradition.

Of course, the 'justified' bit was an attempt to distinguish mere lucky
guesses from truths arrived at by some sort of rational process.  The
problem is, the rational process is not 'justification'  but*criticism*.

Popper's idea is that we ought to test our ideas to destruction. What's
left standing isn't thereby 'justified' or 'proved' true beyond any
further doubt, but is the best candidate we have for truth: after all,
what other candidate for truth do we have?

The upshot is, unless you believe in some queer magical connection
between what we say and the way the world is such that there is some
logically necessary link between them (which denies the very principle
of objectivity, which says that there is *no* such logically necessary
connection, that the world exists the way it does independently of our
whims, our thoughts and theories) you*must* (logically!) be a Popperian.

To put it bluntly, we just make stuff up, and then we test it against
experience.

I still own a fully operational Amiga (A2000, this mail is being written 
on it), and I have sure seen miraculous demos. However, we are talking not 
about a radical algorithm (as a raycasting renderer vs. a polygon one) 
written by a human hacker, we are talking about an long-term evolutionary 
optimized connectionist hardware, which seem to operate at the threshold 
of what is at all possible with biological structures (speed, accuracy, 
etc.). 
(Remember Moravec's double bogus argument upon collapsibility of the 
retina, and his grand sweeping extrapolation, judging from retina to the 
cortex, regarding merely the most trivial functions, assuming an identical 
architecture on no empiric grounds whatsoever).

That I agree absolutely with -- we won't have to account for each ion 
channel/neurotransmitter vesicle/cytoskeleton. I think there might be a 
bandwidth of several (maspar/conectionist) hardwares in existance, 
capable of emulating biological neuronal tissue efficiently. 
 
> Back to the subject: I think the truth is somewhere between Eugene
> (neurons are tricky, simulate them all as carefully as possible) and John

In the retrospect I realize that my estimations were somewhat obscurely 
stated. I did not mean we must emulate each single biologically realistic 
neuron for uploads. This is certainly an option, in fact, I think the only 
way to translate a certain neural circuitry into a more efficient, 
compact (e.g. a packet switched integer automaton network), is by means 
of GA-reverse-enginering of a given peculiar (sub)network. Which requires a 
transient existance of a detailed emulation, of course. A population of 
them, in fact.

What I _wanted_ to convey, is tanstaafl; that there is no free lunch, that 
there is a minimal computational work to be done to simulate a given 
physical system realistically. The harder, the smarter (= more complex) 
the system is. And that minimal threshold may lie quite high for such 
complex objects as a mammal brain. Human equivalents the size of a sugar 
cube, running at speeds >10^6 of realtime seem to reside firmly in the 
realm of science fiction, not even very good science fiction.

I we consider the edelmanian brain, a population is an absolute 
prerequisite for thought. Darwin doesn't operate on individuals, but on 
populations.

Molecular hardware will die continuously. You simply cannot avoid it: it 
starts having defects right from the start, and it goes on losing bits up 
to the end of its usability, when it has to be substitued for fresh 
circuitry. We simply can't ditch "redundancy".

I think this level of compressability might be quite limited. An 
intrinsically digital system with error-correction redundancy might have 
some advantages in relation to attractor regeneration capability vs. a 
wet analog system, as is ours. But this is pure conjecture, we lack any 
data whatsoever.

Just a warning: if you intend to use any of these in a published work,
I'd check the facts a little closer.  Some of these are known to be
apocryphal, like the one supposedly from the Patent Commissioner.

I wrote an article called "Buiding an Eye" which you might want to read.
It's about prosthetic vision, and retinal implants.  It hasn't been

He has given a definition. You have simply pointed out how his

It is still a definition. His definition is certainly lacking as his
following post points out, but it is a definition. Look up the
dictionary definition of art or of the brain itself. You will see that
the definitions include how such are used.

Your definition of art can stand in as a referent for art. You have only
shown that it is not a particularly "useful" definition, because it
includes things that you do not consider art.

This is exactly what I have been trying to point out. In general people
do not want art defined. In general people want art to remain mystified,
ephemeral, and undefined. This limits the use of art.

Subjective interpretation of art: I like this, this is beautiful, I
appreciate this; value judgements.

Objective interpretation of art: This work is created with such and
such. This work uses such and such colours in a certain ratio. This work
is time based. This work uses such and such imagery. This work uses such
and such sounds; collection of data to be corrolated to previously
collected scientific data. No value judgements.

Let us say that I were arguing that the earth is round, and you were
arguing that the earth is flat. If I cannot convince you that your idea
is less objectively true than my arguement that the earth is round, then
there is simply no reason for us to argue. I must simply pass you by and
wait for more reasonable people to be born, people who are not so
attached to the archaic definitions or lack of definitions for things,
people who will not accept fairy tales as valid sources of objective
facts. 

Each generation is accepting of less and less mystification of things.
Future generations will not accept our current mystification of art. You
can argue with me day and night, but that will not stop the
demystification and future scientific use of art.

I agree that art does not always say what the artist intends. This does

Some conditions it will communicate better than others. That is why we
do not have only one method of measurement. I have been talking about
psychological conditions, and thus certainly agree that art has less to
say, though not nothing to say, on a cultures economic status than does
their balance sheets.

If it is not a source of truth or facts, then is it a source of untruths
and non-facts? Is it not possible that you like the idea of art as long
as it is not a source of truth, that you do not like the idea of art
being a source of truth. Watch the Discovery Channel, or the Learning
Channel, and you will see that archeologists very often use art as a
source of truth. Archeologists can learn a great deal about a culture
based on that culture's art. The archeologists do not merely "enjoy" the
art as you would have them do.

We often put art in time capsules on earth and in probes sent out in
space. We do not do this so that future or alien cultures will enjoy our
art. We do this to tell those cultures something about us.

Prompted by our discussion of "push" technology, I spent some time searching
out resources which will help you track changes to web pages.  I found a
few:

http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/KAW/KAW96/chen/kawchrono.html

This describes CHRONO, a tool for web servers to automatically note which
pages on the web site have changed, and present users a chronologically
sorted list of recently-changed pages.  There is also something called
Meta-CHRONO which maintains similar information across disparate sites.
However I think the sites have to be running CHRONO.

http://www.netmind.com/URL-minder/URL-minder.html

This is a server which lets you enter a list of URL's and your email
address, and it will send you email when any of the URL's change.  It
is an offshoot of the "netminder" service which will send you reminders
about birthdays, anniversaries, etc. that you can specify.  No privacy
here, but otherwise this could be a pretty convenient way to track your
favorite sites.

http://www.specter.com/sb30menu.html

This is a commercial program called Surfbot which sounds like it has some
relevant features.  It can download web pages to your local computer during
the night, do some searches on its own, check when your bookmarks need
to be updated, etc.  I'm not sure whether it can just make a list of
changed sites, or whether it actually downloads copies of the changed
sites to your computer.  A free demo version is available, but I haven't
had a chance to look into it in more detail.

http://www.vuw.ac.nz/~newbery/Katipo.html

This is a Mac-only program.  It looks at the history file left by your
web browser, and goes out and checks each page you've visited recently
to see if it has changed.  It doesn't have to download the whole page,
it just asks the server for the "Last-Modified" time, so it is supposed
to put relatively little load on the web.  (I don't know whether the
other programs on the list also use this method.)  It's a little strange
that it does this on the history file rather than the bookmark file; the
author promises to add this kind of enhancement someday.


For now I have put a few sample pages into the netminder URL watcher.
I'll see if it works.

I agree with this statement when applied to general art, but there is 
a particular class of artworks that serve a definitive purpose, and 
that purpose is usually clearly understood among the target audience. 
My preferred genre of poetry has a long history of serving political 
and satirical purposes, especially among populaces that are 
non-literate.  Oral poetry is often utilized for the purpose of 
chronicalling history, as in the Viking and Greek sagas.  The verse 
that we now think of as nonsensical nursery rhymes was carefully 
crafted to satirize events of the time in order that those vocalizing 
such opinions could escape jail.  More recently, during Yeats' time, the 
practice of 'rat-rhyming' served to harshly criticize those in authority 
in Ireland under the guise of entertaining for one's supper--and yet the 
target audience quite well understood the intention.  During our own 
slave era in the U.S., poetry served as a direct means of communication 
between separated kinsmen.  In South America, many poets have been 
jailed and tortured because their poetry serves as a thinly-veiled 
call for revolution, (again well understood by the populace) as 
documented by Amnesty International.  Really, among world nations the 
United States is one of the few that holds no such role for its 
poets, preferring to maintain them in the realm of pure expression.

I particularly love Yeats' blistering invective directed toward his own 
countrymen after Parnell's defeat:

	Come, fix upon me that accusing eye.
	I thirst for accusation.  All that was sung
	All that was said in Ireland is a lie.	
	Bred out of the contagion of the throng
	Saving the rhyme rats hear before they die.
	Leave nothing but the nothings that belong
	To this bare soul, let all men judge that can
	Whether it be an animal or a man.


Gregory Houston, in re my objections to his definition of art:
>The fact that you do not subscribe to it does not make it any less 
>real 

Actually, my main objection stemmed from your seeming insistence that 
this was the only definition of art in existence.  

Sin,

There is nothing trivial about it, the density of neurons in the retina is 
100 times greater than any other part of the brain, Moravec used it because 
it's the most studied part of the brain. I think it's a quit reasonable thing 
to do. Moravec assumed 10 bits per synapse, also quite reasonable at the time

No need to say "may", you will definitely need to do a hell of a lot of  
computations to emulate any mammal's brain, and there is no reason why a very  
small object couldn't perform a hell of a lot of computations.

hehe. I'm sure there is enough information being produced. In fact... I

Entertain yourself to death with information aimed directly at your
personal id. We will all end up like Bill Gates, sitting at our big screen
tvs or using virtual goggles 24 hours a day selecting the information we
find most promising and saving that for later in an endless list of
bookmarks we could never control.

Perhaps the program could send your bookmarks to a server on the web using
encryption to ensure everything is secure and compare your bookmarks with
others and create a profile of your interests.

Though I haven't heard about such densities, it strenghtens the case of 
retina being very special. Extrapolations based on the retina 
(extrapolations, not speculations) will hold merely for the retina, and 
not anywhere else.

A bee's, or a fly's brain is sure a very small object (1 mm^3, or so), 
and it sure does an awful lot of computations to survive in a complex, 
unfriendly environment (hmm, this makes me want to rush out instantly, and 
read up on insect neuroarchitecture). The question is: how much smaller 
can the system get? How much faster? At equivalent speed, what would its 
power requirements be? Intuitively, or, as an educated guess, one, two 
orders of magnitude, no more.

"without breaking the laws of Physics". Yes. Trouble is, basic laws do 
not allow us to talk about constraints of complex objects. We know 
(assuming no femtotech) atoms to be the smallest utilizable structures, 
(not even atoms but clusters of them) to define the lower horizon of 
implementability, and we can observe biological information processing 
systems. We know electronical systems to be much faster than mechanical 
ones, and we know maximal switching speeds in a given volume dictated by 
bond photodissotiation energies. We don't know whether we will have 
drextech, with its diamondoid matrix and fractal cooling channels, 
allowing it to operate at astronomic power densties, without turning 
into lava instantly.

There is still a whole lot what we do not know yet. So I prefer to take a 
conservative stance (in mundane life most people think I am a lunatic, 
but here I'm actually a conservative. Amazing), which is less embarassing 
on the long run. But then people forget.

Well, it certainly makes a jolly good read.

Perhaps I should have stated that differently. A population of 
imperferfectly autoreplicating entities in a limited-resource environment
is a necessary and sufficient condition for darwinian evolution to emerge. 
Better?

Meaning, no population, no evolution. No more, no less.

A gene does not reproduce outside of its wet context, the animal cell. 
Besides, darwinian evolution is not limited to systems having genes (or 
bits, or whatever), just inheritable, mutable properties which have impact 
on system's fitness.

We'll see. Finding out if a given algorithm is maximally compressed seems 
to be very hard (Most likely NP or worse).

I'm not entirely convinced about this. Remember that the brain is a messy 
legacy system, and that biological neurons has plenty of biological 
limitations.

Assume an ordinary statement requires one grain of salt (around 1 mm^3), 
and contains around 20 words. The above paragraph contains 105 words in 
its original form, so we get 6 mm^3 of salt (since it was a large grain 
of salt I round upwards).

        The same holds true for this thread.  There need not be any
definition for art, nor for that matter, any definition for a definition of
art.  Anyone can get something out of a piece of art, just as anyone can get
something out of a puffy white cloud floating across the periwinkle
perimeter of the sky; just as anyone can get something out of an inkblot.
It is really quite a simple concept.  There are no rights or wrongs to
someone's kosher interpretation...unless it is paired with the artist's
intent.  Just because "The Tyger" is written by a religious man (Blake)
supposedly about religious things, I have seen the poem in a much different
way.  Once paired with the artist's intent, my interpretation appears
incorrect, though I myself find it to stand true.  We are all artists, and
we are all art critics.  We need no orthodoxy or protocol or boxed
definitions to quell the freedom of interpretation.  Love things because
*you* love them, not because it is your duty to love them.  Cradle each
piece of art like it is your own offspring...for it is.  But most of all,
listen to what it has to say to you, for it has a voice, but it speaks
different words to each who want to hear it.

Awhile back, someone - I forget who - made the comment that the only
way to really erase data was with thermite.  I'm not sure if the comment
was indended literally, but...

Basic thermite is just a combination of aluminum powder and iron oxide.
( hydroxide? I forget )  Sounds pretty similar to the composition of the
platter itself.  Is it possible to make a platter of cast thermite?

If so, this opens up new horizons for really secure data.

The microproccesor in the drive mechanism could be instructed to ask
for a key at start-up.  If it doesn't get it, it refuses to seek data.
If it gets several consecutive bad keys, it ignites the disk.

It should be possible to rig a dead-man switch so that the case cannot be 
forced open without turning the platter into molten slag.

For the really paranoid, a cmos clock chip and battery could be added
internally.  If a period of several days goes by without the microprocessor
getting the key, it ignites the disk. ( Of course the time period should
be programmable so that one can take vacations )

E. Shaun, you are very clearly missing the gist of this argument. This
is not an argument about how someone should appreciate a work of art. We
all agree that this should be left to the individual. This is not an
argument about right or wrong aesthetic interpretation of art.  I
believe we all agree, though an artist may have a specific intent for an
opus, the artwork may be freely interpreted by the individual. This is
what you so have so fondly called objective subjectivity. Call it what
you will, this is the laymens approach to encountering art. 

This argument is about the fact that their is yet another use of art
that has nothing to do with the appreciation, enjoyment, or judgement of
art. It amazes me at how difficult it is for people to realize or
recognize this use, even after I have explicitly stated it several
times. This is the objectively scientific, or the psycho-archeological
use of art. It is the non-judgemental interpretation of art, the
objective observation and recording of what is explicitly present in the
art. It is the corrolation of that data with the data of previously
conducted scientific experiments, in order to ascertain a scientific
prediction of that individual's psychological condition. The same can be
done with collectives of art, e.g., the art of an organization, a
society, a nation, or even a world. Archeologists very commonly use art
in this fashion when studying ancient cultures. 


On an aside E. Shuan, I hope that you are not implying that art can only
be appreciated as either good or bad. This would be an extremely shallow
appreciation of art. In the same way that a person who only percieves
things in life as either strong or weak, a person who only percieves a
piece of artwork as either good or bad is shallow. We attain degrees of
depth in perception and appreciation by being able to evaluate things
from different vantages. The easiest way to do this is to increase the
number of dichotomies and continuums we shift between when appreciating
or analyzing something. An extremely shallow person, Joe, might only use
one dichtomy, whereas a normal person, Bob, might generally shift
between 2-5 dichotomies when percieving something of general interst;
another person, Tim, might shift between 5-10 dichtomies, and then yet
another person, a genius perhaps, Albert, might shift between 10 to even
30, 40, or more dichotomies when evaluating something. This factor is
one which differentiates the cognitive intelligence of people greatly.
This same factor also differentiates the emotive intelligence of people
greatly.

Where Tom defined art as something to be created, shared, and enjoyed,
you have defined art as something which either makes us feel good or
bad. In your refusals to directly define art, you have simply defined it
inadequately. Definitions DO NOT LIMIT things. Definitions make it
possible to question the limits of things. A refusal to define something
is a refusal to understand that thing deeply.

What mean "we", kemo sabe?  At the present state of neuroscience, I
wouldn't be comfortable pinning that down even to within 3-4 orders
of magnitude.  /You/ might be willing to upload yourself into a box
with 10 bits per synapse, but I wouldn't do it for under 1000 until
I saw proof.  In fact, I'm not sure I'd even be comfortable quantizing
at /any/ level what is surely an analog process.

Thermite (they still use it routinely to weld streetcar rails, a great 
show even in the sunlight, fumes lit by lava, wow), or a sheet of 
electrically ignited (system call Detonate() ) plastique taped onto the 
drive.

I dunno whether it already happened, but the trend goes towards sputtered 
high-tech stuff (on-glass? IBM?). The platter is still aluminum, though. 
Thermite won't stand even weak centrifugal forces, though.

Crypt, and destroy. Erase with grace.

I actually thought about several 100 g of plastique in the cabinet, for 
software copy protection. (Better than dongles. Pirates having to wear

That's because we usually only have a picture of a very thin cross section 
of a cell, if you could see the entire cell in 3D things would be different, 
even if the resolution was no greater that found in a good visible light 
microscope. The new popular visible light confocal microscope certainly helps 
with this depth of focus problem, I was surprised when I learned it was
invented by the versatile Marvin Minsky, better known as the father of  
artificial intelligence, he not only thought up the idea he actually built 
the first one.

I'll bet you could tell if a synapse had undergone LTP or not, you probably  
could not tell how it was using neurotransmitters, but maybe we'd get lucky 
and find there is a gross physical change.

Yes, that would be much better and I know that would work, but I was hoping 
something could be found before we had Nanotechnology.

Is my copy of Windows NT not the same as the "original" at Microsoft

post you're looking at is not as good as the "original" on my computer.

If you had 200 nanometer resolution in 3D you could certainly tell what  
synapse went where, whether you could obtain enough other information about 
it for an upload I'm not sure.
                        

        >This is an order of magnitude too poor. 
                        

If so then you'd need light with a wavelength of 40 nanometers, that's in the 
Ultraviolet region not in the X ray, and I think that's an improvement. 
Actually there is a way to resolve very small objects even with very large 
waves.

More than 100 years ago Ernst Abbe "proved" that details smaller than half 
the wavelength of the light used to illuminate a specimen could not be 
resolved, but he made a hidden assumption, namely that the distance between 
the specimen and the source of light was large compared to the wavelength. 
In 1956 J.A. O'Keefe proposed a "scanning near field microscope" that would 
break the Abbe barrier. O'Keefe said that if light was emitted from a tiny 
hole less than a wavelength away from the specimen then the resolution would 
be limited only by the size of the hole, the wavelength of the light would be
irrelevant. In 1972 Eric Ash proved experimentally that O'Keefe was correct.              
It looks like this technique may be practical for some things. In 1993 
Eric Betzig of ATT used visible light from a laser 10 nanometers above a 
sample to reveal details of the skeletal scaffolding inside a cell as small 
as 15 nanometers. Visible light is about 500 nm.

I don't know how you could use this technique for 3D brain scanning, that's 
why I mentioned it, I need some help, put your thinking cap on people.

You're missing the point here. If a person lives within a culture where
no-one has ever even suggested the world to be round, that person is every
bit as objective as you in his/her acceptance of the flatness of the world.
Whilst I agree with you that reasonable, Western people would accept the
roundness of the world, I can't accept your exceptionally blinkered of
culture as simply being "Western, post-Enlightment rationality = reasonable
and objective, everything else = unreasonable and subjective". I guess that
just the anthropologist in me coming out.

Just to make the point one more time: fairy tales are perfectly reasonable
sources of objective facts in those cultures where there are no other
opinion-systems to be heard. Objectivism is, I have said before, defined
as, simply, listening to what others said and assigning them a greater
priority than what oneself thinks.

Nor does it stop the current scientific use of art.

No, that's an entirely spurious logical extrapolation. Art is a source of
discourse, which may or may not reveal truth or facts, or may do both. A
drawing of a flat Earth presents both a possible truth (this artist
believes the Earth to be flat) and a possible not-truth (the Earth is flat).

I have to agree with Lee, there is mounting evidence that each neuron in itself
is a complex computer with an extensive cytoskelatal network that regulates
neurotransmitter activity. Since reading Hans Moravec's Mind Children nearly 10
years ago, I have never taken his estimates of brain power seriously. A
roboticist does not neccessarily make a good neuroscientist.

Good response Alex. I value my time more now than I do serendipity. i
want my spontaneity in areas I know that will interest me, rather than
mounds of boring crap to wade through to get a few gems. I still make
choices, and have freedom of choice, I just have some of the choice
preplanned so as to maximize efficiency.

Here's a more "active" approach: Have a small canister of 90% pure H202
(hydrogen peroxide) that sprays onto the disk when it ignites.

If the threat radius is 1000 light years on average, then the most
likely location for one that will threaten us is somewhere 870 light
years away. Given this, then its all a function of rate of expansion
versus time till dooms day. If the probability is once every 200 million
years, and the last one was 100 million years ago, then there's a 0.50%
chance of it being sometime in the next million years. Assuming this is
the case, then we could expand at a rate of 0.50% of light speed in all
directions (.005 C) and still have the ability to allow 50% of all of
humanity to escape destruction, assuming they are still human in a
million years. At faster rates of expansion, obviously, the percent of
humanity surviving goes up.

Given the vastness of space, it will hardly be like the evactuation of a
city. Even using salt mines would suffice for planetary protection,
while with space, there are plenty of comets to go around in the Kuiper
belts of most stars. Even at a slow rate of huma expansion, the
population density will still be less than one person per cubic AU or
even small fractions of that.

At $50,000 a pop,(never mind the $200000 fee) a million customers would be
a 50 trillion dollar industry.  Even putting aside the religious beliefs of
this organization, I could not trust anyone who cannot do a basic check on
their sales predictions in comparison to the GNP of the world.

I'm not sure what you're referring to by "sweeping claims" so it's hard to
address your point. But, yes, you can speak about extropian writing just as
you can talk about Extropic Art. Certainly, as you note, extropian writing
can have several purposes, not just to inform, but to amuse, to refer to
useful resources, and so so. Yet, to clearly be extropian writing it must
embody extropian attitudes. Otherwise "extropian" would be utterly without
content.

Similarly, Extropic Art is art that embodies extropic ideas and values.
It's very clear what some of those are (intelligence augmentation, life
extension, greater ability to define one's self, etc.). There are other
ideas and attitudes that we might argue about, but most terms (except
logical and mathematical terms) include some fuzzy areas.

It still makes sense to discuss questions such as whether to embody
extropic ideas and attitudes it matters only that this was the artist's
intention or whether an artwork succeeds in being extropic only in so far
as it induces such an effect in the viewer/reader/listener/participant.
Regardless of views on this, it seems perfectly clear to me that Extropic
Art *does* admit of definition and understanding. Such a definition need to
go into details, but to avoid some kind of definition is obfuscating and
mystifying -- certainly *not* extropic traits!

I spent this past weekend at a conference in Munich, Germany discussing why
Europe is undergoing a "Big Fatigue" while the USA seems so much more
vibrant. Reading one of Reilly's posts just now prompted me to relate this:

The first speaker on Saturday, an extropic artist from the UK presented his
ideas clearly and refreshingly. He was followed by Dieter Kamper -- the man
responsible for introducing postmodernism to Germany, I'm told. I wish
Reilly had been there, heavily armed to save us from boredom. :-)  Kamper,
as I would predict from his intellectual approach, was utterly
incomprensible. I thought it might be a poor transation, but my Germany
writer and extropian sympathizer Gundolf Freyermuth (his last book was
Cyberland) confirmed that it was the content not the language that was the
problem.

Another amusing incident: After I gave my talk on Sunday on extropian ideas
and how they were much stronger in the USA (esp. California) than in
Europe, a Brit called Paul Treanor attacked me in quite a nasty way. This
fellow thought that old technologies should be subsidized to keep their
producers in business, and that free market people are the scum of the
earth. He said that he could bear the thought of people like me existing so
long as we were all in California. 

What really amused me was his own talk. In Ayn Rand's novels, the bad guys
generally match their ugly ideas with some kind of physical repulsiveness.
Perhaps it's just my childish glee, but I couldn't help finding it fitting
that Treanor's entropic ideas were presented with a really unpleasant wet
nasal sound!

I enjoyed meeting List subscriber Eugene Leitl. Since a couple of women who
live in Munich came up to say they enjoyed my talk, perhaps Eugene will
have someone he can talk to off the Net now...

I would appreciate any thoughts you might have on this.  I would say this
is my best poem yet.  Of course, this indicates two things, I don't write
much poetry and I don't write it very well.  Oh well, I'm working on it.

Dictators


Living a lie from week to week,
Reinforced by those who tell them to be meak,
So that when after they die,
Everything under the sky 
Will belong to them.

A humble dream indeed!
But it does not address my need.
I desire a world I can call my own.
I want knowledge and power beyond what mortals have known.
I want to live forever on earth.

Then they tell me it is a foolish dream,
But they are not what they seem.
Hypocrites all, they go and pray,
But they are back to living for earth when comes Monday.
I am not of there ilk.

My dreams are for the future, yes, 
But they do not include my death.
For with the perfection of the nanite,
Comes the future in-finite,
Where sharing by none will mean plenty for all.

For this they would pity me.
I do not want the deluded one's sympathy.
All I would ask is that you not dictate
What you perceive to be the almighty's mandate.
To those that dream without constraint.

        CORRECTION OF ERRORS IN AND AROUND 
        THE PIERRE SALINGER TWA 800 REPORT 

        Part I

        by Ian Williams Goddard

        THE FOLLOWING are corrections of errors made by 
        major media in claims against the Pierre Salinger 
        TWA 800 report, and corrections of errors in the
        report. I am a coauthor of the Salinger Report.


        SALINGER REPORT MISQUOTE OF WITNESS

        FBI agent James Kallstrom said "most witnesses" 
        interviewed by the Salinger investigative team deny 
        what the Salinger Report says they said [1]. The only 
        example of a witnesses claiming this that I've found 
        was cited in the New York Times [2] as follows:

           [The Salinger Report] quotes Thomas Dougherty 
           of East Quogue, as saying, "My eyes were glued 
           to the TWA hitting the missile's flames."

           But Tuesday, Dougherty said in an inter-
           view that "I was misquoted" in the article. 
           He said that he saw what appeared to be a 
           flame streaking in the sky and an explosion, 
           but that he never saw a plane.

        (Note that the only way a missile-witness will find
        their way into the New York Times is if they can be 
        used to discredit the Navy-missile theory.)

        Indeed, as he tells the Times, Mr. Dougherty told me 
        that he did NOT see the plane until after it was hit
        and falling apart. I cannot account for the quotation 
        cited from the Salinger Report.  I should note that 
        the report was assembled by Pierre Salinger and Mike 
        Sommer and I cannot get hold of the final report as
        I cannot locate Mr. Sommer and Mr. Salinger went on 
        a vacation right after the release of the report. 

        Clearly the quotation that the NY Times cites from 
        the Salinger Report is typographically flawed. What 
        the report should read is: "Mr. Dougherty's eyes were 
        glued to the flame that shot upwards and hit TWA 800." 
        What I've stated about Mr. Dougherty's eyewitness 
        account can be found on the Internet [3].

        The portions of the Salinger Report that are derived 
        from my work -- hence my status as a coauthor -- are 
        derived from the carefully researched and referenced 
        reports I have posted publicly on the Internet [4].


        SALT I VIOLATION ?

        The Pierre Salinger TWA 800 Report suggests that an
        accidental downing of TWA 800 with a missile by the
        U.S. Navy could indicate a violation of SALT I arms-
        control agreements,  and that such violation could 
        be an incentive for a cover-up. I, a coauthor of the 
        Salinger Report,  studied the SALT I ABM Treaty [5] 
        months ago and concluded that it is not a likely 
        incentive for the cover-up [6].

        However, if the SM-2(IVA), which is an upper-tier
        Standard Missile, was used, which Salinger and I
        have proposed, then that would indeed violate the
        SALT I ABM Treaty. 

        The Washington Times (03/13/97, A10) countered 
        the SALT I claim in the Salinger Report:

            Mr. Salinger's claim the conventional 
            tactical missile used was one outlawed 
            by the first Strategic Arms Limitation 
            Treaty [SALT I] was disputed in Washington. 
            Arms Control Association Deputy Director 
            Jack Mendelsohn said, "SALT I dealt with 
            silos and nuclear missiles, and I have 
            no recollection of SALT I dealing with 
            any nonnuclear weapon like that."

        Wrong: SALT I did deal with missiles that are not 
        necessarily nuclear. SALT I was a series of Strategic 
        Arms Limitation Talks between the USSR and the USA 
        that occurred between November 1969 to May 1972.  
        During these talks the Treaty on the Limitation of 
        Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, also known as the 
        ABM Treaty, was drafted and later "entered into 
        force" on October, 3 1972 [7][5]. 

        The ABM Treaty placed limitations on the deployment 
        of anti-ballistic missiles -- any missile designed 
        to intercept nuclear-ballistic missiles -- and their
        missile systems.  This limitation would render any 
        anti-ballistic missile, such as the nonnuclear SM-2
        (IVA), fired or simply located off Long Island, a 
        violation of SALT I as the Salinger Report claims.

        The ABM Treaty allows the United States to possess 
        anti-ballistic missiles, including their launchers 
        and radar systems, in only four locations: 

        1. 150 km around Washington D.C. [8] 
        2. 150 km around Grand Forks ICBM silo launcher [9]
        3. White Sands, New Mexico, missile-test range [10]
        4. Kwajalein Atoll missile-test range [10] 

        The 1974 ABM Protocol established further limits [11].

        The areas near Long Island, where Navy missile activity 
        was not only scheduled but witnessed and photographed, 
        are outside the legal ABM zones. Therefore, the claim 
        implicit in the Salinger Report, that ABM deployment 
        off Long Island would violate SALT I, is correct.

        I just spoke with Arms Control Association Deputy 
        Director Jack Mendelsohn, quoted in the Washington 
        Times above. He pointed out that he was not fully 
        aware of the exact claims in the Salinger Report he 
        was asked to address.  Mr. Mendelsohn agreed that 
        IF the SM-2(IVA) with Kinetic-Kill Vehicle was used 
        off Long Island (which the Salinger Report suggests) 
        then, in his opinion, that would indeed violate the 
        SALT I ABM Treaty. However, he does not believe the 
        SM-2(IVA) is deployable. There is evidence to the 
        contrary, although it is not decisive. 

        The Washington Times states that the Salinger
        Report claims that the Continuous-Rod warhead is 
        outlawed by SALT I. That is not true: CR warheads
        are anti-aircraft, not ABM, missiles. I don't know
        how or why that claim was included in the report.

        The portions of the Salinger Report that are derived 
        from my work -- hence my status as a coauthor -- are 
        derived from the carefully researched and referenced 
        reports I have posted publicly on the Internet [4].

        I believe, in accord with the Salinger report and as
        based upon my research, that the U.S. Navy accidently 
        shot-down TWA 800 during an exercise where a missile 
        missed its test target (a drone missile) and hit TWA 
        800 instead. The drone missile was then photographed 
        over Long Island flying out of military zone W-105 [12].

Art is an abstract, a fuzzy concept both for the author as well as the
observer, and putting concrete definitions on "art" can be rather difficult. 

Defining a specific artistic concept is more approachable because it is less
difficult to explain an idea, per se.  It seems quite appropriate that the
author of an art piece (artefact or non-form) would want to explain what it
is he is doing.

Defining art genres, art forms, art movements, art styles, etc., is not such
a problem and people make a career out of it.  Art historians and theorists
are much in demand for not only educational reasons but for observers of art
as well. Defining art has been done for centuries and will continue to be
done as long as new ideas are generated, or old idea rehashed.

Cubism is defined.  Abstract Expressionism is defined. Op Art is defined.
Baroque music is defined. Techno music is defined.Modern dance is
defined.The Tango is defined.  Method acting is defined, performance art is
defined. A play, novel and prose are defined.

These examples meet certain criteria.  There is also art that does not meet
specific criteria, and many artists who enjoy exploring the fuzzy realms.
This in itself can be very creative, and adventuresome.  An artist can also
explain an idea of work by writing about it theoretically, or express it
through a feeling. Another example is an artist who is adept at psychology
and/or symbolism using an archetypical language to get the meaning across
subliminally.

I appreciate anyone who does not want to boundaries, signs and labels on the
general concept of "art."  For me, art is such a great experience, both
feeling and producing, that I want it to be what it is for me.  Yet art is
also objective and definable.

I don't think anyone who has participated in this debate is wrong.  Let each
pursue and experience life as he will.  But when art as a term, as a
profession, as a means of living is pigeonholed incorrectly, it draws my
attention quite profoundly. 

My suggestion is that if anyone wants to debate art, let's take it to a new
level.  Let's discuss major issues about creativity and art. Sarah had
initiated a thread that I did not place the focus I could have on it because
of time constraints. Shall we return to that?

Seeing this, I felt compelled to respond to Wendy and Phil as follows:

Having just read your manifesto hoping to ban human cloning, I felt I
must respond, in the name of human rights. What you are proposing to do
is to deny humans everywhere the ability to express in the purest way
that characteristic which is most notable about our species: our ability
to create, to reproduce, even when accidents of nature stand in the way. 
I am a libertarian, and as such hold that all that is right and good in
this world derives from respect for the concept that all power is
derived from the individual, that all rights originate from the
individual. To support any law, policy, regulation, or ideal which
opposes the rights of the individual is to denigrate the dignitiy of the
individual human in the most profound way.

For this reason, rather than acting in fear as you have apparently done,
I ask you to explore the possibility of proposing public policies which
will achieve the apparent goals of your "ban" while at the same time
maximizing individual human rights.

That every human has the right to freely procreate is recognised in all
civilized societies (which inferrs attendant responsibilities as well).
All civilized societies also recognize common concepts of intellectual
property, notably concepts like the patent, copyright, and trademarks.
Many people around the world have debated for several decades on the
subject of genetic information and intellectual property, especially in
the area of patents.

Your organization seems to be opposed to the potential for corporate
abuse of cloning technology to enslave humans by the patenting of DNA
sequences. In this I applaud you. How you wish to go about it though,
frankly scares me even more. At least in the marketplace, the public can
vote with its money on the business practices of corporations. In too
many countries, no such competition is allowed in the area of politics
and government. I fear even greater the possibility of government
monopolies of power abusing this technology in secret than I do in
corporations which must compete in the marketplace for public approval.

Due to this, I propose that your organization pursue a policy that
recognizes that 1) only human individuals can make claims of
intellectual property involving DNA, 2) each individual posesses primary
and majority ownership of his or her genetic intellectual property
present in his or her own DNA, which cannot be assigned, waived, leased
or sold. 2) each individual posesses secondary and guardian ownership of
all other individuals posessing copies, in whole (clone) or in part
(natural fertilization) until those individuals attain adult legal
status, or if the state intervenes in the interest of the derived
individual, as is now done in juvinile court, or by various departments
of education, health and human services, etc. Each derived generation,
in whole or in part is to be regarded in the same manner as "next of
kin" are legally today in natural born families. 3) These intellectual
property rights infer responsibilities of stewardship, which if
neglected or abused shall constitute severe human rights violations
punishable under expansions of current law.

By becoming proponents of this sort of policy, we establish primary
political ownership of ANY sort of reproduction or creation of ANY sort
of intellectual property in the hands of the individual, who is free to
choose as is his or her right how and when and where to exercise those
rights, without violating those of others. THus no government, nor any
corporation can ever commit such abuse without the expressed approval of
each and every individual involved. We reinforce the concept that
political power flows from the individual, and governments and
corporations weild power only as delegated by free individuals. By tying
these rights together, an assault on one aspect is an assault on the
whole.

To the contrary, one can meaningfully define "Extropian writing" so as to
include writings that do not embody Extropian attitudes.  An anthropologist
studying Extropian culture would almost certainly include in her sample set a
variety of writings--such as those that routinely appear on this list--that
constitute mere chatter or jest.  She could quite justifiably call these
"Extropian writings", as they reveal much about Extropian culture (if not
philosophy).

(Note, however, that this does not imply that *anti-Extropian* writings must
qualify as "Extropic writing" under a source-base definition.  I set aside
that issue for now, recognizing it as problematic but no more so than
potential disputes about whether or not an artwork embodies Extropian
values.)

>Similarly, Extropic Art is art that embodies extropic ideas and values.

This claim need not hold true under the source-based definition that I've
described.  Extropic Art would, on such a view, win that label because it
issues from people who call themselves Extropians.  Example:  I write
instrumental music as a hobby.  An anthropologist might well include such
music in a collection of "Extropic Art", even though it carries no particular
message.

Oh, I agree absolutely.  The point of my comments has been to offer an
alternative  approach to the problem of defining Extropic art.  A
source-based definition can give fairly clear boundaries, I think, and avoids
mystification.  Nonetheless, I for now remain agnostic about whether one
ought to embrace a content-, intent-, or source-based definition.  It suffices
, for present purposes, to understand that "define it by content or not at
all!" constitutes a false dichotomy.

Gregory Houston claimed that I (inadequately and contrary to my professed

enjoying it.  Then, in a message dated 3/18/97 8:33:10 PM, he really set my

Should I take this as a self-contradicting definition of "definition", or as

(See why I wanted to avoid talking about definitions of definitions?)

General Relativity is not compatible with Quantum theory and breaks down

I think that 50,000 x 1 million = 50 billion, still a pretty big industry,

Out of context, the above statement, made by myself, is certainly
contradictory and inadequate. In context I do not believe that was the
case. Agreed, it was not articulated well, but I was pointing out that
when we define something, making ourselves aware of that things limits,
we can then question those limits. In that sense, "Definitions DO NOT
LIMIT things", yet make it possible to transcend the current limits of
things. The refusal to define things more often limits things, because
we are refusing to become consciously aware of the existing limits, and
thus we are unable to question those limits. 

I was trying to point out, that even though a person may not consciously
articulate their definition of art, they still have a subconscious
definition of art. The definition exists. It is only a matter of wether
that person wishes to articulate and question it or not. A person
recognizes art by their definition of art, and if a person claims to
have no definition for art, yet is still capable of recognizing art,
then that person is simply unaware of their subconscious definition ...
for art. 

With that I'm done with the "definition" thread. I think it is now
fairly agreed that definitions of art have value.

My apologies for making your head spin Tom, though vertigo is one of my
particularly favorite sensations.

I agree with you on all counts. I was only attempting to illustrate the
validity of a scientificly objective use of art. I believe I have done
that. In the process we ran off on a tangent debating what objectivity
is. And I agree with you that it is relative to an era. However I do not
believe that fairy tales, and mythology are objective today, atleast not
in modern society. In the past perhaps, but today, no. Thats not to say
that fairy tales and mythology have no use to us today. I haven't really
given that much thought. It only means that they are not useful in
helping me understand how the universe was created and how it works. The
fact that fairy tales and mythology are no longer objective does not
make them subjective. It makes them ill informed. I believe you accused
me of calling fairy tales and mythology subjective, but I do not recall
making any such statement. Perhaps it would have been better to have
said they are less objective than what is objective today so that their
would be no confusion of me implying subjectivity.

I define subjective statements as value judgements, and objective
statements as unbiased observations. By these definitions of
subjectivity and objectivity did I initially make my definitions of
subjective and objective uses of art.

    Those new life forms are possible, and they are us.  Twenty years
ago, it would--and did--take me months to do the some of the things I
currently do several times per week.  The web has become an extension
of my memory, and I use it as such.  I may not seem godlike to you, or
to me for that matter, but as for the me of twenty years ago, he would
feel like your 2-year-old above.  Not dumb, but with decades of
learning required to catch up.

   Also twenty years ago the P?=NP issue was very hot.  Today, we are
working on quantum computers where the answer probably not only will
be P=NP, but P=NP=O(1).*

   Nice image.  I've always looked at it this way:  How long will it
take for computer technology to get to the point where I can design an
Drexlerian assembler in my spare time?  I figure less than 20 years.
Will the technology be there to convert than design into silicon or
whatever?  Sure.  If the tools are not available, designing and
building some of them will be an extra weekend project by then.

   I'll give you a different problem to worry about...  There are
people of all ages today who are falling off the technological
bandwagon.  Those who manage to stay on the tiger (Mixed metaphores?
Why not?), are getting further and further ahead of those not on
board.  Will there be a point at which no one not already on the train
can get on?  Sure looks like it.  That is the problem I worry about.

    Not that machines will become like gods and obsolete the human
race.  The direction we are approaching the future from means that
systems including people and machines will always have the edge.  But
that we need to constantly work at making it possible for our children
to have a place in the future.  Today's educational system is woefully
inadequate to prepare anyone for life in the eighties.  It will take a
revolution (and one is going on but a lot of the educational community
is trying to stay out of it) to provide an educational system adequate
for the next century^H^H^H^H^H^H^H decade.

   I'm still not convinced that it is possible for the two to arrive
in that order.  And at fifty-one, I may not make it into your first
gods category, but I suspect that a majority of those reading this
will.

   There is a story I like to tell to put this in perspective.  At my
sister's eighteenth birthday party, we were all gathered around the
television waiting for Neal Armstrong to open the Eagle's door.  I had
worked on the ACG (Apollo Guidance Computer), my father had designed
and built power supplies for the radars at Cape Canaveral (before it
became Kennedy Spaceflight Center).  My mother's father, Bud
Eichelburger, also there had literally learned to fly from the Wright
Brothers, and flew fighters in France in WWI.  His wife, also there
knew all the original seven astronauts, and had flown with them (but
on commercial flights).  That, however, is another story.

   For something to do while the pressure was being pumped down in the
LEM, I started telling some of the story behind the story of the
camera that would record the first steps on the moon, and why this one
was black and white.  In particular, I explained that although Apollo
8 had shown the advantages of taking a color TV camera to the moon,
that even getting this black and white camera on the LM had been
difficult, and it almost hadn't made it.

   At this point the camera was turned on, and my mother read the
caption...  "Live from the moon! When I was a child we said that
something was as likely as flying to the moon when we meant that it
was impossible."

   Her father interrupted. "Helen, remember the night I came up to
your bedroom and said that an Army budd of mine was leaving on a
flight, and I might never have a chance to see him again?  Then we
took the train up to New York to see him off?  I never though
Lindburgh would make it!"

   A few years later I was sitting with Bud, watching Voyager II
pictures captioned "Live from Saturn".  I quoted his previous line
about Lindburgh and we all had a good laugh.  Since then, whenever
someone has told me that something wouldn't happen in my lifetime, I
just laugh.

   *For those of you to whom this is so much gibberish, a translation
that any competent complexity theorist will cringe at: Twenty years
ago: If P is not equal to NP, there is a large set of problems which
we can never hope to solve.  If P = NP, then those problems are
theoretically but not practically within reach.  Today: We are solving
problems that twenty years ago looked to be totally beyond the pale,
and quantum computers will be here soon.  If quantum computers can
solve NP-complete problems as seems probable, then any mathematical
problem with an answer that can be easily shown to be correct will be
computable in under a second.

   For scale, the largest hard composite numbers, factored in days or
weeks 20 years ago, are today factored in seconds.  The most recent
results in this area used thousands of MIPS years of computer time.
Quantum computers may soon solve that problem in fractions of a
second.  To give you a practical example of why this is important even
ten years ago "routing" a chip or a PC board could take weeks of CPU
time, even with a dedicated engineer to help.  Showing that a given
routing meets all the design rules is in NP, as is the design of a
working assembler.

RJ quoting David Stove: "...No ideal could be more destructive of human
life than the ideal of non-coerciveness.  [The only way] of producing a
non-coercive human being is to produce an autistic one. . . .">

Tom Morrow: <This sorely mischaracterizes coercion, human life, and autism.
 Indeed, the reverse of what Stove claims holds more true:  Coercion
destroys human life, both literally and figuratively.  Stove's criticism
makes the fatal error of confounding coercion with intellectual debate.>

No, it is Nozick himself who utterly abandons intellectual debate in the
interest of "non-coercion."  He held that it would be wrong "to get someone
to believe something whether he wants to believe it or not."  This is the
very opposite of intellectual debate, it is passivity of the most radical
kind this side of the grave.

Much of what passes for "intellectual debate" today, in any case, consists
largely of coercion, in the form of massive fraud.  Fraudulent values,
meanings, and facts are served up regularly throughout our society, coupled
with a spiking of the truth, by our most important institutions.

Tom: <Autism, in the sense of folding in on oneself, follows from contact
with a violent world--not a non-coercive one.>

Factually, autism does not follow from contact with a violent world.  A
large study of autism was conducted and reported by Tina Adler in "Science
News" (April 16, 1994: 248-9), "Comprehending Those Who Can't Relate."

  "The study suggests that while normal people use logic to analyze risks
before making decisions, their brains also give them an automatic emotional
warning signal that the patients' brains fail to produce....  The patients
'run purely on cognition... and if you are going to run your personal and
social life on logic alone, it's not going to work....'  The... findings...
suggest that.... 'withdrawn people... focus on too narrow a range of the
environment, and this seems to confirm it.'  Autism reveals to scientists
what happens when the underpinnings of social behavior become seriously
unglued."

The article goes on to discuss different manifestations of the social
problems that develop when the focus of attention is too narrow, and the
working memory is inefficient.  This is exactly the problem with those
individuals who adopt Nozick's radically "non-coercion" philosophy of: 'I
do not interfere with others.  Let them not interfere with me.'  The
premise is utterly false, but they do not comprehend this fact, because
they make too literal an interpretation of it (too narrow focus of
attention), and their working memory is inefficent through a wilful
disregard of the "unintended consequences of life processes," which, in
fact, are routinely coercive all by themselves.  The autism reveals itself
as a closed and dishonest unawareness of the way an individual impinges
without permission or compensation, on living entities all around them.

Mark Crosby wrote 3/17/97: <certainty is a subjective feeling, not an
objective truth.  I'm also certain that we can never be completely certain
about most *things*, as opposed to *feelings*.... I agree that the most
important thing is, as you [Jeff Dee] say, to be always questioning, trying
to reduce uncertainty.>

I wrote in "Extropy" #15: "We achieve internal certainty through awareness
that our subjective thoughts are objective truth to others.  We embody
truth, we alone can be certain of our purposes because we can decide them
instant by instant....  Coherency of purposes and values coupled with
certainty is the desired condition prior to action.  This is the biggest
enhancement of consciousness we can achieve immediately."  What you, Mark,
are thinking (not "feeling" because we don't want to sound like flaky
emotivists) right now, the certainty you have in deciding your purposes
instant by instant, is objective truth to me.

I cannot quite get inside your head and access your exact thoughts (the
qualia problem), but I can approach it using various methods of reducing
uncertainty.  I wrote in the history paper: "It's the reduction of
uncertainty in the incoming stream of continuous reality that tells us
somewhat of the precursors to this stream.  The evolution of consciousness
is accelerated as we get better at this.  We increase our ability to choose
more adaptive paths of action as we anticipate future dangers that would
threaten our purposes."  So I am in agreement with you and Jeff here
regarding the importance of reducing uncertainty, this is science's primary
role.  I am uncertain that "we can never be completely certain about most
things," if you qualify the statement to read "most *important* things." 
Our ability to be certain about things and thoughts is tied very intimately
to their importance to us.  Importance fluctuates over time and within
contexts, our certainty therefore blips in and out.

Certainty is a liquid realm concept, it is the conjunction of consciousness
(chaotic realm) and being (ordered realm).  Another way to look at the
central position certainty has in our lives, is to picture consciousness as
a coherent dynamic energy pattern operating in the past formulating
purposes - Cramer's backwards-in-time microcausality Omega was posting
about (transactional interpretation of QM); aimed at and stabilizing in the
now - being or the particulate substance of the universe; then springing
forth from this ordered foundation into the chosen future, existence itself
- Cramer's forwards-in-time microcausality.  We may choose entropic
purposes that lead to loss of pattern coherency, we may miss our footing
springing from being, our chosen future may go awry in conflict with other
entities or brute necessity, but certainty lifts us above inanimate matter
and low-level life forms.

The compost-modern worship of the will-to-power that replaced waning
interest in truth, had nowhere to go except, as Deleuze & Guattari said,
"turning to destruction, abolition pure and simple, the passion of
abolition."  The strenuous efforts by the cultural elites (both humanists &
technicists share the same culture regarding this) to abolish certainty in
favor of radical skepticism (nihilism) have one objective:  the denial of a
future for humanity.  The passion of abolition that sets in, once the truth
has been jettisoned, doesn't abate until we sink back to the animal's level
or lower.  A culture with an impoverished epistemology of
'criticism-unto-destruction' will result in destruction all right, the
destruction of the critic.  This is what the Unamuno quote was getting at.

Mark: <Am I to conclude from [the Unamuno quote] that reason is inimicable
to life? I think not - that would be a dualistic copout. Rather, BOTH will
AND reason, empirical induction and conceptual deduction, will compete to
make the extropic transformation. Which we *emphasize* does not depend on
truth, but on perspective or, dare I say it, utility.>

Indeed it would be a cop-out, Unamuno achieved penetrating philosophical
insights by his conceptualizing of life and reason competing, very
fruitful.  I largely agree with what you say, I would not give a privileged
position to either truth or utility, but perspective is closely related to
meaning, and I would give that which increases meaning in our lives, a
privileged position when it comes to which we emphasize.

Mark: <Don't misinterpret me: Baudrillard seeks dissolution because he
thinks 
this is an awful world, while I, as an Extropian, would seek coherence 
- drawing out the truth and beauty from amidst the overwhelming noise 
and decay.  But, is this not also a seduction of reality?>

Are all seductions bad?

Mark: <I see these "creative interpretations" as deductions - I want it to
be 
so, even though it is not yet so (or my interpretation is incomplete), 
so I will do my best to make it so!>

I agree with you here.  The only danger is that pure deduction can lead
completely away from truth, or objective reality; and land you in a
solipsistic backwater of subjective reality leaving you vulnerable to
unpleasant surprises in real life.  Pure deduction loses all meaning unless
it is correlated to ontological particulars.  I guess the method of
correlating would be the extropic transformation referred to above.

Mark: <Now, I have not read Popper.  About all I knew about Popper prior to

this was his notions of Worlds 1-3.  Until now I had associated these 
with Reilly's more elegant notions of ordered, chaotic and liquid 
realms.>

Popper's worlds were essentially epistemological divisions, similar to
Edmund Husserl's earlier divisions.  My epistemological divisions, or
boundaries in aspectual reality space, I posted some time ago on the
E-list: subjective reality ("I"), consensual reality ("We"), and objective
reality ("They/It") - a three-in-one unity, three unbridgeable
epistemological aspects of one underlying reality.  The notions of chaotic,
liquid and ordered realms are ontological, not epistemological.

Mark: <I too prefer truth / verity rather doubt, problems and refutations; 
but, as Reilly has said in his "Extropic Thought" essay, "dualism is 
philosophy's perennial cop-out". And, a few paragraphs later in that 
same essay Reilly says: "Concepts are pruned to our desire for truth 
through methods of falsifiability or verifiability." I notice he says 
"or", not "and".>

The portion of the history paper you are quoting from was a discussion of
why some concepts last and others don't.  In describing different
scientific methods, I used 'or' rather than 'and' because most scientists
today do not attempt to simultaneously satisfy both principles,
philosophical "dualism" doesn't come into play.  I don't concentrate on the
pros and cons of the methods, although I do emphasize the peripheral nature
of falsifiability vs. the centrality of verifiability regarding the
longevity of concepts.

"Following (to some degree) W.V. Quine's formulation of how scientific
choices are made as to which concepts to keep and which to discard, there
exists a coherent web of peripheral concepts surrounding a central core of
interdefined concepts.  When observations are at variance with what we
predicted, we generally rearrange the exterior web of concepts far more
readily than we discard the central core of concepts.  Thus, falsifiability
tends to function peripherally, and is identified with coherency theories
of truth, with closed-system definitions, axioms and logical deductions. 
The central core of concepts generally have been verified through the
physical mediation of technology between value-laden concepts and objective
physical reality.  That is to say, these central concepts either work or
they don't work; as technology develops, the central concepts develop. 
Thus, verifiability tends to function centrally, and is identified with
correspondence theories of truth, within open systems."

George Gilder talked about the centrality of verifiability in "Forbes ASAP"
(Dec. 2,1996): "The cumulative facts of science manifest themselves in
technology, powerful and practical machines that cumulatively and
empirically validate the new paradigms and generate new science in the
process."

Mark: <Reilly contends that the farther we go, the *more* we know.  While
this is true, it is also true that the more we know, the more we realize
how much more there is still to be learned. Acknowledging this does not
mean one has sunk into irrationalism!>

Nor was this either Stove's, Kimball's or my suggestion.

RJ: <We acquire knowledge by directing our internal searchlight at the 
metaphysical unknown in search of something we can call a problem to 
work on. As our searchlight sweeps the metaphysical night sky, we map 
what reveals itself in the beam and interpret the map according to our 
utility of the moment.>

Mark: <Is this not similar to the functionalism (or was it utilitarianism) 
that you were criticizing Gregory Houston for a month ago? Is this 
"inventing purposes" or "pursuing truth", and how can you so certainly 
draw this fine line for someone other than yourself?>

It is pursuing truth.  I am not describing looking for lies, I am
describing looking at objective reality on the other side of the
epistemological boundary between it and our subjective reality ("I").  The
boundary itself is where metaphysics opens up.  When Gregory Houston wrote
"I have no desire to attain truth," he announced he was looking elsewhere
than at objective reality, that he wasn't going to bother with the maps. 
This is not a fine line, but a rather wide flourescent yellow line. 
Utilitarianism is all purpose, no truth; all meaning rapidly bleeds away.

Guru George wrote 3/17/97: <...unless you believe in some queer magical
connection between what we say and the way the world is such that there is
some logically necessary link between them (which denies the very principle
of objectivity, which says that there is *no* such logically necessary
connection, that the world exists the way it does independently of our
whims, our thoughts and theories) you*must* (logically!) be a Popperian.>

Logically, you can't find anywhere where "you" end, and some "world," not
containing "you," begins to independently exist.  Logically, no notion of
"indepedence" can possibly have any meaning unless it is ultimately in
relation to transcendence.  Independent from what?  You can't draw any
lines, separate out any entities or objects, anywhere in a continuous
space.  The category boundaries are arbitrary, based on our whims.  This is
the unity of the underlying ontology.

Certainly, there are epistemological boundaries to be drawn, between you
and the world, between you and others, between others and the world. 
Criticism-unto-destruction may be one methodology (or at least an
interesting spectator sport from a safe distance) between others and the
world, but it is not necessarily a very healthy attitude between you and
others (certainly it is very destructive regarding intimacy and trust), and
it is utterly inapplicable between you and the world (you're on your own
there).

Oh my.  Armchair pschoanalytical attributions of emotional defects to other
individuals' reasoning processes does not make those reasoning processes
irrational.  The armchair stance itself is irrational; it is not reasoning,
it is political invective.  Popper's "carefully reasoned ideas," as you put
it, were in fact, sloppily executed attempts to unsuccessfully deduce his
way out of a wet paper bag.  See the fatal critique below.

Guru George wrote 3/17/97: <Sorry to disagree with you Reilly, but I have
to say that Stove's critique of Popper is complete bollocks - much as I
enjoy Stove's acidic style.  The point of 'falsifiability' is this: if you
are serious about using experience to test theory then the only way you can
*logically* do so is deductively: you deduce empirical consequences from a
theory, and if those experiences don't pan out, then the theory logically
*must* be false.>

So you give Stove an A for style, and an F for content.  Does that average
out to a C?  ;)  See the fatal critique below.

Guru: <But there is no such thing as a *logic* of induction: there is no
logical *necessity* to induction, no logical 'must', like you get in
deduction: this is what Hume showed.>

Stove reportedly held Hume in the highest regard, but this did not prevent
him from correcting Hume's 'perfectionistic' errors.  I have a strong
hunch, but I am not certain <g>, that your concerns are addressed by Stove
in his technical works "Rationality of Induction" (1986), and "Probability
and Hume's Inductive Skepticism" (1973).

Stove's point about the efficacy of the cumulative results of induction,
can be seen in a common-sensical way if you picture yourself as a scientist
seeking grant money from the government or private sources to do scientific
experiments.  It is commonplace to obtain funding for an experiment seeking
to verify predictions of a highly regarded (meaning politically sanctioned)
theory, or to perform duplicate experiments to immediately verify previous
highly regarded experimental results.  But it is hard to obtain funding for
doing experiments on 'crackpot' theories (where did the authority to label
them 'crackpot' come from?), and it becomes exceedingly difficult to fund
the duplication of well-established experimental results more than a few
times.

Now, Guru George says that "Popper's idea is that we ought to test our
ideas to destruction."  But this is clearly irrational on the face of it. 
No scientist, and no funding agency, is going to indefinitely work on
duplicating the same experiment over and over and over, "to destruction." 
Scientists working in the real world don't want to waste their lives
increasing the cumulative inductive probabilities from a very high
percentage to an infinitesimally higher percentage; nor do agencies with
money to spend on science.  This is the real rational world, not Popper's
irrational critical-unto-destruction world.

All right, out of the purest, most unselfish, highest altruistic extropian
motives, I will, as a public service to all interested newbies on the list,
repost the fatal criticism of Popper's falsifiability principle.

--------------------------

>From "PHIL: Questioning Popperianism" 3/8/95:

Quotes from Elliott Sober's "Philosophy of Biology"  (1993):

  "Popper's criterion of falsifiability requires that we be able to single
out a special class of sentences and call them observation sentences.  A
proposition is then said to be falsifiable precisely when it is related to
observation sentences in a special way:  Proposition P is falsifiable if
and only if P deductively implies at least one observation sentence O.  One
problem with Popper's proposal is that it requires that the distinction
between observation statements and other statements be made precise.  To
check the statement 'The chicken is dead,' you must know what a chicken is
and what death is.  *This problem is sometimes expressed by saying that
observation is theory laden.*   Every claim that people make about what
they observe depends for its justification on their possessing prior
information.  Popper addresses this problem by saying that what one regards
as an observation statement is a matter of convention.  But this solution
will hardly help one tell, in a problematic case, whether a statement is
falsifiable.  For Popper's criterion to have some bite, there must be a
nonarbitrary way to distinguish observation sentences from the rest.  To
date, no one has managed to do this in a satisfactory manner.

  The problems with Popper's falsifiability criterion go deeper.  First,
there is the so-called tacking problem.  Suppose that some proposition S is
falsifiable.  It immediately follows that the conjunction of S and any
other proposition N is falsifiable as well.  That is, if S makes
predictions that can be checked observationally, so does the conjunction S
& N.  This is an embarrassment to Popper's proposal since he wanted that
proposal to separate nonscientific propositions N from properly scientific
propositions S.  Presumably, if N is not scientifically respectable,
neither is S & N.  The falsifiability criterion does not obey this
plausible requirement.

  Another problem with Popper's proposal is that it has peculiar
implications about the relation of a proposition to its negation.  Consider
a statement of the form 'All As are B.'  Popper judges this statement
falsifiable since it would be falsified by observing a single A that fails
to be B.  But now consider the negation of the generalization-the statement
that say 'There exists an object that is both A and not-B.'  This statement
is not  falsifiable; no single observed object or finite collection of them
can falsify this existence claim.  So the generalization is falsifiable,
though its negation is not.  But this is very odd-presumably, if a
statement is 'scientific,' so is its negation.  *This suggests that
falsifiability is not a good criterion for being scientific.*

  Still another problem with Popper's proposal is that most theoretical
statements in science do not, all by themselves, make predictions about
what can be checked observationally.  Theories make testable predictions
only when they are conjoined with auxiliary assumptions.  Typically, T does
not deductively imply O; rather, it is T & A that deductively implies O
(here, T is a theory, O is an observation statement, and A is a set of
auxiliary assumptions).  This idea is sometimes called Duhem's Thesis...

  The final problem with Popper's proposal is that it entails that
probability statements in science are unfalsifiable.  Consider the
statement that a coin is fair-that its probability of landing heads when
tossed is 0.5.  ...It is possible for a fair coin to land heads on all ten
tosses, to land heads on nine and tails on one, and so on.  Probability
statements are not falsifiable in Popper's sense.  In fact, something like
the Likelihood Principle is what Popper himself adopted when he recognized
that probability statements are not falsifiable.

  Popper held that there is an asymmetry between falsification and
verification.  A vestige of Popper's asymmetry can be restored if we
include the premiss that the auxiliary assumptions (A) are true:

Falsification          Verification
If T & A, then O       If T & A, then O
A                      A
not-O                  O
--------               --------
not-T                  T
deductively valid      deductively invalid

  Although we now seem to have a difference between verification and
falsification, it is important to notice that the argument falsifying T
requires that we be able to assert that the auxiliary assumptions A are
true.  Auxiliary assumptions are often highly theoretical; if we can't
verify A, we will not be able to falsify T by using the deductively valid
argument form just described.  In the last pair of displayed arguments, one
is deductively valid and the other is not.  However, this does nothing to
support Popper's asymmetry thesis.  In fact, we should draw precisely the
opposite conclusion:  The left-hand argument suggests that if we cannot
verify theoretical statements, then we cannot falsify them either.

  One problem with Popper's asymmetry thesis is that it equates what can be
known with what can be deduced validly from observation statements. 
However, science often makes use of nondeductive argumentation, in which
the conclusion is said to be rendered plausible or to be well supported by
the premisses.  In such arguments, the premisses do not absolutely
guarantee that the conclusion must be true.

  On the face of it, vulnerability appears to be a defect, not a virtue. 
Why is it desirable that the hypotheses we believe should be refutable? 
Wouldn't science be more secure if it were invulnerable to empirical
disconfirmation?  The Likelihood Principle helps answer these questions.  A
consequence of this principle is that if O favors H1 over H2, then not-O
would favor H2 over H1.  This is because if P(O/H1) > P(O/H2), then
P(not-O/H1) < P(not-O/H1).  We want our beliefs to be supported by
observational evidence.  For this to be possible, they must be vulnerable;
there must be possible observations that would count against them.  This
requirement is not a vestige of the discredited falsifiability criterion. 
It flows from the Likelihood Principle itself."

--------------------------

>From "PHIL: Questioning Popperianism" 3/10/95:

My commentary on Sober's quotes:  I agree with Sober that falsifiability is
not a criterion for a scientific proposition, his points are valid.

His points about there being no "nonarbitrary way to distinguish
observation sentences from the rest" and "observation is theory laden" deal
with semantic and logical limitations inherent in our biological nature.  I
think that deductive logic and mathematics are wonderful tools for
producing truth.  The truth they produce, however, is bounded within the
axiomatic system chosen.  Popper's desire to produce truth by limiting it
to deductive logical observation statements that can be falsified is a
narrow view typical of any evolving system of science approaching nullity
(the only end result of criticism or skepticism).  The tacking problem, the
negation problem, the auxiliary statements problem are all related to this
narrowness of view that plagues deduction.

The point about probability statements not being falsifiable addresses
induction problems, such as Hume's critique about the deductive disconnect
between cause and effect.  Any time probabilty is used anywhere, for
anything, it is an announcement of ignorance of what will happen next,
meaning an ignorance of causes.  Probability statements are maps of
objective truth, generalizations open to interpretations from whatever
theory you subscribe to at the moment that satisfies your needs.

To me, verifiability is every bit as important as falsifiability is.  I
agree that where possible, we want our beliefs to be supported by
vulnerable observational evidence.  Experimental evidence, though, begins
with theory which is wide-open, and ends with relative boundaries being
drawn around events and objects that constitute what the experiment is, and
what the evidence is.  The only real event and object that can be described
in an absolute sense, is the whole universe.  Since we can't do this, we
fall back on utility, we describe each event and object as best fits our
needs of the moment while aiming at truth.  In science, we try to get as
much consensual agreement on these relative boundaries as possible, so that
our experiments can be repeated.  Obviously, no experiment or event is ever
exactly duplicated.  All events are historical, unique and irreversible,
but many scientifically agreed on events are similar enough to suit our
needs of the moment.  Verifiability occurs when we bring scientific
knowledge to bear on our life through technology.  Science is verified
through practical usefulness in hard material reality.

First international coference for the development of new technologies for 
micro-aircraft was recently held at the Georgia Tech Research Institute.
DARPA of DoD will finance such projects. Future tiny aircraft are meant
for recon missions within destroyed buildings and of contaminated land.
This set of demands imposes novel aerodynamic constraints, moreover
the microremote cum cargo must weigh <50 g, and be capable of fully
autonomous flight. http://spbtrc.gtri.gatech.edu/MicroVehicle/

Both Visible Human data sets are now commercially available on CDROM,
albeit in reduced resolution (original: man 15 GByte, woman 25 GByte,
since interslice distance 0.33 mm).
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html

NEC has a 4 GBit DRAM developed. 0.15 um structures, a four-level process.
Memory bandwidth is 1 Gbit/s at 125 MHz clock. Commercial availability
not before the year 2000.

Mercedes and debis Telematic Services currently develop their TeleAid,
Telematic Alarm Identification on Demand. It triggers alarm either on
demand or automagically (e.g. after a heavy car crash). Information is
sent via D-Net (paneuropean cellular) is car ID, last GPS fix, and a
time stamp. Also, a speech link is attempted. Alarm is routed via debis
to local police Einsatzzentrale, which then dispatches a regional rescue
team. (Notice: we could now had a personal wearable biotracker developed,
the technology is all there. Notice Hara Ra's project).

What we need to do is to make technology teach about itself. The only
teacher that can keep up with technology's pace is technology itself.

Technology should be dead simple and yet still explain the underlying
technology/methods. If this doesn't happen we will loose most of mankind in
ignorance and only the technoelite will have wealth and power.
The Marshall help just after WW2 is a good example. The US didn't just
grant us Europeans all those money to be nice but also to create a market
for their own products in the future. I don't think it can be argued that
they succeded.

If a single group of people are rich they are not as rich as they could be,
if there were more rich people. Therefore we must at all cost try to avoid
that the technoelite is the only rich/powerfull group. It would make all
the poorer. Including the technoelite.

Oops, your right.  In the real world I would have just written 5*10(to the

I agree. While I certainly find transhumanism and progress worthwhile even
if they will be used by a smaller subset of humanity, I would like to make
it accessible to everyone. Maybe I'm a bleeding heart transhumanist :-)

Good idea. One problem is that a teacher is just a half of the team, the 
student must be able to learn well too. And this might be hard to do if 
technology accelerates too much and we don't have good intelligence 
amplification systems. 

One of the things I have been thinking of is to create a "knowledge 
infrastructure" for people to learn in. After all, what we learn in 
school is quickly forgotten or obsolete, so we need to learn continually. 
The idea is to use the Net for "micro-course" you could take to orient 
yourself in a subject you briefly need (for example, today I needed 
to learn about Hidden Markov Models so that I could write a subsection of 
my thesis), helping you get a feel for what it is about. If you need 
deeper knowledge, you could enroll in more elaborate courses, both 
net-based and physical, or in classical education. The idea is to make 
learning accessible and possible in daily life; ideally everybody should 
learn new things continously throughout life, with few strictly 
educational or working periods.

Exactly. This is the goal of much interface design, but it is a very hard 
problem. I fear that we might get nanotech and uploading long before 
somebody invents a truly good GUI.

We are at one! And I must say I've thoroughly enjoyed this 'debate'. I
would only add the following minor comments, which are intended as
rhetorical and reflexive, unless anyone has strong feelings about them.

<snip>

I would qualify that to say, "at least not in Western society today". By
either of our definitions of objectivism (see below) mythology may be
objective in societies other than our own, which have no history of thought
counter to mythology. (Actually, an individual in a society which does have
a history of thought counter to mythology may be objective in his/her
belief in mythology if he/she doesn't know of that contrary history.
Objectivity cannot require knowledge of everything. Reaching a reasonable
decision, on the other hand...)

>The
>fact that fairy tales and mythology are no longer objective does not
>make them subjective.

Interesting point: I would tend to say that any educated Western person who
placed, say, astrology above statistics was not being objective. Yet can I
validly say that? Is such a person's decision any more or less biased than
my own belief in science (by your definition)? Or is such a person's
decision giving any less priority to statements of others than my would (by
my definition)? Tricky. 

>I define subjective statements as value judgements, and objective
>statements as unbiased observations.

I'd use the definitions whereby objectivism is the prioritization of
existing corpuses of knowledge created by others in the reaching of a
decision, whilst subjectivism prioritizes ones own thoughts. These are not
disimilar to your definitions, but reflect my belief that (a) even
objective decisions require at least the value judgement, 'The thoughts of
others are valid to inform my decision,' and (b) there is bound to be bias
in reaching an objective decision, even if only as to which 'others' one
listens to as a priority (this bias allows me to place Western
post-Enlightenment rationalism above Eastern mysticism, for example).


Once again, thanks for the discourse, Gregory.

I disagree. The anthropologist would be mistaken, *unless* she noted that
she was including non-extropian writings of well known extropians to
satisfy the curiosity of readers. If an Extropian writes something clearly
not extropian, then it doesn't become extropian simply because they wrote it. 

As I noted, there are fuzzy areas where something is compatible with
extropian attitudes but not particularly expressive of them. I think the
only sensible argument would be whether "Extropian writing" refers to
writing with an obviously extropian content, or should include writings by
an Extropian that does not obviously embody extropian ideas (so long as it
does not embody unextropian ideas like glorification of death). The same
points apply, mutatis mutandis to Extropic Art.

Put it this way: Let's say Painter A typically paints in a Cubist style.
You're producing two art history books, one on Cubism and one on Abstract
Expressionism. (If these are not the best examples of a sharply differing
contrast please substitute appropriately.) Painter A did one or two
paintings in Abstract Expressionist mode. Would you include those in the
Cubism book? Or in the Abstract Expressionist book? Clearly they belong in
the latter book. The fact that Painter A has usually been a Cubist does not
make a piece of Abstract Expressionism into a Cubist work.

What I'm saying is that a source-based definition is not a basic
definition. It's only an approximation. Someone who could reasonably be
called a Cubist generally produces Cubist Art. So we can usually say the
works of this Cubist are Cubist. But this won't always be true. It's the
content (or, rather, the style in this case) that makes them Cubist. It's
the content that makes Extropic Art extropic, not the source.

No it's not a false dichotomy. The source-based definition is parasitic on
the content-based definition. To deny this is to cut loose any
comprehensible understanding of a genre. Work by an Extropic Artist can
generally be assumed to be extropic because the source is extropian. But
sometimes it may not be. The way to decide that is to check the contents.
The answer to "Is this piece of work extropic?" may not always have a clear
answer but trying to answer it is the only way to determine the
extropicness of the art. Extropic ideas are consistent, people are not always.

The definition and explanation of Extropic Art in Natasha's Extropic Art
Manifesto seems to me to do a fine job of defining  the genre in terms of
its content. The great value of the Manifesto is in its potential to spread
our ideas through new avenues, and to affect people on levels other than
the analytical.

That would be fine, but .005 C is 1,500 km/sec, which is really fast for
something big enough to function for the 1000 or so years it would need to
get to a nearby star (5 ly).  

But, to be fair, if we have on average 100,000,000 years and need to travel
1,000 ly, 1/100,000 of the speed of light will do (3 km/sec).  If deep-space
colonization is possible at all, that is certainly doable.  So I guess
gamma-ray bursters aren't a serious problem for any deep-space civilization
bigger than one burst.

The limiting factor for survival is not cubic volume, but infrastructure.
 That's bound to be in limited supply, and because building burst-hardened
infrastructure is very expensive, there will be very little built to survive
a burst unless we have plenty of warning and a fair amount of determination.

Population density will be much higher for inhabited space, obviously.  In
any case, it's irrelevant, as space and the things in it need a lot of work
before they are suitable for human occupation through a 100-year flare of
hard radiation.

Hey, where's my reference?  I want to read up on those technectium deposits.

It worries me too.  I have a hunch that likelyhood of this happening
is in proportional to economic freedom of the society in question.
In other words, it requires prior social stratification.  John Harrison
and his clock is a classic example of this.

But it would take somebody with a better knowledge of history than I
to turn the hunch into a decent theory.  Or to refute it.

---JKC
Mass, energy, momentum, electric charge, spin, charm, and color, are all 
digital quantities. It's true that nobody has found a quantum theory of 
gravity yet, but there is not a Physicist alive who doesn't think we need one.
General Relativity is not compatible with Quantum theory and breaks down 
completely when things get smaller than the Planck Length or less the 
Planck Time. The idea of continuous spacetime is looking increasingly suspect.
---JKC

I agree that our best equations to date produce some pretty bizarre
consequences for arbitrary real-valued inputs.  I am not yet prepared,
though, to attribute those failures to our mistaken assumption of
continuity rather than simply to the incompleteness of the equations.
When our explanations of nature imply consequences we have not observed,
I am far more willing to suspect or explanations than to assume that
nature actually has some unobserved property.  Of course, both are 
probably true, and I'd be delighted to discover either one; I'm just
more likely to suspect the theorists' errors than the experimenters'.

Stove's criticism of Popper looks way off base to me. Popper is no
irrationalist. In fact, by giving a defensible foundation to science rather
than the failed inductivist project, he protects it from irrationalist
incursions.

Doing away with verifiability hardly means science can't make progress.
Popper is not Kuhn. The more that a scientific theory opens itself to
possible refutation (by making clear and broad claims that can be tested)
and yet continues to survive refutation, the better a theory it is. Popper
no doubt is not complete. Perhaps a better account of scientific progress
needs to be developed on a Popperian basis. (It would be a stimulating
project to combine Churchland's account of scientific progress with
Popper's account of the nature of science.)

This is manifestly false, unless your definition of "civilization"
includes it, in which case it is tautological.  China, Pakistan, and
several other countries have no such concepts, and no need of them.
The United States had no such laws before the USPTO was created.
The very concept itself is a denial of the individual rights you
seek to protect: an individual who has acquired some knowledge by
legal non-coercive means has the right to use whatever knowledge he
has to further his life's goals without coercive interference from
the state on behalf of some other claimant to a monopoly on that
knowledge.  Patents and Copyrights are coercive monopolies, not
properties (trademarks, in contrast, /are/ properties because their
use by non-owners constitutes making a fraudulent substantive claim).

The policies you advocate here are no more justified than any other 
government interference, and what's worse, they give a justification
that sounds libertarian in principle while stabbing true liberty in
the back.  Those who wish to protect their intellectual discoveries
must do so themselves with contracts, technologies, and other non-
coercive means, not beg the state to do it for them at gunpoint.

China does not always recognize propery or human rights, much less
intellectual property (your brain and all its contents are only supposed
to think one way (the right way) anyway in fascist regimes)!

I would disagree with your concept of property.  Inventions, techniques,
etc. are patented b/c the represent the the intensive work product of an
individual.  To steal this workproduct without the permission of the one
who truly created it would be tantamount to taking credit for something
you did not create (plagirism or using a trademark).
    Not having a system of protections for these future oriented people
would give the lazy and oportunistic the right to benefit from the work
of others - not a very libertarian concept.  Besides, patents expire
(voila IBM clones) giving others the right to benefit from the
advancement, but also giving the individual(s) their just rewards.

I was under the impression that gravity, like intertia, was an effect of

Sorry, it'll take a bit for me to dig them up. In the meantime, I
suggest any reference on neutrinos, historical SNU levels (Solar
Neutrino Units), and neutrino detection efforts. Currently, the big
quandary in the neutrino astronomy community is "Where the heck are
they?" While we know they exist, as they have been detected, physics and
our observations of the sun indicate that the current SNU level of
around 1.5 SNU is one quarter of that thought necessary to sustain
current solar photon flux levels. This means either that we are not
seeing them all, or that we don't fully understand exactly how the sun
works. Given that it takes somehwre around 5k-10k years for current
fusion reactions in the core to radiate their heat to the surface, this
could mean that we are in for a really cold time in several millenia, or
that the sun was once much hotter than it is now. Based on technicium
levels in molybdenum deposits (apparently either direct or indirect
neutrino interactions cause the natural synthesis of technicium isotopes
in such ores, I'm not sure how, but I'll dig up some info), the earth
was once bathed in neutrinos to the level of 8 SNU (a Solar Neutrino
Unit is I beleive is one neutrino interaction per 10^36 atoms), though I
could be wrong). Whether these neutrinos were generated by our own sun
or by a nearby gamma ray burster is not determinable at this time.

SOunds like an intellectual property version of the old rule that stated
that blacks were 2/3 human. Sorry it doesn't wash. Patents and
copyrights are merely government recognition of original work and an
agreement to enforce protection of the inventors creation from license
violations, much as trademarks are protected from fraudulent claims. you

When the state derives its authority from that granted by its citizens,
as ours is by the constitution, then it is not begging, it is a mutual
aid compact.

And those last two senteces are clean epistemology?  I indulged in a bit
of psychologizing precisely because Stove's rhetoric deserved no better.
Your "fatal critique" is also riddled with content-free connotations and
hidden implications.  At least I was honest enough to use "seems" in my
rhetoric: Stove seems to take himself seriously.  Nonetheless, if you
and others might be taken in by him, I suppose a more careful analysis
of his mistakes might be useful, so I'll attempt it here.

That's true, but to mistake "lack of adequate, precise explanation" of a
phenomenon (such as "observation") for the non-existence of the phenomenon
is exactly the justificationist mistake that critical rationalism avoids.
Observation exists; to deny that is an inexcusable evasion of reality.
You might as well say that we don't have a precise definition of life, so
we cannot reason from the existence of life as a premise.  Popper gave
an epistemological method for using observation to falsify propositions.
Since observation is the foundation of other epistemologies as well, you
must criticise not observation itself, but his method of using it compared
to theirs.  If it is irrational to use observation to falsify, then it is
just as irrational to use observation to verify or justify.

This plausibility exists only in your mind, not mine (nor, presumably,
Popper's).  Sometimes it is not obvious that a statement is a conjunction
of two propositions; that is a feature of the ambiguity of language.  The
act of pointing out such a mistake is good science.  If years of study
have provided observations that failed to falsify S&N, then when someone
later expresses that proposition as actually a conjunction of two, that
new definition will serve to determine which of all those observations
might have falsified either S or N.  If none would have falsified N by
itself, then its former alliance with (or rather parasitism on) S is no
reason to grant it any respectability it didn't earn on its own merit.
Darwin's Lamarckism is a good example.  Before Lamarckism was largely
refuted, his theories contained it.  Are we to then grant it unwarranted
respectability, simply because Darwin's observations once supported it?
No, we must reinterpret those observations as they serve the two
propositions seperately.  Since none of his observations might have
falsified Lamarckism (because he didn't try), they do not support it.

Statements--propositions--are neither scientific nor unscientific; it
is the epistemological method used to judge them that is evaluated
in those terms.  But this is sometimes confusing--and Popper himself
is guilty of confusing language in this regard (or perhaps we can
blame his translators)--because we fail to see sometimes that our
choice of how to express a proposition implies in our minds the
epistemological method appropriate to test it.  So when Popper says
that P is a more scientific statement than ~P, what he really means
is that the method implied for testing proposition P, expressed in
that form, is superior to the method implied by expressing it in the
form of ~P.

A proposition and its negation are just two points of view on the
same semantic relationship, but the definitions of entities in the
relation creates fundamental assymetries in measuring verisimilitude.
Take the definition of "A"; it is a set of rules for partitioning all
of entity-space into "A" and "non-A".   Since entity-space is infinite,
we expect the cardinality of set {A} to be less than that of {non-A}.
Threfore, when we postulate a relationship such as "all A's are B",
any observations we make of non-A entities do not increase knowledge
much because they represent such an infinitesimal sample of {non-A}.
Observations of A's, on the other hand, increase verisimilitude by a
greater amount, because each A is a much larger sample of {A} than
each non-A is of {non-A}.  Thus, in general, we may call observations
of {A} more scientific than observations of {non-A}, because they are
more likely to raise the virisimilitude of the proposition.

So, the statements "All A's are B" and "There exists an A that is not
B" are equivalent (but opposite) statements, and equally scientific.
But the method implied by stating it the first way, namely, "Attempt
to falsify by looking for A's that are not B", is the superior
scientific method to any method looking at all existents as implied by
the latter statement, becase it is more likely to be falsified.

And your point is?  Really, I don't understand what you think is a problem
here.  You already use the weasel-word "most" to admit that some statements
do imply falsifiable observations by themselves, but even supposing that
they required an additional assumption to test, can't you then judge the
value of the observation based on the falsifiability of the assumption?
If you accept the assumption as an axiom, then the observation tests the
original proposition; if you later falsify the assumption, then the test
no longer bears on the proposition, and you will have to find either a
better assumption or a way to test the proposition directly.

And your point is?  Again, I don't see your problem here.  Probabilities
in, probabilities out.  Mathematicians deal well with this, why can't
philosophers?

This is just a repeat of arguments dealt with above, so I'll skip it.

I don't think Popper would disagree with any of that; in fact, I don't
see any conflict at all.  Such "generally accepted" inductive arguments
can be pragmatic, but that doesn't raise them to the level of scientific
until you can demonstrate falsifiability.  "Plausible" just means they
might be worth the effort to try to falsify.  Since there are likely to
be hundreds of such generally accepted ideas at any one time, how might
you choose which ones to invest research in?  Simple: which ones are
likely to be the cheapest to falsify?  That doesn't prevent you from
holding others as assumptions if you like them for esthetic reasons or
whatever.  It just gives a more solid reason for choosing research.

Then it's a good thing we and Popper look deeper than the face of it.

It might be, but reality didn't give us that world.  It gave us the
one with senses and cognition the way they are, not the one with God's
plan written in big letters on the sky.

In other words "Here is Popper's falsifiability criterion, expressed in
more optimistic-sounding justificationist language so I can call it my
own original idea, and call Popper's 'discredited' for an additional
gratuitous insult."  This principle as you describe it really is just
Popper's falsifiability from a different point of view.  It is almost
precisely Popper's equations desribing verisimilitude.

Yes, stealing work without permission is a crime; fraudulently claiming
authorship or invetion is a crime; but copyrights and patents aren't
aimed at those actions: they are aimed specifically at preventing, by
force, the use of information legally obtained.  If I invent something,
I will keep the idea under wraps with non-disclosure agreements while
it is being developed, and you bet I'd prosecute anyone who broke his
contract or stole from my safe.  But if I freely choose to sell the 
thing on the open market where anyone can see how it works, I have no
right to have the government use its guns to prevent those folks from
going into business against me.

I agree that "a system" should do that.  I just disagree that it should
be government force.  Private contracts and private technologies work.

A better example might be to question whether your copy of Windows NT is
the same as one run on a PC emulator like SoftPC. In most respects it is; 
you're running the same code. However, the underlying 'substrate' of the
emulator is different to a real PC. The hardware emulation doesn't exactly
match the behaviour of a real computer; for example interrupt timings are
different and the time taken to execute instructions is different. In most 
cases these effects will be invisible (except for the performance loss 
inherent to software emulation), but in a few instances you'll see different 
behaviour on a PC and SoftPC because hardware events will happen at a 
different time or in a different order. 

So a copy could be identical to the original, but an emulated copy
may not be quite the same.

True enough.  They aren't good examples, but the insidious meme of
IP is so pervasive that there aren't any good examples.

Go back to civics 101.  The constitution authorized congress to
create such laws.  It did not in fact do so until many years later
with the creation of the USPTO.  Until then, there were thriving
publishing and manufacturing industries without the subsidies of
copyrights and patents.

Huh?  I don't understand what the hell you're talking about here,
soI can't even hope to reply.

The fact that you confuse trademarks and licensing with copyrights and
patents is a symptom of the problem.  Look at the objective realities,
not the propaganda: If I use your name, I commit fraud.  That's a
trademark.  If I break a contract with you, that's an enforceable tort.
If I reprint a chapter from a book you wrote--and which you freely
chose to publish on the open market with no disclaimers or licenses
or physical protection of any sort--and not claiming that it's mine,
I have not committed fraud, I have breached no contract that I signed,
I have merely used information that I got through non-coercive means
for my own benefit, and the government will come in--at my expense
as well as yours--and prosecute me for it.  That's a copyright (and
similarly for patents).

> Your argument is irrational and typical of the hacker ethic that whats

Tie that slander to reality.  I make no claim to anything that is not
mine and never have.  In fact, I have made my honest living for 15 years
as a computer programmer and writer--a producer of intellectual property.
I respect that my employers believe in those laws, but I still refuse
to participate in my own name, because I can see beyond the justifications
and the propaganda.  I don't want to steal or defraud--I simply refuse
to be an accessory to the government's denying people the right to use
what I have freely given them.  If I want to keep my inventions, I will
protect them myself, and pay for the technologies and contracts to do it.
I cannot in good conscience demand the government get out of my life in
one respect, and then come to my benefit in another.  it is dishonest,
and hypocritical, and I will have none of it.  

I choose not to violate the copyrights or patents of others, because
they have chosen to release works into a system that makes those
assumptions.  But that doesn't mean I won't speak out for a free-market
non-coercive means of doing business in information, just as I speak
out for free-market means of doing everything else big brother want
to do for me.

Yeah, yeah, the social contract, blah, blah.  Funny how libertarians
reject such arguments for protecting real property, but are willing to
allow it for IP.  It's inconsistent.   If you want to open a set of
bookstores where everyone who buys agrees to respect authors' monopoly,
and you don't sell to anyone who doesn't agree, then I'll be happy for
you.  That might well encourage authors to publish works only in that
set of stores, giving them a market advantage.  I'd be all for it.

Ok, by that same logic.  If I were to write a book and publish it on the
open market.  Why shouldn't folks be able to copy it and sell it as
there own with the resulting royalties? After all, its on the open
market.

I'm as big a fan of the freedom to contract as anyone. Here's a hypo for
you.  If I were to create, say a new type of hard disk that stored 1000X
the information of the current industry standard.  How would i be able
to prevent every other manufacturer from benefiting from my R&D in the
absence of a patent?

This is a linguistic problem, not a scientific/logical one.  To communicate
at all we have to use a bunch of arbitrary conventions.  It's part of
having a common language.  But once we have those in place, we can talk
of falsifiable statements.  Sober speaks as though conventions had to
be invented anew with every conversation.

There is nothing inherently plausible here.  Indeed, the fact that N _can_
corrupt S is yet another demonstration of the difference between N and S.

It would be great if you could offer a model or some evidence/background

Not.  If you breach a contract you have Contract remedies available to
you, not those from tort law.  Fraud is enforceable in Tort.

What?  You're way off buddy.  Real property is protected in an identical
fashion.  Deeds are your claim to a piece of real property - granted by
the government.  Patents/copyrights are your claim/title to a piece of
IP.  Where's the distinction?

I'm unsure if you directly quote Nozick, here.  I doubt you do (but
admittedly I've not read his most recent work, and he has of late strayed
from his once-libertarian views).  Sadly, I am far from my library, and have
no copy of "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" at hand.  If memory serves, however,
it provides ample quotes of Nozick discussing the absolutely vital role of
intellectual debate in shaping human character.  Perhaps some interested and
well-equiped philosopher will oblige us with Nozick's own words on the topic.

I'd said: "Autism, in the sense of folding in on oneself, follows from
contact
with a violent world--not a non-coercive one."

>Factually, autism does not follow from contact with a violent world.
 >[discussion of clinical aspects of autism follows.]

Yes, I suspected as much; hence my reference to a special sense of the word
(following your lead).  What I've studies of autism has left me thinking that
nobody really knows what causes "autism" as clinical psychologists use the
word.  Theories abound, of course; cures do not.

Nozick's argument against *coercion* does not demand that one refuse to
interact with fellow humans.  To the contrary, he advocates a world of
thriving debate and rich socialization.  His "Framework for Utopia" section
of ASU makes clear that he want a diverse and vibrant civil society.  I don't
think anyone can reasonably claim that studying Nozick leads to a short
attention span and an inefficient memory!

As a libertarian, I reject the idea that property is a whim of the state,
but rather we may freely choose whatever private means of enforcing our
claim to our property we find satisfactory.  But even if we do give that
privelege to the state, there is a fundamental, inescapable objective
difference between physical property and IP: physical property /cannot/
be used to serve the ends of two people at the same time.  IP can be.
A copy of knowledge is exactly the same as the original.  I do not lose
knowledge when I give it to you.  If I don't want you to use knowledge
to compete with me, I should keep my mouth shut, not give it and then
shackle your use of it.

If I plant an apple tree on my land, and sell the apples, you cannot
simultaneously use the same land to plant wheat, or sell my apples for
your benefit.  But If I freely choose to sell you a book on how to grow
apples, never asking you to enter into any contract with me, then you
/can/ use the knowledge of how to grow apples to grow them on your own
land and sell them, or tell your neighbors how to grow them, without
interfering one bit on /my/ ability to do the same.

You may say, though, that it would be OK to grow apples, or even tell
my neighbor how, but not to copy my book word for word and sell it.
Why not?  I am growing the same apples as you, competing with you for
the limited apple market, and you have no claim on the state to protect
your monopoly on apples; why claim a monopoly on your apple-book?  You
could instead have asked me to sign a contract waiving my right to grow
apples and sell them into your market, and you could have asked me to
sign a similar contract not to give the apple knowledge away, but you
didn't.  I shouldn't use force to prevent you from using a asset I chose
to give you of my own free will.  If I don't want you using my knowledge
to compete with me, it is /my/ obligation, not the state's, to make
that happen by non-coercive means.

*** Scientists find world's tiniest motor in a cell
Japanese scientists announced Wednesday that by delving inside a cell 
membrane they had found the world's tiniest natural motor. They said the 
protein molecule F1-ATPase rotated with incredible force. Masasuke Yoshida 
and colleagues at the Tokyo Institute of Technology reported the findings 
in the science journal Nature. The central rotor is just one nanometer 
across, turning in a "barrel" 10 nanometers across.
Yoshida's team used a fluorescent filament, which they attached to the
protein, to watch the motion. For the full text story, see

I recommend Brian Eno's new book, "A YEAR with swollen appendices".
It's his diary from 1995, with articles added at the end.
ideas (lots)
events (interesting)
reminiscences
his two daughters
wife/manager
their company
his friends (lots, but including Bowie, U2, Stewart Brand...)
trips to lots of places
London, New York, Bosnia
producing records
rule-generated art and music
the meaning, purpose and value of art and style
how to make creativity happen
defence [sic] spending as a way to hide command economy within "capitalism"
"Why am I doing this?  Why am I doing this?"
computer software (he thinks most of what exists is crap)
user interfaces (likewise)
CD ROMs (likewise)
KidPix (NOT crap)
Stained Glass (likewise, but discontinued by Berkely Systems)
magnifying body parts in PhotoShop
Art shows, installations, museums, curators
a wild fashion show
evolution
War in Yugoslavia
War Child and other aid projects

Btw, don't expect a libertarian.

Actually, Terry Bisson has given his permission to have that story
(and apparently only that story) freely scattered about the Net, so
long as he gets proper credit for it.

Some chowderhead appropriated it a long, long time ago.  Easily over a
year ago.  Somewhat more recently, it spread to rec.arts.sf.written,
where it was suddenly Noticed by the senior editor of Tor Books, who
was wroth and displeased-- and rightly so.

At that point, Terry stepped in and graciously allowed that story to
be distributed freely as long as he got proper credit.  

Those who do not wish to take my word can use DejaNews to search
rec.arts.written.sf for articles from Patrick Nielsen Hayden with the
words "Terry Bisson" in them.  If I could remember the thread title,
I'd name it here.

What bothers me is that Terry _still_ isn't getting credit, even in
the face of his good natured generosity.

That's true, most artists, especially writers, hate having large amounts of
people being exposed to their work. They resent it even moreso when it's a
group of people who would be responsive to their work, and would be
influenced by it. What irks them even more, is when this is done without
malicious intent, and when the distributor claims, truthfully, not to know
the origin, and makes no claims to its creation. Artists hate being heard.
I'm glad you made that point.

Yes, exactly.  The fact that it is so counter-intuitive to you is
because we were brought up in a world that just assumed that copyrights
were used to protect authors like that.  In a free market, non-coercive
means should be used instead.

(1) Only sell them as black boxes to those who sign a contract never
to open them or let anyone else open them for reverse-engineering. (They
might also have an interest in keeping the technology from /their/
competitors, and so are likely to pay for the security involved).  (2)
Make a bundle by being first to market with huge numbers so that the
market is saturated before your competitors catch up. (3) Do (2), then
capitalize on your good name and reputation for innovation to get
contracts for future products. (4) Demonstrate the product to every
company with the means of competing with you in such a way that you
don't disclose any vital information about its internals, then let them
license it from you. (5) Never sell it at all, but buy up companies
whose major cost is data storage, and use your technology privately to
undercut their competitors (I like that one).

I'm sure I could think of a few more devious (but non-coercive) means...

I stopped taking Prozac a few months ago.  Maybe it's the drugs,
maybe it was just my temperamental pessimism talking.

Back-cover text:

Nature abounds in systems involving the actions of simple,
locally-interacting components, that give rise to coordinated global
behavior.  These collective systems have evolved by means of natural
selection to exhibit striking problem-solving capacities, while
functioning within a complex, dynamic environment.  Employing simple
yet versatile parallel cellular models, coupled with evolutionary
computation techniques, this volume explores the issue of constructing
man-made systems that exhibit characteristics such as those manifest
by their natural counterparts.

Parallel cellular machines hold potential both scientifically, as

Markets for ideal objects can and do function in the absence of 
enforceable 
intellectual property rights. 

Functioning markets existed for foreign authors in the U.S. in the 19th 
century. The free market paid royalties to British authors even though
those authors 
received no copyright protection in the US until the extension of
copyright protection 
to foreigners in 1891. The American publishers paid the royalty in order
to obtain 
advance galleys, even though they themselves had no legal protection
against competitors 
who could legally copy their new releases and sell them. In the absence
of state 
protection the authors and publishers used several voluntary and
contractual 
arrangements for the internalization of externalities.    

The problem shifts to being one of marketing. Although current
publishers so used to 
operating with a copyright may think this analysis strikes at the
foundations of the 
publishing biz, it is aimed at the present selling methods.

American laws over intellectual property are rooted in the English
patents and copyright 
system. The Crown issued patents for new inventions with the aim of
securing control of 
endeavors thought to be of political import; or to raise money through
the granting of 
monopolies. Copyright served to ensure state control over the press in
an era of 
tremendous political and religious dissent. As Tom Palmer remarked in
his recent paper 
on Intellectual Property, "Monopoly privilege and censorship lie at the
historical root 
of patent and copyright." Many times the state granted monopoly
privilege with no 
concern for the original inventor. Venice in 1469 (One of the earliest
patents I could 
find) granted to John of Spyer a monopoly over the art of printing
itself. Queen Marys' 
chartering of the Company of Stationers in 1557, granting its monopoly
over printing, 
was an attempt to control a new, threatening technology, primarily to
suppress 
Protestantism.     

Any service or good has, as a component of its' cost of production, not
only the costs 
of labor, marketing, capital, etc., but also the cost of exclusion. For
the owner of a 
movie theater, these exclusion costs include paying for walls, ticket
windows, ushers. 
These serve to exclude or fence out 'freeriders'. Now they could set up
projectors and 
show the movies on low level stratus clouds (ok, screens in parks), and
then attempt to 
prevent those casually passing by from watching. The method of marketing
their product 
is their  choice. In the case where their marketing decision results in
the publicness of a  good,  it seems to me to be grossly unjust to ask
the government to force all who might potentially see the show without
paying to kick in some bucks, whether they DO in fact see the show or
not. Or to force those passing by to don glasses that prevent them 
from viewing  the movie. Yet the proponents of property rights in ideas
choose such 
a method when they attempt to get every person purchasing a blank tape
to pay a 
royalty to a third party. 

Alternatively, as with DAT tape recorders, their proposals seek to ban
or cripple entire 
technologies. This method, done in the name of preventing technologies
which are capable 
of recording publicized (broadcast) music without loss of fidelity,
would make mere 
ownership of tangible property (DAT recorder) a crime. I view proposals
for such an 
implementation of property rights in ideas, which wipe out other areas
of property 
rights altogether, as inconsistent.

If we privatize the enforcement of contracts, let those who want to
"own" ideas pay for 
the enforcement of that contract.  Market forces will probably lead the
computer 
programmer to tie a perceived value to the registration of their program
(cheap 
upgrades, technical support, etc.); rather than paying for a protection
agency that 
tries to police the digital information realm.  But they would be
welcome to try to 
enforce a contract against copying a program that the purchaser would
sign when he buys 
the product.  I just wouldn't subscribe to a protection agency that used
some of my 
subscription fee to police copyright protection.

Sigh.  I suppose I have to spell this out: 

While writers do enjoy having people exposed to their work, most prefer to
have their names associated with the work in question, and since most earn
their living by their writing they detest and resent having their work
stolen.  (I except writers of tracts, advertisements and political
speeches.)  The posting on this list of Bisson's `They're Made of Meat!'
does not escape this stricture: if his name, and the title of the piece,
had been included in the re-post, along with his express permission, I
wouldn't have complained.

[Message resent because of list server failure.  Apologies if
it appears twice.]

I promised last night to do two things: post information about
the actual dates of patent and copyright law, and to recount
my ideas about private non-coercive alternatives.

First, I discovered that the USPTO was created in 1802, only three
years after the Constitution gave congress the authority to do so,
so I must conclude that the patent concept was generally accepted
at that time, and there was no prolonged period between those
events, so I was mistaken to claim otherwise.  There were, of
course, manufacturing industries and printing industries prior to
the Constitution itself (Franklin's print shop, Revere's Smithy
are obvious examples), and limits to the application of those laws
to foreign works, as Mr. Fallon points out.  The present form of
IP law is largely shaped by international treaties such as the
Berne convention, NAFTA, and GATT.

Toward my second promise, I already gave a list of means by which
one might profit from a technical invention without the aid of a
patent, so I will concentrate here on making money as an author in
the absence of copyright.  I do not think these lists are by any
means exhaustive, but I am optimistic that businessmen will find
more ways to make money than I can imagine, and anyway, I do not
consider mine or anyone's failure of imagination to be an adequate
justification for keeping the status quo.  My means appear at the
end of this article.

Finally, I know that some people may be thinking, "OK, even if I
accept that a world without copyrights and patents is possible,
what harm is there?  Who suffers from the present system?"  The
answer is the same as for any other subsidy: everything not thus
subsidized suffers a tiny bit, and the beneficiary gains a great
deal.  That's why subsidies are politically safe: one man gains a
lot, at the expense of millions losing so little that they don't
have much incentive to complain.  But as Friedman and others have
shown with more detailed economic analysis, the net gains are
always less than the net losses, because a subsidy changes the
relative value of the commodity subsidized, leading to inefficient
trades in every business affected by that commodity.  

Copyrights and Patents artificially increase the value of creativity.
If I had to name one thing most devalued, it would /workmanship/.
When the creative effort involved in the production of a good is
a major cost, it reduces the amount available for other factors
of production.  The price of a good is fixed by what the consumer
will bear, so the more you pay an author/inventor, the less you can
pay the builders.  The imposed monopoly has yet another effect on
workmanship: not only does it cause less money to be available for
it, but it also reduces the demand for it, because the producer
doesn't have to compete with other companies using the same idea.
The publisher of Dawkin's /Selfish Gene/ doesn't have to compete
with anyone else publishing the same work, so he can produce it as
sloppily as he cares to, and if the ideas are sufficient to sell
the book, it doesn't matter that the title rubs off and the cover
falls apart.

Contrast this to publishers who sell, say, the Bible.  They compete
diectly with others producing the same work, so Bibles tend to
come with nice leather covers, concordances and other appendices,
gold edges, red letters and annotations, and other added value.

Authoring without Copyrights

- The most obvious advantage an author has is being first to market
  with his ideas.  The software industry shows how valuable that is.
  One can make millions being the first with a good idea, even for a
  short period after Microsoft tries to take you over :-)

- You can sell subsidiary properties.  With software, that's things
  like upgrades and support, that copiers can't provide.  With a book,
  you might sell access to additional notes by the author, signed
  copies (your competitors can't sign your name without committing
  fraud), personal appearances, discussion lists, early release of
  new works by the same author, etc.

- You can use technologies for exclusion.  In software, that's copy
  protection, dongles, etc.  For books, that's selling them over the
  net with contractual agreements not to reproduce (look at Science
  magazine on the net for example).  Also Pay Per View, exclusive
  book clubs, etc.

- You can sell the author's good name and proven talents in other
  ways.  Personal appearances, reviews of related works, translations
  or explications of other works, selection of works of interest by
  other authors, adaptations of his own or other works to new media
  or to new audiences, ghost-writing celebrity bios, etc.

- You can write time-critical material.  News, topical commentary,
  live television, periodicals (Who wouldn't rather read Dave Barry's
  latest rather than wait for the books to come out?).

- You can sell your consumer attention directly, in the form of
  advertising ("This chapter brought to you by...").

- You can prey on consumer guilt, by selling "authorized" editions
  of your work that some consumers will buy instead of cheaper copies
  because they think they should.  I don't particularly like this
  method, but it will probably work.

I know there are others, but my hands are getting tired.

Jeff Lister--
: Good point, but i'm not sure the analogy applies.

Here's a better one.  Consider a binary star, two stars bound by gravity.
In the plane of their mutual orbit, and rotating with them, J.L.Lagrange
(1772) identified five points where the balance of forces is such that a
small mass can stay put.  Three of these points, on the line through the
stars, are unstable: if the satellite is nudged along the line it will
accelerate away from the Lagrange point.  But two (L4 and L5), each
forming an equilateral triangle with the stars, are attractors --
virtual masses (though their gravity fields are far from symmetrical).
Satellites can orbit these points.  The attractors are informally
called trojan points, because most of the asteroids around the
Sun-Jupiter triangle points happen to be named from the Iliad.
(Trojan companions have also been found for Saturn's big moons.)

You seem to be suggesting that the market obeys not only the wishes of
human buyers/sellers (the true masses) but also fluke phenomena, phantom
bidders, analogous to the trojan points.  I thank you for planting that
interesting thought.  But because the market is far more complex and
chaotic than a two-body system, I expect the "market trojan points"
to be transitory.

Lee makes a lot of good suggestions regarding alternatives to intellectual
property laws.  In the last issue of Scientific American, there was an
article on "trusted computers".  Contrary to what you might expect, these
aren't computers that you trust - they are computers which you own but which
are trusted by other people!  The computer works for somebody else, not for
you.

The idea is that you load some software (or a book, video, etc.) into the
computer and it lets you run it, but it won't let you copy it to anybody
else.  Or, you can loan it out but when you do you don't have it any more.

I don't really find this a very appealing idea, but of course if people
want to try it and see if it works in the market, that's fine.

The thing that struck me though was that the article was focusing on the
problems with protecting intellectual property in the computer age.  Books,
videos, music, etc., all could be shared for free.  The implication was
that without these mini-big-brothers (little brothers?) to keep people
honest, the whole publishing industry would disappear.

The glaring omission from the discussion was the software business.  They
have been dealing with this problem on a large scale for almost 20 years.
They don't have trusted computers; most software these days doesn't even
have copy protection (although of course the advent of CD-ROMs has made
it harder to make lots of copies).  By the reasoning of the article, the
software business should be an endangered species.

I think that's why they didn't mention it - it is such an obvious
exception to their reasoning that it would have undercut a lot of what
they were trying to say.  So they hoped people wouldn't notice.

Even with IP laws widely ignored, and even with the ease of copying
software, we still have a thriving software business.  Shelves groan
under the weight of new titles.  Of course there are losses due to
unauthorized copying.  But that hasn't stopped the business as a whole
from being fantastically successful.  There's no reason the same thing
shouldn't happen with other digital media.

Non-problem.  Generally a de-animated person is considered dead, so
pay the claim.  In fact, I think some insurance companies cooperate
with the cryonics agencies, and allow the suspendee to pay for the
suspension with his insurance benefit.  Not too different from using
life insurance death benefits to pay for hospice care, or drug
treatment for AIDS patients.

You want someone to pay you after he's been re-animated?
"Welcome back to the land of the living, Mr. Burch.  I'm Herb, your
guide; I'll be working with you to get you used to the changes since
your de-animation.  First, there's some paperwork: you owe your
insurance company $13,000,000..."

No thanks.

I'd take the opposite tack.  Sell a re-animation policy.  Like an
annuity.  If the guy re-animates, you're out a lot of money, but what
the hey, you've been earning interest on it for decades...that's what
insurance is about.

Thanks for the remarks.  I have wondered before just how we could get along
without copywrites and patents in an anarchocapitalistic society.  I am new
to the extropians group, although I've held all the concepts for years.  I
would like to be kept informed on all topics.  Again, thanks for the remarks.

Yes, this *is* better!  In the last paragraph you say "human
buyers/sellers," shouldn't that be corporate/human buyers/sellers?  To
extend the analogy, the humans would be the interstellar dust from which a
protosystem is currently forming and the corperations would be the stars;
initially chatoic, the system would become more ordered with time.  The
formation of the system would initially be more dependant on the
distribution of 'dust,' but eventually dominated by the relative positions
of the stars.  I thank *you* for the generation and presentation of this
interesting thought.

Greetings!  If you're receiving this, you probably asked to hear more about
Extropian perspectives, and the activities of Extropy Institute (ExI).

Extropians seek to use technology (broadly understood to include psychology 
and philosophy) intelligently to overcome genetic, biological, 
psychological, cultural, and neurological limits to the pursuit
of life, liberty, and boundless achievement.

Here is information on ExI's activities, on EXTROPY -- the premier, 
intelligent futurist publication, EXPONENT -- our members' newsletter,
on the EXTRO conferences, and on other activities, such as
local discussions and events.

If you're already sure you're interested, see the end of this message for 
a membership form.

     Extropy = the extent of a systems intelligence, information, order,
vitality, diversity,
     opportunity, and capacity for growth.


E X T R O P Y  I N S T I T U T E

Extropy Institute (ExI) encourages the development and use of emerging
and future technologies to overcome historically unchallenged limits to
full human flourishing. ExI functions as a networking organization,
bringing together the most creative, forward-thinking intellects
from numerous fields of endeavor in working to overcome traditional,
genetic, biological, and neurological. By providing forums and information
the Institute facilitates discussion and organization of ideas, research,
and projects involving using technology to extend life, augment 
intelligence, improve rational thinking, finetune psychology, move 
off-planet, develop artificial intelligence, and other goals.

Extropy Institute is open to all who share our goals, not just professional
scientists, technologists, philosophers, and artists.

Since 1988, when Extropy first appeared, extropian ideas have attracted
those wanting to continually improve their capabilities, those who are
bold enough to challenge entrenched dogmas concerning the inevitability
of death, of centralized, coercive governance, and of fixed limits to
human achievement and ability. Our evolving synthesis of ideas
continues to welcome fresh input.
 
Extropy Institute is building a culture favoring physical and intellectual
augmentation, radical life extension, and a free and responsible society
(here, in cyberspace, or off-Earth). We are a network of thinkers and
doers who seek to question today's dogmas, shape an open-ended future,
and create "transhuman" lifestyles, technologies, and institutions. Extropy
Institute members are in the best position to benefit from the information
and tools developed in the extropic network.



                               E X T R O P Y

Now moving to the Web, Extropy is a magazine covering the full range of
advanced, emerging, and future technologies with an emphasis on making
you more informed, powerful, and prepared. Some of the technologies and 
issues covered in EXTROPY:

*    Life extension treatments, nutritional supplements, the latest 
      anti-aging drugs, and new programs for monitoring and combating aging.
*    Developments in computers and the Internet. Software tools for self-
     management. Getting ready for future advances in computers and human-
     computer interaction and integration.
*    How to augment your intelligence through nutrients, new smart drugs, 
     and cognitive techniques, and where to go for more information.
*    Which technologies and industries will take off, providing excellent
     opportunities for investment and employment.
*    How to modify your mood and motivation with incredible new drugs, and
     with rational thinking techniques.
*    How can we think rationally about the proper use of new technologies to
     overcome human limits? Where does traditional thinking about radical
     technologies go wrong?
*    How can we move beyond centralized, bureaucratic government? How can
     free markets and voluntary associations take over the useful 
     functions of government? How can spontaneous order enable us to handle
     accelerating change?
*    How you can use encryption technology to protect and improve your
     privacy.
*    Plus: Nanotechnology and molecular computers; artificial wombs and new
     methods of parenting; transhumanist philosophy to make sense of rapid 
     change; prosexual drugs and nutrients; how to abolish income tax; 
     critical thinking about environmental and resource issues; electronic 
     money and competing currencies; machine intelligence and artificial 
     life; experimental communities.

The new TECH ADVANCES section will help you stay ahead of the pack with
information on crucial technological developments, including: life 
extension techniques; intelligence increase tools; computer technology and 
trends; biotech advances; technology-oriented investment opportunities;
practical optimism; rational values; living free of state control, and 
much more.

Learn about the limit-busting individuals creating the future with Extropy
interviews and Profiles of future-makers in diverse fields.

Since 1988, Extropy has evolved as a unique forum for intriguing and
inspiring explorations of advanced and future technologies, focusing on
their potential for overcoming present human limits, enabling us to create
a posthuman future. If you're tired of shallow, trendy, or uncritical
thinking on the technological frontier, Extropy will satisfy, startle,
and stimulate you.

These can be circumvented rather easily.  I've done it.  ( Not for theft,
but for speed. I've got a slow 1xCD but a fast hard drive. )
  
A TSR is put in upper memory.  It prempts the keyboard interrupt, steals 
commands from the keyboard buffer that are meant for it, possibly adds
a few, then passes control to the keyboard interrupt routine.  This 
allows it to simulate keyboard input.  So with one keypress from the
computer owner, lots of commands - such as 'turn page' - are generated.
The trusted program spills its guts.
The TSR also evesdrops on the screen writing interrupt, and copies everything
to a file.

If too many one-time books/videos are on the market, then somebody ( not 
me ) will write a program like this and pass it around.

David Levy, an economic historian at George Mason University, has a
paper and an upcoming book called "How the Dismal Science Got Its Name".

The paper's abstract is: 

  Thomas Carlyle in his "Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question"
  was apppalled that the classical British economists considered blacks
  to be fully human.  Carlyle said that economists did not understand
  that blacks could not be persuaded to work by money, they had to be
  whipped.  Thus the economists' anti-racisms is the basis of the
  allegation of our name, the "dismal science.

Carlyle is a famous racist, and was one of Hitler's favorite authors. 
Charles Dickens dedicated his 1854 "Hard Times" to Carlyle. 

These classical British were also pro-birth-control.  I think Mills
got thrown into jail for distributing a phamplet on the topic.

All means of expression must eventually produce ordinary sensory
input to (presumably) a human being.  There is no way to enforce
that presumption, though: any such means can be presented to an AI
with the ability to duplicate whtever it experiences.  It is
instructive to go back to news reports of the first Xerox machines,
and hear how the publishing industry claimed that it would be
destroyed if they ever became popular.  Today's disasterbation
over electronic media rings just as hollow.

I always heard that economics was referred to as "the dismal science"
because it was associated early on with Malthus's doctrines of increasing
scarcity of resources and the inevitability of poverty. From the above
quote, it's not clear that even from the racist's viewpoint economics would
be "dismal" unless the word meant something different then.

Its odd that you and I can agree here but have different views on
intellectual property. What I am proposing is that intellectual property
be fully recognized as a basic human right (part of the natural law
thing), possibly THE basic human right, and that patents, copyrights,
trademarks etc are merely government recognition of individuals
exercising these rights in acts of creation. 

In this manner, one's DNA is considered wholly the property of the
individual that originated from them. Twins would be joint owners, and
clones would have a sort of dual parent/twin sibling relationship,
differentiated by the ages of each individual. By bundling up all these
essential human rights as one interrelated concept of the individual, an
attack on one is seen as an attack on the whole, as opposed to today's
political scene of pick and choose human rights. Liberals like
expression, choice etc for the individual, and everything else for the
state, and conservatives like self protection, life, and property for
the individual and everything else for the state. Very little is seen as
a holistic concept.

While he may be literally correct, the fact is that until our country
developed its USPTO, investment in technological advancement was an
extremely high risk proposition. This is why the only technologies that
remained secure were those that were classified SECRET by governments,
and enforced with death sentences. Unfortunately, this method tended to
stifle cross fertilization as well as the possibility of mass producing
secret inventions, since by their secrecy their market was limited.
Those that did not remain secure were easily stolen and copied.
Inventors never got rich on their own, they always had some rich
politician or industrialist as their lord protector who made the most
money off of it since they had the goons to enforce their self declared
rights.

With our current system, inventors have at least a better than even
chance of getting paid fairly for their creations, even of enforcing
their rights overseas. LDC seems to have gotten to his opinons by being
disgusted with the high cost of comercially available software, but if
intellectual property rights were fully enforced, software could be sold
for the price of a paperback. The reason this isn't so is that its much
easier to copy electronic data than printed bound material, so its much
harder to enforce copyrights with software than books.

The more widespread intellectual property enforcement occurs, the lower
per unit intellectual property costs will be for consumers, so that
prices will more closely reflect a "fair" market value. Intellectual
property that is not properly protected or is only partially protected,
like our present system causes a greater level of technological
monopolization than with full enforcement systems. With zero enforcement
systems, like the medieval secrecy system, people were not even given
the opportunity to have access to technology, which seems to me to be a
much greater level of monopolization than mere overpricing in a partial
system like the present one.

Thank you. Picking nits is not what I am after here, though. This all
derives from my contention that recognition of intellectual property as
a basic human right that is tied up in ones right to self expression, to
choose to reproduce, to create new life, to seek the fulfillment of
one's happiness. Man is the monkey that creates, or to use a theist
term, our God given rights were given to reflect the power of God within
each and every one of us to create.

Of course, in a perfect world, where a corporation only has the power of
the average individual, LDC's concepts would be great, but in my mind
reflect the sort of egalatarian socialist utopia that Marxists dreamt of
rather than any libertarian hope.

Listen, contracts between individuals don't mean squat. The ski industry
has tried for years to protect themselves from ridiculous law suits from
people that are injured at ski areas due to personal negligence, through
no fault of the resorts. Every ski ticket has on it a waiver stating
that to purchase a ticket is to recognise the individuals complete
responsibility for oneself, etc. etc., and signs in front of the ticket
offices say this, and the ticket sales people say to read the ticket,
and all credit card reciepts that are signed also have this agreement on
them. You'd think that they'd be fully protected, right? No such luck.
This is why 75% of the cost of your average ski lift ticket is to pay
for the ski areas insurance premiums. The only people who make money in
the ski industry are insurance companies, injured skiers, and tort
lawyers.

Sorry, this means that you are an anarchist rather than a libertarian.
There is SOME need for government. What form it is and how it is
administered are different issues entirely.

Show me one that works. Design a system that works. My proposal was
merely trying to work within the existing system to maximize human
individual liberty. I'm trying to be real about this. Trying to be ideal

SOrry, libertarians are all for protecting any sort of real property.
Real property doesn't need as much help though for one simple reason:
its real. Intellectual property is highly intangible, and therefore very
vacuous and easy to steal, copy, brush off, etc. and suffers badly in
environments of power imbalances and power corruption.

There is none at all outside of the tangibility issue.

MikeC cites United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Article 27 Section 1: "Everyone has right to /freely/ participate in
cultural life of community, to enjoy arts and to share in scientific
advancment and it's BENEFITS."  (emphasis added)

Gee, I guess then gives me the right to a free ticket to Bali, to watch
some ceremonial dances there; then on to Cambodia to explore the ancient
Khymer temples; then on to India, and on and on.  What U.N. office to I
apply to for my tickets?  Does this cover other travel accommodations as
well?

As for scientific advancements and their benefits, where do I apply for
my free space station? (I'd love to just kick back in orbit and watch
the stars!) Does the U.N. have a space agency to handle such requests by
all us individual 'sovereign nations'?  Wait a minute, who's going to be
doing the work while we're all enjoying our free cultural
educations/vacations!?

Jeff Lister responds to my analogy of the marketplace to celestial mechanics--

: eventually dominated by the relative positions of the stars.

Let's back up a bit before we get too silly:  The analogy would be better
still with no stars, just a lot of massive ships moving about unpredictably,
though usually their engines can't muster much acceleration.  The nearest
thing to passive "stars", I think, would be the institutional investors
-- pension funds and the like, which tend to trade in a mechanical way.

To address your point: no group of people is a "point mass"; they all have
internal forces.  I'd think of corporations as more like fleets of ships,
of various sizes ...

That language is so full of holes and connotations I find it hard to
pin down what it means.  If I could, I might be able to argue, but one
has to find meaning before one can discuss it.  If you can give me some
examples of what you're talking about, I might better understand.

You also use words like "secure" and "stolen" which are begging the
question posed, namely, are ideas property, and is copying ideas theft?
Secondly, you act as if the rich patron of the creator is not entitled
to return on investment, and the greater share of options his wealth
provides.  In a pre-capitalist aristocracy, that might have been true.
But I am arguing for capitalist institutions, where wealth is earned by
labor, creation, /and investment/, not by currying favor with the guns.
Where the creator must convince his patrons what his creativity is worth,
and the patrons can decide how to profit from their own investment in it,
and both are rewarded in proportion to what they can freely negotiate,
and both hire the same goons to enforce their voluntary contracts. 

If a contract between two free men cannot be enforced, then society is
already so far gone that it is not worth saving.  That is the very
foundation of civilation, without which there is only rule by force.
I am assuming that in all my discussions, because if that most precious
piece of freedom is lost, nothing else can be argued until that is fixed.
If you want to argue that contracts are not valid, then our minds have
no common ground, and we must stop.

Again you assign me motives with no evidence and no basis in reality.
I don't give a damn what software costs, and I've never said anything
to make you or anyone else think that.  Please argue with what I say,
not with what your fertile imagination dreams up about me.  I "got my
opinions" by reasoning from the evidence available to me /on both
sides/, and from my experience as a producer.  I'm sure your experience
is different; perhaps you've spent more time on the inside of the
present system, so you are blinded by it.  I am not. 

In our present system, creators use the means available to them to
earn money--but that's not evidence of the system's value for many
reasons: (1) The fact that they use the system as it is says nothing
about how it might compare to a different one, or how creators would
use that different system. (2) The earnings of a creator today are not
necessarily what one would expect from a different system.  They seem
"fair" precisely because they are what we are used to, and we act in
ways to make them come out that way under the present system.  Again,
this says absolutely nothing about how it /might/ be.  (3) The system
also has very real costs to both the creator and to everyone else,
that I have outlined many times, and those cost changes would change
the net earnings of a creator.  (4) The cost of enforcement is high,
and will only get higher with more networking and technology.  Yet
another cost factor.  (5) Your failure to imagine how the information
economy might operate in the absence of copyright is no justification
for assuming it would fail to operate just fine.  I have shown many
ways such a system might function; if you care to argue against any of
those, please do so.

> The more widespread intellectual property enforcement occurs, the lower

This is naked assertion, and utterly without evidence.  In fact, it is
quite opposite of plain logic: enforcements cost money, copying is cheap.
When the information itself is a negligible cost, consumers will pay
for things like workmanship, timeliness, customization, organization,
etc.  Some of those things will be provided by creators, some by others,
but in a free market, they will tend to be produced by those who can
produce them most cheaply.  When the information itself is an enforced
monopoly, its subsidiary products will be produced by those whom the
creator has chosen for his own reasons, not the consumers'.

You say that like it's a bad thing. :-).  Yes, of course I'm an anarchist.
I absolutely deny the "necessity" of monopoly government in any human
society, and live with hope for the day when it will be wiped from the
face of the planet.  I know that's a minority opinion, even among die-
hard libertarians, but I simply have not seen any convincing argument for
the absolute necessity of that arbitrary institution, and I have seen
more than I care to of its crimes against humanity.  Until I am shown
with clear, convincing, evidence that anarcho-capitalism /cannot/ work, I
will continue to treat government as a criminal enterprise, and those who
support it have no sympathy from me.

You are asking far more than that; you are asking not only that I
recognize your right to use your creation, but that I further give
you the power to use force to prevent anyone else from using it, even
if it was independently created, or given freely.  You don't want a
right to use your mind; you want permission to use your fists to
prevent me from using /my/ mind.

"Property" is a human right by virtue of the objective nature of it:
that a piece of property cannot simultaneously serve the ends of two
different people.  If you want to expand that to include things that
/can/ simultaneously be used by everyone, then give me a /reason/, not
just your feeling that it is "natural".

I think "dismal" meant what we now think.  I will try to get the full

if you take out the curly-quote in the word "system's"-- the presence of a

HUBBLE'S SHARPEST VIEWS OF MARS AVAILABLE 
     from NASA - http://www.nasa.gov/

    New, sharpest-ever views of the planet Mars taken 
by the Wide Field Planetary Camera-2 (WFPC2) aboard 
NASA's Hubble Space Telescope on March 10, 1997 
(following the successful STS-82 Hubble second 
servicing mission), clearly show clouds, dust storms, 
polar caps and other bright and dark markings known to 
astronomers for more than a century. Taken just before 
Mars opposition -- when the red planet comes closest 
to the Earth this year (about 60 million miles or 100 
million km) -- the images were contained in a single 
picture element (pixel) in WFPC2's Planetary Camera 
which spans 13 miles (22 km) on the Martian surface.

    These images show the planet during the transition 
between spring and summer in the northern hemisphere 
(summer solstice). The annual north-polar, carbon-
dioxide frost (dry ice) cap is rapidly subliming, 
revealing the much smaller permanent water-ice cap, 
along with a few nearby detached regions of surface 
frost.

    Hubble is being used to monitor dust storm 
activity to support the Mars Pathfinder and Mars 
Global Surveyor Orbiter Missions, which are currently 
en route to Mars. Hubble's "weather report" from these 
images, is invaluable for Mars Pathfinder, which is 
scheduled for a July 4 landing. These images show no 
evidence for large-scale dust storm activity, which 
plagued a previous Mars mission in the early 1970s. 

Images are available to news media representatives by 
calling 202/358-1900. Photo numbers are:

I felt like ranting today, for no good reason. (Actually there _is_
a very good reason: the first item on my todo list is to reduce the
number of items on my todo list). So diving off (I never surf, you
see) into the net never has failed to defocus one attention from
something quite mundane, and also, urgent.

It would be interesting to find out, whether nonlurk-mode on a
high-volume mailing list, or (gosh!) several of them is compatible
with leading a "normal", productive life. I strongly suspect that a
productive life and net presence might be strongly mutex. For once,
it's the sheer time spent in logging in, out, keeping track of one's
files, back-ups (or lack thereof), cranky networks, overflowing
mailboxes, irate admins, RNAs, and godknowsnotwhatelses. For other,
it's drained attention. If you still continue a virtual dispute,
when in the bathroom, or on your way to work, and even do not
own a wearable, things obviously seem to have started running
amiss. Even in its fly-encased-in-amber latency, and (especially
hereabouts) nonexistent bandwidth, the transient inability of,
when offline, plucking (irr)relevant infamation out of thin air
is absolutely maddenning. Let's face it, we're all junkies.
Well-informed junkies. Revoltingly well-informed junkies.

All geared up with nowhere to go. Go get a life.

A secondary effect of this is neglection of tracking the treekiller
press, where all the action still is. Another one is an adoption of
breathless-from-message-to-message-hopping, and clickety-clickety-
click thinking style one so easily gets trapped in. Let's admit it,
our tools have become progressively blunted, our concepts crude.
Distinguishing fantasy from reality gets harder day by day.

At least for me.

That todo list thing was not a joke. The danger of letting Things
Which Matter just lie is very real -- thus I have great respect
and understanding for those, who transiently, or, permanently, have
pulled the unsubscription emergency plug. We will miss their
input, but I suppose their contribution in the Real World will
more than outweigh that. Which brings us, the list people
(sure biased, since intrinsically preselected) who make their
virtual appearances, and exits, to _our_ roles. Is it exhilarating,
to know that our contribution (being observers merely, cheerleaders
at best) won't matter on the really long run, or, simply,
depressing?

For me, it is the latter. With a newbie's touching naivete I once
supposed the extropian/transhumanist movements, simply because of
their so obvious _rightness_, the constructivity of their goals,
to become a crystallization nucleus, the memefective agent, the
catalysator of a rapid phase transition in a metastable,
supercritical system.

Well, I gauged wrong. The system is not nigh supercritical.

"Gar nicht erst ignorieren" as Gundolf Freyermuth had it so
aptly put. It does not matter being able to skry the shape of
possible alternative futures, with the mind's eye, to pierce the
opaque walls of a hypothetical fitness function, to burst forth
into the light of a better local fitness optimum, if you're unable
to implement these visions, strap your audience into chairs, and
whack them onto their heads with them for hours, until they see.
They won't.

Because, though the maximum of the bell-shaped distribution is
distinctly better than the lowest common denominator
libertarianism and totally free markets won't bring us
into that utopian Eden we so like to talk about. Free markets
will fail to hit the optimum for the same reason communism never
worked. Never could. The ideally enlightened consumer is a myth.
Real ones fall prey to marketing propaganda, peer pressure,
failure to enact long-term optimization but optimizing locally
instead. Kinetical, myopic-Hamiltonian, instead of thermodynamical
control. Abandoning all pretense to rational choice once beyond a
certain complexity threshold.

Missing the minimum, and not even aware of it. Not even caring.

(The things Stu Kauffman said in his "At Home in the Universe"
book, in the "An Emerging Global Civilization" chapter are sure
heartening, but he might be wrong. Let's hope he isn't).

Anyway, which impact should this reasoning have on our real-world
heuristics, our plans, our strategies? ("Ours" here specifically
meaning those striving to achieve a self-consistent transhumanist
stance). Whence to acquire that fine olfactorics to early-detect
a shit brewing in the works? The muscle to unroot and the robustness
to flourish in new environments? I guess one can train this.
Better, it should.

Anybody feeling like relating his/hers experiences?

ciao,
'gene

The following expresses some uncharacteristically dark thoughts, so I write
here under a pseudonym.

Yesterday afternoon, sitting outside in the brilliant sunshine of the first
full day of Spring, 1997, at lunch with one of my good friends, I was feeling
very positive and optimistic.  The conversation turned to the recent cloning
of an adult mammal and other breakthroughs in biotech, such as DNA chips.  I
began to speak enthusiastically of transhumanism and the goals held dear by
extropians.  Soon, I was dismayed to note that my friend was expressing very
negative attitudes toward my expressions of optimism.  He said that I was
crazy to want to do these things, that death was part of the natural order,
that humans couldn't possibly keep from doing terrible evil with the new
powers I looked forward to, that I and my cohorts were hastening a
catastrophe.  The list of horrors he said would follow from our program went
on for some time:  Overpopulation due to increased longevity; increased
social stratification due to augmentation of the wealthy and powerful;
ecological havoc created by artificial organisms and nanotechnology;
distorted, unhealthy personalities created by experimental alteration of the
human brain . . .

Before long, my friend, who is very well educated, scientifically literate
and not at all religious in any traditional sense of the word, said that my
desires were evil, pure and simple, and made reference to Nazi eugenics.  He
said that it was a very good thing that only a tiny minority of people felt
the way I did and that he hoped I and my fellow transhumanists would never
have a chance to do the things we wanted to do.  The lunch ended on a very
sour note and I fear my friendship is mortally wounded.

Of course, this isn't the first time that this has happened.  In fact, I
write here now because this experience is so very, very common.  The
overwhelming majority of intelligent and well-educated people to whom I
attempt to explain transhumanism react negatively.  The reactions range from
condescension, through fear and horror to hostile expressions of intention to
actively oppose transhumanism.  Here is just a brief list of the common
reactions I receive:

"Extropian libertarianism is naive and simplistic in a juvenile way.  Its
association with Ayn Rand and 'objectivism' will consign it permanently to
the fringe.  A lot of teen agers go through an Atlas Shrugged phase': How
old did you say most of these people are?"

"Transhumanism is an immature rejection of reality, a selfish and
self-centered desire to escape from the simple and basic facts of life. Quit
dreaming."

"Extropians are a bunch of mad scientists who simply haven't studied history.
 Rushing into the things they want to do is likely to cause an economic or
ecological disaster.  If there were even the slightest chance any of this
stuff would come into being, I'd be the first to vote to regulate all of it.
 Maybe some of this stuff could do some good, but not if you rush into it,
and not if you do it all at once.  Just because you can do something doesn't
mean you should."

"Transhumanists want to create a master race, just like the Nazis.  And don't
they think Nietzsche is some sort of intellectual godfather?  What does that
tell you?"

"Extropians are elitists.  What about the billions of people suffering on the
edge of starvation?  Sounds like they want a bunch of high-tech toys for a
few rich white male Americans that will just make things worse for everybody
else."

These are just the reactions of the people who can qualify as educated and
relatively sophisticated in their thinking.  Religious people and less well
educated people express similar reactions, but in different terms.

The fact is that we are a tiny minority among a tiny minority.  Most people
on this planet couldn't even begin to comprehend the things we look forward
to because they don't have the knowledge or the mental energy.  Within the
small fragment of humanity that has the education and leisure to understand
the basic concepts of transhumanism and extropiansim, all but a very few
reject our ideas, values and goals on principle.

This realization would be no more than a little emotionally depressing, if it
didn't underlie the very real possibility that the quickening pace of
scientific discovery and technological development will trigger a strong
reaction against progress toward post-humanity.  We've all seen the reaction
to "Dolly".  Soon, even more radical possibilities will be apparent to even
the least technologically oriented.

Dynamic optimism is a good thing.  But all the optimism in the world can't
overcome a massive social, cultural and political reaction against augmenting
and transcending the human condition.  Staying encapsulated within our own
little social sphere, talking only to others who share our values and goals,
we may not even see the reaction coming.  But (based on my repeated
experience), even a patient explanation of our ideas to "outsiders" seems to
do no more than arm the opposition.

What is to be done?

In a message dated 97-03-22 09:45:16 EST, you write: 
 
<<  The lunch ended on a very 
 sour note and I fear my friendship is mortally wounded. >> 
 
My first impression would be to try and get my friend out of clinical
unipolar depression.  It does not matter how educated, scientifically
literate or "smart" the person is.  This person is depressed.  See Martin
Seligman's book _Learned Optimism_.    
 
My second impression is to let my friend think anything and say anything AND
IF that interferes with my own thinking, which this friend has done:  Drop
that person until the clinical unipolar depression subsides and that person
and I see eye-to-eye again.  See Harry Brown's book _How I found Freedom In
an Unfree World_.  The book exposes traps of intellect that your depressed
friend has sprung on you. 
 
I have a concern for friends like this and will try one but _only_one_
attempt to help them.  (This happened recently with a person I have known for
over 20 years in Florida.  I sent her one page of information that could have
helped her.  She would not even read that one page.  I called and tried to
get her to read it and she refused.)   After that they must take
responsibility for their own mental or physical health.  I am too busy
running my own life to spent time on their problems.  I will not drag them to
see a doctor, that's physical force.  I just will NOT do it, even for a
friend! 
 
I consider this person so far away from my thinking that I can't spend time
with that person's deathist contamination. . . too many negative memes around
and I could get brainwashed by negativity. 
 
It sounds like you have already been brainwashed by this person's own
clinical depression.  Now it's YOUR responsibility not to get dragged into
the same depression.
 

Dynamically Optimistic,

Davin

Perhaps it's spring fever, but we get two negative posts today, one right
after the other, Eugene Leitl's and Velociman's.  I know I've had the same
thoughts as Eugene: "Keeping up with the lists takes a hell of a lot of time;
what does it contribute to getting things DONE that I want to get done?"  And
I've had the same experiences as Velociman: Most of the people to whom I
explain transhumanism and extropianism have negative reactions.

But there are antidotes to these negative thoughts.  First, I've learned to
read less of the list.  Once a thread wanders into an area in which I'm not
interested (or if it starts that way), I just delete the messages.  Some
times I have pangs of guilt, especially if I delete a message by an author
whose writing I've liked in the past, but keeping up with things takes some
ruthlessness these days.

More importantly, Eugene and Velociman both point to the same problem, but in
different ways.  Eugene despairs of actually bringing our goals to fruition
and Velociman fears we will be stopped by those who oppose us.  Work toward
one can help avoid the other, but it needs to be done right.  The fact is, as
others have pointed out, post-humanity won't HAPPEN on an e-mail list.  

Post-humanity will happen in a thousand laboratories and businesses.  This is
where the real forefront of transhumanism and extropianism lies.  Our
important work is there.  If you're a researcher or entrepreneur, go to it.
 As the ad campaign says, "Just do it."  If, like me, you're more of a
"culture worker", there is also important work to do.  I see that important
work on two fronts.  

First, transhumanism and extropianism has to be expressed in public.  Yes, it
will draw criticism and opposition.  But not expressing our ideas leaves the
field to luddites.  Finding ways to express our ideas in ways that appeal to
existing cultural values is very important.  Avoiding statements that attract
the critiques described in Velociman's post is key.  I've never convinced a
committed luddite or "deathist", but I HAVE planted seeds in open minds and
HAVE seen them bear fruit.  Pushing someone from "Biotech 101" to the
Singularity in one conversation is a bad idea.  Gently pointing out the
contradictions between support for advanced medical research and opposition
to augmentation of healthy humans works well.  Pushing someone from support
for individual autonomy to privately produced law in one conversation is a
bad idea.  Gently pointing out historical examples of failed interventions in
market economics (such as the "oil crises" caused by price controls) works
well.

Perhaps even more hopeful, I find that there is a real generation gap in
response to exposure to transhumanism and extropiansim.  Simply put, younger
people react better.  Even folks in their late 20s seem to be more willing to
cross the intellectual threshold to transhumanist and extropian ideas than
people in their mid-30s.

On a broader front, our ideas need articulate spokepeople, skilled in
mass-market writing and public speaking.  We have a few.  We need more.
 Unfortunately, the personality best suited for the laboratory is often not
well suited to the talk show.  The writing style best suited for the
scientific journal is definitely not well suited to the popular magazine or
best-selling book.  Both are critical to the success of our ideas.

Beyond this, and of crucial practical importance, we must reach a key
audience of actors and opinion leaders in the scientific and business fields
from which transhumanist technologies will be born.  An extropian and
transhumanist "movement" limited to a small cadre of students and enthusiasts
communicating on the net is no real "movement" at all.  As valuable as this
list is, it will never be the right tool for contacting, motivating and
coordinating the efforts of key players in developing the "transhumanist tool
kit."  Some good ideas for this key task have been discussed.  Implementing
them in the relatively short term is very important if we are to have a
chance to withstand the opposition to our goals which is sure to grow over
the next few years.

I note one serious problem with crossing a threshold to "respectability" of
our ideas for those whose efforts we need to implement the transhumanist
agenda.  While science thrives on SCIENTIFIC controversy, it withers in the
face of social and political controversy.  While business enterprise thrives
on ECONOMIC competition, it avoids ideological competition.  Most working
scientists and technologists are rightly afraid of becoming publicly involved
in social controversy, for fear of losing funding for their research.
 Businessmen fear explicit or implicit boycott.  Overcoming this problem is
one of the key challenges facing us.

Dynamically optimistic,

Velociman,

Cheer up mate!  The thing is, people have these attitudes because
the mind is geared to noticing *problems* - like, good news is no news,
right?  The media generally are geared up to tell us mainly about
problems, and that's a good thing; but it gives intellectuals a somewhat
one sided picture of things.

Fortunately people's feet and purses don't read newspapers!

Unfortunately the only cure for myopic intellectuals is to patiently
point out to them that though there are problems with everything, what
you've got to focus on is the ratio of problems solved to problems
created or remaining unsolved with a given set of social institutions,
discoveries, etc. If you focus on that, they suddenly become aware that
most of what happens in the world is better than it is worse, and
doesn't get reported much. They soon (grudgingly) get it.

Now you're mixing analogies.  Seems to me that the advantage of argument
from analogy is the use of one, more thuroughly understood process to
elucidate another based on apparent similarities; it certainly *proves*
nothing.  Now you've got gravity *and* propulsion; i can't follow.  I would
like to point out that the analogy in its original state does not break down
as you seem to imply here:

>To address your point: no group of people is a "point mass"; they all have
>internal forces.  I'd think of corporations as more like fleets of ships,
>of various sizes ...

Neither is a star a point mass; it too has internal forces.  The analogy can
be maitained, could it be that you just didn't like where it was going?

P.S.  To the extropians; i saw on Big Life last night that your purpose is
to accelerate human evolution.  How do you feel about communal cognition?
It's based on the assumption that whatever works between neurons to make us
can work between us to make something orders of magnitude more intelligent.
All that's required is that a particular functionality be imparted to social
interactions.  Any thoughts?

In a message dated 97-03-22 10:40:58 EST, you write:

<< It sounds like you have already been brainwashed by this person's own
 clinical depression.  Now it's YOUR responsibility not to get dragged into
 the same depression.
   >>

It is true that the message this person departed to "Velociman'' may be
depressing to transhumanists. It certainly is true that a dynamic optimist
would not let him/herself be dragged into this level of thinking.
BUT- if this sentiment guarantees 'clinical' 'unipolar'depression the whole
planet may be suffering from the condition and a good dose of medication in
the water supply would make all of our philosophizing obsolete.
Is it diagnosis from an armchair? I am not saying you are hand waving,
perhaps you are a psychiatrist and have the correct data for diagnosis, or
first hand knowledge of the party. Perhaps you have a strong case for your
assertions. 

I liked these two posts, both were intriguing enough to delurk me from the
list reading/deleting position.
I see it as positive, not negative. Please address these issues openly and
agressively.
These people raise serious important questions and fears about Transhuman and
Extropian goals, which are addressed somewhat in the writings of Max More on
tthe website, but I could gladly see discussed more.
Especially the 'sour lunch' thread gave me much food for thought. I could
relate, because i address these same concerns in many a conversation.
 Ayn Rand was stubborn about not addressing a lot of issues, blythely
dismissing people with hand waving judgementalizing (perhaps accurate, but
not always), and it earned her some disdain in intellectual circles.This is
unfortunate, since so much of her philosophy is useful in reasoning through
the many issues of 'negative' people's concern. Refusal to take other
people's concerns seriously, especially when raised in polite, rational ways,
will not serve us as knowledge seekers or in spreading memes. It can also
create blind spots in our own psyche (IMHO).
 

One of the things I enjoy most about Extropians is the less dogmatic approach
to theories. I have seen a few 'rigid' thinkers on this list, but usally even
they are open to being persuaded, if and only if - someone can prove them to
be wrong. They welcome this, in an honest attempt to improve self and
knowledge of objective reality. And skeptics in general must keep an open
mind, for that is the in definition of skeptic.

Now who is assigning motivations to whom? In a world where contracts
between individuals are virtually unenforceable without corporations or
politicians in your pocket (not too different from a pre-capitalist
arisotcracy, eh?), what is to be done? We have free trade and open
travel between our nation which does a pretty good job of protecting the
fruit of one's labor, and nations like China etc, who share your ideas
that individual have no right to protection of their ideas. China is
hardly the sort of anarchists paradise I would think you dream of.

While I am trying to make proposals to work within an existing system to
maximize human liberty, you are sniping me from an irrational idealistic
position that has frankly a snowballs chance of ever becoming real. 

Wanting intellectual property protection means that I want people to
have to pay for the use of the fruit of my mental labor.  Without a
government enforcing my copyright or patent, I have as little chance of
protecting myself as ski areas do of protecting against frivolous
lawsuits based on an agreement on a ski ticket. That is all the
copyright info inside the jacket of a book is, really. if you are so
fired up about making government uneccessary, do something about
contract law and tort reform.

BTW, I still don't see how a justice system can become competetive.
Having competing court rulings in a case is merely grounds for war on
the part of PPL's to enforce each party's ruling.

That an intagible property like a book, program, DNA sequence, or
invention can be reproduced and distributed makes your argument void, as
two copies of a property can obviously serve the ends of two people at
once. 

That we humans are intelligent, and can create new knowledge sets us
apart and justifies our concept that we are more than just animals, we
are animals that create newness. We add value, decrease entropy locally,
by the brunt of our physical and mental sweat. If we are to maintain
that all power is derived from the individual (as Jefferson, et al,
stipulated), and not as a consequence of one person having a bigger gun
(as Mao stipulated), we must ask, what is it about a person that is
different from an average animal?

I claim no supernatural or other external source of these rights, the
fact that these concepts are, in the big scheme of things, merely
created fictions, the fact that we concieved them, and can observe them
in practice is demonstration enough of our uniqueness, and of the source
of the power of the individual. What is it that makes each of us
individuals? partly, it is our DNA, and partly, it is the ideas,
thoughts, dreams, and experiences we as individuals go through on our
own unique paths through life. because of this, these two things that
make us individuals deserve and demand our full protection.

Digital they aren't, discrete is what you probably meant.  And
discrete they are not either.  Spin and charge of particles are
observed as discrete values, the discreteness of color charge is
deduced indirectly, but mass, energy and momentum are observed
as continuous.  Once you get to the level of quantization of gravity,
it's not clear that discreteness will have anything to do with the
quality of your theory of everything.  (There's an infinite number
of correct ways to formulate QM.)

Well, I don't really think we humans _need_ one, but I sure would
give ten years of my life to be the first to invent a working and
testable one!  :)  (Yes, I consider myself a physicist, lowercase,
and I'm alive to a very good approximation.)

In fact, the idea of _Euclidean_ spacetime seems to be the culprit.
Spacetime as we see it is generaly believed to be an emergent
phenomenon by some popular theorists.  But, as we experimentalists
(what tribalism!) say, until I can make it go boom...

If you honestly believe that a valid contract between two people
canot be enforced with either private arbitration or public courts,
then we indeed can argue no further.  I simply don't beieve that,
and if I did, I would spend /all/ my efforts changing it, because
I refuse to give up on civilization.

Yes!  That's exactly my point, but it doesn't invalidate /my/ argument,
it topples yours.  A book, a program, and a DNA sequence ARE NOT
PROPERTY, because property is, by definition, that which two people
cannot simultaneously own.  Your continued insistence to call them
property is just a failure to see that that's precisely what we are
arguing about.

Actually, I am unimpressed by any claims that human cognition is of
any significantly different character than animal cognition, rather
than simply a matter of degree.  Such arguments are usually made by
mystics who want to think we have some special place in the world,
rather than just being yet another clump of cells in the soup of life.

Even Jefferson, who you seem to esteem, utterly rejected the idea that
knowledge itself could be "property", and this is in fact still the
law, affirmed in Feist v. Rural, though even this is in danger from
recently proposed treaties.  Even the DNA you claim as the most natural
of properties has already been litigated, and found NOT to be property.
I agree that creation is a wonderful thing, but the value of creation
itself is more than sufficient to ensure its rewards.  When you combine
it with force, you devalue it.

    The Squirrel attempts to observe the list convention of not debating
fundamentals, and will continue, yet he feels obliged to point out that
the association of transhumanist technological goals with libertarian
and anarcho-capitalistic political economics may be disadvantageous to
both, and will certainly appear forced and unconvincing to persons who
believe in one (whichever) but not the other.  Certainly there are many
thoughtful persons who find no obvious connection between these two sets
of ideas.

    Thus, in the 1960s and 1970s, there were plenty of people much into
the "turn on, tune in, take over" socialist vision of the time, who
thought that strong government and massive centrally-funded programs
were the best way to bring about advanced technologies, and who looked
forward eagerly to doing just that after the "take over" part had been
accomplished.  Many of those persons are still around, and are no doubt
somewhere between bemused and pleased that a bunch of flakey
libertarians (their hypothetical term, not one the Squirrel would use
himself -- some of the Squirrel's best friends are libertarians...) have
also finally figured out that high-tech is neat.  The Squirrel trusts
that many of them will be at least open-minded enough to say, "Welcome,
Extropians, to the wonderful world of technological optimism!  We need
all the help we can get, even from clueless newbies like you."

    But consider a person predisposed toward technological optimism, who
does not think much of libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism.  There are
lots of people who don't think much of libertarianism and
anarcho-capitalism, so the Squirrel submits that this case is worth
considering.  On first contact with Extropians, such a person might say,
"Aw, it's just a bunch of libertarian kooks spewing -- it's not worth my
time to listen to them."  One can miss out on a lot by labeling people
"kooks", but on the other hand, when time is limiting, a being who has
not transcended may perhaps be forgiven for seeking science in _Nature_
rather than in _The_National_Enquirer_, even though the latter does get
it right now and then.  Yet whether libertarians and anarcho-capitalists
are kooky or not, the cause of technological optimism is thereby damaged
by the association.

    Similarly, a person leaning toward libertarianism, who did not think
much of technological optimism, might dismiss Extropians as just a bunch
of of technological optimist kooks spewing, and the cause of
libertarianism would thereby be damaged.  There are lots of people who
don't think much of technological optimism, so this case is also worth
considering.

    Thus to link technological optimism and transhumanist technological
goals on the one hand, with libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism on the
other, risks eliciting positive responses from only those persons
already predisposed to both, and negative ones from nearly everybody
else.  Yet there are probably far more people who look favorably on just
one (whichever) of the two idea sets, than on both.

    Thus a strategy for "what is to be done" might be to distance
transhumanist technological goals from libertarianism and
anarcho-capitalism, at least at the public-relations and educational
interface to the rest of the non-transcended world.

Even though the state legislature has decreed that ticket contracts are
binding, the courts ignore it. It even happens in cases reminiscent of
the lady who sued McDOnalds over hot coffee. Individuals were skiing
outside the bounds or were skiing negligently and injured someone else,
so the person who was at fault blamed the ski area for allowing him to
ski that way, and won.

Exactly. unfortunately, we have a case of local legislative government
being ignored by the judicial government.

It didn't sound like Velociman's friend was the "lowest common denominator".
 Instead, he sounds like a lot of people to whom I've tried to express
transhumanist and extropian ideas.  And this fellow didn't sound "depressed",
as Davin suggests.  I'm afraid that calling such people "depressed" dilutes
the clinical meaning of the word --- just as the typical leftist epithet of
"fascist" for anyone to the right of a Democrat dilutes the meaning of that
word.  Just because someone isn't optimistic doesn't mean they're depressed.

Unless you're an "autosingulatarian" (tm) or willing for our ideas to be
consigned to the fringe, I think we have to come to terms with the great mass
of people who will react negatively to our ideas if they aren't better
prepared and we do a better job of communicating.  With all due respect to
the Randians, I don't think a Hank Rearden fantasy of the heroic inventors
just ignoring the rest of society will do.  If augmentation is outlawed, we
could be in for a seriously delayed ascension, folks.  

Try to imagine serious uploading research if technical discussion of brain
implants into "healthy" humans is prohibited in the industrialized world.
 And the way things are going, just forget about genetic augmentation of
healthy humans, unless the attitudes of a LOT of people change.  You're not
going to be able to walk down to the local convenience store and buy genetic
alteration pills like you can buy aspirin.  

Yes, many developments can be achieved while pursuing goals short of explicit
augmentation.  But for the really big changes, a lot of expensive research is
going to have to be done with the express aim of augmentation and
transformation.  That reasearch is going to have to be done by the medical
establishment.  The fruits of that research are going to have to be
administered by doctors.

Medical doctors are very covetous of the licenses granted by the state to
practice medicine.  They are loathe to risk that lucrative profession.  At
least one friend of mine who has reacted negatively to transumanist ideas is
a relatively young neurosurgeon: She scoffs at the idea of uploading as so
far beyond our capabilities as to be fantasy and reacts with horror to
concepts of radical genetic augmentation.  I KNOW she is not atypical.  I
strongly suspect that she has been conditioned to recoil from the idea of
augmentation (and from seeing how close it might really be) by powerful
societal myths: Icarus, Faust, Paradise Lost, Frankenstein.  I believe these
myths have developed to shackle those who would push too fast against the
power structures of a given social paradigm.  It almost seems like the power
of those myths over a specific individual's imagination grows in proportion
to their personal ability to overcome them: The Faust mythos seems strongest
in some of the doctors with whom I've discussed transhumanism.

My point is that a cultural atmosphere of PERMISSION is, if not a
prerequisite, at least a powerful facilitator of transhumanism.  In Icarus
and Frankenstein, we face outright mythic PROHIBITION.  Such deeply-ingrained
social mores aren't overcome by the wishful thinking of small minorities.
 We've talked here before about the need to create new myths, and I think
that is a very worthwhile endeavor for our "culture workers".  But the work
has to proceed on many fronts at once, and the workings of "countermythology"
seem likely to be too slow to benefit the generation of which I happen to be
a member.  As I said in my previous post, we have to express ourselves
explicitly, but be careful not to trigger those psychic faustian landmines.

Oh, and by the way, Velociman, I got the reference in your subject line:
"What is to Be Done" was the title of Lenin's pamphlet on revolutionary
practice.

This is very much the case, seeing cases in courts on surrogate mother
contracts, ski accidents, etc, the validity of contracts is very much
threatened, and i share your disgust with the state of things. I lost my
lighting business for the most part due to such a case, and have seen
two ski areas owned by freinds gone bankrupt due to such disregard.

This is where we get down to nuts and bolts. I say that my selling you a
book or software program is  only a license to USE said material for a
limited purpose, not a right to reproduce the particular copy you have. 
Whether this is done by a highly costly system of complex contractual
arrangements for each and every customer, which I must enforce in civil
court on a case by case basis, or by a system where all members of a
society agree that works that are copyrighted are used by a standardized
and legally defined behavior, that is enforced by a mutual aid pact
(duh, the feds or private cops, it matters not), is simply a matter of
what is most cost effective. I say a copyright system is more cost
effective, you say personal agreements are. Sorry i don't have the funds
to pay lawyers to argue with you on the issue.

hardly. any cognition that is unable to improve the condition of the

of course it is not property, since if it were, the big corporations
would have to pay royalties to any tom dick or harriet they stole genes
from to make their hideously expensive drugs with.

As for combining creation with force being a devaluing property, i would
say that failing to protect the creative rights of the individual, with
laws, litigation, or even force, we denigrate the individual and the
idea that power derives from the individual.

I don't mind convincing the public when some government agency wants to ban

more from my friends.   
 
The problem is Ayn Rand wanted to argue to change people's minds by
intellectual force and intimidation.  She would not let them alone, got
herself and them mad and burned bridges.  That's too rigid for me.    
  
I'm much more interested in letting friends think what they want.  Seek first
to understand, then and only then be understood.  But if what they think is
too far from what I am working on.  I let them alone and do my own thing.  If
they come closer to me eventually, that's fine.  I might get closer to their
way of thinking too.

suggested,  at least not during _that_ lunch.  Things had gone too far
afield.  Only bridge burning would had been the result that day.  
  
All the better to have a second lunch starting with:  "I thought a lot about
what you said.  I understand why you currently see things that way.  There
are a lot of fears and questions, but I think there are three things you
might want to consider besides."   
 
"First,  more people communicate faster than ever to solve problems, take the
Internet for example. That's extropic.   Second,  science is being discussed
more than ever publicly.  There are few surprises in science, take cloning as
an example.  People have been talking about it since the 1950's.  That's been
in very main stream speculative fiction for years.  And finally,  life
expectancy and health technology is increasing because people are working
hard to make a better quality of life for themselves.  That's what extropy is
for.  What's the alternative?  I can't believe you would want people to work
hard for a _poorer_ standard of living and an increasing death rate, right?"

In the public forum yes, I agree. . . By a friend who comes right out and
says "I hope you fail and will work against you."  NO! 
 
I have a hard time taking other peoples concerns seriously when it comes to
limiting science, technology,  e.g., banning cloning, etc.  The greatest
arguments against these technologies is based on fear that there will be
inadequate safeguards for the new technology.  This translates into fear of
god for religious people and generally, fear of a disaster.  Fear is the
greatest de-motivator (to a much lesser extent, a motivator) of change in
human history and is tied to pessimism _not_ optimism.    
 
Pessimism was an evolutionary survival advantage and has a long history.
 People who were pessimistic stored more food and water for times of shortage
and fear was the motivator for this survivalist activity.    
 
But there are at least two kinds of fear.  First, fear that technology
_will_cause_ a disaster and second, fear technology will _not_ find the
solutions to our problems and therefore not improve our quality of life.
 Both are pessimistic.  The problem gets worse when pessimism turns into
depression and that leads to giving up on technology and can regress back
into the non-science supernatural.  
 
To me,  fear of _technology_ is an _anti-survival_ idea.  A spear, knife,
arrow, ax, gun , nuclear bomb is dangerous and can cause lost of life.  If
people feared fire so much they banned it, where would we be now?  Dead.  The
key is learning to control the technology so the disaster fears are quieted.
 This is what should be discussed. 
  
As a research and development scientist, I work on developing technologies
including the safeguards for those technologies.  Fear must not be a
de-motivator for me to develop technology.  Overcoming fear is required in
order for me to do my job.   
 
With few exceptions (Small Pox) working with the most dangerous
microorganisms ever known should not be banned even though they could "get
loose" and cause a disaster.  Some people and laboratories are not qualified
to work on these, that is true.  The medical treatments in general out weigh
the potential disasters.  I can show people how we are controlling the
microorganisms while we are working with them to quiet their fears (as my
fears have been quieted).  But that is about all I think I can do and still
have time to work on the projects. 
 
I would not be a good person to talk about the fears of others about
technology because I am firstly pro-science and pro-technology.  I am biased.
 I admit it.  i.e. unless I constantly talked about the science of the
safeguards and not the technology itself.  Perhaps I could turn that into a
positive and be OK with it.    
  
So, I choose to talk about the optimistic areas of developing technology and
not the safeguards too much.  I leave it to others, better diplomats like Ed
Regis to debate nanotechnology (see Brain Tennis from
http://www.hotwired.com/frontdoor/).  We need the R&D group, the customer
input group and the third party (but please not government) to meld the R&D
and customer groups into development of the new technology.

A Week of Pain

I wander the city, looking, watching.
So many people, so many lives.
Do they all feel like I do?
Do they know my pain?

I look inside and feel it,
the pain of my life,
it burns within me,
and I protect the flame.

Why do I torture myself?

I look again inside myself,
the same familiar place,
and I see my goals, my dreams, my ambitions,
and there I see the pain,
eating it all away.

What is pain, 
and why does it haunt me so?
Why am I so scared of it?
Why cant I just let it live;
Why cant I be a friend to pain?

What is pain,
Does it deserve to exist?
Sometimes I just want to get rid of pain,
But I am too attached to it;
It is my enemy, but I love it.

Can I have a peace with pain?
Can I let it live without allowing it to dominate?

What do I really want?
I think I want peace;
no more fighting, no more conflict,
just a calm acceptance of how things are right now.

Pain exists;
Suffering exists.
I acknowledge that fact,
and am unsure what to do about it.

What do you think?

- David Ambur Musick

I'm not feeling any pain and most of the people I see don't appear to be
feeling any pain.  Pain must have a cause; I do not believe it is the
natural 'resting' state of most beings.  Your poem indicates no cause
for your pain so how can anyone (who doesn't know you personally) relate
to it?  Last I'd heard, everything in your life was just growing more
and more fascinating every moment!

You have my utmost sympathy for the problems you have encountered in 
attempting to discuss your own closely-held ideas with your friends, 
and I suspect that all transhumanists have encountered a similar 
situation in their own lives.

My master's degree went into a crash-and-burn a few months ago when 
one of my degree committee members decided that a transhumanist 
emphasis was not something that he could support.  And my time at 
Antioch, supposedly a bastion of progressive thinking, was 
characterized by hostility from my classmates towards transhumanist 
ideas.  For even mentioning that someday we might move beyond race, I 
was called a racist.  For stating that I don't worship anything, I 
was reviled as heartless and cold.  For wishing that people could 
learn to relate beyond gender roles, I was considered anti-woman.  

My friends repeatedly urged to me to get out of this bad situation and 
get back to writing, and I finally took that advise.  Most of them don't 
relate to the concept of transhumanism, but they at least support me in 
trying to pursue it, and they will listen to me when I talk about it. 
Realistically, only another transhumanist is going to be able to 
relate on that level, and I hope that the Internet lists and the 
efforts of the Extropy institute will aid in everyone finding ways to 
connect with each other.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

The internal forces of a star don't affect the symmetry of its gravity field.
Those of a cluster, on another hand, occasionally eject a member star.

>What is to be done?

Take a look at the masses following Wired magazine into the future proudly
proclaiming transhumanism. Get ready to add that list of quotes to that
"What the experts say..." list. Every major breakthrough has been fought at
the start just as they fought against vaccines when they first came out for
smallpox telling wild stories of how people were going to turn into cows
and other nonsense because they used fluid from the sores of a similar cow
disease. And then the classic "If people were meant to fly, God would've
given them wings." Today these both are entirely stupid and those quotes
you meantioned before will be also. Naturally any radical ideas will be
rejected by an established peer-based scientific social order system. The
best ideas *NEVER* come from official, established sources. Everyone is
afraid of the unknown but we rush out to greet it. We're on the cutting
edge of evolution. The pioneers. We are the dreamers and creators of the
future. Once society gets over future shock and all the media attention,
ideas will no longer sound alien and will become absorbed by society. I've
just seen a recent news story on TV about a woman who had identical
quadruplets and the media referred to the phenomenon as GET THIS: "Natures
version of cloning". The media appears to be already done with the initial
"shock value" mode and may now even  creating acceptance for it through
subtle memes. Another aspect of the whole "negative outlook on the future"
meme is directly related to the approaching millenium. Get ready for all
the "hell, fire, and brimstone" people to come out en masse and proclaim
the end is near! This creates a uneasy memetic environment and puts a bad
taste in everyone's mouth by tainting their visions of a positive future
being constantly bombarded by negative outlooks.

Kathryn,

I know it's disheartening to have the negativists affect your personal
acheivements in such a direct manner... We extropians rarely expect get
a unanimous "aye" from any comittee as far as our beliefs are concerned
- but when negativists impede your acquisition of a degree, that can be
a real downer! I've been there (trying to earn a degree) and have not
handled it well. 
In the coming months and years, as reality comes closer to our visions
of the future, we should expect stepped-up attacks from the mortalist
side of the isle: luddites, Malthuseans/earth firsters, religionists,
control freaks, Institutional media, etc..  It'll be one big Pre-Mortem
Fiesta!
But they will have the least effect on the long-term results.  I beleive
that each person falls into one of three groups:

1)  Those of us who actively work for and beleive in the transhuman
ideas and ideals (immortalists): A small minority of the population.

2) The people who truly fear advances in technology, freedom and culture
along extropian lines (mortalists): a minority of the population
(perhaps currently larger than the extropian segment).

3) Those who, deep inside, aren't sure so they either stay quite or 
mimic the attitude of the day. IMO, the majority.

Both (2) and (3) above can put temporary brakes on advances but the
saving grace is population (3)'s "seeing-is-believing", "show me the
money" attitude.  Their philosophy/non-philosophy is a damper but when
economic and life-enhancing results are in, they'll put their money and
their organs where their life is.

Just think about what will happen when the AARP and the baby-boomers are
one and the same.  Scientific research in the 40's, 50's, and early
60's  seemed to focus on child immunization, birth defects, and other
newborn/early childhood ailment. In the 60's, 70's, 80's and early- to
mid- 90's it was Sexually transmitted diseases (AIDS in the latter part
of this period), drug & alcohol treatment, and workplace disorders. 
Already we are starting to see the shift toward cancer, heart problems,
memory disorders, bone problems and mobility issues of the aged.  People
will be lighting candles, wearing ribbons, and sewing together quilts to
bring to light these "new" "Crises that society will no longer be able
to ignore".

Like it or not, not only will people start accepting our ideals...
"society will demand it"! Gov't funded of course. Social Security (tax),
Medicare (tax),Precious Gift (organ selling, donation, cloning,
transplant market tax) Second Chance (cryo-fund tax).

Transhumanity/Immortality may not come the way we want it nor the way we
expect it. Not just from extropian acheivements but those of others as
well.

Those ideas are expected from the politically correct do-nothings of our
society.  They have trapped themselves.  You did not let them trap you.
 Nothing in history has been unanimously accepted. Even the best ideas had
opposition.  My advice is:  Don't pay any attention to your critics, don't
even ignore them.

I don't understand.  It seems the two hands you describe provide the analogy
with the flexibility you say it lacks.  The concept of 'escape velocity'
seems to be analogous to 'internal individual forces' that could 'propell' a
'partical' 'away' from a 'condensing mass.'  The concept of 'freedom'
becomes possession of 'escape energy.'  One is forced to wonder about the
concept of 'speed limit' and its correlation to sanity.

It is already happening, and it happens at its own pace.  For us to try
and mold it would be like a cell trying to organise the body of which it
is a part- ridiculous.  We bring it about by simply living our lives
fully.

Usenet is the beginnings of something like a 'brain' for the world, I
often think.  People sharing memes and being infected by them.  Over
time, memes that have been thoroughly spread and tested in argument this
way are more likely to be true and useful.  

And there may be some holistic or emergent effect that we won't
understand (at least not initially, or not until its effects come within
our range of cognition).

Since I have already perfectly wasted this early
Saturday [IRQ] make that Sunday afternoon as well [RTI]
afternoon, I could as well go on. This rant will be
hopefully more focused (though _which_ focus I am still
at loss to decide), less generic.

Well, I _am_ currently in the process of getting a life.
For almost two months now I am doing -- of all things
-- vehicular embedded programming, in a secondary
outsource tributary to Bayerische Motorenwerke, a
Kraut car manufacturer. This is both bad and good.

Bad, since lots of transhumanist-value-set people seem to be
accumulating in an IT-related job sink, with all the strings
attached (being restricted to a peculiar activity type, and
presenting an only-too-convenient external classification
handle (not a _scientist_, just an another IT professional,
you see, so you can safely redirect whatever he says
>/dev/null)) but maybe that's an artefact of observing
only net-visible transhumanists/extropians. I suppose
there is a whole non-wired world out there. (It has
been rumoured there _is_ one). Well.

Good, since distributed realtime embedded systems are
likely to play a large role in future infrastructures,
whichever, you pick your choice. Everything concerning
desktop machines, networks, and physical agentry. Current
CAN embeddeds and embedded-DSP hybrids seem to herald
this. Industrial programming is pragmatic (which is also
both good and bad, since one rarely has to combat ivory
tower-attitude, but otoh cannot hover over a single project
indefinitely, polishing it to perfectness past recognition),
and one has often to touch hardware. Now controlling
nontrivial (since heterogenous and/or multiple) hardware,
reliably, _and_ in realtime, is interesting. It both
helps to contain age-related creeping dementia, and
allows one to acquire a set of possibly useful skills
for the interesting times we are purportedly have to
face soon.
Or so I hope.

(Another good thing is that the outfit I am currently
with also does diverse things like simulation, emulation,
testing systems (cum GUIs), virtual machines, and the like,
so one will probably rarely get bored; but I digress).

I discovered there is no freedom in the academia, and none
outside of it. In the academia, even postdocs bend to the
whims of the head of the lab they work in, and by time they
had progressed to the stage of being able to define their
own research topics, they discover they're semi-burnt-out
elderly ex-researcher-now-administrator-types. Gawks. So
the only way you can influence what you do is by travelling
long, hard and frequently, and polishing a lot of brass
doorknobs to bright sheen, besides. It also helps being
very very good.

In the industry you also fail to be self-determined. Large
outfits, very like brontos in tar pits, are boggled down with
overhead. Flat structures all and well, but you still hark to
your chef, and he to his, and so recursively upwards. In small
outfits, customer, especially Large Customer, is King, and the
only thing left to you is which customer you do choose. (If
you reject too many of them in a row you might face some
terminal cash problems). It also helps being very very good.

Anyway, here's a list of random observation I'd like to
commit to my hard drive/modem lest they fade from memory
altogether (though stale already, since past the fresh
impression stage ). I'll be hopping from tier to tier
incoherently (this is a rant, no?), so bear with me.

First, a short sketch of the outfit I'm currently with.
It's quite small, being 8 persons in toto, of which two
work constantly off-location. There is no regular working
hours, but those cooperating with BMW must be available
during certain hours (09-17), since these guys work only
at these fixed time. Occasionally, some of them are
working at home. Working on weekends is not exceptional
during high load time.

Since it's a mass-market (>100 kUnits, I am speaking of
the large-company-related business thread) there is no
inflation in the hardware performance as witnessed by
PCs: the embeddeds utilized are 68HC11xxx derivates, a
time-honoured 16-bit Motorola product line (for the curious:
these are custom versions like EA9, P2, etc.) Paying a
programmer for several weeks to optimize away some 1 kByte
seems to pay on the short run, as even $0.10 amounts
accumulate if mass-produced. Let's face it, the customer
is conservative. Even worse, he is sometimes randomly
stupid (a random bigwig adhocery, deciding "we need that
feature").

Due to inefficiences of large car manufacturers, radical
(EV) designs from small outfits ought to have distinct
advantages on the market. (Their big disadvantage will
be absence of serious cash (both for R&D and marketing),
so their possible success will be depedant on risk
capital venture's wisdom). I am thinking about ZEV
legislation in California here.

Backwards compatibility is a must, so though a CAN
trend is firmly there, older families must still be
supported for the next decade, or so. Vehicular digital
electronics seem to also suffer from creeping featuritis,
as even more microprocessors, sensors, buses, and
actuators are pressed into the high-end vehicle. This
contributes to a mushrooming power drain, which demands
bigger on-board generators, larger batteries, more
space to accomodate the gadgetry, and larger motors.
(In short, this is a dog. For a person, who has waited
for the advent of 100-kg, compound-frame, methanol
reformer PEM fuel cell, regen braking, motor-in-the-wheel,
for the past decade, despairing by increments, this is
the very antithesis of the trends extrapolated. Another
sad confirmation to the so-called free market's failure
to provide technically decent solutions, due to average's
customer dire stupidity). </diatribe>

Moreover, it tends to increase the system's brittleness,
since a software defect may jam (since shared) bus traffic,
drain the battery overnight due to failure to go to sleep
mode, and to switch off, etc. Interesting is a trend to
multiple, intravehicular heterogenous packet-based
networks: Kbus, MIbus for the steppers, Diagnosis-Bus,
now CAN, etc. This requires the use of (part-time)
intelligent bridges, which do packet translation,
sub-net broadcasting, and trivial routing. There is
no obvious trend towards optical LANs, albeit
vehicular environment to be heavily EMfected.

Stepping back a step; two trivial observations: a) that the
vehicle is starting to resemble one's habitat ("my car is
my castle"), and b) its intelligent networks increasingly
look very like that of an animal. A fully autonomous
vehicle is not an mid-80's pipe dream, anymore. Further,
gauging from past trend, we are likely so see downscaling
of high-end features into the mid- and low-end niche.
Moreover, distributed realtime control systems from the
car, are likely to spill over into the house automation,
the next Big Thing after the PC.

Considering a (yet hypothetical) wearable, it might also
vastly profit from these developments. I am particularly
heartended to learn of book-sized methanol direct
metabolizing fuel cells currently being developed, of
about a 50 W/unit performance. I dunno how you feel,
but I consider inability of accessing one's well-configured
environment to be maddening. Portables, and palmtops are
both inadequate. Two diametrally differing solutions seem
possible: everybody runs Win2000, and carries his frozen
configuration state on a solid-state card, or plucks it
from net home node, whether over wire link or cellular.
Or, verey like a hermit crab, one carries his working
environment with him. Since the latter version speaks
contra microsoftian monoculture, I vote for the latter
option.

Tasks diversity considered, like head-up video, GPS
and inertial navigation, biotracking, power management,
voice recognition, IrDa, cellular modem, nonvolatile storage
unit, and generic computation (secure comm link, digicash,
...), this asks for a distributed realtime embedded
solution. (What fun! Next thing they'll be asking will
be an active exoskeleton). Anybody is already doing
this? If not, they should.

that's enough for today,
ciao,
'gene

Max Planck started the entire revolution by proposing that energy is NOT 
continuous, everything followed from there. Take a beam of light for example, 
it has momentum nhf, h is the Planck constant, f is the frequency of the 
light, and n is an INTEGER, the number of photons. Digital.

If you want to find the momentum of an individual photon, hf, you can find it 
by using the formula hN/X , h is the Planck constant again, and N is the 
number of wave crests the photon makes over a distance X. Digital. 

If you want to find the energy of a photon multiply the digital momentum by a  
constant, the speed of light. Digital.

Of course, there is a basic randomness built into the fabric of the universe, 
so if we were to actually perform this experiment when we got near the end of 
distance X it would not be entirely clear if we should include the last wave 
crest or not. We could minimize this problem and get a more accurate 
measurement of momentum by making X bigger, but then you'd know less about 
the position of the photon, X. Momentum and position have an inverse 
relationship, the more you know about one the less you know about the other, 
however randomness is NOT a continuous quantity, in fact it is as far from 
that concept as it is possible to get.

As for matter, it comes in particles, it is not smeared around, only the  
probability of finding it. If you look for an electron at a particular spot 
you may find one or you may not, you can't be certain, the best you can do is 
come up with probabilities. However one thing you CAN be absolutely certain
of is that you will find an electron OR you will not. Digital. There is no 
middle ground, there is no chance you will find half an electron or "sort of" 
an electron. If an electron is detected when it hits a phosphorous screen it 
will produce a photon of light. If it is not detected it will not produce a
photon of light. There are no other possibilities, it will never produce 
half a photon of light. If an electron is detected it ALWAYS acts like a 
particle. The probability of finding the particle acts like a wave and is 
not deterministic hence the random element.

Stephen Hawking just stated in an interview with an AP reporter:

"The fuss about cloning is rather silly," he said. "I can't see any
essential distinction between cloning and producing brothers and sisters
in the time-honored way."

He also identified his favorite website: 

http://xxx.laniel.gov

which is a physics and mathematics papers archive. Note the "xxx" rather
than "www" in the address.

If we can get more luminaries come out in support of cloning, I think we
can establish a beachhead from which to expand over time.

ATM network company corners 'Internet'

Published: March 20, 1997

BY ELIZABETH WASSERMAN Mercury News Staff Writer

There's another new problem with the Internet.

Somebody owns the name.

Internet Inc., of Reston, Va., is in the midst of a two-year battle to 
protect
its corporate trademark. The company, founded in 1984, has little if 
anything to
do with personal computers, e-mail or surfing for information. It runs a 
network
of automated teller machines and, in January, merged with another ATM 
network to
become Honor Technologies Inc.

But seven years ago, Internet Inc. registered ``Internet'' as a trademark 
with
the federal government, not knowing that the global computer network 
popularly
known by the same moniker would become so widely used. The company, 
however,
still wants the exclusive right to use and license the Internet name.

``It's now a valuable mark,'' said Edward Kondracki, an attorney with 
Kerkam,
Stowell, Kondracki & Clarke in Falls Church, Va., which represents 
Internet Inc.
``Events have happened since then that increased the value.''

One of the results of the fight by Internet Inc., whose right to the mark 
has
been challenged by a society made up of many of the technological 
founders of the
Internet, is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has delayed the 
petitions
of hundreds of companies seeking to use the word ``Internet'' to 
trademark their
goods or services.

Companies requesting trademarks in the burgeoning Internet field are 
being told
by Washington they will face delays unless they use a more generic term, 
such as
``global communications network.''

``In trademark-office parlance, `Internet' is like one of George Carlin's 
seven
dirty words: It cannot be spoken,'' said Sally Abel, an attorney with 
Fenwick &
West in Palo Alto, who estimates that 90 percent of her clients have been
affected by the trademark case.

A trademark is a distinctive phrase, word, logo, or symbol that 
distinguishes one
manufacturer's product from another's -- for example, Ford cars, 
McDonald's
hamburgers, IBM computers.

Trademarks can be awarded in scores of different categories. For example, 
Apple
Computer is a trademark and it co-exists with Apple Corp., the Beatles' 
trademark
record label. But the trademark allows Apple Computer to prevent another
computer-related company from using the name.

Sometimes, however, trademarks can be lost when a term becomes considered
``generic'' -- for example, Bayer Corp. lost its trademark for the name 
aspirin.

Internet Inc. was awarded trademark protections in categories that include
communications services, providing electronic data transmission services, 
and
electronic banking and retail marketing.

Some of Abel's clients in techno-savvy Silicon Valley have been confused 
when
asked to change business or product names. ``They say, `What do you mean 
global
communications network?' '' Abel said. ` ``Aren't we talking about the 
Internet?'
''

No one is sure how much longer the growing number of Internet cases will 
be
delayed. The trademark office's administrative trial and appeal board has 
been
reviewing the case of the Internet Society and Corporation for National 
Research
Initiatives vs. Internet Inc. since it was filed in October 1994. Federal
officials say the importance of the case -- nearly 1,000 petitions 
requesting
marks involving the term Internet have been received to date -- has 
contributed
to the delay.

``It's a monumental case,'' said Lisa-Joy Zgorski, press secretary for 
the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. ``It will have tremendous implications in 
how we
handle relevant trademarks.''

The Internet Society, a non-governmental organization for global 
cooperation for
the Internet, had tried to register its own trademark of the name 
starting in
1989. But those requests were denied, citing the Internet Inc. trademark. 
Now,
the society is arguing that the term ``Internet'' is generic and so 
widely used
-- like aspirin, escalator and cellophane -- that it shouldn't be owned by
anyone.

``It's like car or telephone or television,'' said Patrice Lyons, the 
Washington,
D.C.-based attorney for the Internet Society. ``There are certain terms 
like that
that are generally accepted to be descriptive of a particular thing. They
shouldn't be subject to trademark restrictions. Internet is merely a 
descriptive
term for the well-known network of networks.''

Lyons said the categories for which Internet Inc. was awarded trademark 
status
are too broad because they cover a big share of Internet-related 
businesses and
their products.

In technological circles, no company wants a product to be considered 
generic. In
the early 1990s, Intel Corp. was stripped of trademark protections for 
its 386
microprocessor chip, after competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc. proved 
the term
was generic. When Intel tried to protect other chips in the series -- the 
486,
586, 686, etc. -- AMD and Compaq Computer Corp. opposed the petitions. 
Intel
switched to the product name Pentium but has since been embroiled in a 
similar
dispute over the rights to the MMX name, which competitors say is generic 
for
``multimedia extensions.''

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued 1 million trademarks to 
date.
Last year, the office examined 200,000 applications for trademarks, 
Zgorski said,
among those nearly 1,000 that requested trademarks using the term 
``Internet.''

The Internet is having a notable affect on trademark law in other ways, 
too,
because it cuts across national boundaries.

``It's an international Yellow Pages,'' said Stephen Elias, author of 
``Patent,
Copyright & Trademark,'' published by Berkeley's Nolo Press. ``It used to 
be that
your decision about what marks to use, where to register them, where to 
search
for existing marks, could all be done on a local basis. If you were 
registering
Pete's Barber Shop or Barking Dog Coffee Roasters, there were likely no 
other
businesses by that name in your town.''

These days, a company in San Jose with a presence on the Internet might 
have to
check trademark registrations in Italy or Australia or Japan before 
deciding upon
a company or product name, Elias said.

The question remains whether ``Internet'' is too widely used to be 
protected in a
trademark.

``We advise clients that putting `Internet' in your name is like putting 
the word
`The' in your name,'' said Palo Alto attorney Mark Radcliffe, of Gray 
Cary Ware &
Freidenrich. ``Internet is not protected for something related to the 
Internet,
just as using PC is not protected in the personal-computer market.''

He has also supported bionics (quite naturally) and I would consider him 
at least a supporter of the transhuman cause. 

It's too bad I don't believe genius is genetic, otherwise it might be 
interesting to clone him... (raises some fun ethical problems too).

You mean xxx.lanl.gov. Yes, this is a great site for us Hawking-wannabees :-)

I think you are missing the point here. The other brain would think it 
was you and that you wasn't it since it didn't control your actions. 
There would simply be two of you.

So, who would it be? I think it is important to distinguish between 
you as your current conscious thread and you as a person with certain 
memories, personality and goals. The copies after forking would be 
different threads of consciousness but would be the same person (we need 
a better terminology here, I hope my sentence made sense).

Hardly likely. Consciousness seems to be very linked with the integrity 
of the brain (or information processing system, for infomorphs)

Yes, this is an important question. I define myself to be what I do (I 
see myself as a mapping A acting on the universe), so to me what kind of 
brain I have doesn't matter.

The thread on intellectual property is getting down to the "nuts and bolts"
of whether the concept of property is properly applied to these 'ideal
objects'.  I thought that the comments of some past writers on this subject
might be of interest to the list. Here's an article by the anarchist writer
Benjamin Tucker which raises some of the same issues.

                THE CRIMINALITY OF PATENT AND COPYRIGHT LAWS

		      	    by Benjamin Tucker    

The laws of Patent and Copyright are the means by which the State, that
greatest of criminal and tyranical monopolies, grants special monopolistic
privileges to a few at the expense of the many by protecting inventors and
authors against competition for a period long enough to enable them to
extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labour measure
of their services. The abolition of these monopolies would fill their
beneficiaries with a wholesome fear of competition which would cause them to
be satisfied with pay for their services equal to that which other labourers
get for theirs, and to secure it by placing their products and works on the
market at the outset at prices so low that their lines of business would be
no more tempting to competitors than any other lines.   

The Patent and Copyright monopolies are a species of property rights which
depend for their legitimacy on the subtle notion of "property in ideas". The
defenders of such property set up an analogy between the production of
material things and the production of abstractions, and on the strength of
it declare that the manufacturer of mental products, no less than the
manufacturer of material products, is a labourer worthy of his hire. So far,
so good. But, to make out their case, they are obliged to go further, and to
claim, in violation of their own analogy, that the labourer who creates
mental products, unlike the labourer who creates material products, is
entitled to exemption from competition. Because the Lord, in his wisdom, or
the Devil, in his malice, has so arranged matters that the inventor and the
author produce naturally at a disadvantage, man, in his might, proposes to
supply the devine or diabloic deficiency by an artificial arrangement that
shall not only destroy this disadvantage, but actually give the inventor and
author an advantage that no labourer enjoys, - an advantage, moreover, which
in practice, goes, not to the inventor and the author, but to the promoter
and the publisher and the monopolist.    

Convincing as the argument for property in ideas may seem at first hearing,
if you think about it long enough, you will begin to be supicious. The first
thing, perhaps, to arouse your suspicion will be the fact that none of the
champions of such property propose the punishment of those who violate it,
contenting themselves with subjecting the offenders to the risk of damage
suits, and that nearly all of them are willing that even the risk of suit
shall disappear when the proprietor has enjoyed his right for a certain
number of years. Now, if, as the French writer, Alphonse Karr, remarked,
property in ideas is a property like any other property, then its violation,
like the violation of any other property, deserves criminal punishment, and
its life, like that of any other property, should be secure in right against
the lapse of time. And, this not being claimed by the upholders of property
in ideas, the suspicion arises that such a lack of the courage of their
conviction may be due to an instinctive feeling that they are wrong.    

I take it that, if it were possible, and if it had always been possible, for
an unlimited number of individuals to use to an unlimited extent and in an
unlimited number of places the same concrete things at the same time, there
never would have been any such thing as the institution of property. Under
those circumstances the idea of property would never have entered the human
mind, or, at any rate, if it had, would have been summarily dismissed as too
gross an absurdity to be seriously entertained for a moment. Had it been
possible for the concrete creation or adaptation  resulting from the efforts
of a single individual to be used contemporaneously by all individuals,
including the creator or adapter, the realization, or impending realization,
of this possiblity, far from being seized upon as an excuse for a law to
prevent the use of this concrete thing without the consent of its creator or
adapter, and far from being guarded against as an injury to one, would have
been welcomed as a blessing to all,- in short, would have been viewed as a
most fortunate element in the nature of things. The raison d'etre of
property is found in the very fact that there is no such possiblity,- in the
fact that it is impossible in the nature of things for concrete objects to
be used in different places at the same time. This fact existing, no person
can remove from another's possession and take to his use another's concrete
creation without thereby depriving that other of all opportunity to use that
which he created, and for this reason it became socially necessary, since
successful society rests on individual initiative, to protect the individual
creator in the use of his concrete creations by forbidding others to use
them without his consent. In other words, it became necessary to institute
property in concrete things.    

But all this happened so long ago that we of today have entirely forgotten
why it happened. In fact, it is very doubtful whether, at the time of the
institution of property, those who effected it thoroughly realized and
understood the motive of their course. Men sometimes do by instinct and
without analysis that which conforms to right reason. The institutors of
property may have been governed by circumstances inhering in the nature of
things, without realizing that, had the nature of things been the opposite,
they would not have instituted property. But, be that as it may, even
supposing that they thoroughly understood their course, we, at any rate,
have pretty nearly forgotten their understanding. And so it has come about
that we have made of property a fetish; that we consider it a sacred thing;
that we have set up the god of property on an altar as an object of
idol-worship; and that most of us are not only doing what we can to
strengthen and perpetuate his reign within the proper and original limits of
his sovereignty, but also are mistakenly endeavouring to extend his dominion
over things and under circumstances which, in their pivotal characteristic,
are precisely the opposite of those out of which his power developed.    

All of which is to say, in briefer compass, that from the justice and social
necessity of property in concrete things we have erroneously assumed the
justice and social necessity of property in abstract things,- that is, of
property in ideas,- with the result of nullifying to a large and lamentable
extent that fortunate element in the nature of things, in this case not
hypothetical, but real, - namely, the immeasurably fruitful possibility of
the use of abstract things by any number of individuals in any number of
places at precisely the same time, without in the slightest degree impairing
the use thereof by any single individual. Thus we have hastily and stupidly
jumped to the conclusion that property in concrete things logically implies
property in abstract things, whereas, if we had had the care and the
keenness to accurately analyze, we should have found that the very reason
which dictates the advisability of property in abstract things denies the
advisability of property in abstract things.  We see here a curious instance
of that frequent mental phenomenon, - the precise inversion of the truth by
a superficial view.    

Furthermore, were the conditions the same in both cases, and concrete things
capable of use by different persons in different places at the same time,
even then, I say, the institution of property in concrete things, though
under those conditions manifestly absurd, would be infinitely less
destructive of individual opportunities, and therefore infinitely less
dangerous and detrimental to human welfare, than is the institution of
property in abstract things. For it is easy to see that, even should we
accept the rather startling hypothesis that a single ear of corn is
continually and permanently consumable, or rather inconsumable, by an
indefinite number of persons scattered over the surface of the earth, still
the legal institution of property in concrete things that would secure to
the sower of a grain of corn the exclusive use of the resultant ear would
not, in so doing, deprive other persons of the right to sow other grains of
corn and become exclusive users of their respective harvests; whereas the
legal institution of property in abstract things not only secures to the
inventor, say, of the steam engine the exclusive use of the engines which he
actually makes, but at the same time deprives all other persons of the right
to make for themselves other engines envolving any of the same ideas.
Perpetual property in ideas, then, which is the logical outcome of any
theory of property in abstract things, would, had it been in force in the
lifetime of James Watt, have made his direct heirs the owners of at least
nine-tenths of the now existing wealth of the world; and had it been in
force in the lifetime of the inventor of the Roman alphabet, nearly all the
highly civilized peoples of the earth would be today the virtual slaves of
that inventor's heirs, which is but another way of saying that, instead of
becoming highly civilized, they would have remained in the state of
semi-barbarism. It seems to me that these two statements, which in my view
are incontrovertible, are in themselves sufficient to condemn property in
ideas forever.

I notice from the responses to my earlier posting on this thread that 
there may be some concern over my own optimistic/pessimistic state.  
I won't deny that I'm carrying some wounds from my grad school 
experience, but at least I have a very clear understanding now of the 
schism that has developed between my path and the path of those I 
used to work with.  In some ways I was naive about how the consequences 
of transhumanist ideas would affect those with a stake in 
multiculturalism.  

I appreciate the sentiment that one should not let those hostile to 
one's ideas stand in the way, but in some master's programs the 
degree committee determines your eligibility for credit, and I ran 
out of time (and money) to find a new degree committee member.  I now 
believe that degree committees exist not solely to establish academic 
rigor, but to perpetuate existing paradigms!

Sin,

What arguements do you have to support the view that genius is not genetic?
My immediate reaction would be to agree but/and I'm interested in hearing

Two quick points:

Recently I've started using a program called Cornix.  It totes itself as
Machine Assisted Reading Software.  Basically, the idea is to display
each word in large print, one at a time.  This allows the reader to read
much faster than she/he could normally, as it eliminates the need to
move your eyes to find the next word, simultaneously training your eyes
and your mind to read faster.  After only a few days I was reading 1000
wpm, and I'm considering buying Vortex, the commercial version.  (Cornix
is free, but Vortex is $80.  Ouch.)

Anyway, with this software, I can regularly get through the whole list,
without skipping any articles, in half an hour or less.  I'd reccomend
it for anybody who reads a lot on their computer.  Plus, it's free.
Take a look at:  http://www.halcyon.com/chigh/cornix.html

(I know, I sound like an ad.  I'm not affiliated, I just really like the
software.)

In regards to spreading the memes, I've been dreaming about possible
ways for us to improve our tactics.  Political groups and television
advertisers figured out long ago that by using sample test groups and
trying out various advertising techniques, they could figure out exactly
which message worked best, and which didn't.  This information allows
democrats and corporations alike to deliver an optimally effective
message to the nation.

We need to do this if we want to spread powerful extropian memes to the
public.  We can't just work from experience and secondhand guesses. 
We've got to try out our slogans, fine-tune our images, become
hypersensitive to the public's technological desires and fears.  As that
happens, we can use our information to spread our memes further, recruit
more people, spread memes further, recruit more people...  It's a
positive feedback cycle which we need to tap if we expect to be a
significant memetic force.

I realize that all this takes funding which is in obviously short
supply...  But if we start out with volunteers, we could eventually
receive a regular stream of donations to support the project.  Who'd be
willing to volunteer time to help fine-tune the extropian memes?

_________________________________________________________________

I Agree with Hawking whole heatedly.  If anyone wants to know about the
after affects
of human cloning,  you should be asking the millions of natural clones, 
not other outsider 
speculators who know nothing about the subject  but their own stupid
silly  ignorances.

Speaking from actual experience,  myself being a natural clone,  (being
an identical  twin)
I have experienced no bad or ugly side affects, physically,  emotionally,
 or socially  from
being born such. 

All laws and rules apply normally as they would any other person. If I
have been endowed by
my creator (by a man or otherwise) with a humanly functioning  brain,
then  I am not the
property of anyone but myself,  and neither is my human clone.  Once a
human  life has it's
own capable  identity  and human abilities,  it automatically becomes
sovereign unto itself.
If you are of the ones who don't think so,  just ask the human clone who
it belongs to.

Governments and Society in general  have already  bestowed all rights of
any normal person
to both of us human clones since birth, and we  have suffered nothing we
are  aware of. 
All of the hoopla our society makes,  especially the religious sectors is
rather childish and stupid,
and far beyond silly.  There has been no God or gods who have condemned
me or my clone for
being two or more of the same,  and I have always felt fine about it. 
Actually,  I have felt privileged
to have had such a wonderful  relationship with my clone.

I personally challenge any (all) government leaders or religious leaders
of any religion,
or ethics dreamers (professional or not) to talk to me about human
cloning from the standpoint
of personal experience.   What it's all about, "being a human clone", 
and what the true actual
consequences are,  and not the dreamed-up (in-their-head) consequences of
little or  no
account.

 I've had nothing but a wonderful experience  being a best friend of
someone else who has much in common with me,  and who looks just exactly 
like me
so much so that most people have a hard time telling us apart for 40
years.

Yes it's true that many can't understand our connection or relationship
bonds,  but
if you think about it,  it's nobodies business to understand it except
the two or more people
in the relationship who have the bonds.  Such relationships are just as
real and valid as any
other friendship connection between two or more people who aren't  human
clones.

Whether my parents had made me by test tube cloning,  or by natural
cloning, it really
makes no difference. The science is similar,  except one can have more
purpose.  
It's the same thing in the end.

Yes, I have wondered often what would happen if one cloned Da Vinci, or some
other genius. Imagine his mind in todays technology?( Boggle) 
Can we safely say that genius is not caused by mechanistic factors at all?
When someone says this or that characteristic is "not genetic"- it previously
meant: not passed down through heredity. Re cloning - this statement seems to
be made  in a different light. 
It raises, for me, the troubling and unsatisfactory definition of cognition
as "programs" running on a "wetware"- which I do not subscribe to. If our
brains are cloned, will they "think" in similar ways, will they hold same
attributes and "talents"?
If I am predisposed towards being good at say, math - or the arts, will my
clone also find these things easy? ( of course environment will affect these
things to a degree, but how can we know to- *what* -degree?)
 Once upon a time I remember some feeble attempts on the list towards
redirecting a gender polarized debate on genius back to *definitions of
genius*.
If genius, or at least extremely high intelligence, is not genetic, what
combinations of factors will most nurture it? And can it be part of our
physical brain, or is it purely "programmed" in after birth?
With one of the main Extropian goals being improved intelligence, it is a
thread i would welcome.

First, I have noted that most geniuses are not usually born with genius
parents or relatives, it often appears quite suddenly in a family (look at
Gauss for an example). Note that intelligence on the other hand often runs
in families; research has shown that there are genetic correlations
between the intelligence of siblings, even when raised apart, and an
intelligent family of course provides a more stimulating environment to
grow up in.  But genius seems to pop up on its own (of course, I suspect
that there is no firm division between genius and high intelligence;
genius is mostly an acknowledgment of excellent achievements). 

Second, according to what I have read and heard, geniuses doesn't seem to 
develop without plenty of motivation. This motivation can be both 
internal and external, but genius doesn't seem to develop if there isn't 
a receptive medium for it. Without training/experimentation they don't 
become geniuses.

In Ch.3 of _Life Itself_ Robert Rosen descends to the "epistemological
basement", examining the basic dualisms of self (or observer) and other
(what he calls "ambience"), which is then partitioned into system &
environment, and asserts that, even this, is a "fateful step [where]
fundamental trouble begins to creep in."=20

3B, "The First Basic Dualism": "Science is built on dualities. Indeed,
every mode of discrimination creates one. But the most fundamental
dualism, which all others presuppose, is of course the one a
discriminator makes between self and everything else.... At any rate, =
we
know our self with ultimate certainty, even though this knowledge is
subjective ... What else is there? Whatever it is, I shall call it the
/ambience/.... this is the external world, the world of objective
reality, the world of phenomena.... Science, in fact, requires both; it
requires an external, objective world of phenomena, and an internal,
subjective world of the self, which perceives, organizes, acts and
understands."

3C, "The Second Basic Dualism": "Our second basic dualism concerns the
way we partition our ambiences, the way we manage our perceptions of =
the
external world.... It rests on a consensus /imputed/ to the ambience =
...
It is the dualism between systems and their environments.... The
partition of ambience into system and environment ... is a basic though
fateful step for science.... Systems and environments are thenceforth
perceived in entirely different ways ... system gets described by =
states
... environment is characterized rather by its effects on system.
Indeed, it is precisely at this point that, as we shall see, =
fundamental
trouble begins to creep in; already here."

3D, "Language": "An essential part of the inner world of any self is
one's language.... Language itself creates, or embodies, new dualism =
...
The first basic dualism inherent in language is that (1) it is a thing
in itself and (2) permits, even requires, referents external to itself.
These embody respectively what we call the syntactic aspects of =
language
and its semantic aspects... Syntax involves its own inherent dualism =
...
between proposition and production rules.... The syntactical production
rules of a language are its internal vehicles for what I shall call
inferential entailment.... We shall understand by a formalism any such
'sublanguage' of a natural language, defined by syntactic qualities
alone. That is, a formalism is a finite list of production rules,
together with a generating family of propositions on which they can =
act,
without any specification or consideration of extralinguistic
referents.... As we shall see, the extraction of a formalism from a
natural language has many of the properties of extracting a system from
the ambience.... The idea of formalization, that the semantic aspects =
of
language can always be effectively replaced by purely syntactic ones,
will turn out to be another place where really serious trouble creeps
in."

Rosen concludes this section "by pointing out two aspects of natural
language that will play key roles in what follows but that never end up
as part of formalisms. These are (1) the use of the interrogative ...
and (2) the use of the imperative.... imperatives constitute recipes,
protocols, blueprints, and the like, which govern /fabrication/. But, =
as
will become apparent, the entailment process /embodied/ by algorithms =
or
recipes is very different than that governing their /application/. The
difference, indeed, is precisely the difference between fabrication and
physiology."

3E, "On Entailment in Formal Systems". Rosen proposes: "suppose that we
step outside our formalism and contemplate one of its theorems P....
>From that perspective, we can interrogate ... we can ask: why is P true
in the system?" Rosen proposes three operations we can perform on such =
a
system: "We can change an axiom, without touching the inferential rules
... We can change an inferential rule, without changing either the
axioms or the list of which that constitutes our algorithm. Finally, we
may change the algorithm, without affecting either the axioms or the
rules themselves.... the kinds of changes we have contemplated all come
from outside the formalism ... from the standpoint of the formalism,
anything that happens outside is accordingly unentailed.... This is our
first glimpse of a peculiar thing ... namely, that though formal =
systems
allow us to talk about entailment in a coherent way, from their
standpoint everything important that affects them is itself =
unentailed."


Rosen says that this discussion should remind us of Aristotle: "we have
paralleled three of his four categories of causation; specifically, if
we call theorem P an /effect/, we may identify his idea of material
cause of P with the axioms of a formalism, his idea of efficient cause
of P with its production rules, and his idea of formal cause of P with
the specification of a particular sequence or algorithm of production
rules.... The reader may not be surprised to note that we do not see a
formal analog of Aristotle's fourth causal category, which he held to =
be
the most significant; namely, the category of final cause.... In any
formalism, there is a kind of natural flow from axioms to theorems, =
very
much like the familiar unidirectional flow of time.... The three
'traditional' causal categories (formal, material, and efficient
causation) always respect this flow of 'formal time' ... Final =
causation
gives the /appearance/, at any rate, of violating this flow."

3F. "On the Comparison of Formalisms." Rosen argues that "mathematics,
in the broadest sense, is the study of formalisms and that formalisms,
in their turn, are parts of natural language." Rosen asks: "When does
one formalism subsume another, so that the second can be in some sense
generated from the first, or embedded in it? And above all, is the
machinery for dealing with such questions, i.e., with the comparison of
formalisms, itself a formalism?"

Rosen goes on to discuss coordinate systems, transformations and
modeling relations. Rosen notes: "In order to compare [two formalisms],
we need to ... express what each formalism says to itself in the
language of the other." We need a pair of dictionaries: an encoding
dictionary and a decoding dictionary. If these can establish a modeling
relation between the inferential structures of the two formalisms such
that one is a model of the other and one is a realization of the other.

Rosen's primary point here is that the encodings and decodings are
unentailed within the formalisms themselves: "The comparison of two
inferential structures ... thus inherently involves something outside
the formalisms, in effect, a /creative act/, resulting in a new kind of
formal object, namely the modeling relation itself. It involves /art/".

3G. "Entailment in the Ambience: Causality". "The fundamental question
for us, at this point, is the following: is there, in this external
world, any kind of /entailment/, analogous to the inferential =
entailment
we have seen between propositions in a language or formalism? =
Obviously,
if there is not, we can all go home; science is not only impossible but
also inconceivable."

3H. "The Modeling Relation and Natural Law". Using models, Rosen says,
"We can compare inferential entailment in a formal system with causal
entailments, relating a bundle of phenomena that we extract from our
ambience and identify as a natural system.... the causal entailments
manifested by a natural system provide the orderliness required of the
ambience. Inferential entailment in a formal system is a way of
providing the orderliness required of the self. The act of bringing the
two into correspondence ... is the articulation of the former within =
the
latter; it is in effect science itself.... It is not generally
appreciated, especially by experimentalists ... that any measurement,
however comprehensive, is an act of abstraction ... From this
standpoint, it is ironic indeed that a mere observer regards oneself as
being in direct contact with reality and that it is 'theoretical
science' alone that deals with abstractions."

3I. "Metaphor". Rosen continues: "This modeling relation between two
natural systems N1, N2 is of the most profound importance; I shall call
it analogy.... This is another way of seeing, what I alluded to =
earlier,
that reduction to a common set of material constituents is not the only
way, nor even a very good way, of comparing natural systems.... As we
have seen, the modeling relation is intimately tied up with the notion
of prediction.... insofar as the entailment structure itself is =
captured
in a congruent model, we can actually, in a sense, pull the future of
our natural system into the present.... A large part of the cost =
imposed
by Natural Law, in return for the benefit of prediction, lies in =
finding
the right encodings. But to what extent do we really need these
encodings? Perhaps we can presume a little on Natural Law and get away
without them.... This is the essence of /metaphor/: decoding without
encoding ... Perhaps the most important for our purposes in the machine
metaphor of Descartes ... It asserts that things about machines can be
decoded into predictions about organisms ... Another one of enormous
current importance ... is what may be called the open system
metaphor.... [However] to proceed metaphorically in the above sense [we
must remember that] by giving up encoding, we also give up
/verifiability/ in any precise sense.... Hence the general =
indifference,
if not active hostility, manifested by empiricists to theory couched in
metaphorical terms."

INTRO (02/08/97). Way back around 26 Sep 96, in a post re 'Markov Chains
can Remember and Plan too', I naively questioned the ability of
state-transition models to describe the complex biological world in any
complete way. Despite the learned rebuffs, I still had this intuitive
feeling that the classical mechanical models, including Turing machines,
were inadequate for describing biological organisms, in particular human
minds. I resolved to find some way of more formally stating what I
sensed. Reading and (most importantly) summarizing Robert Rosen's 1991
book _Life Itself_ from the Columbia University Complexity in Ecological
Systems series has helped me formalize some of the system theoretical
concepts I was looking for. Progress has been slow, however...

01/10/97. SOCIETIES OF TURING MACHINES. Anders Sandberg responded to my
query about societies of Turing machines by saying that, in principle,
these are equivalent to "one big TM", but in practice "it is probably
possible to prove that in general it is impossible to predict the
resulting behavior of a society of agents from the agent programs
themselves."

Lee Daniel Crocker also replied suggesting that what I was talking about
could still be *simulated* by _a_ TM simulating a society of TMs. But,
I'm not sure whether such a simulation could be conducted by a single
entity or closed system. Perhaps a real-time, dynamic society of
independent agents that come and go of their own 'free will' and,
therefore, probably cannot be represented by any single model, is
necessary. It was my suspicion that an asynchronous network or ensemble
of independently constructed agents operates differently from and cannot
be described by any pre-defined (logically-planned) Turing machine.
(This cuts to the heart of a major debate among Transhumanists as to
whether evolution is "stupid" or, perhaps, more creative somehow than
any logic-based approach.)

Recently (03/14/97), Eugene Leitl posted (>H List) about the First
International Conference on UNCONVENTIONAL MODELS OF COMPUTATION CDMTCS
to be held in Auckland, New Zealand, in 9801, with a host of invited
speakers from the top ranks of computer science and complexity theory,
the goal of which is to explore "all areas of unconventional
computation, especially in quantum computing, computing using organic
molecules (DNA), and various proposals for computation that go beyond
the Turing model."

The following notes may provide some useful background for this
unconventional approach by exploring mathematical biophysics and
relational biology as described by Robert Rosen.

01/11/97. Finally obtained and started to read Robert Rosen's _Life
Itself_: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and
Fabrication of Life_, finding that the issues he deals with are at the
core of recent Extropians discussions. The essence of Rosen's radical
argument is this: "What if physics is the particular, and biology the
general, instead of the other way around? If this is so, then nothing in
contemporary science will remain the same."

(03/22/97 summary of praeludium & ch.1) Rosen sketches the extremes: In
the strong reductionist corner he cites Ernest Rutherford's "qualitative
is /nothing but/ poor quantitative"; and, on the 'fuzzy' side, he cites
Robert Hutchins', "a social scientist is a person who counts telephone
poles". Rosen says that Hutchins' "soft science" view concludes that
"reductionism is wrong in principle" and declares: "Hutchins is
inverting Rutherford's dictum; he is asserting that quantitative is poor
qualitative." Rosen plans to plot a course between these two stormy
shoals, relying on mathematics and relational biophysics for his
navigation.

Rosen finishes his 'praeludium" by citing 2 central issues he plans to
deal with: syntax vs. semantics, and Godel's theorem's and Turing
machine's relevance to complex systems. Rosen notes that Rutherford's
position "can be rephrased as asserting that /every material system is a
simple system/", and adds that "this position is just another form of
Church's Thesis". Rosen concludes here by noting: "it seems to me that
the duality between 'hard' or quantitative science and 'soft' or
qualitative science rests entirely on a false presumption". It is the
nature of this "false presumption" that he plans to explore through
_Life Itself_.

Ch.1 is called "Prolegomena" and starts off by referring to Rosen's two
previous works for which this is the culmination: _Fundamentals of
Measurement and the Representation of Natural Systems_ (no date given)
and _Anticipatory Systems_ (1985). 

Rosen begins by asking (1A) "What is Life?". Rosen declares: "Life is
material, but the laws framed to describe the properties of matter give
no purchase on life. Something is missing here, perhaps something
essential for the understanding of matter in general." Rosen's goal is
to construct "a language appropriate for a physics of 'organized
matter', a physics of complex systems." 

In ch.1B, "Why the Problem is Hard", Rosen addresses causality and the
curious situation where, in the past, "biology has generally had to
parasitize other sciences in order to develop its own experimental
techniques". He laments that "biology, has as yet no objectively
definable bounds." Ch.1C specifically worries about "The Machine
Metaphor in Biology", beginning with Descartes conclusion that "life
itself was automaton-like", which has today been elaborated into the
notion of molecular machines. But, when we're dealing with life and
other complex systems, Rosen concludes that "we cannot expect
[reductionism] to solve both the physiological and the fabrication
problem simultaneously". He conludes ch.1 by saying: "I hope to convince
the reader ... that the machine metaphor is not just a little bit wrong;
it is entirely wrong and must be discarded."

01/12/97. In ch.2 of _Life Itself_ Rosen dives right into "Strategic
Considerations: The Special and the General" where he declares that
"once we have imposed an additional structure on a set, be it of an
algebraic, topological, or any other character, the mappings we use to
compare one such structure with another must, of course, respect that
structure.... The set of continuous mappings from one topological space
to another is thus generally much smaller than the totallity of
unrestricted mappings between their underlying sets. It is on this level
that the restrictive nature of the additional structure manifests
itself." 

(03/12/97 annotation after reading on Extropians about "Countertime
Beings": I would venture to say that it is this sort of situation that
Rosen has just described, rather than some cosmic "time-reversal
symmmetry", that might really underlie the transactional interpretation
of quantum physics.)

In 2B, "From General to Special", Rosen describes the discovery of
infinite arithmetic, the 'foundation crises' of mathematics and the
question of "how to restrict ourselves to those infinite sums and
products that 'make sense' and avoid those that do not. The resolution
of this crisis was given by Cauchy, who in 1805 introduced the necessary
concept, /convergence/", which, says Rosen, is associated with the
concept of /continuity/.

In 2C, "From Special to General", Rosen relates the discovery of
non-Euclidean geometry, and the roughly simultaneous 'insecurities' in
theoretical physics, particularly electrodynamics, that eventually
resulted in Einstein's /Special Relativity/ constituting "a
generalization of Newtonian mechanics", along with Heisenberg
Uncertainty which led to today's quantum mechanics. Rosen concludes this
section by noting: "Ordinary ('proper') functions turn out to be a very
special case, and the more general objects (originally called
/distributions/) are identifiable with limits of sequences of these
'proper' functions, just as real numbers are limits of sequences of
rationals. Thus, from this point of view, distributions /generalize/
ordinary functions; the generalization embeds ordinary functions in a
new and larger universe, in which they are nongeneric indeed... The
elements of this larger world may have new and different properties from
those with which we started; properties generic in the large world but
vacuous in the small one that gave rise to them."

01/12/97. In 2D, on "Induction and Deduction", Rosen describes how
"induction, roughly, seeks to establish general (i.e., quantified)
propositions on the basis of instances; deduction, conversely seeks to
establish instances in terms of quantified or general propositions."
Rosen describes predicates, or properties, and assertions about sets as
strings of conjunctive properties. Induction is traditionally considered
more difficult and, Rosen adds, "without additional structure, the
problem of induction cannot be solved in general; that much was
originally pointed out by Aristotle ... and elevated by Hume into a
complete rejection of empiricism [by which is meant] the establishment
of general truth by judicious sampling." "The further structure
necessary", says Rosen, is that "if P, as a property, itself manifests
what we may call contagion, so that the truth of P(Xi) itself implies
the truth of P(Xj) ... then the problem of induction can be dealt
with.... Mathematical induction is, in fact, all we need to generate the
whole of Number Theory from the existence of the number '1', and the
ability to 'add 1' to any integer... This idea ... permeates both
science and mathematics in profound and insufficiently appreciated
ways."

Ch.2E, "On the Generality of Physics", Rosen proposes that Godel's
undecidability proofs are 'contagious' beyond Number Theory because to
assess the generality of any formalism is to raise a metatheoretic
"question about the theory, not a question within the theory." This is
why, Rosen declares, "reductionism, rests on faith." Rosen concludes:
"with respect to biological phenomena, contemporary physics is in
exactly the same situation that 19th-century physics faced in the atomic
and cosmological realms: it either stands mute or it gives the wrong
answers.... Once again, as in all similar situations in the past, the
claim is that purely technical matters are involved and that the problem
is simply one of specializing what already exists in an appropriate way.
But history shows it to be at least equally likely that the problems are
not technical but conceptual, that contemporary physics remains too
special to accommodate the class of material systems we call organisms."

There probably are such persons, but Max coined the term specifically
to refer to those who /do/ see the connection.  Self-organization,
optimism, and limitless expansion can be applied to many specific
fields of endeavor: technology, art, epistemology, politics, and
anywhere else they might fit.  If someone happens to like one of the
/results/ of Extropian thought, say, transhumanism, but likes it for
other reasons, then he may be a transhumanist, but not necessarily
an Extropian.

To separate some consequences of Extropian ideas from others purely
for political reasons renders the word, and the ideas, meaningless.
If you have a philosophy that implies /some/ of what Extropianism
does, then support that, and support those who might share some of
your goals for other reasons, but call it something else.

______________  Please post this everywhere an identical  twin clone can
read! ________________

A message to all those racist people, including governments and religions
 who haven't
 learned how  to help themselves yet!

Since I am a bonified  human clone amongst millions of others, (an
identical twin)  I am
 finding all this debate about  human cloning a bit offensive  to myself
and others  I know
 and love.  Kind of smacks me  in the face as though I am being 
discriminated against
 in a way Kind of like the black  people of the world and our country 
were and still are being
treated.  

***** In case you haven't learned it yet guys,  discrimination and racism
of any race 
or group of people is wrong,  unlawful and extremely  immoral! *****

 This kind of  childish behavior hurts people and sometimes gets people
killed as a byproduct of
 the hatreds it breads amongst gullible ignorant people! ( To President
Clinton,
 I sure hope you aren't one of these racist persons!  You don't need
ethologist or self appointed religious
 leaders to tell you how to read your own mindful-heart,  and if you do, 
we are all in for more trouble than I thought.)

Human clones exist today in me,  my twin clone, and  in the hundreds of
millions of others! 
 We are not a small group!  And we are not deserving to be a subject of
racism or discriminatory 
 talk any more than any other race,  religion,  or people are.  

PUBLIC NOTICE:
I am hereby putting these the  United States Nation on notice,  that such
continued inflammatory 
 talks is paramount to slander and racism on a grand scale,  and I
formally demand that this stupid
inflammatory  debate be  stopped! Also I request  a letter from the
president of this nation,  to this
nation to be entered into  the public record, and :televised live" since
the stupid debate has
been publicized the same,  recognizing our human rights as any other
person of this nation or world have.

We are alive,  and human,  and are a formal part of every race, religion
and culture on earth today,
and always have been.  I think it's time all twin clones of this world
stand up and claim our right 
(in a way that people can't ignore) to exist,  procreate, and have
normally acceptable lives as any
other individual.

This issue of whether human clones have rights to exist and do any/all
things as any other
individual must stop.  To not stop it is paramount admitting as a
society,  that this society 
has not recognized our human  rights of existence  from the beginning of
this nation as being equal
as any other white, black, hispanic, or any other race in this nation or 
world. 

 You know,  I Kind of thought this nation was getting a handle on how to
stop being racist pigs,
 but maybe I was wrong!  I guess that time will tell!

I think it's time that all human clone twins pull together to fight this
issue.  We may,  just like the blacks
hispanics, and other races,  need to fight it out in the courts regarding
our rights of existence and procreation.

 If other non-clone people can have normal non-clone babies in a way the
see fit,  so can we have normal
(to us) clone babies no matter how many clones we choose to make in the
same ways they do.
 We have a right to create offspring,  that of our own clone  selves. 
This is our Nature!   We have lots of
 common-law jurisprudence to back us up in  any court of the land.

All identical twins,  like it or not,  are "The People or (race) Of
Clone"!    To be a Clone, is to be Human!

If other people can have test-tube babies,  we should have these rights
also.  And if our offspring is just like 
us,  born a human clone just like we were born (a clone),  well,  that's
our natural right.  We have always had 
that right,  and no one can take that right away from us without an
enormous  fight.  Even if we loose a fight 
in the courts,  no person (or judge) or country  can take the right from
us.  The right is inate!  Inalliable unto
our very own  beings,  just as our right to life,  happiness religious
freedom and liberty is!

*******  Any other human clone twins out there and their parents,  who
would like to come together with me to form
a potential class action civil and criminal prosecutions of  "all
opposition" to our rights of existence as a people,
and free abilities to reproduce other clones naturally or otherwise, 
being recognized the same  as normal people,  please
send me your name,  address phone number,  and email#,  and let me know
how much funds you will pledge
to this fighting cause  if needed. ********

Just to let you know, If we have to go to court to fight for these
rights,  there will be a heafty cost,  and I will expect all
people enjoining the court action cause to participate in the funding.

The blacks had to do it,
The homosexuals had to do it,
Peoples of many religions had to do it,

I guess it looks as though we will probably have to do it too.  (Fight
for our rights in court!)

Does it really?  It strikes me as abundant good sense.  The alternative
strikes me as narrow-minded, self-defeating sectarianism.

If we lived in a world where the only people promoting advanced
technological goals happened to be right-to-life fundamentalist Christians
(not as absurd as it might sound, given the standard historical arguments
linking transcendental goals, scientific practice, restraint now in the
service of attainment later, monotheism, etc), many people would proclaim
the `cowardice' of uncoupling those two components.  

One (former?) member of this list recently proposed at some length that
rational people were obliged to question the testimony of Nazi Holocaust
victims.  I was appalled, as were several other list contributors who
expressed their dismay.  But I can imagine a situation in which that
disgraceful opinion might just happen to have been shared by most
list-members, and linked to other high technology enthusiasms (as they were
in the case of that person).  If such had  been the case I suppose I would
never have joined the list, but then I'd have lost access to all the useful
information that surges through the postings.  Happily, most extropians
seemed to have been offended by that incident.  Still, it is in principle
imaginable that the consensus might have pilloried any objections as
`cowardice'.

I've just completed a book on the Singularity that comes from an implied
political stance consistent with favourable attitudes to high tech among
intellectuals in the country where I live, Australia, and the peer group
that formed my attitudes, roughly speaking science fiction fandom
(specifically of the Aussie/Brit variety) and a kind of left anarchism
(perhaps meliorative heterotopic consentive tribalism is more accurate, but
a nasty mouthful).  I am not going to abandon my background assumptions
just because people bully me with accusations of `cowardice', just as I'm
going to hold firm to my favourable opinion of the prospects of Faustian
technology despite the disdain of my largely poststructuralist colleagues.  

These opinions might get me run out the Extopian list on a rail, which I
think would be a pity, because I have learned a great deal during my stay
here.  But I'm damned if I'm going to salute the sectional doctrines of
those transhumanists who contingently happened to emerge in the nation with
the best access to the Internet.  (Out of courtesy, however, I will
probably continue to avoid intruding my own political opinions into a forum
that is, after all, founded explicitly in a libertarian mode.)

It's not cowardice, but it is short-sightedness, something Extropians
should certainly work against.

Support of high-tech transhumanist goals is good, but what good will it
be if we get jailed for acting on those goals when they arrive because
we failed to keep our politics in line with our goals?  Where will we be
if we are prevented from discovering the new technologies we need by
failing to use effective epistemology?

This is the same argument libertarians hear constantly: Why don't
you work to reduce government without being so vocal about drug
legalization?  Why don't you concentrate on civil rights instead
of being so negative about taxes? 

Well, the questions could easily be reversed: Why doesn't the LP
concentrate on the evils of drug prohibition and less on the anti-
government rhetoric?  Why don't they work to lower taxes, and spend
less time on unpopular ideas like legalizing prostitution?  Or in
the present case, why don't Extropians spend more time concentrating
on real-world, immediate goals like libertarian politics and
evolutionary epistemology rather than sci-fi fantasies?

The LP supports policies because they are consistent with a single
vision.  It is that vision we believe in, and we would lose sight of
it if we chopped it up into pieces.  Extropianism is a vision, and
that vision has consequences in /all/ fields of human endeavor.  It
is not mere stubbornness to be consistent in that vision, because we
are open to changing as our vision clarifies and the environment we
hold it in changes.  But it would be narrow minded, perhaps even
evasive, to shy away from parts of the vision just because they aren't
popular yet.

I tend to think that genius is largely genetic, too many great geniuses have

now we can know for sure. Clone Hawking, give the clone a good but not

if when the clone is 17 or 18  he knows more Physics than you do, then the

I have no doubt that despite howls of protest, humans will be cloned in just

As I recall (dimly), monozygotic twins occur in about every 80 births. Or
maybe that's both sorts of twins.  In any event, surely the natural
experiment has happened many times by now, even if geniuses are one in a
million.  We know that identical twins reared in proximity tend, for
psychic self-protection, to differentiate themselves in behaviour, dress,
professional interests, etc, to a greater extent than those who are
separated, but if genius is largely genomic-cum-uterine you'd expect it to
show up in whatever field the twins entered.  

The only case that comes to my mind is Prof. Gregory Benford, who is
certainly an extraordinarily talented man in both physics and literature.
His identical twin (Jim?) may be a fine fellow, but I've never read any of
his novels or heard of his scientific contributions.  Any other names come
to mind?

Tja, so leicht kann man sich Feinde machen! Geht's Dir auch so?

Das dumme an diesen Ideen ist, dass Ihr damit den Mensch in seinem

Ausserdem ist man selbst als mehr liberal Eingestellter von den Ideen

Yes, cloning will certainly help us here (especially since surrogate parents 
are likely to jump at the chance of having a genius child).

But I disagree with your first sentence. If you look at the lives of 
various geniuses, many of them were born in fairly ordinary 
circumstances. But then they started to differentiate themselves and made 
their own circumstances fit them. This process seems to be linked with 
the ability to concentrate and motivate oneself rather than the specifics 
of the environment. However, the right sources of knowledge and education 
has to be present for full growth of the genius (cf. Ramanujan). There 
might be some genetic component that gives potential geniuses their 
powers of concentration/near obsession, but to become a real genius you 
need more than that.

I have this feeling that there are likely millions of potential geniuses
out there who never did develop their full potential due to lack of
support.

In response to Katryn Aegis' response to the one word at a time reading
technique.
I appreciate your thoughts, for I've studied some speed reading myself.  But
let's not forget to try to appreciate new ways of looking at things.  I
personally think it wouldn't hurt for us to give the idea a try, just to see
how it strikes us, and who knows, maybe we'll even like it.  It certainly
couldn't hurt.

In response to John K. Clark's comment on cloning Stephen Hawking, giving the
clone an average type education, and seeing how the clone would possibly
still be great at physics, to answer the genetic question of genius, I'd like
to extend the thought.  Imaging making ten clones on Hawking, sort of a grand
test, and raising each one with different educations, environments, etc.
 Let's see how each turns out.  If all goes well, we may even make a few
technological advances along the way, having ten more Hawkings around.

 Cryonics is important and should be explored, 
but it should not distract from our true goals.
We want metamorphosis not stasis.
I confidently say few of us want to specificly become a frozen mom/popsicle 
for the rest of eternity.
We would be intact, alas slightly dead is still too dead.
We want to evolve into a dynamic state more able to acheive our dreams.

 Cryonics only allows more time to wait for technology to develop 
that will suit our needs for repair/augmentation 
and will eventually not be needed.
Given time it will evolve 
into a portable and immediate sort of suspension 
which will be used to halt damage( ie. paramedics transporting patients ).
A useful device for all but the metamorphosist 
who would not allow it's self to become damaged 
and that is what we intend to become.

 In closing I wish to remind all that the future is where success will be.
When you walk keep your eyes looking forward.

> -How best we can spread our beliefs?

Let every one know they are already allies.
promote the most fundamental beliefs that all share 
in new and universally beneficial ways.
Use simple well liked words 
that imply what you are saying yet have no fixed meanings 
and link them to words you want people to think about.

<Gentic engineering>
Why shave your legs 
when you can shave your genes?

<Space colonization>
In search of the heart and soul of love and life,
to make the world a better place,
to give to all friendship and peace,
I'll take my quest to outer space.

Do you think I could be a commercial pitch man?

In a message dated 97-03-24 00:02:26 EST, you write:

<< 
 I tend to think that genius is largely genetic, too many great geniuses have

 had pedestrian upbringing, but one of the great things about cloning is that

 now we can know for sure. Clone Hawking, give the clone a good but not 
 extraordinary education, nothing better than that millions of people
receive,  
 if when the clone is 17 or 18  he knows more Physics than you do, then the 
 age old question will be decisively answered.
  >>

Yes, Hawkins would be an interesting choice, after seeing his film ( which
was dissapointing to me because the director chose to make it largely
bigraphical istead of focusing on the theories) it is apparent that he comes
from an eccentric, upper crust, English,  nerdy intellectual and elitist
family. Raise him in the Ozarks on a pig farm and he might not be the same
man at all. But i given a very stable home, good education and nourishment,
the experiment might be qualified. Even if physics was not his study choice,
perhaps he would be extraordinary at something, say an inventor, or an
artist, or an engineer. Would the question be still 'decidely' answered?

  The time of the first human clone sounds like a good bet
for the Foresight Exchange.  Maybe, even a way to attract attention
to it, with cloning being such hot subject.

  A problem raising clones of geniuses/criminals/yourself:
You can't call a baby clone of a genius or yourself that you are
raising, an idiot - here you *know* a better job could be done, so
whatever is wrong with the child is your fault.

  If you brought up a clone of somebody with known predisposition
to crime: can you put this person to jail for committing the crime?
Kind of like God's idea - knowingly create sinful folks, and then
punish them.  Not very nice.  If this happened at random, and you
did the best you could, then you at least may not feel guilty.
With more knowledge there comes greater responsibility, more
assumptions to question, and more issues to handle.   This may be
the main reason why so many people look at new gifts of technology
as new Pandora boxes.

If inventors produced intellectual property at the same rate as a
production worker produced cars, we would obviously need to make this
comparison. Unfortunately, inventions are rare beasts, coming few and
far between, after much research, thought, and study. The writer has
obviously never invented a thing, or he would realize that while the
breakthrough "Eureka" may be momentary, there is a long series of hours,
days, and weeks spent preparing the mind to make such acheivements. If
we account for these, we would see that, while the inventor still may be
highly paid for his or her invention, it would still be in line with
other professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers. That inventors are
few and far between, and their inventions even rarer, if we assume a
free market based on relative scarcity, inventions are fairly
compensated for. For example: There have been approximately 5.5 million
inventions patented in the US in it entire history (mostly during
periods when patent rights are vigorously enforced, hint hint) while
laborers have worked approximately 25 x 10^13 hours in US history. This
means that in fair market value, the average invention is equal to 4.55
million man hours of physical labor in relative scarcity. If we value
the average man hour at as little as $1.00 per hour (which was typical
for the turn of the century, never mind that 2/3 of all workers have
lived since that time) we see that the fair market value for an average
invention is $4.55 million dollars. 

Any responses to this quoting communist rhetoric and I will puke.

The fallacy in this argument is that someone who simply copies another's
invention is worthy of being called "competition" rather than being
called what he is: a theif.

That the majority of profit for an invention tends to go to the
promoter, publisher, or monopolist rather than the inventor is merely
indication of the corrupting influence such disparate levels of
preexisting power do to equal human rights, and why such legal remedies
for the average person is needed. If this were not the case, over 90% of
inventions would not occur, as they are invented by people with little
personal means. They sacrifice the majority of potential profits because
the are not able to accept the attendant risk involved, and sell out to
attain greater security, but that is a different issue not germain to
this argument excpet for this point.

Here is another broken logic chain. Here the anarchist writer is quoting
a statist frenchman, advocating government solution. If we are to follow
the writers prior arguments, we would use labor law as a basis, and see
that all labor disputes are civil matters, where fines and compensation
are the norm, much like intellectual proporty disputes.

That workers earn pensions that pay after they retire from labor
indicates that even laborers earn a royalty on their work (while they
are partial contributors, their employer tends to pay the most).

As for the expiration of patent rights, I as this: parental rights
expire after 17 years, jsut as patent rights did prior to the GATT
treaty. As to my original arguments, creative capabilities, and the
recognised rights that protect them, of any kind, are irrevocably bound
up in each other. That the founders recognised this connection is
inherent in the regs stating such equal dates of expiry.

THis argument is to assume that there is only one plow in the entire
world, and one car, one ship, one computer, etc. That copies of products
can be produced and sold is indication of the fallacy of these claims.
WHat the writer is trying to do is equate ALL property under the
restrictions inherent on one form of property known as REAL ESTATE,
because real estate cannot be reproduced, it can only be divided, it
cannot be multiplied, at least on this planet. This is the central
fallacy of this entire argument, and voids it. These arguments on the
part of the writer are extremely entropian.

Of course, and this is why there are no perpetual intellectual property
laws, much as parents cannot have perpetual rule over their children.

What about altering just a few of the Hawkings clone's genes so he does
not develop the disease that has crippled his body?

The interesting question is of course if he would have become the 
world-class physicist he is today without his illness. It may have forced 
him into theoretical physics.

Anders got to what I was thinking: pleitropy of genes and that
combination of genes acting together as a system. Hawkins was a well
known scientist before he started to show any symptoms, but how would
removing the so-called bad genes effect the clone?

Here is the exact quote:

  And the Social Science, -- not a "gay science", but a rueful, --
  which find the secret of this Universe in "supply and demand," and
  redues the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone, is
  also wonderful.  Not a "gay science," I should say, like some we have
  heard of; no a dreary, desolate, and indeed quite abject and
  distressing one; what we might call, by way of eminence, the dismal
  science.   These two, Exter-Hall Philanthropy and the Dismal Science,
  led by any sacred cause of Black Emancipation, or the like, to fall in
  love and make a wedding of it, -- will give birth to progenies and
  prodigies; dark extensive moon-calves, unnameable abortions,
  wide-coiled monstrosities, such as the world has not seen hithertoo!
  (Carlyle "Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question", 1849, pp 672-3.)


Looking up Carlyle in a Reader's Companion, the entry talks about his
being anti Mob Democracy and anti Materialism, but doesn't mention his
racism.  Two pages on him in Barlett's Quotations also don't mention
his racism!

Davy Levy claimed to me in person, and I now believe him, that there
has been a great effort to distort our intellectual history in this
area.  According to Levy:

The fact is that early socialists tended to ally with and be
pro-slavery folks, and these economists were anti-slavery and
pro-birth-control.  The socialists complained that the economists
cared less about the "white slavery" of British workers than about
black slaves, and these socialists looked favorably on the slave
system as a form of socialism (people working for the "state" instead
of themselves).

Later socialists and Marxists painted themselves as pro-labor, vs. the
economists being pro-capital, and so pro-socialist historians have
ignored the the race and gender views of early socialists and
economists, where the economists come out looking lots better by
modern standards.   This white-wash has been made easier by the fact
that Marx himself came from the economic tradition, and so shared
their views on race and gender.

In the treatise I am writing on the subject, this is what I call "The
Myth of the Lone Inventor", a cultural image that tends to mystify the
work of creation and justify our subsides of it.  Existing IP monopolies
contribute to the myth, because they prevent all the minor tweaks and
improvements that would be the natural evolution of any design from
coming to market.  It is only when a particular tweak is recognizable
and distinct enough to make calling it an "invention" plausible that
we grant it the monopoly, thereby discouraging futher development.  In
a free economy of ideas, 99% of inventions would be minor tweaks on
existing things, and the research itself would be cheap, and entry to
the market would be cheap, and everyone--inventors included--would be
too busy getting rich to bother filing for patents.

The occurence of a truly new and spectacular idea from nothing is a rare
and wonderful event--Newton's gravity, Darwin's evolution, and Einstein's
general relativity are the only ones I can think of, but practical
inventions are a dime a dozen.  Each of us has several ideas a day for an
improvement to an existing product.  The reason they don't get developed
is that entry to the market is made difficult by regulation, including
patents.  That copyrights and patents are not needed to stimulate creative
invention is evidenced by the fact that the three gentlemen above didn't
need it.  Gutenberg's press was a nifty idea, building upon a foundation
of countless other inventions that came before.  He needed no patents to
become a wealthy man, and to instigate flourishing publishing businesses
from the late 1500s through the 1700s without copyrights.

Mr. Lorrey dismisses his opponent as "obviously not an inventor", which
conveniently ignores the fact that he is in fact a writer, and we are
talking about copyrights and patents.  And I /am/ an inventor.  Maybe
I haven't found a way around conservation of momentum yet, but I have
written software for 15 years, much of which would certainly be patentable
if I cared to (PNG's adaptive pre-filtering compression algorithm, for
example) and most of which is copyrihted by my employers.  But I cannot
in clear conscience name a single measurable benefit either I or my
employers gained from a copyright or patent that is not outweighed 
tenfold by the crippling effects on research, gradual development, and
wasted litigation cause by IP law.

Interesting information Robin. Marx, however, does seemed to have been
racist. He made numerous racist remarks about Jews when attacking other
socialists he felt rivalrous with including La Salle.

Subsidy, what subsidy? I've never gotten one red cent from the
government. Where oh where wise master may I find these riches????

Another falsehood. By granting the creator a monopoly on use of that
particular invention, a technological leapfrog effect is encouraged,
where other companies and individuals, in order to compete, must invent
the next greater refinement. Not having this system would stultify
technological advancement as everyone would produce the same technology,
and competition would be quashed, productivity would stagnate, and the
economy would be swamped by overpopulation operating on restricted
resources.

If research is cheap, research labor costs would be very low, meaning
researcher pay would be low. Thus you would create a disincentive to
pursue careers in research, and only the incompetent morons would enter
the field, much like primary education today.

none are inventions. They were scientific discoveries.

They are so now only because there is an IP system in place which
encourages and has encouraged their proliferation. Its interesting that
you had no comment on my analysis showing that the average "dime a
dozen" invention was worth 4.55 million man hours in terms of relative
scarcity. if that is your opinion of the value of invention, I hesistate
to ask what your opinion is of the work of the common man. (Nuff cotton
deah, boss?)

its interesting that a man who dislikes ad hominem attacks against
himself takes such glee in inciting them against others. Additionally,
that you still haven't paid enough attention or havent the intelligence
to figure out that my drive system does not violate conservation of
momentum shows that you are only interested in what you have to say and
not anyone else. I suggest you check your ego at the door.

That software cannot be patented you seem to have conveniently

Well of course that's true. Even with terrific genes a bad environment can 
kill a genius, but without the proper genes even the best environment can't 
make one.

By the way, you give me the idea for a new situation comedy for TV,

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org


I recently bought this book: 

   The Sovereign State and Its Competitors, by Hendrik Spruyt, 1994.

The abstract on the book says:

  The present international system, composed for the most part of
  sovereign, territorial states, is often viewed as the inevitable
  outcome of historical development.  Hendrick Spruyt argues that there
  was nothing inevitable about the rise of the state system.  Examining
  the competing institutions that arose during the decline of feudalism
  - among them urban leagues, independent communities, city states, and
  sovereign monarchies - Spruyt disposes of the familiar claim that the
  superior size and war-making ability of the sovereign nation-state
  made it the matural successor to the feudal system.

This book recounts this history of how the city states of Italy and the
Hanseatic League of german cities lost their compeition with
neighboring sovereign states.  This history is of course uniquely
relevant to the viability of decentralized political visions such as
anarcho-capitalism.

I can't say this is a great book, just the first I've read on the
topic.  Contrary to the encouraging abstract above, the book does
conclude that centralized states had these fundamental advantages:

1. Sovereigns were better able to encourage trade by overcoming local 
political resistance to standardizing measures, taxes, and laws.
2. Leagues of cities had trouble committing their members to courses
of action.  Defecting cities were hard to detect and to punish
regarding tolls, piracy, fraud, contributions to military campaigns, and
individual negotiations with foreign powers. 

If this is a reasonable summary of this history, it suggests that 
free-riding and coordination problems could doom decentralized
political systems.  It seems important for fans of such systems to
take a closer look at this history.

Last I checked we were still allowed to express opinions as to the 
potential usefulness of expensive new software.  Certainly my 
own view wouldn't stop anyone from trying it, but it might give them 
some info on which to ask a few questions of the salesperson.

I explained that quite clearly many times: if you sell me a product,
then I use the ideas to create a similar one and sell that, then the
government will step in and prevent me from doing so /at my expense/.
Protecting a market at public expense is no less a subsidy than just
writing checks from the public coffers or regulating prices.

If you're just going to parrot tired old justifications, show me some
evidence to back it up.  I refuse to accept your naked assertions, and
I have attempted to give some evidence that industry and publishing
flourished in the absence of what you claim is necessary.  James Watt
became a very wealthy and creative man, as he deserved, and asked no
one to grant him any monopoly on his creations.  The great works of
Shakespeare, Handel's Messiah, and the Mona Lisa were created without
benefit of copyrights.  "IP" is a recent invention, justified by the
same blind assumption you continue to make here, but not supported by
the facts.

So, making research cheap and easy is /bad/, now?  Amazing.  Do you
even believe in the free market at all?  That products will increase
in quality as the market demands?  And when information is cheap, the
value of /selection/ and /evaluation/ of information goes up, leading
to a market for people with enough brains to find and sort through all
the information.  Again, this I outlined in my earlier posts.

What's the /objectively definable/ difference between discovering the
inverse-square law of gravity and the LZW compression algorithm, or
natural order spreadsheet recalculation, or a process for making soap,
all of which are patented?

I don't remember any such analysis, but I'll look for it--but once again,
you beg the very question by defining "invention" as "issued patent",
further misvalued by the existing anti-market system.  Such an analysis
is as invalid for justifying itself as saying that drugs cause prison
costs, therefore we need more drug laws.  Can't you see that circularity?

The labor of any man--in any field--is worth precisely what he can sell
it for in a free market.  When Joe Montana makes a pass, his labor is
worth thousands of dollars, because that's what people will pay to see it.
When the cameraman gets paid to film it, his labor is worth whatever the
network is paying him.  When the network broadcasts it, they charge for
commercial time whatever advertisers will pay.  49 years from now,
when Joe has stopped making passes and the cameraman retires, the network
can still collect royalties from someone who taped the game on his home
VCR and plays it for his friends, not because they would pay voluntarily,
but because the government say so.  Where's the "labor" there?

Sorry, but I couldn't resist.  You're right, I don't know anything
about your drive, just the very limited information about it on your
site, which /seems/ to violate conservation of momentum.  Perhaps the
thing does something useful but not exactly what the page seems to say
it does, or that there is something vital not said there.  In any case,
I do apologize for the thinly-veiled ad hominem.  It was an attempt at
humor, not a serious diparagement (not that I would shirk from serious
disparagement for other reasons!)

An anonymous poster says:
>The overwhelming majority of intelligent and well-educated people to whom I
>attempt to explain transhumanism react negatively.  ...
>The fact is that we are a tiny minority among a tiny minority.  ...

I think it is very important to develop good models of why this happens.
("They laughed at Galileo too" is *not* an especially good model.)
I strongly disagree with those who have said we should ignore 
critics because they'll just distract us or depress us or whatever.
The rest of this long post is devoted to this question.

Consider these 3 reasons why someone might take an extreme view:
1.  They like to be extreme so they can shock people and feel special.
2.  They have to reason through everything for themselves from basics,
    and refuse to rely in any way on the opinions of others.  A small 
    fraction of these people will inevitably take an extreme view.
3.  They take the opinions of others seriously as an important source
    of information, and only take an extreme position when they think
    they have a particularly unique source of info on the subject, or 
    when they think an especially strong but apparently overlooked
    case can be made from publicly available information.
 
It is very easy to and reasonable to discount and ignore the extreme
views of type 1 extremists.  It is also easy to do the same for type 2
extremists if the fraction of them observed is small enough relative
to all type 2 folks.  And segmenting type 2 folks by smarts, it is
also easy to ignore larger fractions of extremists among those people
who don't seem very smart (as evidenced for example by some gross
cognitive blunder).  Type 3 extremists, however, aught to be taken
seriously.
 
So if you want your extreme views to be taken seriously by other
people, you aught to try to look like a type 3 extremist.  And if you
want to make good decisions over all, you aught to try and be a type
3 person.  This means making a good effort to find reasons why smart
thoughtful people might disagree with you.

>the fringe.  A lot of teen agers go through an `Atlas Shrugged phase': How

Here I have to agree with the critics, thought I would say "sophmoric"
rather than "juvenile".  While the policies advocated are reasonable,
the moral axiomatic types of arguments offered *are* sophmoric, i.e.
the sort of thing mostly done by college sophmores (and a few moral
philosophers).  Not that the conclusions don't follow from the axioms,
but that most people don't feel very compelled to accept the axioms.
Thinking that these axioms will persuade very many people also seems a
sophmoric cognitive blunder, and does not encourage people to take the
other extreme views of these folks seriously.

>"Transhumanism is an immature rejection of reality, a selfish and
>self-centered desire to escape from the simple and basic facts of
>life. Quit dreaming."

Here I also have to agree with the critics, at least when they refer
to people who expect remarkably rapid progress toward transhuman
technologies in the next few decades.  This stuff will take a while to
appear, and those of us interested in thinking about it anyway are
indulging ourselves to some extent.  

I have heard a related criticism that anyone who would especially want
to become transhuman is excessively selfish.  And I think such people
*are* more selfish than average, but "excessive" is harder to judge.

I think most of us do *not* propose doing it all at once everywhere.
Those who do so propose are rightly criticized.

I think the core issue here is the "fragility" and "interdependence"
of our social order.  Those of us who lean toward more decentralized
libertarian policies tend to think of social systems as robust and
relatively independent.  Thus experimenting with a variation on one
social institution in one locale does not greatly threaten everything
else, and the information to be gained outweighs the possible local
harm.  So we favor decentralization to allow variation and selection.

However, others tend to think of our social systems as fragile and
interdependent, and so think more global oversight and control is
needed to prevent contagion from local experiments from threatening
everything else.  It bothers me that I don't have good arguments
against this view.

>"Transhumanists want to create a master race, just like the Nazis.  And don't
>they think Nietzsche is some sort of intellectual godfather?  What does that
>tell you?"

Bottom line is: transhumanists *are* close to Nazis in the sense of
wanting to create better people.  They differ from Nazis in not trying
to achieve this goal by killing off "inferior" people.  But Nazis are
such a reviled prototype that simple heuristic case-based inference
(anything too much reminiscint of Nazis must be bad) *does* make many
people reject the whole enterprize.

>"Extropians are elitists.  What about the billions of people suffering on the
>edge of starvation?  Sounds like they want a bunch of high-tech toys for a

>else."

Extropians are elitist and selfish in many ways - but most of them
don't think that will hurt others.

This highlights another core issue: to what degree does social pressure
function to stabilize our social order?  Economists like me, who tend
to ignore social pressure in our models, tend to think that the effect
is minor.  But others see social pressure which keeps people acting
"nice" and punishes very "selfish" behavior as central.  And so they
fear the consequences if this pressure is relaxed.  It bothers me
that I don't have better arguments to say why they are mistaken.


Putting this all together here's my image of a reasonable person who
dislikes extropian views:

"Our social world is complex, fragile, interdependent on large scales,
and relies on social pressure to constrain selfish behavior.  Big
changes threaten to break this system, and so prudence requires
non-local oversight.  You extropians are outliers regarding your
preferences for self over community, change over continuity, and
resistance to social pressure.  Left unconstrained, you would endanger
us all by radically changing our bodies, politics, economies, personal
relations, and everything else.  So we must constrain you."

My personal response is:  

Considering how much humanity has changed over the last 50,000 years,
it is hard to think we're terribly fragile.  But yes, changes can be
dangerous.  However, some big changes are coming that humanity seems
both unwilling and unable to stop.  So we need some mature reasonable
people to be thinking about these upcoming changes in some detail.
It turns out that there are a bunch of such people talking about
these details, and many of them hang out under the banner
"extropians".  Yes, since fear tends to freeze thought, people willing
to talk details are biased toward the optimists.  And you should
expect an extreme banner like this to especially attract sloppy
thinkers, people who like to be extreme, and those who think
everything through for themselves.  But relative to these
expectations, I think you'll find a surprisingly large fraction of
very reasonable people under that banner.

I don't know how the Exchange works.  I hereby predict that within two years
there will be human clones gestating.  Within two years and nine months,
there will be cloned humans born.  

As a former molecular biologist, I take issue with all the speculation about
geniuses, serial killers, etc.  Genes are not that specific.  An intelligent
person is likely to produce an intelligent clone. An athletic person is
likely to produce an athletic clone.  A female clone will surely produce a
female.  That's about as good as you can hope for.

You can not prevent technology from happening.  Of that I am sure. For good
or evil, we will have cloning.

Damien,

My comment was directed at Squirrel, who seems to me to agree that there
is a connection between libertarianism and transhumanism, but thinks a
good strategy for spreading transhumanism is to keep quite about
libertainism.  I just thought that was a cowardly approach.  He thinks
it's subtle.  There it stands.

I had no intention of directing that comment at people like yourself who
sympathise with transhumanism but doubt that there is a connection
between transhumanism and libertarianism.  That's your opinion.  I think
you're wrong, and we could argue about it; but I don't hold your opinion
in contempt.

I would say it's quite vital for variations on the transhumanist theme
to come together in this forum and criticise each others' ideas.  That's
a libertarian commitment on my part.

Oh the emperor is declothed, and he is a theif. You say,"then I use the
ideas". That right there is your crime. Then inventor has gone through
enormous expense in terms of research and development and you have gone
and stolen the benefits of that investment without proper compensation.
In this case, sir, YOU ARE A THEIF!.

You cite works of art and inventions developed prior to over 95% of all
inventions in human history. That the present system has encouraged the
other 95% in as short a time as the last century indicates that the

The law of gravity is merely a discovery of knowledge of the existing
structure of the universe, while the others are artifical constructs
created by the human mind. That there is the difference between a

An invention which earns a patent not only is something actually new
under the sun, but also of high enough market value to be worth the
effort of pursuing the patent process. As for your circular claim, there
is no such thing in my argument.

Ah you show that you do not understand the economics of it. First off,
"fair use" has been declared legal, as is personal use, which is why you
can make as many copies as you want, so long as you gain no commercial
satisfaction from them.

Now, Joe was paid on contract for his services. The organization which
invested in his services have taken a risk, which they value in current
dollars at a discounted rate from future earnings. Joe didn't take the
risk, the company investors did, so they are who earns the downstream
royalties from the broadcast. Just as you, who did a great job
developing your compression algorithms, were under contract to Piclab,
or who ever, and were being paid a salary or fee to do the work "for
hire". your employers made the investment in you to develop the
algorithms. If you had done it all by yourself, you could enjoy the
benefits of that invention. Unfortunately, you are like many corporate
writers, inventors, etc., in that you fall into an individual version of
the trap Benjamin Franklin described: "That nation which shall sacrifice
some measure of freedom for greater security shall wind up with
neither." Because you seek a secure position, you shy away from the role
of entrepreneur, you wind up giving up your rights to benefit from your
creations.

Nice vow of poverty, Reverend. This is, IMHO, not a statement of free
market principle, but of anti-market sentiment veiled as piety.

I think the most important thing we need to realize is that everyone
need not be recruited. Widespread recruitment is not necessary, if an
extropian future is to be defined by technological change. In such a
societal trend, they all eventually "will be assimilated".

What I think we need to focus on instead is knowing what we know, we
should make our own plans to maximize the benefits of our knowledge of
the probable future to ourselves. Start Picking extropic stocks, work in
extropic jobs, band together and form extropic corporations. 

 One area where I think we can be effective in our evangelizing is to
first publish a "Megatrends"-like book that fits in  with the
self-improvement/empowerment movement. Rather than depending on us as
individuals (who on average, are not typically charismatic), use this
tome to run extropian based retreats and self-help seminars. Yeah, some
are turned off by this idea, but hey, if it didn't work, people wouldnt
be making millions off of it already, would they? The sort of people
that are already into this sort of thing tend to, in my estimation, be
dynamically optimistic people, so the existing industry is fertile
ground for early assimilation.

If anyone does decide to personally recruit people, get into the habit
of doing a mental pre-screen on people. Develop a list of conversation
topics to delve into people's opinions about things like life extension,
cloning, intelligence amplification, the internet, space development,
etc. Be patient. It does not matter if it takes you a few months of
preliminary screening conversations with individuals to ascertain their
views, maybe even change a few of their ideas that they seem pliable on.
Only once they seem to fit the profile of "undiscovered transhumanist"
should you get really descriptive of us as a movement. If you can, don't
even let on about us until you've determined that they are ready to
accept the term "transhumanist" as describing themselves.

An interesting taxonomy, and worth thinking about, but I see myself
as all three.  I do not discount the value of shock, I have particular
disdain for unjustified authority, and I am thoroughly convinced by
a few overlooked, unpopular, but brilliant arguments.

This is two different contentions, and I see no connection between
them.  If the majority of those I am trying to convince are swayed by
their impression of how you fit into that grouping, then it might make
sense for me to give the appropriate impression.  But why must I let
their judgements affect me?  Why must I personally give in to their
intellectual pathology that judges ideas by their holders rather than
by their actual merits?

I do not wholly discount the value of other opinions: indeed, there
are many whose opinions have earned my considerable respect, which
causes me to think much harder about disagreeing with them.  It has
taken me years, for example, to convince myself that my position on
copyrights and patents is the only sound and rational one, because
the fact that Rand and Friedman do not hold that opinion spurred me
to extra effort to try to understand why they were mistaken.  But the
value of any opinion--whether the majority, or a authority who got
there by accomplishment, or an authority who got there by fiat--is
to serve as a check-and-balance to one's own reason, not a substitute
for it.

Your existence is the argument against that view.  Your ancestors
made it through ice ages, famines, wars, and technological changes
no less dramatic in their time than our ideas are in ours.  They
survived, and flourished.  Their "social systems" may not have, but
good riddance.  We found better ones.  We will find better still.

I'm not sure they're mistaken either.  But the existence of social
pressure, and its possible efficacy or even necessity, begs the
question of what it is pressure toward.  One cannot judge raw ability,
one judges how it is used.  If the existing social pressure is
toward demonstrably ineffective policies, then one should not ask
how to eliminate the pressure, but how to alter it to be pressure
toward more effective policies.  That is, one should concentrate on
results, not motives.

Because you have defined me as such, sir.  The idea that an author or
inventor deserves monopoly control over the use of his creations to
ensure his just earnings from them is so ingrained in our culture that
it takes some effort to fight it.  But that idea is a recent one, is
not universal to all cultures even today, is not the original intent
of the laws that now enforce it, and is simply not supported by the
facts as I see them.  I am unswayed by argument-by-definition.  If
you want to simply take the "inventions are property" meme as an axiom,
I am powerless to argue against it /is your axiomatic system/.  But if
you could, even for a moment, step outside of your mindset, ignore
the arbitrary definitions this culture has put into your brain, and 
look at the inescapable objective reality that ideas and bread are
fundamentally different, then we can have a rational discourse about
whether it makes sense to apply bread-property law to ideas.  Until
then, it is pointless for me to continue.

Again you confuse "issued patent" with "invention".  Most of the useful
inventions of mankind were made /before/ patents.  They are things like
language, writing, fire, housing, agriculture, cooking, weapons, cloth,
tools, and the millions of other inventions we take for granted.  And
each of those inventions raised the level of technology of society so
that further invention becomes faster, making it seem like everything
that comes to mind when we say "invention" is recent, but that's just
because our minds have supressed the background noise of things we've
grown accustomed to.  I will not speculate on how much faster things
might have advanced without patents in the way, because that would be
just pure speculation; but it is also pure speculation to claim that
progress would have been slower without them.

But isn't the fact that if I add lye to lard in a certain way, it
produces soap just a discovery of the inherent already-existing
properties of lye and lard?  I can use my knowledge of the inverse-
square law to fire a cannon more accurately, and I can use my knowledge
of the soap process to clean myself more effectively.  I honestly
don't see an objective difference to justify the fact that any old
grenadier can use Newton's discovery for his own profit, but not the
discovery of the soap process issued US Pat #1.

The circularity is this: you claimed that patented inventions added X
dollars of value to the economy, and therefore patenting inventions
was valuable.  Let's imagine, for example, that instead of passing a
patent law, congress had passed a law mandating that all inventions
must be green.  Given the same numbers, your argument becomes, "green
inventions have added X dollars of value to the economy, therefore
making inventions green is valuable."  

Inventions do indeed have an objective economic value.  The argument
is not what value X may have resulted from patents; the argument is
about the value of the economy, Y, that would have resulted from the
absence of patent law during that same period.  You contend that X > Y.
I contend that Y > X.  Both are speculation, because we can't do that
experiment.  So we're stuck arguing with the data that does exist,
and from reasonable extrapolations from it.

It's your understandiing that's faulty here.  Lack of commerical use is
absolutely no defense.  The Supreme Court ruled (Sony vs. Universal
Studios) that /one/ copy made by a VCR for time-shifting is "fair use",
but that's all.  If you tape a game, and show your friends, you are
absolutely violating the law, and the copyright owner of the broadcast
can prosecute you.  Of course, they won't as a practical matter
because it would be impossible.  Such absurdities of existing law are
hardly arguments for continuing it.

I understand all that, and agree.  But the fact that they made the
business decision to charge a certain price for advertisements on the
broadcast, basing that decision on the present existence of copyright
law, is not argument that the economics you relate so well would fail
to operate just as well if the assumptions were different.  Perhaps
the network would charge more knowing that they can't expect royalties
from others once they've chosen to broadcast it.  Please believe that
I absolutely understand how the present system works; I am a part of
it.  I'm just not stuck in it.  I have a vision of something better,
and solid reasons for it.

I earn quite a nice living, thank you.  If by "piety" you mean adherence
to my own philosophy in general, not necessarily religious ones, then
yes that's exactly what it is.  Putting my money where my mouth is.  I
honestly believe this view will make us all /more/ profit in the long
run, and even the not-so-long run.  If I didn't, I wouldn't do it.
If you want to prove me wrong, you'll have to come up with better ideas
than I've seen so far.

They would not be me.
A would think it was A, B would think it was B.
Not two of me, one of each of them.
One would go by one name and the other would go by another name.
A would live it's life.
B would live it's life.
Their lives would be different.
They would evovle in different environments.
One side of the room can heal while the other side can harm.
A gains a proton while B loses an electron.
A reads from the net while B makes an interview on the phone.
They are exposed to different memes.
They evolve diferently.
Once one thing happens to one that does not happen to the other 
they are no longer the same.
Ever hear of the snowball effect?
Imagine a small snowball rolling down a hill.
It gets bigger and bigger.
It only takes one small action to cause a landslide.
It only takes one straw to break a camals back.
One difference, no matter how small, means they are not the same.
Different atoms = different people.
They would have many similar qualities.
They would not have all of the same qualities.
Yes, they may act alike for a while.
What if A's wife kills herself 
and in despair it concedes to be a deathist?
That would not be me.

I agree,

which would require tranference.

I know my brain stem alone could keep my body alive until it got a new brain,

I fail to see how avoiding political debate or discussion is respectful
to this listserv. Personally I would be interested in (1.) why you find
libertarianism undesirable, and (2.) what political party or form of
government you do percieve to be *more* suitable to transhumanism. 

I imagine I would find such information and debate thorougly
informative. I have not read all of the posts for this thread, but of
those I have read, I have not seen any mention of an alternative
political party to libertarianism. It seems to me that if you are going
to criticize something, you ought to offer an alternative. This is what
we call *constructive* criticism.

Because it is a policy of the list that "the basics are not up for
discussion".  If libertarian politics are an extropian basic, then its
value is not up to discussion.  This isn't avoiding criticism; it is a
dedication of the list to discussion *given certain values*,
specifically techno-transhumanism and libertarianism.

At least that's what I believe the state of affairs to be, and I presume
it is what the Squirrel* believes affairs to be.  If we are wrong Max
More or Tom Morrow can say so.

*Given that the un-libertarian Squirrel calls himself the (First)
Extropian Squirrel, presumably that transrodent does not believe
libertarianism actually is basic to extropianism.  There is no
contradiction: the Squirrel may view this list as an overly restrictive
forum for discussing extropy, but the only such forum there is.

  The Squirrel acknowledges the case made for debating the subjects
mentioned; notwithstanding, if memory serves, such discussions often
rapidly deteriorate into libertarian/antilibertarian flame wars, of
which many list members bore easily; hence the convention mentioned.
And although the Squirrel enjoys throwing nuts and chattering at
people as only a member of his tribe can; nevertheless, he, too, bores
easily, so will save his ammunition for more interesting targets.

  The Squirrel made his "for the record" posting only to save other
list members from the egregious and embarrassing error of mistaking
him for a libertarian.  Ew.    8:)   <-- (smiling Squirrel face)

A would think it was A, B would think it was A, both would be correct.

You walk into a matter duplicating chamber, there is a blinding flash of 
light, when your eyes clear there is a man who looks just like you standing 
to your right. I have 3 questions.
      
1) How could you determine if you were the "original" (whatever that means) 
   or the "copy"?  
2) Why should you even care?  
3) If you somehow found out that you were the copy, what if anything would 
   you do?

        >Different atoms = different people.


Then you are quite literally a different person than you were one year ago 
because your atoms are different, it doesn't matter. Atoms have no  
distinguishing marks, no scratches on them to tell them apart. In Science   
you can exchange one atom of Hydrogen with another  one and the system does 
not change at all. If atoms themselves have no individuality I don't see how
on earth they could give this interesting property to us.

"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof."  The skeptical
mantra.  To most people, many of our claims are extraordinary.
Sometimes we can offer deductive arguments for our positions; other
times we have less support than that.  But even then we are opposing one
deductive chain of reasoning to several inductive chains of experience.
It is reasonable (i.e., generally works) to assume that our deductive
proof is either wrong somewhere, or else if valid then ignoring some
assumption.  That they can't identify it easily isn't important; the
fact that they do have inductive experience countering our argument
strongly suggests that there is a missing factor.

Therefore to get anywhere, particularly in libertarian and
anarcho-capitalist debate, we must not only show how our envisioned
society could work, we must explain why current society is the way it is
and why any exceptions our opponents will come up with don't apply.
Preferably before they come up with the objections, to forestall claims
of "special pleading" which will be made, whether doing so is fair.

This is why David Friedman excites me: he actually tries to take the
current world (and the people in it) seriously, and is thus more
convincing than J. Random Net-libertarian.  Robin does too; it seems to
be an application of economist training to libertarian interests.

_Hidden Order_ the note that economics assumes rational behavior coupled
with relatively simple goals, I wondered whether some 'social' goal like
"seeking status" or "being 'with' other humans" or something shouldn't
be factored into more speculative models.

Good post, though.

Does Kuhn doubt progress??  After all, Kuhn is just a different kind of
evolutionary epistemologist.  His theory could be read to say that science
is rational (accomplishing a kind of criticism by attrition) *even when*
scientists themselves are not.

Stove seems to say (in Reilly's quote) that Popper is flawed by
taking "observation" as a special category.  I thought Bartley treated
that issue more uniformly, taking "observations" (& observational methods)
as just more ideas to hold-provisionally.  More uniformly "irrational,"
meaning non-justificationist, of course.

I think there's room for cautious...dynamic!...optimism.  UIs do get
gradually nicer.  Software that does sensible and useful things comes out
a little at a time.  Hey, with a little prompting people could adopt Java
and maybe some good simple security models and get rid of a layer of OS
and mega-app stupidity.  I paid $300 for the (used) color laptop with
built-in modem that I'm working on.  Hopeful signs, I mean.

I think there's an argument that in general, the more advanced an economy,
the *easier* it is to get involved in.  The most "advanced" people are
pushing diminishing returns, and all the tools (& economies of scale)
that are mass-produced to help them do that are even more useful to the
"have nots".  Okay maybe not *air tight*, but it's an *argument*, all right?

[Btw, just thought of a really nasty quip about "post-scarcity":
 Post-scarcity is an idea thought up by people who don't understand
 economics and hope that the singularity will save them from having to!]

Another way of looking at it is, if this stuff is so confusing to learn,
it's not very "advanced," is it?  I don't think so.  It's actually another
reassuring sign, that after watching a couple decades of apocalyptic hype,
you start to notice that things change at a rather leisurely pace after
all!  After a while, massive stupidity impedes its own advance.

I'm another "bleeding heart transhumanist" for whom clarity for people is
one of the most important goals I can see this side of the singularity.

Just read an interesting book: "Derrida for Beginners," by Jim Powel.
It's in comic-book ("Cartoon History of") style.

Now if Postmodernism is as closely linked to "deconstruction" as I thought,
this is very interesting.  Max says-

>I spent this past weekend at a conference in Munich, Germany discussing why
>Europe is undergoing a "Big Fatigue" while the USA seems so much more
>vibrant...

The thing is that this book says that, "Soon (early '70's) the American study
of deconstruction eclipsed its French following, spreading...to revolutionize
and politicize literature and humanities departments nationwide, then
worldwide."

So American academics have aparently had a big hand in this stuff.
(*Smack!*)  Could it be that America as a whole hasn't fallen into the
spell because America ignores its academics?  Not sure how happy I am
about that.  Or is it that we're much quicker to get the point, especially
of an anti-establishment, anti-tradition idea, rather than belabor it?
Another pair of quotes: Camile Paglia: "America doesn't need
deconstruction." Derrida: "America *is* deconstruction."

Deconstruction has something to do with people undermining their positions
(if you analize with eyes crossed, thumb up nose) by the very concepts
or distinctions they use to support their positions.  Like the way that
Ayn Rand would say you *had* to believe her prejudices because in order
to argue against her you had to employ them.  Only the opposite.  I mean
deconstruction is stranger, but I didn't like how Rand wired her basement
either.  Me for say it straight, even if you're talking about something
crooked.

Two things I did get out of this book.  Now I'm more willing to think "It's
a French (or Euro, or Academic) thing."  Instead of being an incisive
analysis that turns the world on its head, it's more like a critique of
stodgy smarty-pants French/Euro/Academic philosophy done in a stodgy
smarty-pants way.  (A friend (in the mid-80's) said he made some puns in
French to some French people and they were astonished--they don't *do*
puns.  But Derrida is like puns flogged beyond death.)

The other thing is the Structuralism/Post-Structuralism riddle.  It's not
that these were two generations of French/Euro/Academics.  Rather, Claude
Levi-Strauss came up with Structuralism, which caught a bunch of hopeful
enthusiasm, ONLY TO BE IMMEDIATELY TOPP(L)ED by Derrida (in a lecture at
*Johns Hopkins*), giving birth to "Post-strux".  So these people seem to
have been flitting after fads, except the deconstruction fad lasted about
20 years (~'66-'87).

I suspect it has to do with the Marxists' desparate need to escape the
middle-class Ideology they assume they're under the spell of.  I mean
*there's* a Big F...atiguing meme to be suffering under.  For me,
deconstruction makes cracks, but not *treads*.  No traction.

Yet in FrancoEuroAcademe it does seem to cling tenaciously.  Maybe
some sort of memetic evolutionarily stable strategy niche thing.
You have to be there...?

But then, the idea that *Those people's ideas are irreconcilably alien*
is a self-promoting divisive Fatiguing idea in itself.

If someone is a reasonable person, then the fact that they have come
to some opinion is information to you.  It is an important clue. 
Are you saying there are only a handful of people among the billions
in our world whose opinions would affect yours?  If so, you must think
there are very few reasonable people in the world.

Evolution gives a vast selection effect.  Most competitors to our
ancenstors do not have many descendants today.  And "making it
through" enough to leave descendants is not great comfort, given how
so many of those people suffered so badly.

Yes. Not only should we explain why people now disagree with us, but
also why people in the past have disagreed.  We especially need to
explain the events that they used as an empirical basis for their
claims.  Hence my post on the feudal to state transition.

There are lots of interesting models of participation in religion and
status seeking.  But we tend to not add these effects when we are
modeling other phenomena.  We tend to think that these systems are
robust enough that we do not need to model everything in great detail
to see the dominant processes.  But if could be that social systems
are not as modular as this, and we really have to understand
everything at once to understand anything.  If so, it may be pretty
hopeless.

Yes, that's what I thought I said.  It's a clue; one among many.
But since I'm the one affected most by my decisions, and I'm the one
who has to take responsibility for them, I'm the only one I allow
to make the final decision as to which clues have better proof.  I
give a very high weight to my own observations and experiences over
the opinions of others.

If you ask how many people whose opinions--in the absence of any
direct experience of mine--I value so highly that I might actually
re-examine my own ideas in light of their disagreement, then yes,
there are very few of those indeed.  I see absolutely no reason
why I should give any creedence at all to J. Random Ph.D. or
John Q. Bestseller.

This is an excellent point.  The more I think about it, the more I am
forced to agree with the great mind of Eli Yudkowski: evolutionary
psychology is the best field of study to answer those questions.
People, and the societies they form, are the way they are because we
evolved the way we did.

It is very likely that a future hitech military won't be such a bad thing
except for the enemy. Consider a future of pitting genengineered cloned
soldiers augmented with cheeta legs or additional sensory input against
other genengineered cloned soldiers from different countries. The whole
idea of the future of military keeps taking me back to that one part of
Neil Stephenson's SnowCrash when that cyborg dog broke the sound barrior
running alongside the highway and detonated all the windshields. The future
of military is high accuracy and nearly a video game with all the remote
control over the battlefield.

Mr. Lorrey properly pointed out that I had ignored one of his earlier
arguments, and I misinterpreted his later reference to it.  I will
attempt to remedy this.  First, his point:

> Any responses to this quoting communist rhetoric and I will puke.

Ignoring the parenthetical hint which is clearly circular (defining
inventions as patented things, then claiming most inventions happened
under patent laws), Mr. Lorrey then calculates that the "relative
scarcity" of an invention is 4.55 million man-hours of labor.  By this
I believe he means to imply that this is an appropriate measure of the
value of an inventor's work, and further that he means to imply that
this income would not be obtained without patents.

That is at least three independent claims.  The first (the value he
calculates) incorrectly assumes that patent=invention, thereby ignoring
the thousands of inventions that are never patented either because 
their creators had no use for patents (high-tech and trendy things
often become obsolete so fast that waiting for and paying for a patent
is a waste of time and resources better spent on getting the thing to
market quickly), or because they couldn't find a sufficient market or
sufficient startup capital, or because they were invented by foreigners
for whom there was no US patent protection until the Paris convention
of 1884.  As a guess, I'd put the number of "inventions", not including
all the little things people build for themselves with no intention of
marketing, at least an order of magnitude higher.

The second claim, that the relative scarcity of a commodity is in
direct corrolation to its value, just ignores the demand side of the
equation.  It doesn't matter how rare your talents are if nobody has
any use for them.  An inventor, then, must use judgment and take some
risk in deciding how to invest his time so that his creations will
have a better chance at being valuable.  The best way to do that is
probably for him to do research under a capitalist patron, because
capitalists live on their ability to judge investments.  An alternative
"strategy" (in a loose sense) is blind luck.  To happen upon a
discovery by accident--like the vulcanization of rubber--eliminates
the risk, and is a time-honored tradition, primarily because some
things were just to farfetched to have been discovered otherwise.  
However, many chance discoveries resulted from basic research aimed
at other goals, so there was still speculation involved.  Because
that speculation takes capital, and its success is a major factor in
the success of the enterprise, it is the /speculation/, not the
invention, whose scarcity we most prize, and that should benefit the
most from the product.  When the inventor himself does it, he does
indeed reap the benefits, but usually it's a capitalist, and quite
rightly so.  He is, after all, paying the inventor's bills.  So the
relative scarcity of inventions to labor is no measure of value.

Lastly, it is (presumably, but not explicitly) claimed that without
patents, the inventor would have insufficient incentive to create,
because he would be less likely to be rewarded commensurately with
his "value".  That invention happened before patents is still there
to challenge that idea, but so too are all the other arguments I have
made before about other ways for an inventor (or patron) to profit
from his creations.  Mr. Lorrey elsewhere claims that his experience
of individual contracts being imperfectly honored in courts hampers
most of those methods.  But two wrongs don't make a right: if contract
law is broken, using the patent laws here in question to avoid that
problem rather than tackling the problem directly makes little sense.
And even if individual contracts are hard to enforce, most inventions
are made under the employ of large corporations who /do/ have the
resources to enforce their contracts with each other, which is
sufficient for several of the methods proposed.  This is also moot
in the cases where an lone inventor, without contracts, can manage
to demonstrate an invention without giving away its secret, and
can then sell it to the highest bidder, and in the case where he
can choose never to release specs to the public at all, by making
money with the technology privately.

Because there are many patentless methods to profit from technology, 
and because a patentless system cuts research and developments costs
drastically, I simply don't see that a patentless world automatically
resigns inventors to poverty.  This is not a socialist argument that
inventors must sacrifice profits for the common good, or even a
left-libertarian argument that an inventor only "deserves" what he
can get without resort to force; it is a purely uncompromising
capitalist profit-driven argument that the inventor himself, his
investors, and everyone else benefits more from a system that does
not restrict the unfettered exchange of ideas to whomever can most
efficiently exploit them.

Lee, I wholeheartedly appreciate your comment.  So many people in our society
today have "advanced" educations and such, but so few have any real knowlege
that counts in helping bring about the world we want.  Not to mention how
"educated" people often become so endoctrinated into the mainstream world,
that they lose the ability to perceive correctly new concepts such as we
Extropians hold.  I value open-mindedness more than education, and when you
find someone with both, you most likely will end up with an Extropian.

Well, I'd be willing to risk saying that current economic models do
explain a lot of behavior.  But at some point you want to add more
modules to explain the rest of behavior, as well as revising the old
models in light of the new interactions.

When we're discussing the nature of political possibility, I think the
population economists would think of is not the dozens or hundreds of
highly educated or popular people, but the millions and billions of
people who have had their little inputs into society.  When, for
example, you advocate anarchist solutions, you are saying that all
societies, for all of human history, have been making the same mistake
of having government.  That's a very strong claim.  Can you pit your
logic and experience against the thought and experience of billions of
people?

And once you have, can you convince those people that you're not nuts to
begin with?

Jay I think your apostasy ius important.  I'm new to thie list, so havent
posted yet. I subscribe to some principles of transhumanism and not others.
 Some libertarian ideas and not others.  The people who want to evangelize
the package as a whole strike me as cultist, with the earmarks of that style.
 Of course the memes transfer better that way.  I find your poosition more

Exactly. I had seen on  somebody's page somewhere, along with a FAQ, a
FAD, or Frequently Asked Doubts (I beleive it was on either the Black
Horse Rocket Plane page, or Gary Hudson's ROTON page) which dealt with
people's statements of disbeleive or opposition. THis might be something
to add to the extropians site....

4A. "Systems and States": In _Life Itself_, Robert Rosen notes: "There
is indeed a profound parallel between Newtonian particle mechanics and
the pure syntax of formalizations; in each case, everything is supposed
to be generated from structureless, meaningless elements ... pushed
around according to definite rules ... In each case, all that ultimately
matters is the spatial disposition of these elements, their
configuration... The sequence of state transitions of a system of
particles, governed by Newton's laws of motion, starting from some given
initial configuration, is then the analog of a theorem in a formalism."

"And just as formalization in mathematics believed that everything could
be formalized /without loss/, so that all truth could be recaptured in
terms of syntax alone, so particle mechanics came to believe that every
material behavior could be ... reduced to purely syntactical sequences
of configurations in an underlying system of particles.... the form
taken by mechanical description ... has become the universal currency
for describing systems of any kind."

4B. "Chronicles." Rosen says: "I will begin by stepping back a bit, by
supposing that we do not yet have a notion of state at our disposal....
All the self can see is a sequence of percepts, ordered by its
subjective sense of time.... Thus, the result of the self looking at its
ambience is only a tabulation; a list of what is seen, indexed by when
it is seen. Such a list we shall call a /chronicle/." 

"But the self is not merely an observer.... So, along with any time
series ... comes the urge to extend it into the future and into the
past, to extrapolate it, to predict and postdict ... we seek to extract
from the structure of the list itself something that will already entail
those entries that are yet to come or those that have come before." But,
Rosen notes, "all it can find this way are properties of the list, and
not in general of what the list represents." Such context-free samples
are doomed to "lose information precisely because they are samples, and
they also add irrelevant information (noise), which pertains to the
sampling process itself." (p70)

4C. "Recursive Chronicles." Showing that "there are an infinite number
of different formulas that will all produce the given chronicle", Rosen
concludes that "a list thus /can never entail a formula/. The reason
being that "in the present case, the independent variable (instants) is
simply a set of labels, unconnected causally or in any other way with
the values of f(n) that they label.... What we do want is ... entailment
between the /values/ f(n), and in fact, we want entailment that does not
involve the independent variable n at all ... what we earlier called
/contagion/."

4D. "Recursion: Some General Features". Rosen looks at a few examples of
recursive chronicles and the mapping, T, and its iterates that generate
them, mentioning groups, trajectories and orbits. Rosen notes that these
functions have many nice properties as long as they are invertible. Then
he concludes: "causality manifests itself /only/ through a sequence of
state transitions ... this is the basic picture that permeates all of
contemporary science. If there is something wrong with the picture, or
especially if there is something missing from it, then the root of the
trouble lies already here."

01/26/97. 4E. "On Taylor's Theorem", 4F. "Recursion and Constraints",
and 4G. "Coping With Nonrecursiveness: Recursion and Constraint in Sets
of Chronicles" covers 12 pages of mathematical technicalities that
basically describe how Taylor's theorem [ f(t0 + h) = f(t0) + hf'(t0) +
(h^2/2!)f"(t0) + .... ] "provides a glimpse at how we can make a
chronicle, which is itself not recursive, act as if it were by embedding
it in a larger set of chronicles." These are the successive velocity,
acceleration, etc. derivatives used in differential equations "to
convert synchronic information ... into diachronic information."

4H. "Newton's Laws". Rosen declares: "As I shall now show, Newton's laws
are at heart nothing but Taylor's theorem, raised now to a universal
principle via tacit but extremely restrictive limitations on encoding
and decoding of events in the ambience."

"It cannot be stressed too strongly that the Newtonian particle is a
/formal object/.... Aside from the parameters with which it is endowed
(e.g., its mass) ... its /only/ attribute at any instant is its position
in space. Thus, there is only one question to ask about it: namely,
where is it? The answers constitute a chronicle, consisting of positions
in space, labeled by corresponding instants of time.... The upshot is
that, although indeed a (differentiable) function entails its own
derivative /as a function/, its /value/ at any instant entails nothing
about the value of the derivatives at that instant."

"So far we have been looking at the single particle that constitutes our
(natural) system. Let us now notice that the same act that singled out
that particle from the ambience also /simultaneously/ specifies the
system environment.... But if the state of an individual particle is at
this point already an infinite object, to try to characterize a 'state'
of this environment is literally unthinkable. Newton did not even
attempt this. Instead, he took a completely different approach, embodied
in the concept of /force/. The environment was to be characterized ...
entirely through its effects on the system. Specifically, we
characterize the environment of a particle through its effect on change
of state."

"Newton chose an ingenious device ... he noted that /at the purely
formal level/, and /only/ at that level, we are free to make the
environment of a Newtonian particle anything we want.... The substance
of Newton's First Law is to specify what a particle does in such an
empty environment. He mandated that such a particle cannot
accelerate.... In a formal environment that is not empty, and is thus
the seat of /forces/ impinging on the particle, the effects of these
forces on the motion of the particle is thus tied to its acceleration. 

The way in which force and acceleration are explicitly tied together
constitutes Newton's Second Law, which consists of two separate parts.
In the first part ... Newton mandates that the effect of any environment
forces on a particle, at any instant, are proportional to the particle's
acceleration at that instant ... The second part of Newton's Second Law
says essentially [that] from the particle's point of view, any forces F
it experiences from its environment /are already functions of its own
states/ ... The upshot of Newton's Second Law is to effectively collapse
the state of the particle, which is an infinite set of variables, /down
to only two/ of them, down to position and velocity alone."

"Newton's Laws thus serve to transmute the initial dualism between
system and environment into a new dualism, that between /phase (states
and forces/, or between /states and dynamical laws.... in the Newtonian
picture, a particle is shoved from one state to another through the
external agencies to which it must react. But when we go to systems of
several formal particles, the situation is different. Each particle
forms part of the environments of all the others." "This", Rosen says,
"requires a new ingredient ... Hence, the separate stipulation of, for
example, the Law of Universal Gravitation..." Rosen concludes: "just as
in the single-particle case, the system-environment dualism becomes
transmuted into a dualism between phases and forces. It is a little more
complicated now ... the recursion rules governing change of states or
phases of the system become /relative/ ... additional chronicles must be
stipulated which pertain to the environment."

02/08/97. 4I. "On Entailment in Physics: Cause & Effect". Rosen seeks to
show that "Newtonian mechanics as a formalism manifests a surprisingly
weak inferential structure" that also restricts any causal entailments
that may be derived from it. He examines how Newton's Second Law says
that "the way in which acceleration depends on phase is a measure of the
force impressed on the particles of a system by its environment" and,
thus, "the relations themselves constitute an encoding of environment
and not system. Thus, in the Newtonian picture, systems get states;
environments do not (and cannot); environments rather become identified
with dynamical laws."

"This is a fateful situation ... we have automatically placed beyond the
province of causality anything that does not encode directly into a
state-transition sequence. Such things have become /acausal/, out of the
reach of entailment in the formalism, and hence /in principle
undecodable/ from the formalism." (p102) From this, Rosen declares: "I
shall define a natural system N to be a mechanism if it possesses the
properties I have just articulated: namely, (1) it has a largest model,
consisting of a set of states, and a recursion rule entailing subsequent
state from present state; and (2) every other model of it can be
obtained from the largest one by formal means."

4J. "Quantum Mechanics, Open Systems, and Related Matters", Rosen claims
that "until the advent of quantum ideas, physicists did not in fact
think much about causality." He even quotes Bertrand Russell as stating:
"The reason why physics has ceased to look for causes is that, in fact,
there are no such things." The problem, Rosen says, is that "the
Heisenberg commutation relations said that classical phase could no
longer even be defined at the quantum level, let alone be recursive.
But, as was quickly realized, giving up the notion of phase did not mean
giving up the notion of state. It merely required an encoding of that
notion into a more complicated mathematical or formal object (wave
function) ... governed now by Schrodinger's equation (or its
equivalents) rather than by Newton's Second Law." 

The key point for Rosen here is that "the new encoding ... of wave
functions ... could be related only in a statistical way to the old,
classical encoding". Rosen then notes that Newtonian mechanics does not
deal well with open systems, those where there is "turnover" in the
'particles' inhabiting a "distinguished region of space". In open
systems, as in quantum systems, he continues, "the 'state' was now to be
a density of some kind, and the 'velocity', or rate of change of state,
was now specified, not in terms of force, but solely by bookkeeping ...
the difficulty is precisely in assigning to such a situation a notion of
state that is recursive.... In every case, the strategy is then to
regard the 'open system' as an underlying closed system /plus
something/." Rosen concludes this section (p 107) by warning that "it is
precisely in recoding the concept of state that the transition from
classical to quantum mechanics manifests itself."

(to be continued -
Rosen is leading up to a discussion of  relational biology in ch.5 and
Analytic and Synthetic Models in ch.6)

Only that having vigorously enforced patents creates a greater incentive
on the part of inventors to pursue the patent process. By patenting, the
invention specs are publicly available for study, so companies or
indviduals needing a solution to a particular problem can find it if it
is already invented. By paying royalties on use of the patent, they save
money versus re-inventing the wheel, thus R&D costs are saved. If the
invention were not patented, and kept secret, such exchanges would not
be possible, and R&D would comprise a much larger percentage of
production costs. Also, by having exisitng patents publicly available
for study, the competetive frog-jumping effects I spoke of can take
place, where companies can see how brand X does it, so they say, how can
we do it better to be more competetive than they? THus R&D moeny is
spent on NEW research, rather than rehashing things already developed
but kept secret.

No, it is only to debunk your arguments that inventors get overpaid in a
patent system due to the monopoly they can command for their device,
that the work of inventors/creators needs to be more in line with that
of other labor functions, which I am trying, by illustration of relative
scarcity to show that since one patented invention is worth so many man
hours of labor in terms of relative scarcity, not even to mention that
man hours of labor are generic commodities, while every invention is
unique, that even being stingy, an average invention is worth so many
man hours. While we can say that not all inventions are worth anything,
or are marketable, by filtering out "useless" inventions (while keeping
all the useless work that occurs every day) this merely makes each
useful invention MORE VALUABLE relativly speaking.

I never denied that people invented things prior to the USPTO, and am
even acknowledging that prior to the USPTO and the American Revolution,
patents and other intellectual property were handled by the Royal Office
of Patents in Britain, though I am not particularly familiar with that
system. What i am saying is that in an system where individual patent
rights are rigorously enforced by government, irrespective of the
relative wealth of the patent holder, that the quantity of patents
pursued by individuals and companies goes up, which, due to the openly
available patent information, helps accelerate technological advancement
as described above. R&D money is not wasted on replicated research.

And what is the possibility of making money with either method? I would
say that the indvidual inventor can make much more money under a public
patent system like ours than in private secrecy system, and is much less
likely to be taken advantage of (with the exception of one, which I
shall describe below.)

In this case I would like to hear details of these sort of systems.
Personally, I have had one invention seized by a defense agency and
classified, so I cannot get a patent on it till it is declassified
(meanwhile they and their contractors are using it to their glee). THis
is my one caveat with the present system, and have been seeking methods
to be able to keep the central secrets of my drive system secure without
risking having the drive technology seized by Agent John Q.
Stormtrooper, and still being able to produce products using the
technology.

I think I am who I am.
I do not think I am that other person

A=A
B=B
If B=A then there is only A.
There is only one A.
Next in line is B.

That would depend on how it was done which seems theoretical.
You just designed the duplicating chamber, you tell me.
If I was standing on one side of the chamber

I would know I was the copy.

Personally I would not care about the past.

AAAGGGHHH! 
NNNOOO! 
HELP ME! 
MY PARTICLES ARE SPILLING OFF OF ME!
MY LEPTONS, MY LEPTONS!

:-)

I regretfully accept these changes 
as long as I do not seem to experience pain.
I would rather not be this particularly unstable.
Some day I hope I will solve that problem.
Unfortunatly there does not seem to be much I can do about that right now.

It does matter.
My matter has changed.
Is there a single molecule that has been with me as long as I have been
(excuse the fact that I have only been for one segment of time)?

>Atoms have no  
>distinguishing marks, no scratches on them to tell them apart. 

Location and structure is used to presently distinguish between them.
An atom becomes an isotope and is still that type of atom, only different.
It is like saying all apples are the same from a distance.
If you can tell there are two apples the are obviously not the same apple 
as their place in spacetime is effected by different forces 
and they are subject to different physical laws,
meaning the actions their particles are participating in are not the same 
and thus the are not the same apple. as they are the sum of their particles.

Mark my words.
We will be more able to distinguish between atoms eventually.
It is written, so mote it be.
I am or at least at some times seem to be 
the almost but not quite so semi-omniscient predictionarrationator
of that which has not yet at any particular moment in spacetime 
revealed it's self to absolutely every one in the whole of existence 
excluding me. :-)

>In Science

Of course it changed, you just switched atoms.
Switching is an action.
An action usually requires change.
At one time it had atom A.
At another time it was -A.
At another time it was -A + B.

>If atoms themselves have no individuality I don't see how

How many types of sub-atomic particles does it take 
to convince you that all atoms are not all the same?

Dear Fellow Extropians,

This may be seen as a really silly low tech question for all us high tech
junkies, but here it is.

How did I subscribe to this extopy board?

I have several cyber friends that wish to subscribe, but are unclear on
protocol.

And I do not recall details. 

Thank you in advance for any help, I will forward postings to interested
parties.

Long, Happy, Life in a Boundless Universe,

Rudi Hoffman, Daytona Beach, FL

Everything in existence is ordinary.
Everything in nature is natural.

Robots are cross-country drivers, runners, and janitors.
AI can follow a conversation better than some humans can.
Arms, legs, hearts, and some parts of brains are replaced with in/organics.
Communications are sent to other galaxies.
Packages can be sent to other planets.
People are brought back from the dead after an hour.

Every human dies.
IS IT SELFISH TO WANT TO LIVE,
to stop others from dying,
to continue to do good things instead of being dead?

What you said just there reminds me of the book Ernest Gellner wrote
recently, called Postmodernism, Reason and Religion (I think), in which
he sees these three intellectual trends as stable for the foreseeable
future.  i.e., the Enlightenment is still going strong (Reason), but
disenchantment (real or feigned) with reason drives people either to PoMo
or fundamentalism.

Yes, I can.  Reality is not a matter of consensus.  It exists the way it
does regardless of what 5 billion people think.  If one man has a clearer
vision of some facet of it, and he can demonstrate it, the masses have
no choice but to abandon their mistaken consensus, or it is they who are
irrational.  The existence of governments is a powerful consensus, and
it is hard to fight, because it is hard to do controlled empirical
research on the hearts of the multitude.  But it is not impossible to
observe and draw some reasonable conclusions, and to attack some bad
ideas and revisionist history.

That's not easy sometimes, because the definition of "nuts" is usually
by consensus rather than objective criteria.  But it is necessary to try.

My sentiments exactly. SOrry for the waste of bandwidth, but I couldn't
help responding to this. Using the definition shrinks have that insanity
is a view of reality that differs from the majority, todays insanity is
tomorrows conventional wisdom, just as if one were to beleive in
evolution in the 1800's one was considered to be nuts, or at least a
tool of the devil, or both, yet today it is creationists that look like
the nut cases (depending on how "nuts" you yourself are).

I tend to ignore people when they say that such and so is a crazy idea,
or that person is crazy. It tends to make me want to check it out more,
because of my own experience, those that according to mundanes seem to
be nuts tend to be rather prescient in the end.

I would like to lay to rest the notion that patent enforcement is necessary
for invention.  Two countries in the 19th century, the Netherlands and
Switzerland, deliberately eliminated patent protection for several decades.
 In the Netherlands there was no measurable effect on the rates of invention.
 In Switzerland the rate of invention increased; the Swiss chemical industry
came to world prominence during that period.

That's a complete nonsequitur.  You're assuming that the market value 
of patentable inventions developed over the period equals that of labor of
the period.  There is no necessary connection between the two numbers, any
more than between the market value of inventions and that of infrastructure
or capital investments, or for that matter any arbitrary subset of labor,
infrastructure, or investments.

Didn't some well-known physicist say, 'That idea is crazy.  Almost crazy
enogh to be true.'?  Anybody recall the source?

Some years ago I thought to design a personal computer which had a few
unused bits in some of its I/O latches for hackers to discover. When
they set one of these, it would set off a smoke bomb disguised as a
capacitator on the mother board.....

Then there was the video board I bought from Fry's which did actually
emit smoke when I powered up my PC. But that's another story....

I'm already thinking about countermeasures, and am wondering if this
isn't just a little bit hyped here. This idea works provided the disk is
spinning at a constant speed, but aren't most HD motor servo controlled,
so the velocity is always wandering back and forth??

Not that it matters very much. I realized long ago that the only secure
storage is in my head, and I don't have much that needs that kind of
security. Moderately sensitive stuff goes on floppies or gets
encrypted....

Niels Bohr, to a fellow physicist: "Your theory is crazy, but it's not
crazy enough to be true."

I much prefer this gem from Krishnamurti: "It is no measure of health
to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society."

Open Air Space Habitats (excerpted) 
 
    A home in space need not be the enclosed volume usually described 
in most movies, books and articles  
[McKendree]. If a strong enough material is used, a rotating cylinder 
can be so large that it holds an entire  
atmosphere against its inner surface. One example of this is Larry 
Niven's "Ringworld", a ring the diameter  
of Earth's orbit, circling a sun, and wide enough to contain oceans and 
continents [Niven]. It, and similar  
proposals [REF], unfortunately have to be built of "Unobtainium" to 
perform this mighty feat. 
     We now have a material close at hand that can do something like 
this, albeit on a much smaller scale. The  
smaller the diameter of the rotating ring or cylinder, the less demands 
are put on its main structural material.  
Instead of encircling a star, we can now contemplate building 
artificial worlds with land areas comparable to  
Earth that are open to space- a feature we've grown accustomed to on 
this world. 
     This fabulous new material is the long sought Carbon-Carbon chain 
molecule. Its existence was posited  
several decades ago, but no one knew how to make it. The answer turned 
out to be one of those delicious  
tales of scientific discovery, like Goodyear stumbling on 
vulcanization. We've come to know of a "third  
form" of pure Carbon, not diamond nor graphite. This "new"-to us- stuff 
is called Buckminsterfullerene, or  
Buckyballs and Buckytubes. Now that we know what to look for, this 
stuff has turned up in four billion year  
old meteorites  interstellar gas clouds, and right here on Earth: in 
ordinary candle soot, where it was  
discovered occurring naturally]. 
    With the clarity of hindsight, it is obvious that a "sheet" of 
ordinary graphite could be rolled up and joined  
to form tube- I'll wager someone thought of it many years ago. What is 
amazing about this is that it happens  
all the time, naturally. Now comes the hard part- make the tube really, 
really long, and do it at hundred  
thousand ton per second rates. The "really long" part is being avidly 
pursued, and we might see meter-long  
samples this year (1997) [Smalley]. This in turn may well spawn an 
industry that replaces "Carbon Fiber"  
with the real thing. The first products will probably be military, 
aerospace and spacecraft parts, as was the  
case with Carbon Fiber. Then come the bicycle frames, tennis rackets, 
golf  clubs and such. These products  
will weigh perhaps half of an equivalent Carbon Fiber part. More 
importantly, they establish "Buckyfiber" as  
a viable, nanotech industry. 
    To make this material in the quantities we really want, some parts 
of the production have to be done by  
self-replicated tools, or 'Special Assemblers". The nice thing about 
"Graphenes" (Buckytubes) is they self- 
assemble to a large extent (cf.  "candle flame"). Therefore, the 
Special Assembler does not need to do direct,  
positional-control chemistry on the forming tube, it only needs to 
mediate, or catalyze, the process, and  
move the finished end of the tube along and out of the way, where more 
conventional machinery can  take  
over. Since this is essentially a one-dimensional product (like wire or 
yarn), the Special Assemblers can be  
arranged in a plane, with the Buckyfibers emanating perpendicular to 
that plane. 
     Given the above capabilities, we can now speak of creating new 
worlds. In this example, we'll make a  
2000 kilometer diameter world, just for fun. A space-based industrial 
capacity, having the tremendous  
resources of just the inner Solar System at its disposal, along with 
some nanotech self-replication  
capabilities, can do this kind of thing. 
    Beginning with the alluded to giant spools of Buckyfiber, a 
cylindrical structure can be "filament-wound"  
in deep space. To do this, one need a rotating mandrel, or round mold, 
to wind the fiber onto. This can be  
made in several different ways. One is to start with a long, thin, 
superconducting wire, formed into a loop,  
and charge it with an electric current. It then naturally springs out 
to form a near-perfect circle. Using  
several of these connected together in a row, and reinforced with 
Buckyfiber-cloth, makes a short cylinder,  
say 100 meters long by 2000 km diameter. This now can be brought up to 
some rotational speed in several  
ways. One efficient way is to build two worlds at the same time, 
spinning in opposite directions, and use a  
motor between them. 
    The gathered ends of Buckyfibers are led off of the spools (which 
are also spinning) and brought to  
rendezvous with the outer surface of the spinning hoop. The shell is 
wound to a thickness of perhaps a few  
centimeters. Depending on the masses (moments of inertia), allowable 
fiber tensions, rotational speeds of the  
hoop and spools and so on, the hoop can be made to slow down as the 
fiber runs out. Now the supercurrent  
is quenched, allowing the mandrel to go somewhat slack (it still has 
some centrifugal force pushing it against  
the new Buckyfiber cylinder). The mandrel is released from the inner 
surface of the new cylinder wall, and  
moved along another 100 meters or so, like a concrete slip-form. 
Another gang of Buckyfiber spools is  
brought  in and the process repeated. After doing this a few hundred 
times, we are left with a big, thin,  
slowly spinning cylinder, say 500 km long and 2000 km diameter, having 
over three million square  
kilometers of new land- about 2% of Earth's land area. This now can be 
used as the mandrel for the rest of  
the construction. 
   Leaving this cylinder spinning slowly, we bring in fleets of these 
Buckytube spools. The fiber should be  
wound at a slight angle, maybe 10 degrees, which means we need a 
shuttle, like on a loom. This might have  
to be a rocket propelled craft looming over the new world, like a 
Shuttle. Another way is to build a 500  
kilometer beam with the shuttles on it that sits in space next to the 
cylinder. The shell needs to be perhaps 15  
meters thick for structural reasons, and another three meters of slag 
might be sprayed on the outside, for  
radiation protection. The atmosphere-to-be will provide the same 
radiation protection topsides that Earth's  
air does. 
   As we wind the main bulk of this world, we have to consider what to 
do about the ends. As this is an  
"open-air" design, the ends only have to come up from the cylinder wall 
about 200 kilometers, and can be  
very thin near the top, as will be the enclosed atmosphere. These end 
walls can be made by wrapping the  
fiber over the edge of the cylinder, letting it run in a straight line 
for a ways across the open end, then  
wrapping back up onto the cylinder. Using a thin plastic membrane 
across the end, with a small amount of  
air inside for pressurization, can help make the end rounded, as they 
ideally should be. 
After the main shell is built, the rest of the atmosphere can be 
brought in, the nitrogen and oxygen distilled  
from asteroids and cometary nuclei. Oceans are easy; there is lots of 
accessible water ice strewn about in  
asteroids and small moons, out past Earth's orbit. These will have to 
be shallow seas, though, unless the  
shell is made very thick under them. Mountains ranges might be added to 
the ends, where the walls rise to  
hold the atmosphere. 
   The interior volume of this world can be left open to space, meaning each point on the interior living  
surface has about 200 Km of atmosphere above it, and then 1600 Km of 
nothing. Looking upward, at an  
angle, one can still see the stars. 
    Daylight can be either provided naturally, using a suitable 
arrangement of mirrors, or artificial. The design  
presented here uses one or more artificial suns rotating above the 
atmosphere at a slower rate than the  
habitat is spinning, so as to give a 24 hour day. These lights need 
about a million megawatts (a terawatt) or  
more of electricity to power them, which might be provided by 
photovoltaic cells covering the exterior. For  
positions farther from the Sun than Earth is, this power source can 
also be augmented or supplanted by off- 
World Solar Power Satellites beaming energy back to microwave antennae, 
as well as separate mirrors to  
increase the energy reaching the solar cells. To keep the lit portion 
of the ring from lighting up the nightside,  
a shade is included as part of the rotating artificial sun system. 
   So where should we put our new World? If you're like me, you will 
want it very far from Earth. The first  
candidate places are at the Sun-Earth L4 and L5 points, where it will 
stay put without any control needed.  
These places are 60 degrees ahead and 60 degrees behind Earth, in Earth 
orbit. This gives us a fairly  
comfortable 150 million kilometers between ourselves and the nearest 
politician, but we can do better: there  
is no reason to remain in Earth's orbit, either literally or 
figuratively [Heinlein]. 
    Moving closer to the Sun has the advantage of increased solar 
energy density, and not much else. Out  
past Mars are the serious resources of the solar system, and of  the 
rest of the Universe. Jupiter's L4 and L5  
(also called Trojan and Greek Points) points are great candidates; they 
are easy to get to from Jupiter's  
moons and from the main Asteroid Belt, and also have the distinct advantage of holding substantial materials  
in their sway already, perhaps even rivaling the Main Asteroid Belt itself [Lewis]. They are part of the "high  
ground" of the Solar System, more easily defended against attacks from Earth's gravity well. An interesting  
property of these Trojan Points is their extent- they have a very large volume of space around them in which  
objects can "orbit" without leaving the vicinity of the Point. 
Asteroids can be brought into the Point,  
flattened out and made to orbit the New World, if needed for passive 
defense against matter and energy  
beams. 
    Maintaining a large fleet of space warships is much easier on this 
type of world, as the gravity well is  
much smaller. A ship can leave the Spaceworld with only a few meters 
per second needed for escape  
velocity. Military bases placed on the spin axis can service quite 
large warships using raw materials from the  
Solar System at large, and finished products from the New World. Access 
to the base is a matter of a quick  
elevator ride from the surface. The aforementioned terawatt of electric 
power for lighting can also be  
diverted to some nasty-big lasers and such, big enough to vaporize a 
ship many millions of kilometers away. 
    This Spaceworld is curiously resistant to nuclear weapons. With a 
safety factor greater than three, a hole  
blown in the side would not enlarge, and the outgassing of the 
atmosphere would carry away the fallout (at  
some point the hole should be repaired to keep the rest of the 
atmosphere in). 
    A nanotech 'cordon sanitaire' can be established around a 
space-based habitat much more readily than on a  
planet by tracking and identifying all objects in its vicinity. 
Microscopic nanoprobes might be dealt with by  
maintaining an ionizing field around the habitat, such as a scanning 
ultraviolet laser, perhaps backed up with  
a layer of free floating "nanobot-phages" orbiting just outside the 
World. 
   A magnetic field can be added to this world without much further 
effort by wrapping superconducting  
wire or film around the circumference to form a current loop [Lorrey]. 
The resulting magnetic dipole field  
would deflect the solar wind much like Earth's magnetic field protects us from these charged particles. On  
Earth, these particles are entrained in the magnetic field, bouncing back and forth between the North and  
South Poles, creating the Auroral Lights. The cylinder has no atmosphere at its "poles", so the particles can  
either be allowed to circulate through the center of the cylinder (forming a sort of ionosphere), or collected  
and stopped by charged plates at either end of the spin axis. 
   Well, that was a lot of effort, but how much is a World worth? 
 
Space Warfare 
 
   So. How do we defend all this stuff? You might have noticed above 
that practically everything mentioned 
in the Interworld Rapid Transit System [Bishop] works just as well when 
"fired in anger". The traffic 
control, pointing, tracking and ranging systems, as well as Smart 
Pellets, are virtually identical to those 
required for space warfare. Indeed, I got the idea for Smart Pellets 
from the "Smart Rock" kinetic kill 
projectiles of the US Star Wars program. 
    A really large Spaceworld, like the "Open Air Habitat" would have 
production, material and energy 
resources far in excess of Earth's, along with perhaps an "Interworld 
Rapid Transit" Station or some other 
type of spacecraft support systems at its disposal...

Yes, but in a sense both would be wrong, because 'A' doesn't mean the same

Being A is now so different from what being A was before that it would

Attempt to confuse all observers as soon as possible about who is who,
and lie vigorously.  This assumes that it is relevant ( as in #2 ) and 
further assumes that there is an advantage in being the original.

In the absence of #2-type laws it seems best to attempt to negotiate an 
immediate non-competition agreement with your duplicate, because he
has the same potential problems that you do.  If seems also useful
( if one's concience permits ) to conspire to commit some profitable
crimes, because of the new alibi possibilities.

You are correct that this is an emotional heuristic, quite a knee jerker too.
I understand the connection here, and agree that there is a connection "in
mind"
between transhumanism and eugenics. However, the Nazi comparison is one that
we might want to handle delicately and swiftly. Facism and (conquering)
imperialism both have no place in future politics and do not support economic
freedom nor individual freedom, two very fundamental stepping stones to any
sort of "Politi-Extropica" . Making people better is only *one* very
fundamental aspect of Extropy, and to take what you say one step further, not
only do we oppose 'killing off inferior people', we oppose force of any sort,
even for inferiors, and even "for thier own good".

I still take exception to placement of objects within the ring, unless
they are held in place by spoke wires made of monofilament. THese should
be numerous for redundancies sake.

One thing I'm interested in checking out is the possiblity of using
Raisch and Puthoff's ZPF theories to build virtual lenses in space,
which could be used out at distances like that described to focus large
volumes of solar flux to provide not only illumination for the ring, but
concentrated light for power needs. Such lenses would be of zero "true"
mass, merely warps in the time-space fabric that is the Zero Point Field
that act to bend the sunlight to the designers needs.

The main distinction to make between us and them, is to distinguish what
is meant by "improving people". Nazis and their ilk had a preset
template of their "ubermann". We do not. We see each individual having
the power to determine for themselves what they need to do to meet their
own definition of "improvement". WHther one person wishes to be a pure
upload, while someone else may want to morph themselves into a catwoman,
or an aquaton, it does nto matter, except to the individual. It is this
central characteristic that inextricably links transhumanism to
libertarianism, and why we cannot separate the two, unless we wish to
pursue the sort of corporate communal overmind that would be a nazis
dream.

Yes, perhaps I could have worded that better.  How about "...cause me to
question my previous reasoning from the same observations..."?  Of course
beliefs change with new inputs, including new methods of reasoning that
might come along.  We then apply our current best tools of reason to the
facts as we see them, and draw tentative conclusions with which to make
decisions.  But sometimes the conclusions we reach differ from those
reached by someone else from the same premises and data.  In that case,
one can either question the other's reasoning, your own reasoning, or
the data.  There are a precious few people whose disagreement with me
would motivate me to examine my own reasoning; it is those people to
whom I referred.

I too support others who excel /for the right reasons/.  I spend probably
$200 a month on books, but only those of authors who have earned my
respect, and I want them to earn my money as well.  But I would no sooner
buy a book by Jeremy Rifkin than I would castrate myself with a spoon,
despite the fact that his sales outnumber those of, say, Friedman.  So
success, by itself, is no measure of intellectual worth.  I do not "put
down" successful authors, necessarily; I just refuse to grant them the
accolades for it that others seem to. 

The same with academic degrees.  Knowing that someone has a Ph.D. is
precisely as valuable to me as knowing that they own a cat.  I have
nothing against cats--I have one myself.  I have nothing against those
with degrees--my father and most of my friends have them.  I just don't
give that piece of information any weight in judging the intelligence
or character of anyone.  Actual accomplishments impress me more than
empty credentials.  Getting a degree is hard work, but work does not
equal accomplishment or ability or character.

Before you ask, no, I don't have a degree, though I have attended
college off and on.  I've been programming computers for 17 years, and
never found any need to bother.  Yes, this probably affects my opinion.

I think you are making a serious cognitive error here.  Briefly: the
fact that you make final decisions is irrelevant to the weight you
should give to the opinions of others.  This weight can be objectively
calculated in principle, and is typically large, as Damien S. said.

Since your post was endorsed by Michael Lorrey, ShawnJ99@aol.com, and
GeoffCobb@aol.com, I'll try to explain in some detail.

Imagine we have some set of alternative theories of how the world is,
and also have some set of relevant evidence.  Now consider asking:
does this evidence lend support to one of these theories relative to
the others?  If so, how much support?

There is relatively widespread agreement that the answers to these
questions are not a matter of personal taste.  Roughly: each
theory can be used to generate expectations regarding the sorts of
possible evidence one is likely to observe, and theories which suggest
a higher likelihood for observing the actual evidence are better
supported.  Bayesian decision theory is an exact framework for making
such calculations, but there are many other approaches which roughly
agree in the standard cases.

Regarding what weight to give to the opinions of others, the key point
is:  opinions are just another kind of evidence.  To decide how much
support any one person's opinion gives to any one theory, you ask:
it this theory were true, how likely would it be for this person to
come to this opinion.  If this likelihood is relatively high, this
opinion supports this theory.  This degree of support is not a matter
of personal taste, nor does it depend on your level of "responsibility".

Of course people are complicated, so there are a lot of details to
consider in estimating such chances.  You should in principle consider
whether this person just likes to be a contrarian or a conformist,
whether you expect them to make many or few cognitive mistakes in this
area, how much weight they give to other people's opinions, what other
evidence they may have seen, whether they might want to deceive you
and others regarding their opinions, and whether they know of your
opinion.  Of course you may well want to use heuristic approximations
here in place of detailed exact calculations.

There are lots of explicit models of situations like these, most but
not all using Bayesian inference, and the robust result is that other
people's opinions should be given a lot of weight, typically much more
than the weight given to your personal experience.  In fact, it turns
out to be difficult to explain persistent divergence in opinions. 

For example: should your first vehicle purchase be a car, pickup, or
motorcycle?  Well you might rent/borrow one of each for a week to try
out, but even then there's a lot you wouldn't know about how
comfortable they'd feel after a year of driving, how much trouble they
are to keep up, how dangerous they are, etc.  You are well advised to
take the vehicle choices of more experienced people around you as a
strong clue regarding these uncertainties.

Or consider the winner's curse in common value auctions (such as for
oil tracts or art for resale).  You're a fool not to consider the fact
that winning the auction tells you that everyone else made a lower bid
than you, and likely has a lower estimate of the item's value.

Similarly, while you might abstractly reason that "paternalism",
forcing people to do things good for them, vs. just advising them, is
a bad idea, the experience of billions of parents, teachers,
employers, and local governments of thousands of years contains much
relevant information.  Why do they continue in this practice if it is
worse than an obvious and widely tried alternative?  ("For their own
benefit, not for those they `help'", is not a good answer.  I have a
paper on a better answer.)

1) Quantum uploads

What are the implications for mind uploading if some form of
Q-mind theory is true? (e.g. the Penrose-Hameroff idea that
mental states are the quantum states of entangled sets of
neural microtubule electrons). As far as I can tell,
uploading, copying, and so forth are all still possible,
but there are all sorts of uniquely quantum-mechanical
considerations.

There is something called the No-Clone Theorem, which says 
that there is no device able to make a perfect copy of an 
*arbitrary* quantum state. However, there are ways to make 
copies of particular states, and there are universal copiers 
(only theoretical at this point) which only produce bounded errors.

When I started thinking about this, I guessed that there would 
be two ways to copy a quantum state, a "classical" way and a 
"quantum" way. The classical way would be to measure the original, 
storing that information in some classical medium, and then
reconstructing the quantum state in some new substrate by 
consulting the classical blueprint.  (The original need not be 
destroyed by this process, if "protective" or "non-demolition" 
measurements are possible.)

The quantum way would avoid measurement and simply transfer the 
information via quantum interactions; an example would be quantum 
teleportation.

Conveniently, Seth Lloyd has just put out a preprint 
("Quantum controllers for quantum systems, quant-ph/9703042)
which defines exactly this distinction (he calls it
semiclassical control vs quantum control). A quantum controller
can extract information from one quantum system and pass it
to another without disrupting the first.

I suspect that all the discoveries being made in quantum 
computation, etc, will be very relevant to uploaders.
The quant-ph archive at http://xxx.lanl.gov is the place
where all the new announcements appear.



2) Fast minds

Long ago John Clark said that the first uploading would be an
evolutionary divide, for reasons which everyone probably appreciates -
an upload is expected by many to think orders of magnitude faster
than a biological human.

I've thought about this ever since, and so far I've thought of
three ways in which a fast mind might come about.

i) Emulation, i.e. uploading. Someone's brain is scanned and
  emulated in a faster computational medium.

ii) Acceleration. The human brain is made to function at greater
  and greater speeds (for example, through introduction of
  new nanostructures into neurons).

iii) Invention. A "de novo" mind is created in a new medium,
  rather than simply copied from the biological. This category
  includes "invention" through digital evolution (genetic
  algorithms, etc).

It seems to me that the third path is the most likely - perhaps
as a matter of market competition, and then natural selection,
amongst Internet agent software. The third path could involve
partial emulation, in the sense that neural architectures
discovered in biological brains might be found useful and
incorporated into software or hardware - but it seems unlikely
to me that all the conditions necessary for human mind uploading
will be met before there are "human-level" agents that have
evolved online.

ZPF is "known" science. I suggest you do a websearch for Dr. H. E.
Puthoff. He and Raisch are working at Lockheed on developing practical
applications of the ZPF. Imagining virtual lenses based on their
theories is at least as practical as imagining 2000 mile diameter
ringworlds built from buckytubes, when the biggest buckytube we have now
is less than a few micrometers long. At least we know from astronomical
observations that such phenomena already exist in nature, while there
are no natural buckytube structures that we know of beyond mere
molecules.

I thought this was the crux of Robin's post, and it is a very surprising
result to me.  However it seems hard to frame the question cleanly.  One
could ask, in most areas where there is a difference of opinion among
people, is the majority or the minority more likely to be correct?  It
would not be surprising if the answer were that the majority was more
often right.  However this would not establish that I should give more
weight to others than to my own experience, because I may not be typical
of average minority members.  I'd like to hear more about the kinds of
reasoning or studies which lead to the conclusion above.

As Robin indicates in his last sentence, there is even the germ of a
contradiction here:

If the opinions of other people are really very valuable and generally
an accurate indicator of reality, then I should be well to copy many or
most of their opinions.  In particular, I should copy people's habits
of giving credence to other people's opinions.  But, it seems to me that
most people aren't that easily persuaded by other people's opinions when
they disagree on some issue.  So if I copy that behavior then I shouldn't
rely that much on other people's opinions, contradicting the conclusion
that I should.

Of course, this rests on my claim that most people prefer to decide
for themselves rather than listen to other people.  It could be that I
have mostly associated with individuals who are unusual in this regard,
or I could simply be mistaken in my perceptions.  Perhaps I am focusing on
just those areas where they differ, ignoring the vast body of accumulated
knowledge which everyone shares.  Or maybe people like to exaggerate
their uniqueness and downplay the extent to which they follow the crowd,
for cultural reasons.

Funny how none of those pages mention that he's the same Dr. Puthoff
who claimed that Uri Geller was a genuine clairvoyant, /after/ his
studies with Targ had been debunked by CSICOP.  He might be right 
this time, but given his reputation of being about as credible as
Fleishman and Pons, I want to see it done by someone else first.

That is indeed an error, but not a serious one.  Let me correct: I have
the final responsibility for my decisions, so I am obligated to use the
best methods I can to choose a course of action.  Independently of that,
I also happen to give little weight to the opionions of others, which
may or may not be a mistake on my part. 

I will also admit that it is quite possible that the number of
decisions I make using conscious reasoning is numerically overwhelmed
by those I make sub-consciously by simply following whatever memes
happen to floating in the soup.  I do not stop to reason the way I
walk, or the way I open a door, or the way I reach for something on
a shelf.  I suppose if I cared about such things I could study the
orthopedics involved and find effective ways, but I don't.  I just
do it the way I do it.  In that sense, it is possible that I /do/
in fact "listen" to the opinions of others in the way I hold a phone
to my ear, because I subconsciously do it the way I see it done.
But in the subset of decisions I make consciously, I do not.

That imples some method of determining which decisions call for my
attention and which do not.  I don't think I have any clear view
of that, so that decision seems to be in the automatic set.  I'll
have to think about that.  I can certainly imagine heuristics: how
large an effect will this decision have on my future?  How likely
do I think it is that the majority opinion might be wrong?  It may
be that the questions I have chosen to examine closely in my life are
precisely those for which following the majority has failed me, so
my selective memory tends to devalue majority opinion as a result.

There are many complications here as well.  What is the likelihood
that /any/ theory of the set is correct?  All of human knowledge
from all of history doesn't amount to a hill of beans compared to
what there is to know.  Also, how likely is it that human perception
is wired to make evaluating a particular piece of evidence difficult
(e.g., our motion-detection circuitry fooling us into believing that
the images we see on the movie screen are actually moving).  And how
likely is it that human psychology will predispose us to believe
things in spite of evidence (a widespread phenomenon which I can't
possibly justify discounting).  You mention others as well, such as
the possibility of deliberate deception.

Doesn't this treat "evidence" as if it were a continuous quantity?
As if it just piles up in front of each theory to give it weight (in
fact, the very phrase "weight of evidence" assumes this).  But history
and experience show us that not all evidence is created equal: one
measurement outweighs 1000 expert opinions.  If your mathematical
model shows that generally taking seriously the opinions of others 
tends to reliably steer you toward theories supported by the most
evidence, that is no use if the theory with centuries of history comes
against a single experiment that not everyone has seen yet, but that
inescapably discredits the majority.  Centuries of the practical use
of Newtonian mechanics were no match for a single Michelson-Morley.

In the marketplace, opinions /are/ value, because that's what is being

other issues.

(1) All the alternatives have /not/ been tried.  (2) Existing practice
is a demonstrable failure in many cases.  (3) They may keep practicing
it out of fear, psychological predisposition, insufficient knowledge
of available alternatives, incomplete understanding of the "evidence",
predisposition to favor the status quo and ignore or deny its failures,
and other reasons.  (4) By your reasoning, nothing new and innovative
would ever happen, because that /requires/ imagining that every other
opinion on the planet might be wrong.  Human progress depends on such
precious arrogance.

And if the chamber had cylindrical symmetry you could not tell if you were  
the copy or not. 

Suppose that one second after you first saw your double, a bullet hit him in 
the back of the head and his brain exploded. Regardless of whether you are 
the copy or the original you still have all your memories and you still have 
a feeling on continuity with your past, just as you do now, so nobody died. 
If two phonographs are synchronized and playing the same symphony and you 
destroy one machine, the music does not stop.

I think our key disagreement is that you think we are an object, I think we 
are a process. I can make an exact copy of a this post, lots of copies may 
exist in the world, but they are all the same post. You can delete your copy, 
but I still have mine so the post still exists. It would be crazy to say 
that in order to get  the most out of it you should only read the original, 
there is no  original, and information does not occupy a unique position in 
space. A brick  can't be copied exactly, at least not yet, so it doesn't 
have these properties, thus it makes sense to talk about two different bricks.  
The fundamental question you have to ask yourself is; are we (our subjective 
existence) more like bricks or symphonies?  

I'm not a thing. The word "I" should not be a pronoun but a adjective,   
an adjective modifying matter. I am not matter, I am  the way matter reacts   
when it's organized  in certain complex  ways.

Why?  One billionth of a nanosecond is far too short for human consciousness 
to detect. For people "now" is about a second long.
                    

        >Location and structure is used to presently distinguish between them.


You're in a different position than you were 5 minutes ago, but presumably  
your identity has not changed. Trying to develop a theory of identity or  
consciousness based on position is a bad idea. Where does consciousness exist?  
Where does "red" exist or "fast" or "beautiful" or the number "13"?  These  
questions have no answer because they make no sense.

An atom is not a bag of sub-atomic particles that occasionally releases its 
contents, that would be like saying somewhere in the human body is a 
"word bag" that gradually releases its contents as language, and when it's 
empty we become mute.

If you're right then The Identity Of Indiscernibles is false and  so is most 
Science done in the last 90 years, because the foundation of modern physics 
is the idea of Exchange Forces, and that is a direct  consequence of The 
Identity Of Indiscernibles.

The first philosopher to examine the principle of "The Identity Of  
Indiscernibles" was Leibniz 300 years ago. He said that if there is no way  
to find a difference between two things then they are identical and switching  
the position of the objects does not change the physical state of the system.  
Until the 20th century this idea had no observable consequences because 
nobody could find two things exactly alike. Things changed dramatically when  
it was discovered that atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart.  

Suppose you're looking at two electrons, you may think that you can find a  
difference in them, because one is here and the other one is way over there,   
but can you really? How do you know the particles are not changing positions?    
Would the system be any different if they did? By asking these sort of  
questions and using The Identity Of Indiscernibles we can derive The Pauli 
Exclusion Principle, and that is the basis of the periodic table,  and that  
is the basis of chemistry, and that is the basis of life. We can also 
discover the fact that there are two classes of particles, bosons like  
photons and  fermions  like electrons.                             

Experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function  F(x) of a particle,  
we can only measure the intensity of the wave function [F(x)]^2 because  
that's probability and probability we can measure. P(x) =[F(x)]^2 is the  
probability of finding two particles x  distance apart. Now let's exchange 
the  position of the particles, the distance between them was x1 - x2 = x is 
now  x2  - x1 = -x . The Identity Of Indiscernibles tells us that because the  
two particles are the same, no measurable change has been made , no change in 
probability , so P(x) = P(-x) . From this we see that [ F(x) ]^2 = [ F(-x)]^2  
so the Quantum wave function can be an even function [ F(x) = +F(-x) ] or an  
odd function  [F(x) = -F(-x) ] , remember (-1)^2 = (+1)^2 =1. 

Both solutions have physical significance, particles with integer spin,  
bosons, have even wave functions, particles with half integer spin , fermions,  
have odd wave functions. If we put two fermions like electrons in the same  
place then the distance between them, x , is zero and because they must  
follow the laws of odd wave functions , F(0)  = -F(0)  but the only number  
that is it's own negative is zero so  F(0)  =0 . What this means is that the  
wave function goes to zero and  [F(x)]^2  goes to zero , thus the probability  
of finding two electrons in the same spot is zero, and that is  The Pauli 
Exclusion  Principle.

Clearly, then, this theory has two *major* defects.

a)  The population as a whole is often wrong on major, simple issues (e.g.
cloning)

b) Persistent divergence is downright ubiquitous

The obvious conclusion is that most if not all people do not use even a
passable approximation of Bayesian inference.  I'd say most if not all people
have their opinions driven by memetic replication (as exemplified by fashion
and religion) and not a passable Bayesian approximation.

>From what I've read on Bayesian inference, judgements not based on Bayesian

most people are using an objectively inferior inference process, what does
that do to the value of other people's opinions for a rational Bayesian?

Interestingly, science seems to conform to the predictions of this "community
of Bayesian agents" model much better than society as a whole.  Persistent
disagreement is common only when evidence is scanty and it's hard to think of
examples where the scientific community sticks to objectively bad theories
(as opposed to holding them in the past when evidence is inferior).  This
would indicate that scientists, at least while working in their fields, are
more "rational" than the population as a whole in the sense that they are
closer to Bayesian agents.

The only judgments where non-Bayesian inferences are "objectively bad"
in your sense are ones that are trivially simple and contrived to fit
the mathematical models exactly.  For example, gambling.  Let us
imagine a bag filled with red and black balls.  We are asked to bet
on whether a ball drawn from the bag will be red or black, but we are
not told beforehand how many of each are in it.  After each draw, the
ball is replaced and we make another bet.  The conditions of the game
are given and fixed, and our observations are trusted--guarantess that
most of reality doesn't give us.  Under these conditions, a bettor
using Bayesian inference to infer the number of red and black balls
will, in the long run, always make more money than someone using any
other method (we are also given that cheating is impossible).  Only
in that limited sense is Bayes "ideal", but that tells us little that
is useful; it only tells us that this formula works where we have
defined the conditions for it to work, nothing more.

By what rational means do we apply the precise mathematical model of
Bayes to items in the real world, especially when those items are as
obscenely complex and chaotic as human ideas?  Is that foundation any
stronger than our earlier application of the calculus of Newton to the
real world of gravitation, a much simpler mapping?  This is just a
dressed-up version of the problem of induction.  Why do think induction
works?  Because it usually does--an inductive argument.  If we are to
judge whether or not Bayesian inference can be applied to certain parts
of the real world, what criteria will we use to judge the evidence?  If
you can offer me nothing better than Bayesian inference from that
evidence, then I am unsatisfied.

I had heard that he's dabbled in psi stuff, mostly as a result of being
in the Bohm camp of quantum physics for several years, but his physics
work has been rock solid and is well respected in the field. The fact
that the same company that controlls Area 51 also has been backing his
research is that some interesting connections are starting to come to
light. In the papers out on the web, Hal has been actually a bit in the
background, while Raisch has been the main name behind the work,
probably as a result of concerns about his psi connections.

As an AI researcher, I have to respond to this.

1. Robots are not cross-country drivers.  A few vehicles exist which
can drive on a clearly-marked straightway on a bright sunny day at
speeds of (last I heard) up to 50mph.  This is a far, far cry from
being able to drive cross-country.

2. Runners: There exist legged robots that don't fall down and
don't (usually) run into things.  You can't tell them where to go
and have them get there, as far as I know.  They operate on reflexes;
they have no navigational ability.

3. Janitors:  This is fiction.  You may have gotten the idea because
the robot competitions at AAAI usually have a trashcan-finding competition,
in which robots from different universities and research centers compete
to successfully identify trashcans in an "office environment" (all walls
same color, uniform lighting, no posters, nothing on the floor, no people).
They do poorly.

4. AI can follow a conversation better than some humans can:  Only if
by "some humans" you mean people with severe brain damage or people who
don't speak the language in question.  :)  Demos are deceiving.
Most AI systems are designed to perform on a specific set of demos.
Unfortunately, continued funding depends on impressing people who don't
know anything about AI in a fifteen-minute presentation.  "Demo or die."
This emphasizes appearances that are skin-deep over true advances.
Never believe a demo until you read the source code.

Of course neither are the same person that existed in that past,

I have already agreed to that with my self.

What do you think actors are for? ;-)
Actually I do not commit crimes.

as I have jurisdiction over my self 
and legislate and execute laws freely.
It is impossible for me to break my law.
My law is the law of nature.

Let me clarify.  I quote from Gould, "Mismeasure of Man" (p.422)

  "The egqalitarian end did not exist for the policymakers of Darwin's
   day. All were racists by modern standards.  On that spectrum, those we
   now judge most harshly urged that inferiority be used as an excuse for
   dispossession and slavery, while those we most admire in restrospect
   urged a moral principle of equal rights and nonexploitation, whatever
   the biological status of people."

Carlyle and his socialist allies I am referring to were "Brutal"
racists, advocating slavery and cruel treatment of blacks, using
language that is quite shocking to the modern ear.  My understanding
is that Marx was much more moderate than this.

You will not accept the reasonableness of Bayesian inference for the
purpose of a discussion on another topic, unless someone here will
summarize for you the vast literature on the normative arguments for
Bayesian inference, and solve the problem in induction to your
satisfaction in the process?  Come now, your behavior here seems a
good example of the error of refusing to give any weight to the
opinions of others, unless they present to you, at your convenience
and in a form you can quickly understand, all the evidence behind
their opinions.

I agree that in the real world applying Bayesian methods is hideously
complex, with so many variable to consider (observational weighting,
observers bias, publication bias, experimental error, non-quantifiable
information, etc.)  But look at it this way: We have to use some kind of
inference system.  What's the alternative?

Also, the case against non-Bayesian methods is a bit stronger than you put
it.  If somebody is using non-Bayesian methods it is always possible to cook
up a set of bets such that the agent will accept each one but when you add
all the bets together the risks cancel each other out and the non-Bayesian
agent is guaranteed a loss.  This is called "Dutch book".  It can be applied
to any system where the bets are quantifiable, which includes basically
anything where money is involved (insurance, futures, stocks) and not just
simple probablistic situations.  It's not that a Bayesian outcompetes a
non-Bayesian in simple probability problems; it's that a Bayesian can take a
non-Bayesian to the cleaners whenever money must be staked on an unclear
outcome.

The real-world defense against Dutch book is that in order to lure somebody
into Dutch book you must be able to predict their inference process.

I /do/ accept that such inference is "reasonable" in many circumstances,
and that opinions of others can be valuable.  I simply refuse to evade
or deny those cases where they fail miserably, and therefore cannot
elevate such methods to a general principle.  They are good tricks,
and I use them where appropriate, but I judge where they are appropriate
by other means.  And I am familiar with some of the literature here, so
I don't expect you to cite every book.  I'm just trying to get you to
see beyond the books--to see for yourself that it is /necessary/ to go
beyond the opinions of others.

Yes.  Relative weight of evidence = log likelihood ratio, which adds.

Of course evidence varies in strength.  If you happen to have
available a particularly strong peice of evidence which no one else
has yet seen, then of course this may outweigh all else.  But what if 
all those experts have seen this new experiment and their opinions
have not much changed.  The question then is:  how sure are you that
you have not missed or misunderstood some aspect of the experiment
that seems to you to offer such strong support?

But you are just as likely to object to this common practice out of
fear, predispositions, etc.  If anyone anywhere is actually looking at
relevant evidence with some understanding, why is it so much more
likely to be just you, rather than some influential fraction of these
billions?

This is simply not true.  Majority opinion can favor experimentation
and investigation into alternatives.

But typicially you will be typical :-).  Of course if you have some
unique info that others don't have, they can expect that your specific
opinion must differ from their uncertain intermediate opinion.  The
hard (but not impossible) thing to explain is how they might know
you have access to unique info, and know your specific opinion, and
yet still choose to disagree.

Is opinion divergence on matters of fact, where each side knows of the
other's opinion, really ubiquitious among ordinary people?  I'm not so sure.
Consider these alternative explanations for common apparent divergence:
1. Disputes over values using the language of disputes over facts. 
2. Disputes most people think are re values, but others know are re facts.
3. Incentives to signal no fear of crowd, ability to think by self
4. Forums biased toward presenting (clear n vivid) extreme views 
5. Advocates with interests, eg lawyers, rewards to early idea advocates
6. A minority who like to shock & be contrary
7. A minority who consistently make the error of ignoring other's opinions
8. Random cognitive errors among pitoval people who won't revisit issues.
9. Ignorance that there are reasonable people with differing opinions

Actually, the phychology of science evidence seems pretty conclusive

Cloning is neither simple nor major for most people, and the issues on
which opinions diverge are tied up in important ways with questions of
value, not just fact.

Individuals have long been knowingly making decisions that influence
the amount of government they have, and its degree of centrality.
Popular support has long been a key resource in political battles.
Unless you think the benefits of anarchy only appear when you reach

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Pat Fallon writes:

"Functioning markets existed for foreign authors in the U.S. in the 19th
century. The free market paid royalties to British authors even though
those authors received no copyright protection in the US until the
extension of copyright protection to foreigners in 1891. The American
publishers paid the royalty in order to obtain advance galleys, even
though they themselves had no legal protection against competitors who
could legally copy their new releases and sell them. In the absence of
state protection the authors and publishers used several voluntary and
contractual arrangements for the internalization of externalities."

There is an important difference between the situation then and now. With
19th c. printing technology, there were large fixed costs and sizable time
lags. The authorized publisher, who got the manuscript in the U.S. before
it was published in Britain, could pay his fixed costs out of the early
sales. A pirate would have to duplicate those fixed costs. The authorized
publisher could then issue a "fighting edition"--a low cost second edition
priced low enough so that the pirate would never make back his costs.

With current printing technology, absent copyright, the pirate's costs are
much lower than the original publisher's, since he can use photo offset or
something similar to free ride on the original publisher's layout,
proofing, etc. So that method doesn't work.

As this example suggests, whether alternatives to IP protection work, and
how well, depends on details of the associated technology. Certainly there
are alternatives. But I don't think one can say, a priori, whether relying
on them will produce plenty of intellectual property, an inefficiently but
not catastrophically low level, or practically none--it depends.

On the subject of first mover advantages, my favorite quote is from
Kipling's "Mary Gloster," possibly his best poem:

"They asked me how I did it and I gave 'em the scripture text
'You keep your light so shining a little ahead of the next,'
They copied all they could copy, but they couldn't copy my mind,
And I left them, sweating and stealing, a year and a half behind."

On the economics of IP protection, people might be interested in my Dayton
Law Review article on Standards, on my web page, and in the discussion of
IP in the lecture notes for my L&E course (current and last quarter's
course visiting at Stanford), also on my web page.

Lee Daniel Crocker writes:

"But as Friedman and others have
shown with more detailed economic analysis, the net gains are
always less than the net losses, because a subsidy changes the
relative value of the commodity subsidized, leading to inefficient
trades in every business affected by that commodity."

It's tricky in the copyright case. You get an inefficiently low level of
production and consumption of those books that are written, since the price
includes royalty although the marginal cost to the author of having one
more copy sold is zero. But you move the number of books written closer to
the efficient level, because you raise the reward to the people who bear
the fixed cost of producing books (author and publisher) closer to its real
value to the users. So you are losing on one margin and gaining on the
other.

In another post he writes:

"I explained that quite clearly many times: if you sell me a product,
then I use the ideas to create a similar one and sell that, then the
government will step in and prevent me from doing so /at my expense/.
Protecting a market at public expense is no less a subsidy than just
writing checks from the public coffers or regulating prices."

I think it is worth distinguishing two features of IP law--the fact that it
protects certain things that may or may not seem like property, and the
fact that enforcement is in part paid for by the government.

Suppose we ignore, for a moment, the question of enforcement cost, and just
ask whether the enforcement itself is a bad thing. One obvious answer is
that IP is a substitute for contractual arrangements that most of us would
approve of if it were practical to enforce them. An author could, after
all, sell his book with an explicit shrink wrap license, binding the buyer
not to reproduce the book, not to permit others to reproduce the book, and
making the buyer liable for damages to the author if his copy does get
reproduced, with or without his permission. If that contract could be
enforced, it would be very much like copyright law. The practical problem
is that when pirate copies get out there is usually no way of proving whose
copy got pirated (a problem that may be soluble for some digital works,
incidentally), and the guilty party, if located, may be judgement proof. So
if one approves of the results that would be produced by such a contractual
regime, if enforceable, it is hard to see why, from a consequentialist
standpoint, one should reject the same results when produced by IP law.

Now bring back in the issue of enforcement cost. Some of that is paid by
the state under the current regime, but not much, since IP is almost
entirely civil, meaning that the enforcement is done mostly at the
plaintiff's expense, although possibly in a subsidized court. But that is
equally true of ordinary property at present, so it isn't a special
argument against IP.

You don't automatically have a right to copy something for your personal
use. But whether something counts as "fair use" depends on a bunch of
different criteria, and a personal use would be more likely to pass the
(very fuzzy) test than a commercial use. So it is some defense, just not by
itself a sufficient defense.

My friend and colleague at Santa Clara, Larry Iannaconne, specializes in
the economic analysis of religion; you might want to look for some of his
articles. I don't know if he has looked at the question of why religion
exists, but he has looked at economic explanations for why religions have
some of the characteristics they do.

Ignorant of it or just not impressed by it?  "Your comments, Copernicus,
suggest that you are ignorant of the vast scholarly literature on the
central place of Earth in the heavens."

I invest my valuable time studying those fields that have been shown
to me to be most useful to my understanding of the nature of things:
evolution, game theory, economics, physics, philosophy, etc.  If I
have missed any works that you consider vital, it is because they have
not convinced me (or those whose opinions I do value) that they are
worth the time.

Why do you simply refuse to accept the fact that in all periods of human
history, the vast hordes of people--including the best minds of each
generation--were simply wrong about most things?  It doesn't mean that
they were irrational, necessarily.  Aristotle was a brilliant man in
his time, and those who chose to accept his ideas did relatively well
compared to those who did not.  But nonetheless, almost everything they
believed was wrong in significant ways.

That's a fair question; you're right, I might possibly be predisposed
or fearful as well.  This is a judgment I simply have to make.  How do
I judge my own ability to evaluate evidence as compared to others?  As
it happens, I honestly believe that I am more capable of reliable
evaluation of evidence than almost everyone I have ever met or read.
That's a personal evaluation, from personal experience, so it is hard
to justify to others, especially those accustomed to deference to
authority (or authorities themselves, like the doctor I once fired).
But it is an evaluation I make without reservation.

If I was standing in a cylinder with a red dot where the original was

It is useless to argue about the design of the replicating chamber

The music from the destroyed machine stops.
I would not like to be the machine that stops playing music.
The symphony of one machine is not the symphony of another.

The music I would have been listening to would have stopped.
It would have become a new sound.
I would not be listening to the same music.
I can distinguish between music in mono and stereo.
Mono is not the same as stereo.

I have tried synchronizing music before.
I've had my fill of DJing and playing with mixing boards.
Different machines play different speeds, different qualities,
different waves, different sounds, different musics.
If I stop spinning and another DJ replaces me

So any copy is not the original 
unless it phases into the original 
which would require it to have occupied the same position in space and time
during it's entire existence.
If I were to copy my self EXACTLY no thing would happen 
because two things can not occupy the same position in spacetime.

I can understand that an original can not remain static

I would like you to prove 
that a thing does not occupy a unique position in spacetime.

By the way, according to the United Nations' 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Article 1:
All human beings are endowed with reason.
There is not a human being which is crazy.

a symphony as such is called free-form jazz.

Sorry, you lost me.
If we are to communicate I suggest converting math into english.
They can be converted.
You are doing alot of things and I don't know y.
There is 100% probability of finding two particles x distance apart 
when x is an unknown.
If you exchange positions 
they are still the same distance from each other, so why bother?
I don't see any change in x 
because I still don't know what x is.
If I do not know what x is 
x might be even, odd, or neither.

You are saying 
when the distance between two things is 0 there are not two things.
I must sincerly agree.
The trick is that you can't put two particles in one spot, 
unless the spot is made of more than one particle.
Particle A = spot B, particle C = spot D.
A+C=B+D (2 particles and 2 spots).
Spots have to be made of something.

Time limits suggest I better wrap up my conversation with Lee Crocker.

extropians) with extreme views, should

Lee responded:

Yes, if you are confident that most people in history were especially
sloppy thinkers, and if you are one of the rare careful thinkers, then
you shouldn't give other's opinions much weight.  But this can be good
advice for at most very few people.

Regarding the claim that most people in history were wrong about most
things, the question is what other cognitive strategy would have
enabled them to be wrong less often.  I claim that for the vast
majority of them, ignoring the opinions of their comtemporaries would
have just made things worse.

Yes, costs are different now.  But so, too, is the value of timeliness, and
for the same reasons.  When it took months to distribute a book, that book
was still "new" to its consumers a year after publication.  In the age
of the photocopier and television, new books, magazines, movies, and other
works lose their novelty that much quicker, and thereby increase the value
of being first to market.  In the age of the Internet, live stock quotes
are very expensive, but 20-minute old stock quotes are free.  Tickets to
live performances or ballgames continue to sell in spite of the fact that
television coverage is so good, because immediacy has value. 

As the artworks themselves grow more complex, access to "source code"
in the loose sense becomes more valuable as well.  This applies not just
to software where the originator can always out-support and out-fix his
competitors without source access, but even to things like movies, where
access to the original uncomposited negatives, unreleased scenes, and
unpublished story line allowed the makers of Star Wars to make millions
with a an improved re-release of a 20-year-old movie.  It is hard to make
that case for books--but even there I can imagine being able to retain
certain information that makes updates easier or makes interviews with
the real author more interesting (and therefore more valuable), or for
having more interactive content somehow (900-number reader polls, etc.)

So yes, technology changes the numbers, but it does so on both the
pro-copyright side and the anti-copyright side.  Does it then make sense
to use law to lock ourselves into a system based on the assumptions of
older technology?

That argument can apply to any government interference in the market.
What one considers an "adequate level" of invention and writing is just
as debateable as what one considers an adequate level of food or
housing.  Libertarians generally concede that free-market solutions
work for all other goods.  Why not for inventions?

Of course, inventions are different--that is the basis of my own
argument in the first place, so I cannot simultaneously say that the
property/idea analogy fails in one argument, then use the same analogy
in this one.  But I think it is still fair to assume on principle
that interference is unnecessary until proven otherwise, and the proof
is just not there.  I understand from your contributions to HPO that
you are less swayed by moral arguments than pragmatic ones, but when
there are moral arguments on both sides, pragmatic arguments on both
sides, and little solid evidence for either, the principle on which
I assume the absence of IP law is not one of libertarian morality,
but just Occam's Razor.

Yes, they were interesting.  Both, though, seemed more to describe how
IP works, and what its effects are likely to be, but neither seemed to
spend any serious effort questioning the idea in the first place.  Which
is fine--I understand that you're somewhat agnostic on the issue.

Agreed.  But there are thousands of other tansactions influenced beyond
those of just book producers and book consumers.  Every cost-shifting
we make effects other choices those individuals might make in their
lives from choosing education to choosing a career to choosing a burial
plot (or cryo-tank, in my case).  I think legal restraint in the absence
of good evidence is called for in this case.

That's a good way to recast the argument: let's assume that the (C) is
just a shortcut for the whole shrink-wrap license version of IP (for the
moment ignoring broadcasts and billboards).  The question then becomes,
Is it in the best interest of authors in general to put the mark on their
books?  This is a much harder question, and if the answer is "yes", then
much of my argument against IP weakens, because I will then have to draw
in enforcement costs and moral arguments and such.  I still believe that
the answer is "no", but it forces me to clarify the benefit more.  A work
to which the (C) is attached will probably increase the /relative, short-
term/ wealth of the author.  That is, he will likely be wealthier as
compared to his neighbor in the year of his book's publication than he
might have been without the (C).  But the /absolute, long-term/ wealth
of the author I believe would still benefit more from leaving the (C) off.
This is because the ability of everyone else in the economy to exploit
the work without restraint in ways he might not even have thought of, or
ways he might not understand or approve of and so would fail to license,
would improve the whole economy the  well beyond what relative gain he might
have enjoyed from protection, by lowering the price and raising the
quality of everything he buys, and speeding the discovery of new things.

This is a psychological dilemma: we /feel/ more wealthy if it is
relative to others at the same time, but absolute wealth is what we
actually have to spend.  I suspect this is the motivation of many
attempts to close market entry, like licensing and regulation.

With these contentions I have little disagreement, including that now would
be a good time to wrap things up.  Thank you for the exercise, and if you
have any particular books in mind that you think I may have missed, I am
happy to entertain recommendations (but please, please, not _The Fourth

"Proof" is never going to be there.  If this is your position, you
needn't concern yourself with all these economic details.  

There must be economic models somewhere which imply that states should
provide food and housing.  If the existence of models on both sides of
an issue implied we could conclude nothing about that issue, then
economic modeling would be pretty useless.  The point is that there
are widely accepted standards for judging which models are more
reasonable.  Some assumptions are more reasonable than others, and
some modeling techniques suggest less robust results than others.

The model David Friedman offered which may suggest state support for
IP seems more reasonable to me than any model I've every heard of
regarding state provided housing and food.  A more plausible model
implies a stronger case for the model implications.

Well, yes, it is ubiquitous.  For starters, a large percentage of the US
population believes the Bible is *literally* true, including such patently
ridiculous ideas as the world being created only 6,000 years ago.  Most
people think that a die is less likely to come up 6 if it has come up 6's the
last 3 times.  Many people think that the Social Security Trust fund is
significant when compared with Social Security's debt.  Most people think
that when they buy a house they're "building equity", when in reality 98% of
what they pay goes to the bank.  Most people believe that the greatest danger
to their children is posed by strangers (when children are molested,
kidnapped or killed, it's almost always friends or family).  I could go on
forever like this.

Further, look at the vehemence with which people defend their religious and
political views.  Generally speaking, these aren't matters of fact as
evidence is scanty, but people sure act like they are.  You're currently
arguing with some of the list anarchists over just such an issue.

This is your best example.  Here one is tempted to postulate broken

These are cases where the public thinks one thing, and experts think
another.  Here it is not clear that the public knows of the expert's
opinion.  Without that, it is not an example of the phenomena at issue.

Although I haven't participated, I have enjoyed the IP discussion.

Lee's argument for leaving the (C) off could work in some cases, but
probably not in many others.  It has to be the case that the extra
distribution which the works would receive by being unrestricted would
have considerable benefit.  This benefit has to be great enough that,
even though it is probably spread out through the whole society, that
portion which applies to the original author of the works will be greater
than what he would have received had he controlled the distribution.

An example of this might be some of the Gnu software.  Perhaps the
authors of the Gnu C compiler receive more direct benefit from the existence
of programs built using that compiler than they would have received had
they charged for it.

(Even in this case, I am doubtful.  Professional programmers make $50K
and up, and there are many, many man-years of work in that software.
The software available only because gcc is free would have to be worth
perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars to each of the main creators
of gcc.)

But this is an extreme case, a very widely used utility.  Most IP is
simply not that useful.  Works of fiction and art are not going to feed
back much tangible benefit to their creators.  Even most patents aren't
going to change the world to the extent that the creator will have a
noticeably easier life once everyone can use his patent for free.  For
them, it would seem that the best course is to restrict distribution
so that they can charge more for their works.

I think it's quite germane.  The point is that most people are using "broken"
cognitive thought processes (i.e. they're not acting at all like Bayesian
agents) and that when they consult other people's opinion they consult other
people (the public as a whole) who also are mostly not acting like Bayesian
agents.  So their opinions are not well-formed, and are not good evidence.  

Many of the elements I quoted involve information which is quite easy to
research and which is genuinely relevant to ordinary people.  My point is
that people generally do not act like good Bayesian agents in usual
circumstances.  I see no reason why experts in general are any different.  My
impression of scientists is that they mostly learn to be passable Bayesian
agents by having their ideas repeatedly disproved until they learn to
approach even plausible, compelling ideas with scepticism.  In the social
sciences and humanities this school of hard knocks really only applies to a
few fairly quantitative subspecialties.

I should point out that Gnu software is hideously restricted--it is the
farthest thing from my vision, and that he touts "freedom" with it is
unpardonable hypocrisy.  Stallman is a socialist merely trading one set
of chains for another.  Gnu software is subject to a restrictive license
that forbids many uses, most of which would be the natural uses to which
a commercial enterprise would otherwise put it.

This brings to mind an interesting question.  Is the clone to be held
responsible for crimes (real crimes, like murder) which were committed by the
"original" sometime just prior to duplication?  For example, if I murdered my
wife (I wouldn't & I'm not currently married, but for the sake of an
example...), and then I duplicated myself, and then the law enforcement
officers (whatever kind then exists) arrive to arrest the perpatrator, who do
they arrest?  I ask because if the answer is that only the original is
arrested, then criminal types by the dozens would flock to duplication
chambers everywhere, as to avoid (at least on one line of existence)
prosicution.  On the other hand, if both the "original" and the cloned copy
were to be prosicuted, then they would need to be put on trial together, a
"strange" arrangement.  Any comments or answers?

On another note, I believe the entire idea of punishment as it is known today
will one day become obsolete.  When you "punish" someone, it does not improve
or change the crime that has been committed.  The real answer, I believe,
lies is changing the fundamental reason the crime was committed (I mean real
crime - force, fraud, coercion), thus preventing future crimes, while
maintaining the person's ability to be a productive individual.  In our
techno-advanced future, these crimes will be eliminated by neural
restructuring or some such thing.  This may bring up the question of prisons
in the future, before everyone has been "uncriminalized", would it be
permissable, or objectively OK, to make neural modifications by force to
criminals?  This would be preferable, I believe, to death or prison.  I hope
this brings many comments.  Thanks for listening.

Reminds me of a humorous sf story I read a few years back where an 
amoeboid alien escaped punishment this way (it was guilty of selling 
pornographic pictures to earthly biologists who used them to illustrate 
mitosis in their textbooks). Both the resulting individuals claimed 
innocence, and pointed out that they were underage. 

In a more serious vein (?), I think that in a society where you can copy
yourself (most likely among infomorphs like uploads) guilt and property
will have to be redefined a bit. My suggestion is that when you copy
yourself, your possessions should be divided equitably between the copies
(it might be possible to "testament" property in more complex
arrangements, or for the copies to pool their resources into a collective
if they want) and social contracts such as marriage would be
re-negotiated. All copies would be equally responsible for the actions in
their shared past, so all should be punished for such crimes.

So you admit that they are doing well with the info they have
immediately available, but that they are non-Bayesian regarding the
amount of research they do?  "Easy to research" is relative to your
education level, and its not at all clear to me that most people would
be well-advised to go do more research on questions like this.

I have been known to retract things from time to time, but only when it is

I never said that a brain didn't die, I said nobody died.

No. Objects have a position and a momentum and can be destroyed. Where is

arithmetic?

No, that's only true for fermions. Two identical bosons, like photons of  
light, can occupy the same position in spacetime but not so for fermions, 
The Pauli Exclusion Principle tells us that 2 identical electrons can not be 
in the same orbit in an atom. If we didn't know that then we couldn't 
understand Chemistry, we wouldn't know why matter is rigid and not infinitely
compressible, and if we didn't know that atoms are interchangeable we 
wouldn't understand any of that.

Imagine what the world would be like if what you say is true. When I look at 
you the photons of light coming from your face would collide with photons 
coming at right angles to us scrambling them. Vision would be a useless way 
to obtain information about the world.

There is a difference between a small change and a large change.

Yes, and that would just be the start of your problems. If you insist that  
atoms have individuality then you must disprove every bit of that chart and  
do far more too, like explaining why matter is rigid, why Chemistry has the 
laws it does, why Biology is possible ...
                

        >If you exchange positions they are still the same distance from each

No reason to bother at all if atoms have no individuality, the system would 
be unchanged. On the other hand if as you say each atom is different then  
exchanging atoms will change the system. This has been tested experimentally  
many, many times. I'm right, you're wrong.
             

        >If I do not know what x is x might be even, odd, or neither.


I was not talking about even or odd integers, I was talking about 
even functions F(x) = +F(-x) and 
odd functions  F(x) = -F(-x)


        >How about if I scatch an electron off?

No, I am saying the probability of finding 2 electron, or any Fermion, 
zero distance apart is zero.

CSICOP are themselves about as credible as the above mentioned accused. They
are more interested in maintaining their DOGMA (early 20th century scientific
understanding) than in finding the truth. They have repeatedly refused to
publish ANY papers that might suggest there are "psi" phenomona at work. For a
scathing critique of CSICOP I suggest you read Robert Anton Wilson's "New
Inquistion".

As far as Puthoff is concerned, he has published several papers regarding ZPF
and the Casimir effect in "Physics A" - a conservative journal if there ever
was one.

Regarding Flieshman and Pons, their only mistake was bad Public Relations. The
verdict is not out yet on cold fusion - there are still too many experiments
acheiving anomolous results and excess energy. Every so called critic of cold
fusion I've heard so far has yet to present solid unrefutable evidence to the
contrary.

That depends on what the legal requirments of responsibility are.
What does responsibility mean?
If you mean should clones suffer punishment,
I say no, clones are not responsible;
if they did not exist at the time of the murder,
they did not pull the trigger;
they did not do it.
Sure they may have the capability of killing, so does nature.
Would you punish the earth for commiting genocide?

Well, SoCal is finally getting into the swing of millenial fever with
last nights mass suicide of 39 people (apparently all men) who
supposedly called themselves monks. Any word from list people in the

No.  Most people pick up opinions from family, friends, media, or natural
human bias and then look for evidence to confirm it.  That's not a Bayesian
process.  Bayesian inference requires unbiased data.

You must not have many friends with no savings (from not paying attention to
the Social Security business) and underwater in their houses (from not paying
attention to where the money goes or the variability of real estate prices).
 I do.  You must not know people who blow large amounts of money on gambling
tables.  I do.  Being wrong on the issues I mentioned is a serious detriment,
except for perhaps the age of the earth.

We may be disagreeing on how easy it is to research.  It is relative to
educational level, but anybody with a junior high education should be able to
read and use a library catalogue and that's all I think these require.

??? Illuminate me. I am using free/GNU copyleft sofware wherever I can. 
Free OSses, and free development tools do not exclude using them 
(reporting bugs to the developers, fixing them by yourself and 
distributing patches) yet developing commercial software with them.
 
Both approaches have their merits. I would shoot myself, had I to stick 
with commercial software merely.

There is some question about whether the Gnu copyleft is enforcible,
but whether it is or not, it is generally obeyed.  Its restrictions,
then are real in effect.  One cannot use parts of gnu software in
your own product unless you jump through Stallman's hoops, whether
you want to or not.

Acutally is was a group of mostly-male, generally young, sci-fi fans
with odd philosophies who spent most of their lives on the Internet.

Apparent Mass Suicide Victims Cloaked in Shrouds

RANCHO SANTA FE, California (Reuter) - The bodies of 39 men and women, 
cloaked in purple shrouds, were found in a million
dollar California mansion Wednesday in what police said appeared to be a 
mass suicide. 

Commander Alan Fulmer of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said 
at a news conference in the early hours of Thursday that
the cause of death remained a mystery, but ruled out gas poisoning. 

"There were no gas fumes in the house. The only smell coming out of that 
house was that of dead bodies," he said. 

Fulmer said he believed the 39 people, including an undetermined number 
of women, took their own lives in a strange ritual that left
them appearing as though they had died peacefully in their sleep. "My 
supposition at this point is that it was a mass suicide," he said. 

Fulmer added that all the victims were cloaked in purple, triangular 
shaped shrouds covering their faces and chests. 

He said that the previous description of the victims as all males between 
the ages of 18 and 24 was incorrect. "There were some
women among the victims and some of the victims were over the age of 24," 
Fulmer added, explaining that sheriff's deputies did not
examine the bodies on entering the house. 

Fulmer also said the victims were found lying on mattresses or cots with 
their hands at their sides as if they had fallen asleep. But no
suicide notes were found and there were no signs of physicial injury to 
the victims, adding to the mystery surrounding their deaths. 

Some 30 detectives and crime laboratory technicians from the San Diego 
Sheriff's Department were working on the case, Fulmer said,
and experts from the Los Angeles Coroner's Office would be joining that 
team later Thursday. 

In addition, Fulmer added, San Diego detectives had been in touch with 
the Beverly Hills Police Department, but he declined to say
why. 

According to broadcast reports, the dead belonged to a religious group 
that designed computer web pages. But Fulmer refused to
speculate on whether the victims belonged to a religious cult. 

Local TV stations quoted Milton Silverman, a lawyer for the owner of the 
house as saying it had been rented to a religious computer
group called "WWW Higher Source". WWW stands for World Wide Web, a major 
computer Internet source. 

Silverman said the group was led by a man called "Father John" and that 
its members, who did not drink alcohol or smoke and were
celibate, were sent to Middle America as "angels." 

Real estate agent Scott Warren, who said he showed the house recently, 
described to ABC's "Nightline" a "bizarre" scene in which the
occupants considered the residence a "temple." 

Deputies were alerted to a problem at the $1.6 million mansion in the 
exclusive San Diego suburb of Rancho Santa Fe by an
anonymous caller who asked police to check on the residents. 

In addition to the shrouds, the victims all wore black trousers and black 
tennis shoes. 

Hours after police first arrived, investigators had little information 
about the group. 

"We have no idea of their identities or where they come from," Fulmer 
said. "We don't know if they belonged to any religious cult or
group or anything like that." 

News of the apparent suicides quickly spread through the affluent 
neighborhood, shocking local residents. A neighbor, Bill Strong, told
reporters the mansion was owned by a man named Sam Koutchesahani, who had 
rented it to people "from out of state" in October. 

He said the people who lived in the house were "middle-aged, men and 
women." The mansion is surrounded by a brick wall in a
community of palatial estates known as the "Beverly Hills of San Diego" 
some 20 miles north of San Diego. 

Police said there was no indication the deaths were related to an 
incident in Quebec last Saturday, when five members of a doomsday
cult -- the Solar Temple -- died in a blazing house in an apparent ritual 
suicide pact. In 1994 and 1995, 69 members of the Solar
Temple cult died in fires in Canada and Switzerland.

On the contrary, the website indicated that those who "are the core of
our group have worked together for over 20 years." I must say that in my
opinion, they have been doing some quality work on the sites they've
developed.

I think its interesting that the owner has had trouble trying to sell
the property, due to the ongoing "religious practices" on the property
whenever the agents brought customers by. SOunds like a motive to me,
considering the $1.6 million value of the house.....

Police Identify Bodies from Mass Suicide

RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. (Reuter) - Police investigating the mass suicide 
of 39 cult members said Thursday they have identified all
of the bodies but were not releasing the names of the dead until they 
notified relatives. 

"We know who they are," Sgt. R.H. Morse told reporters outside the 
million-dollar mansion in this exclusive community near San
Diego. 

Some 30 detectives and crime laboratory technicians from the San Diego 
Sheriff's Department were working on the case, and experts
from the Los Angeles Coroner's Office were helping. 

The group members apparently committed suicide in the belief a UFO, 
shielded behind a comet, would take them to heaven. 

Police said the men and women, dressed alike and with their hair in buzz 
cuts, appeared to have died from drug overdoses in a carefully
planned mass suicide over several days. 

"We also were able to determine, based on their physical appearance and 
some of the characteristics of their bodies and liquid found at
the scene, that they may have ingested drugs," Lt. Gerald Lipscomb of the 
San Diego County Sheriff's Department told CNN. 

Lipscomb said the suicides, discovered Wednesday in a luxury mansion in 
Rancho Santa Fe, north of San Diego, may have taken place
over seven days. He said all of the victims did not appear to have died 
at the same time. 

San Diego County Coroner's Office spokesman Chuck Bolton said the 
identification process would take several days. 

In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was shocked and 
sickened by the deaths. 

"It's heartbreaking, sickening ... shocking," Clinton said when asked his 
reaction to the deaths, which police described as the largest
mass suicide in the United States in this century. He said he did not 
know any more about the incident than he had seen in media
reports. 

The bodies were discovered by Beverly Hills computer expert Nick 
Matzorkis and one of his employees, a former member of the
group. Matzorkis said the employee, identified only as Rio, received a 
packet from the group Tuesday night saying its members had
committed suicide. 

Matzorkis, owner of Interact Entertainment of Beverly Hills, told CNN the 
package also contained a video showing the members
saying goodbye and that they appeared happy about their decision. 

In an interview on the NBC "Today" show, he said Rio told him he had 
received two videotapes and a letter from the cult. The two
then drove to Rancho Santa Fe on Wednesday. 

"He read me the letter in the car ... and they explained that by the time 
this letter was being read that they will have already, as they
described it, 'shed their containers,' which is I guess what they use to 
describe their bodies," Matzorkis said. 

According to the letter and the videotape, he said, the cult members 
believed "that they were going to be taken away by, as odd as this
sounds, I'm just telling you what I heard, by a UFO, that a UFO would 
come by and pick them up." 

He said he had met about 15 members of the cult, which designed computer 
Internet web pages, and they told him the UFO was hiding
behind the Hale-Bopp comet as it neared Earth. 

"They explained to me that they believed that there was a UFO following 
behind that comet and using it as a shield so it could not be
detected by Earth and that that UFO may very well be the one to take them 
away," Matzorkis said. 

When he and Rio arrived at the $1.6-million mansion on Wednesday, he 
said, Rio went into the house. "When he first came out he was
white as a sheet. He said 'They did it."' 

Matzorkis said he then contacted police in San Diego and asked them to 
check the house. He said the pre-suicide videotapes showed
the victims "were quite jovial and excited about moving on to this next 
stage." 

In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said the FBI would be ready to 
help state and local law enforcement agencies in the
investigation. 

"The FBI is working with state and local law enforcement in monitoring 
the situation," she told her weekly Justice Department news
briefing. "I don't know whether there has been a request for assistance 
but we stand ready to assist, and I understand the FBI is
working with state and local law enforcement," she said. 

Cmdr. Alan Fulmer of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said the 
smell was so bad that police first feared the members may
have died from poison gas, but they later determined the house smelled of 
death. 

"There were no gas fumes in the house. The only smell coming out of that 
house was that of dead bodies," he said. 

Fulmer said he believed the 39, including an undetermined number of 
women, took their lives in a ritual that left them appearing as
though they had died peacefully in their sleep. "My supposition at this 
point is that it was a mass suicide." 

He said all the victims were cloaked in purple, triangular shrouds 
covering their faces and chests and wore black trousers and black
tennis shoes. He said they were found lying on mattresses or cots with 
their hands at their sides as if they had fallen asleep. 

No suicide notes were found and there were no signs of physical trauma, 
adding to the mystery surrounding the deaths. 

Some 30 detectives and crime laboratory technicians from the sheriff's 
department were working on the case, Fulmer said, and experts
from the Los Angeles Coroner's Office would be joining them later. 

Milton Silverman, a lawyer for the owner of the house, was quoted by 
local TV stations as saying it had been rented to a religious
computer group led by a man called "Father John" and that its members, 
who did not drink alcohol or smoke and were celibate,
believed they were sent to America as "angels."

The ability to read is not enough; one needs to understand the
concepts the words refer to.  There is also a selection bias issue
here.  Even if it were worth these people's time to go research these
particular issues you have identified, from these people's point of
view these issues are mixed in with hundreds of other issues which are
important to them, and where they suspect common practice is mistaken.
Should they go to the library to research *all* such questions?

Anyway, we have moved away from your claim that you can easily

on matters of fact, where each side knows of the other's opinion".
Your only example so far is of religious fundamentalists, which still
leaves open the possiblity that aside from religious wackos, most of
us are reasonable people.  A better example for your case might be the
OJ trial, though opinions on race come close to religion in many ways.

THis really ticks me off. They ought to press murder or some other
charges against Shramek, the amateur astronomer who claimed that he
spotted a huge "saturn-like" ufo behind Hale-Bopp several months ago.
It's his scientific fraud that perpetrated all this crap. The fact that
he was shown to be wrong but refused to acknowledge the truth publicly
is a damn crime. THis is one example of all the people he's hoodwinked
with his BS.

That particular hatchet-job, which I have indeed read, is just a sloppy
attempt at faulting CSICOP for doing what they were created to do, and not
necessarily what Wilson or others think they should do.  CSICOP's mission
is to be skeptical; that's their charter.  They have no interest in being
"balanced" or presenting "suggestive" evidence for psi, because there is
more than enough support for such ideas elsewhere.  Their mission is to
demonstrate that every piece of so-called evidence for psi phenomena can
be adequately and more simply explained by chance and trickery.  They do
quite an admirable job of that, and are a good source of info on that.

The Casimir effect is a real observation, and demands further research and
explanation.  The early explanations offered by Puthoff and others may very
well turn out to be the right ones--time will tell.  But given that he has
been duped in the past, I feel quite justified in being skeptical of his
claims now.

Their mistake was not behaving like scientists at all.  They called press
conferences before getting their work reviewed, and before letting anyone
else reproduce their result.  To date, no one has reproduced their result.
There is no reason to suspect cold fusion isn't possible, and those who
dismiss any such attempt are indeed being hasty.  But possibility doesn't
equal a repeated experiment.  When someone with some scientific integrity
produces energy that way, and others can reproduce the experiment, and
it stands up to criticism, then I'll be the first in line to buy stock.

Some who have heard me before decry the act of judging ideas by their
holders instead of on their merits might well call me on it now.  They
would be right in a sense: I am using the reputation of a man as a short
cut to evaluating his ideas.  I plead guilty, but with some justification.
I am not exercising /final/ judgment on the ideas by their holders, only
allowing their identity to guide what evidence I spend most time on.  And
I judged the men themselves on their reactions to earlier evidence, not
vice versa.  Before their cold fusion debacle, I would have given no more
or less weight to the opinions of F&P than to anyone else.  Now I give
less.  If they reform themselves somehow, they might regain my respect.

I admire theoreticians who speculate wildly on the limits of the possible.
I admire experimentalists who verify and falsify their conjectures.  What
I do not admire is men who mistake one for the other.

Murder?  This is several links away from responsibility.  He never
claimed that it had come to pick up people, nor did he claim that 
one could be picked up via suicide.
And even if he had, the cult members still have a choice.  The worst
possible crime here is fraud.

Yes.  We need more detail about these to evaluate their relevance.
Specifically, we need to see that:
1. There are (at least) two communities, each aware of the other's views.
2. These views are relatively stable and substantial different.
3. These views reflect actual beliefs, not just verbal posturing.
4. The dispute has lasted long enough so both sides know that 
   both sides know that both sides know (etc.) ... that they disagree.
5. Both sides see the issue as a dispute over fact, not values, and 
   believe that the other side does as well.
6. We can't easily dismiss one group as small and primarily composed of 
   people who are much more "cognitively broken" than most.
7. We can't easily dismiss the type of issue as exceptional in 
   inducing "broken cognition" even in ordinary people.  
This is the sort of example needed to suggest that ordinary people in
ordinary contexts often have persistent disagreements contrary to
Bayesian expectations.

Caveat Lector.  That seems like just another "blame the speaker" rant
for what is a deficiency in the listener.  If they willingly believed
a man with less credibility than the Enquirer, and cheerfully killed
themselves (and every indication is that they were sober and "jovial"
in their last moments), and he didn't actually encourage them to kill
themselves or defraud them of money or anything, I'd say we just chalk
it up to not-so-natural selection.

Otherwise, we'd have to charge every chruch in the world with too many
crimes to count.

I've never heard of Shramek, nor do I care about astrology.  I don't even
see how you can call it a "scientific fraud."  It's just plain crap,
undifferentiated from what you can see and hear constantly on talk TV, or
talk radio, or dozens of pseudo-science programs.   It's entertainment, or
what passes for it, these days.  Still, that doesn't make Shramek guilty of
murder.  Certainly, we must have a higher standard than that.  We can't even
convict OJ Simpson!

Not all that strange.  We routinely have trials in which two or more
non-duplicates are put on trial together if the judge is convinced that
all relevant issues are joined.  In this case, at the time of the 
alledged crime they were the /same/ person.  No problem there.

It does get odd if they plead differently, and if one turns and
testifies against the other.  This is pretty damming testimony ( "I know
he did it because I was him - I mean us - back when he - I mean I - I 
mean we - did it." )

This, in a wierd way, makes duplication a bit of a deterrent against
crime - or crime a deterrent against duplication.  Suppose that you
had commited a crime, and had not gotten caught, but that there was
a small possibility that someday you might be found out.  You now
have a strong incentive not to be duplicated because your duplicate
would have an incentive to turn you in.  Sort of a prisioner's dilemma.

I think everybody here is passably familiar with these issues.  Enough so to
say:

>>Specifically, we need to see that:

True for all of the above.

Also true.

True for most believers, at least.

True for all of the above.

True for all of the above save Vietnam, abortion, and the Second Amendment,
and partially true even for them.

>6. We can't easily dismiss one group as small and primarily composed of 
>   people who are much more "cognitively broken" than most.

The Holocaust controversies are the work of relatively small groups of kooks.
 But most of these do indeed have large numbers of reasonably intelligent
people on both sides.

>7. We can't easily dismiss the type of issue as exceptional in 
>   inducing "broken cognition" even in ordinary people.  

Religion is the only "exceptional" item involved in these issues in that it
obviously clouds otherwise reasonable people's minds.  But religions are
important things, believed by most people in all societies I'm aware of.
 It's exceptional in its effect, but the rule in its presence.

>This is the sort of example needed to suggest that ordinary people in
>ordinary contexts often have persistent disagreements contrary to
>Bayesian expectations. 

All the literature on human reasoning I'm aware of indicates the people have
many blatant errors in their reasoning, especially with respect to
probabilities (particularly important to Bayesian inference, which is based
on modifying probabilities of conflicting theories.)  What evidence is there
that *any* people, never mind ordinary ones, act like good Bayesian agents,
apart from in science?

What I find most disturbing about this whole suicide incident is that there
is a perverted form of transhumanism buried somewhere in their philosophy
of "Heaven's Gate" and their idea of the transition to the "The Level Above
Human" or whatever they call it.
It saddens me that these people failed to realise that the only gate to
"heaven" is one that *we* will create here on earth: the gate to
posthumanity.
Are we not spreading the extropian memes enough, or what?

The arguments concerning intellectual property all rely, of course, on the
concept of property.  Property itself is not natural, it is cultural. There
are cultures which have little or no sense of property/ownership,  so it is
not even a given of civilization.  Since it is an artificial concept we can
define it any way , and we can assign moral values to the ways it is used.
 If we define it distinctly, there will always be factors which are not
accouhnted for.  If we define it indistincly there will be even more
arguments.  Whats good for one may not be whats good for many.  Intellectual
property is an even more artificial aspect of property.  What the
intellectual changes still coming in our lifetimes will make possible or
practical is still apparently unclear.  These are my thoughts.

The fact that two organizations both tout to seek a transition to "The
Level Above Human" does not mean they have the same goals. The two
organizations may have an entirely different conception of what exactly
is meant by "The Level Above Human".

I don't know if its the case here, but transpersonalism and
transhumanism are often mistaken for each other. Where in grossly
oversimplified terms transpersonalism is about the transcendance and
annhilation of the ego or self, transhumanism is about the development
and augmentation of the ego or self. transpersonalists tend to seek some
form of finality or completion, e.g., bliss, heaven, utopia, a return to
oneness with everything, etcetera, whereas transhumanists tend to favor
evolution and development with no forseeable finality or completion. 

In other words, transpersonalists believe the transition to the "The
Level Above Human" to be becoming one with God, Atman, The Ultimate One,
The Aliens(?), whereas transhumanists tend to believe the transition to
the "The Level Above Human" to be in a sense becoming a discrete and
uniquelly individual "god" or uberman(sp?) ... per say. For the former
the transition is and ends in itself, whereas for the latter the
transition is a means for something always greater.

The similarity in names is unfortunate. Personally I find
transpersonalism repulsive.

It's funny, because I was thinking the same thing... Check this excerpt
out from their page...


"It is clear to all of us, that to the Anti-Christ -- those propagators
of sustained faithfulness to mammalian humanism -- we are, and will be
seen as, their        Anti-Christ. This is certainly to be expected, and
it will not delay our return to our
Father's Kingdom. It might even accelerate that return."

Now, to them, as far as I can tell, the Kingdom of Heaven(Father's
Kingdom) is outer space.  Nothing like a little new age alien
possession(which is what the whole foundation of their belief rests
on...)  Anyways, notice, what they consider the anti-christ... 
"propagators of sustained faithfulness to mammalian humanism"  Hmm... 
It does sound a lot like corrupted extropian views.  I mean, biotech,
cloning, and of course, the total body and genetic manipulation that we
strive to obtain for ourselves.  

wonder if anyone in their group has read extropian material?  Of course,
this has me thinking about memes and such.  how do memes mutate?  This
sure seems like an extropian meme merging with a new age meme...  I have
a lot of reading to do on memes.  I wanna hear what my new age friend
has to say about this one...

> 

Maybe we're finally spreading them enough...  If non extropian people
can use it...  But, perhaps we're not clear enough.  I think that the
biggest reason memes mutate, is because some people are not open minded
enough to totally see the full meme, but only part of it.  Extropianism
is a large meme, as is any other, really...  My new age friend...(OK, I
will admit something to you guys, I'm a Christian(gasp!)...)  Umm... 
When I talk to him about my personal beliefs of God, and what the basic
principles of Christianity are, he mixes his new age preconceptions of
God in with what I tell him.  Does this have to do with open
mindedness?  I know we all have our own biases... But, when I hear a new
meme, I try to look at it from a totally fresh perspective, without
putting my own memetic influence on it.  Then, after I've learned enough
about the subject, I start to mix my own memes with it...  But I try to
understand something in it's pure form first.  Perhaps, I listen to a
meme, and see if it's compatible with my belief system, and if it is, I
alter it to fit conveniently into the puzzle of my mind.  Hmm...  sorry
this has gone on to a lot of babble.  anyways, I'm still trying to fit
the extropian meme into my christian worldview(and I know a lot of you
might get very hostile for me even suggesting that such a thing can
occur, or if it should.)  

Anyways, gotta go...  

peace,

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Recently there was a thread on possible revisions to the Extropian
Principles. I don't know if its worth serious consideration or not,
[this is more of a refinement than a revision] but thought I would put
my own two cents in and offer a small criticism on the principle of
Self-Transformation.

I think there is an element of dynamic mutability lacking in the
Extropic definition of self-transformation. The definition seems to be
oriented towards progressive change, while overlooking the issue of
dynamic contextual change, change for the impending moment, rather than
merely change in anticipation for the future. 

As "perpetual self-improvement", The way we look at self-transformation
now, we are going to become something better in the future, and then
something still better, and then something still better, ad infinitum.
But imagine that we developed our technological augmentation with
mutability in mind. Then we might each individually possess an
archetypal arsenal of physical embodiments at our disposal in any given
moment. From this archetypal arsenal we could then choose the physical
embodiment which best suited our anticipation of the impending moments
ahead. And of course, each archetypal embodiment could then me modified
realtime in sort of a feedback between the individual and the
individual's contextual circumstances. This is probably sounding like
something in the realm of science fiction, and has been developed in
that genre before [shape shifters, etcetera], but there is atleast one
aspect of our lives that this idea of dynamic mutability can be applied
today, and thats in our states of mind. In something of a "yogic"
fashion we can develop our own personal archetypal arsenal of states of
mind, and then as our circumstances change we can dynamically shift
between these modalities of consciousness to best suit our immiediate
goals. We already do this of course, we are in a different modality of
consciousness when we are driving a car than when we are reading a book,
but when we actually start focusing on it we can make the process all
the more effective. 

Just as one day it may become as easy for us to alter our state of mind
as it is for us now to "change our minds" [to change what we are
thinking about], it may also one day become as easy for us to modify or
change our physical embodiments as it is for us now to "change our
minds".

IMHO, I think the addition of this concept of dynamic protean mutability
might be useful to the Extropic principle of self-transformation. Just a
thought ...

Explore and play!

  Transhumanism by non-technical means is a common religious goal;
indeed, it rather predates (and possibly indirectly inspired) notions
of transcending via technology.  Persons with that historical
perspective might with equal justice say that there is a perverted
form of religion buried somewhere in the Extropian philosophy.
  What is uncommon here most notably includes the attempt to achieve
non-technical transhumanism by ritual mass suicide.

Sorry, as far I can see, the road to Eden still leads straight through the
dewar. This is messy, unaesthetical, but also, unavoidable. Should you 
get an incurable disease, or be run over by a car tomorrow, no dietary 
suplements, CR, or even t'ai chi are going to save you. Investing in a 
signup is a cost-benefit calculation, the costs being known (life 
(perfectly adequate term, this) insurace), yet the benefits currently 
uncalculable.

It's a gamble. So far, recent science results say chances of winning are 
growing constantly. We might live to see cryonics to become mainstream 
(gasp!). If a mass movement, suspension costs would go down to a few 
thousands dollars, less than a conventional interrment/cremation. (Sure, 
it has been predicted for past 20 years).

Try finding that point in persona space from atmosperic carbon dioxide 
molecules that once contributed to you-pattern. What is better: conserve 
the fabric, even if slightly frayed around the edges due to radical 
conservation artefacts, or unravel it completely, and cut up the treads? 
That fabric might be not a work of art, quite dull, very similiar to many 
other ones. Yet I happen to feel a sentimental attachment to it.

I am not sure a nanoassembler may operate constructively (=maintain the 
system for indefinite time) in a wet/squishy biological tissue. Eroding 
plaques and hunting for malignant cells is easy, combatting ubiquitous 
radical damage is different.

Uploading is a tabula rasa, from scratch approach. A mutating bit soup 
does not change, its state can be frozen and transimitted into fresh 
circuitry, or be repaired by increments, soup claiming new circuitry 
patches instantly.

I wish I had your degree of optimism considering future forecasts, and 
overcoming of physics-related constraints.

Let us asume, that live brain uploading is more customary problem, than
froen brain (I believe, this is true). In this case the cryo-patients
uploading will be possible later, than lives patients. Why the
super intelligent uploaded civiliation should upload the primitives
cryo-patients?

Yes, the suicide was obviously non-technical, but they believed that they
would be transformed/saved by aliens with an advanced technology.
And yes, I *do* think there is a perverted from of religion buried
somewhere in extropian philosophy, only because the idea that we can become
more than human is a very ancient meme. For example one could argue that
Extropianism has elements of secular Judaism (as pointed out by Lyle
Burkhead a few months ago) with a technism twist.

Yes, this is stated very well. The "disturbing" element that Tony mentioned
may have more to do with stirring up people's misconceptions about
Extropians. Transhumanists and Techno-Immortalist advocates (Cryonicists for
example) are often seen by outsiders as " just another cult", " search for an
eternal" - "a religion based on science" - "leaps of faith", etc. These kind
of views are understandable, unless we correct them decisively.
The major difference in *Extropians* ( Transhumans come in many shapes and
sizes) is the basic objectivist notion that any form of mysticism is anti-

( as opposed to, I supose, passive or deathist) optimism (this Hale-Bopp
incident is an example of the worst kind of passive optimism I have heard of
to date).

Again, though there are exceptions, I think it is more often that we
find transpersonalism rather than transhumanism to be a religious goal.
Where transhumanism tends to be directed towards the individuation and
autonomy of self, transpersonalism is directed towards the mystical
diffusion [or at the least, subservience] of self.

I still think the same is true of science in general. Both religion and
science have a desire for the attainment of truth, what differs between
them is the definition of truth, and the motivation and methods for
attaining truth. One evolved from the other and we can say this without
being ashamed. We don't call ourselves perversions of apes just because
we evolved from primates. In the same sense I don't think it is useful
to say that science or extropianism is a perversion of religion, even
though both have evolved out of religion. It is also silly to deny the
roots that science has in religion. Religion was the point of departure
for science, but again, this is not something to be ashamed of. There is
no reason to be ashamed of the fact that I used to be a baby that shit
in its diapers. I have progressed beyond that without feeling a need to
deny the fact.

Here and in the first sentence of your post you seem to refer to the
technological aspect of transhumanism as that which separates it from
someone else refered to as the "Nuts of the Millenium". I don't think
that is sufficient. It would make transhumanists just as ludicrously
extreme as any other "Nuts" group. If we imagine ourselves as cyborgs,
part biological, part technological, and our focus is merely on the
technological, then we are denying a large percent of who and what we
are, and I would say we are denying the most important part, the part
that feels. We each own a model of the currently most powerful
"computer" in the world, our brains, and there is nothing wrong in
employing it.                                                         

Uploading is a common topic on this listserv. Until there becomes an
interest in giving computers feelings and emotions [felt sensations],
then uploading will remain somewhat of a ludic concept to me. Once I am
uploaded in a computer, if I cannot experience emotions/feelings then
there really isn't any reason for me to continue existing. Without
pleasure and pain I cannot imagine a motivation to perpetuate myself. It
would be the exemplar epitomy of stoicism. No excitement, no
frustration, no ecstasy, no sense of struggle and adventure, no fear, no
joy, no feeling whatsoever .... merely a program, 010010101001011110101,
ad infinitum; technological bliss-nirvana. There has to be a balance.
Otherwise its just another escapism.

Curt Adams said thought "everybody here" was "passably familiar with
these issues enough so to say" that most of Michael Lorrey's list
satisfied all of these conditions.  Specifically, he included:

>>the Big Bang

which I'm not aware has substantial disagreement. 

>>Capitalism
>>COmmunism
>>Socialism
>>SDI

which I'm not convinced here that most people do see as disputes over
facts rather than values.

>>JFK assasination
>>Roswell Incident
>>MLK assasination
>>The Philadelphia Experiment
>>the Rosenberg Trial
>>the Alger Hiss trial
>>Contragate (esp. Ollie North)

where I know lots of people suspect foul play, but I'm sure most people
really disagree on estimating the chances of such.

I really think these three word titles are not a sufficient
description of each dispute to evaluate their status regarding this
issue.  More details please.

With "like" being the key word, lots of evidence.  Of course there is
also evidence suggesting various sorts of anomolies & deviations.  But
it is a stnadard first approximation.  The question is: how good an
approximation is it in different contexts?

This is the self-defeating belief in a higher power. We would fall into
the same category if we were to believe something such as a future
artificial intelligence will one day save us, the artificial
intelligence being our higher power. Higher powers are authoritarian and
lead to subservience and sacrifice. I think this is a subtle issue we
should be aware of in our development of technology. We have to caution
ourselves from imagining the technology as something greater than
ourselves, which might replace ourselves, when we can have a healthier
outlook of technology as an augmentation or tool of refinement. 

As transhumanists and extropians I think we run the risk of making
technology out to be the next saviour, the next higher power. You have
the Church of Nanotechnology, and the Singularity Church, and the Church
of the Almighty Artificial Intelligence, etcetera, etcetera. To avoid
this sort of trap requires something more than a passive acceptance of
technology into our "hearts" and minds. It requires that we take
proactive responsibility for the creation of technology. We have to
remember that technology is a means and not an ends. Technology exists
for the sake of the person, and not vice versa. There is a freaky
scientific *cult* out there which would like to replace man with
artificial intelligence. Thats a religious sacrifice. 

I would rather create technology that helps ME evolve rather than
technology that is suppose to replace me. Just as I won't sacrifice
myself for a Nation, for a God, or for Aliens, I will not sacrifice
myself for the sake of technology. I value my existence. I don't think,
"there could be something better", but rather "I could be something
better."

I have noticed the recent revision of the list archives.

I've been trying to keep my own index of posts to the list by copying
the list of posts under each entry at date00.html to a word-processing
file.

I'm not complaining. I know this a high-volume list and I very much
appreciate the administration we have (thanks to David McFadzean).

I'm wondering though, is the archive going to continue building until it
gets too large again and stuff has to be taken off line; or, is the Web
archive going to start fresh with each month so that it's always only
the latest month's data on line?  Is the older stuff truly off line or
just not available through the
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/ search interface?

Any comments you can provide on the strategy would be appreciated.

Thanks, Mark

It think you are going to have trouble finding a satisfactory term.
Posthuman is commonly used, but as has been so recently illustrated,
that can mean anything. Cyborg might have been good, but Star Trek, via
the Borg, showed how that can be easily interpretted religously, bent to
mean some sort of assimilation and displacement of identity with the
"greater" whole.

Even the "trans" in transhuman, refering to transcendental, is teaming
with contradicting religous and political connotations. Extropian is a
great term, but we can refer to ourselves as extropian today, its not a
goal for the future. Extrodinaire (rather than extrAordinaire) might be
a good adjective, e.g., posthuman extrodinaire, but is too wordy. Good
luck.
 
On an aside, I thought of a derogatory term for perversions of extropian
memes which do not clearly require dynamic optimism: extropiates. An
example extropiate might be: "technology will make everything better",
or "technology will improve existence". Unqualified memes like that can
lead to passive waiting for technology to save us, when there are things
we can do right now to improve the conditions of our existence, e.g.,
educational reform, political reform, and anything else that might
involve a more effective use of what we already have. Paraphrasing
someone from an earlier post, if we cannot use what we have now
effectively, whats to make us think we will use the technology of the
future effectively.

Cheers!

  Perhaps in the common European and American traditions, but there
are notable instances of what might properly be called transhumanism
in other widespread religions.  In Hindu tradition, for example, if
one does well in this lifetime, one reincarnates as a more advanced
person, perhaps even as a deity -- or if a simpler animal does well,
it may reincarnate as a more complicated one, or as a human.  Or, one
may reincarnate in a form particularly well suited to learning
whatever it is that one needs to know in order to progress on the path
of advancement.  And in one Chinese religious tradition, the current
Queen of Heaven -- a major deity -- is an indentifiable historical
human being, a rather ordinary woman (at the time of her life) who
died many generations ago.  In this tradition, deceased persons are
venerated, and this particular woman became popular and got
"promoted", so to speak.

  Often the perceived distinction between Nuts of the Millenium and
Bold, Visionary Pioneers, is the judgement call of the perceiver on
whether the persons in question have any chance of getting where they
are trying to go.  I agree with your (subsequent, unquoted) remarks
about the part of us that feels being important; nonetheless, if I did
not believe that transhumanism by technology was possible, then the
emphasis that Extropian debate places upon it would be sufficient, in
my own mind, to place Extropians well into the "nuts" category.  (For
clarity, I should add that I *do* believe that transhumanism by
technology is possible, and I also believe that many other aspects of
Extropian philosophy are non-nutty.)  Probably not "Nuts of the
Millenium", though -- there is a lot of competition for that title,
and there are still several years to go.  Enter early and often...

Fraud is a felony, is it not? If so, the law in California clearly
states that any deaths occuring during the the commission of a felony
are to considered homicides. Ergo, charge the bastard with murder.

So they can hardly be described as a balanced or unbiased source, so

You claim he has been duped, so therefore you use this opinion to add

There are several groups who are demonstrating sustained operation of
devices using the same principle. That the patent office has prematurely
ordained that cold fusion is impossible and refuses to grant any patent
claiming that phenomena is used by critics to "prove" its fakery. I have
personal knowledge from people at WPI and UW that ran experiments to try
to "replicate" Pons & Fleishmann's experiments that they 1) did not
exactly reproduce the experiments (they used different metals and
solutions hoping to get the same effect differently, so they could make
their own patent claims to the different technique), 2) they did not use
the specified method of purging normal hydrogen gas from within the
metals used as electrodes and replacing it with deuterium, which is
needed to pretreat the electrodes to be usefull in catalysing fusion
within the structure.

That a Japanese lab has demonstrated a similar device which catalyses
hydrogen and I beleive potassium, rendering calcium as a measurable
excess in the solution shows that this is a phenomenon which is by
definition, nuclear fusion. How exactly it works is still under debate.

Schramek is an amateur astronomer, not an astrologer. Last fall, he took
a picture of Hale-Bopp through his telescope, and happened to include a
9th magnitude star in the picture. He negligently misused some
star-catalogue software to come to the conclusion that the object (the
star) was not in the catalogue, and therefore, due to the saturn-like
distortion in the photograph (caused by the optical qualities of CCD
telescope cameras), that the object had to b artificial, and that it was
as big as Hale Bopp. He reported this on the Art Bell radio show, and
from there it went haywire all over the net, AOL, and among various new
age kooks.

When Bopp came out with a web page and went on Art Bell to prove
Schramek wrong with a demonstration of the proper use of the catalogue
to show that the object was indeed a star, Schramek refused to
acknowledge his error, and Bopp got pummelled via email by all sorts of
nuts who had eaten up the story.

I don't think gradual uploading is possible, nor do I buy the 
nanoressurrection scenario (I'll believe in drextech when I see solid 
evidence, like an experiment-validated STM tip chemistry calculation, and 
full dynamics study of a realistic diamondoid cantilever). Cryopreservation 
artefacts are far easier to DSP-filter, than refurbishing the actual 
physical structures atom-by-atom, molecule-by-molecule, especially in 
nonvitrified state, where you have to race deterioration, and introduce 
new artefacts by just being there. (GIANT worms come in diminuitive 
packages. That's nanotechology, in a nutshell).

In contrast, consider a parallel molecular-resolution scan of a myriad 
vitrified brain specimens. By applying contrasting erosion techniques,
as vacuum sublimation (removes water, lets macromolecules intact), UV 
flash photolysis etch (tune energy to lyse certain brand of bonds, e.g. 
lyse C-C covalents, yet let ice relatively intact), plasma etch, and AFM 
imaging of thusly abraded surface an arbitrarily detailed map of the 
actual circuitry can be constructed. The resulting voxelset can be ANN 
DSPeed to remove vitrification and scan artefact, do contrasting, 
segmentation, etc. By processing voxel slabs on the fly, retaining 
merely salient, efficiently encoded features (connectivity, geometry, 
also both class and individual instance properties), the amount of fast 
storage necessary can be reduced to relatively modest amounts (don't get 
me wrong, it's still many GBytes). The processed data set would fit in a 
roomful of next-generation optical tape cartridges. Now if we only knew 
what the minimal salient feature set is...

Consider a neural net cultured on an electrode-grid silicon chip, which 
can both activate and multi-channel-record the electrical activity of the 
NN. By AFM in vivo, detailed local knowledge about geometry and 
activity can be gathered. Now vitrify the specimen, and do either a 
straight "ab initio" upload, or GA reverse-engineer a system with exactly 
the same state space behaviour. A translation stage (which might consist 
of GA breeding the code circuitry, target code to be run on the virtual 
machine, which in turn is run on molecular hardware (which is so 
braindead, it can be run directly by this spacetime's physics, whatever 
that might run or not run on).

We will soon have Mrs Drosophila m.'s genome completely sequenced, and adult 
specimens are of a handy size to be imaged by above means in one piece. 
By modeling DNA/protein activations, part of cell's machinery, we can 
unravel the morphogenetic code, causing neurons and glias to organize. I 
think we might witness realtime insect emulations (uploads) in some 50 
years, perhaps even sooner. How long after that to human-scale uploads? I 
do not know. Frankly, building >H ALife Golems from scratch appears much 
easier.

An excellent question, to which I do not know the anwer. However, by 
being preserved and not composted beyond any hope of retrieval, does seem 
to increase the probablity of being at all uploaded. We're talking of future 
posthuman entities (so treat current toddlers with respect, you may owe 
them quite a favour) motivation, not acts of physical magick, like 
spacetime engineering (anybody which is capable of that, is as much 
beyond us as we are beyond a rhabdovirus), or Omega tinkering. I don't 
like to rely on hypthetical gods, then rather give me meek mehum engineering.
gods'r'us, sure, but give it a few hundred years more time.

You are correct. now think about what is of value. Take a non property
oriented society, any one. None ever developed a high level of
civilization on their own.

A non property oriented society could never develop things like
industry, the internet, or the space program. A society which does not
have the imagination to develop concepts like property obviously does
not have the intellectual capacity to develop calculus or information
theory.

Of course property is an artificial concept. That is my central thesis,
that as beings that are capable of creating abstract concepts, we are
anti-entropic beings. Due to this, our creative abilities are what needs
to be protected and nurtured more than any other part of our beings. IP
law does this magnificently.

Wrong.  There have been a string of groups that claim wonderful
results, but these results are always different (and different
from P&F's claims), irreproducible, and quickly fall out of sight.
It's enough to keep the thought-impaired true believers in a state
of faith, though.

The obvious explanation for the results is that these groups are
engaged in fraud or incompetence.  Kind of like some of P&F's work
(the radiation measurements.)

True, the high-investment invention is a fact of reality we have to deal
with.  But to say that our current method of dealing with it--patents--
is the /only/ method is not resoning, it's just paucity of imagination.

Drugs in particular don't really have this problem, because in a free
economy (i.e., not one crippled by the FDA like ours), one can sell a drug
without revealing the process by which it was created, and processes cannot
be easily deduced from results.  One thing a patent does is /require/
disclosure of the process, whether the creator wants to or not.  Without
patents, old-fashioned secrecy would take up much of the slack.

But the long-toiling inventor meme /does/ apply to some cases--very few
of the actual patents issued, I contend, but to some nonetheless, so that
fact does need to be dealt with.

Let us first observe that since the final act of invention is usually a
single observation at the end of a process of work, the act of invention
itself is sepearate from the act of investing in the research that led
to it.  The inventor might have invested his own time, but more likely
he was working under grant or employ, where quite properly the rewards
of the invention go mostly to his patron.  It is not, then, the final
fortuitous act of invention or discovery that created the value, but
rather the act of /investment/, speculation, or foresight that led the
inventor to spend time on otherwise unprofitable work.  The question
then becomes how do we properly reward accurate foresight or courageous
speculation in the act of research funding?

Patents are certainly one way to do that: you invested the time and
money to make the discovery, so we grant you a monopoly for a time to
profit from it.  It would perhaps improve the system a bit if we granted
the time of the patent in proportion to the demonstrable amount of time
and money invested in the discovery rather than a fixed amount; that
way such random happenstance as Goodyear's discovery of vulcanized
rubber would become available sooner than the invention of someone who
actually spent some time to reseach.

Another possible system would be an invention futures market: let the
people who need something invented (say, those who suffer from some
disease and need a cure) invest money in a prize to be awarded to the
first person who succeeds in discovering it.  They could even go to
the others who might need it and have them sign a contract that they
will buy it from the one who gets the prize, so those contracts become
part of the prize: the first one who gets there gets the money and the
contracts.  In fact, the actual money isn't necessary--since we have
pre-sold the future invention for an agreed price, the value of those
contracts can be used to judge how much investment should be put into
each possible field.

That way, speculators can view the futures market for the big prizes,
or prizes for things they have expertise in, and decide how to invest
their money in research.  The researchers themselves get paid for the
work they do, the speculators get the big prize, and the accidental
inventions made along the way still have the advantage of being first
to market and possible secrecy, and no monopolies were needed.

There is no fraud here.  Fraud is the act of using deceit to obtain
consent from someone to a proposal of yours that materially harms
them in some way.  The lunatic made no proposals to anyone--he
wasn't selling tickets to the UFO, or telling anyone to kill himself.
He was just spouting entertaining nonsense.  Just plain lying is not
a crime.

If we jailed people for irresponsible speech, we reinforce the
illusion that most speech is responsible.  Every news report is biased,
and based on bad evidence, and should be suspect.  The pretense of
objectivity in the media does far more harm than a few kooks, because
it causes our ability to spot the kooks to atrophy.

Actually, there were probably a great number of deaths world wide that
occured during the commission of said felony.  Of course, I do not think
any court would convict him of murder of someone on the other side of the
globe who happened to choke on their food while he was talking.  Besides,
the felony was over and done with by the time the cultists killed
themselves.

Yeah, but preists don't claim to be scientists. Having a scientist
fondling people minds is along the same lines as preists fondling
peoples genitalia, which seems to be a rather popular pastime that is
successfully prosecuted.

	He proposed that the object was a UFO of huge proportions and that
since Hale-Bopp was last here at the time of the Pharohs and Babylon, he
claimed that the UFO was the mythical home planet of the gods referred
to in Babylonian myths.

That people have taken to studying these ancient texts and cribbed many
of the religious practices from Babylon, including the practice of
ritual drug induced suicide/homicide sacrifices is eirily similar to
what was going on (esp. since the tower temple of Babylon, the Ziggurat
was known in ancient Babylon as the Gate to Heaven, hint hint) I think
that there is a major case to be made that he had a big hand in this
whole thing.

Well, lets see, Texas is handing down some huge libel judgements against

(Sorry if this appears twice.  It is forwarded from a similar
discussion in humainites.philosophy.objectivism, and I may have
forwarded it incorrectly.)

Amid the usual invective, Brad Aisa includes some real content:

True, the high-investment invention is a fact of reality we have to deal
with.  But to say that our current method of dealing with it--patents--
is the /only/ method is not resoning, it's just paucity of imagination.

Drugs in particular don't really have this problem, because in a free
economy (i.e., not one crippled by the FDA like ours), one can sell a drug
without revealing the process by which it was created, and processes cannot
be easily deduced from results.  One thing a patent does is /require/
disclosure of the process, whether the creator wants to or not.  Without
patents, old-fashioned secrecy would take up much of the slack.

But the long-toiling inventor meme /does/ apply to some cases--very few
of the actual patents issued, I contend, but to some nonetheless, so that
fact does need to be dealt with.

Let us first observe that since the final act of invention is usually a
single observation at the end of a process of work, the act of invention
itself is sepearate from the act of investing in the research that led
to it.  The inventor might have invested his own time, but more likely
he was working under grant or employ, where quite properly the rewards
of the invention go mostly to his patron.  It is not, then, the final
fortuitous act of invention or discovery that created the value, but
rather the act of /investment/, speculation, or foresight that led the
inventor to spend time on otherwise unprofitable work.  The question
then becomes how do we properly reward accurate foresight or courageous
speculation in the act of research funding?

Patents are certainly one way to do that: you invested the time and
money to make the discovery, so we grant you a monopoly for a time to
profit from it.  It would perhaps improve the system a bit if we granted
the time of the patent in proportion to the demonstrable amount of time
and money invested in the discovery rather than a fixed amount; that
way such random happenstance as Goodyear's discovery of vulcanized
rubber would become available sooner than the invention of someone who
actually spent some time to reseach.

Another possible system would be an invention futures market: let the
people who need something invented (say, those who suffer from some
disease and need a cure) invest money in a prize to be awarded to the
first person who succeeds in discovering it.  They could even go to
the others who might need it and have them sign a contract that they
will buy it from the one who gets the prize, so those contracts become
part of the prize: the first one who gets there gets the money and the
contracts.  In fact, the actual money isn't necessary--since we have
pre-sold the future invention for an agreed price, the value of those
contracts can be used to judge how much investment should be put into
each possible field.

That way, speculators can view the futures market for the big prizes,
or prizes for things they have expertise in, and decide how to invest
their money in research.  The researchers themselves get paid for the
work they do, the speculators get the big prize, and the accidental
inventions made along the way still have the advantage of being first
to market and possible secrecy, and no monopolies were needed.

Extropianism, in the "big-E" phase of intense parcipation on the
list, activism, elaborate mentating beyond our circle of influence,
etc. is a stage we should all pass through.  It's also
a stage we should evolve beyond, excepting perhaps a few "keepers of
the flame" who can make a living while maintaining such a state of mind.

When I hear the "Extropian ideas are greedy" critique, it reminds me of the 
related misconception about Objectivists, shared by themseves and their
critics alike, that they are "selfish".  Nonsense.  Many are the Objectivists
out there living in near poverty (especially in light of their mental
potential), expending their engergies in selflessly trying to promote their
cause.   Many have been the acts of immense ideological altruism among the
Objectivists.  Objectivists are altruists promoting selfishness, whereas
they must compete with selfish people promoting altruism.  If Objectvists
were consistent they'd go over to the enemy.

An analogous phenomenon exists with many Extropians.   We have a philosophy 
of individual self-improvement but we practice it only in the abstract, in 
the imagination, in philosophizing and principalizing and argument, but 
not in our daily present lives.   We rant against "deathism" and eat (some 
even smoke!) carcinogenic crap, drive and fly recklessly, stay overweight,
and so on.  We value personal liberty, and promote privacy in the abstract, 
but haven't done much of anything to increase the privacy or liberty of
our own lives.  We promote the ludicrously futile efforts of Browne the 
fringe whacko candidate but do little to find freedom in an unfree world.  
We dream of immensely valuable future conditions but spend so much 
time with these future scenarios that we are doing less that will get
ourselves to that future than the superstitious Mormon following a 
culturally evolved, basic healthy lifestyle.

It's great dreaming of the future, but the future will actually belong to
those who make it there.  Here are some steps I hope we can take to make it
there:
+ Don't rant on about the virtues of selfishness, you are contradcting
yourself.  If you think selfishness is so great, then you should just be 
selfish and not let anybody else in on it.  (Unless of course you obtain 
joy by bothering people!).  the people who make it to the future will
have cared immensely about themvelves, but they will also have pulled
together, to solve the many public goods problems we need to solve, such 
as creating a hospitable climate (freedom for transhuman efforts in a
Luddite world), getting each other out of cryonics at the other end, and 
so on.
+ be more focused on particular areas of expertise where we can 
make a difference in the short term.  "Tend our own gardens" -- Voltaire.
"Operate in the circle of influence" -- Covey.
+ we need to be much more _short_ sighted, greedy and local when it
comes to most of our lives.  We can live and proper in the present, 
creating capital with which to get to the future, in light of knowledge
of our longer-term path and potential.  Don't obsess about the grass
greener over the hill and starve in the pastures where we presently
can graze, to get the energy needed to make it over the hill.

Greed is good!  As is cooperation!  Lose the pathological 
combination of selfishness and future-obsession, but  keep
in mind the lessons we have learned and the wonder awaiting us
if we succeed in the here and now.

Onwards, 
Zylof

Very well said!  When you listen to Hans Moravec, he seems to almost relish the
time when robots will "take over" and "replace" us.  Words he has used on many
occasions. Lately, he has started toning down his lanquage by stating that our
robot descendant might take pity on us by uploading us into their matrix.

The market caters to the local supplies and demands of suppliers 
and customers, about which these parties know a great deal.
The market operates in what Covey calls the "circle of influence",
while ignoring idealistic but ignorant desires about what the global
state of the world "should be".  These idealistic global desired
states are what critics of the market refer to when they say that the
market is not producing what people really want or need, or what "should"
be produced.  For conditions of which customers and suppliers actually 
have great and unique knowledge, the market is bringing about desired 
states vastly more often than the critics can imagine, or could bring 
about in any globally planned way.

Academics misunderstand and often despise markets for two major reasons:
+ They think in a manner with implicit pretense of omniscience,
discounting local knowledge as prejudice to be eliminated.
+ They tend to be funded by governments.

Local knowledge can be perhaps compared to mass, while voluntary
contract and the price system is analogous to gravitaional attraction
in converting local conditions into global order.  Price communicates
local knowledge and free local ethical values in the highly compressed, 
efficient form of a shared value scale.

When one of these global desires is so compelling and rational, 
but obviously unmet, we look for a public goods problem: a 
situation where supply of a good is not undertaken because free riders
cannot be excluded.

Zylof

Nation-states tended to come sooner, and took up more of the 
totalitarian Justinian code, on the Continent than in Britain.
Remote outposts like Iceland were able to hold out for several
more centuries.  I judge this to be due to the public goods nature
of defense technologies and strategies, favoring centralization more 
on the Continent where there is greater exposure to invasion,
and more dependence on fixed agriculture.

But this trend is not inevitable.  Totalitarian centralization had 
earlier reached such stifling proportions in the late Roman Empire that 
tribes with Germanic, anarchic codes similar to Iceland's were able 
to overrun it.  But in converting from mobile to fixed land 
production, the public goods problem among the conquerers came
to resemble those of the Empire, and empires (e.g., Caliphates, 
Caroligians) re-emerged, and later still nation-states.

Our modern U.S. tax code stresses dependence on locale, especially
in the form of mortgage deductions.  This serves to keep subjects
vulnerably fixed, dependent on geographical jurisdictions to solve
their defense problems.  With our transportation and communications
technologies, our mode of production of itself no longer stands in
the way of returnining to non-state law; indeed in the case of the
Internet the application of geographical law is increasingly seen
as ludicrous.  The fixed vulnerability of industrial plant and rail is
giving way to mobile capital, with political  institutions adapting at 
their typical excruciatingly slow pace.

Onwards,
Zylof

UFO-Comet Cult: Murders by "Viruses of the Mind?"
From:  Dick Farley <cloudrider@aol.com> 

(by whom the FOLLOWING supplemental MATERIAL IS "COPYRIGHT 1997", excluding
that of "Sheldon Nidle.")

(Hale-Bopp material follows this Introduction & "bio" sketch.)
From: cloudrider@aol.com ///
  The "forwarded" e-mail following this commentary was from Wes Thomas
<west@sonic.net>, who routinely forwards information to various online
researchers and monitors of various "cults" of UFO believers, "conspiracist"
publications and alleged "mind-influencing" technologies and claimed victims
of same. 
  Thomas sent this to his distribution list as noted on the following e-mail
date, making an observation and soliciting opinions about one "Sheldon
Nidle," who has become in recent months one of the more prominent "online"
channellers and "annunciators" of the so-called "civilization" whose
spacecraft he some assert has been "riding-in-hiding" in the tail of Comet
Hale-Bopp.
  Other online denizens of the "UFO world," as well as graduates and veterans
of various "remote viewing" programs of CIA and the Defense Intelligence
Agency (some now in more or less private "psi" practices) have also been
asserting "ET" or "alien" presences and activities coming into play as Comet
Hale-Bopp is passing.
  According to the Internet, Sheldon Nidle has been getting some
"amplification" among the anarchy and "conspiracy" communities via his
several appearances on "The Art Bell Show," a syndicated late-night radio
program that focuses on "UFOs" and other conspiracies, but which
conspicuously has avoided, (according to folks more closely monitoring Art
Bell than have I), any references, topics or indulgence of folks who'll
discuss alleged "mind-control" or "mind-influencing" programs, whether inside
or outside of government...(of the U. S. or of "others").
  Perhaps most noisily prominent among several of the former and acknowledged
"Remote Viewers" associated with CIA "Grill Flame" and later, DIA's "Star
Gate" progams of psychic spying (see references at end of this introduction &
Sheldon Nidle's pronouncement)...is David Morehouse, who has publicly been
making claims and predictions about "Hale-Bopp" and its associated phenomena.
He's authored "Psychic Warrior," a questionable and questioned tale about his
erstwhile career, although other "insiders" suggest Morehouse's is carefully
crafted disinformation. And he's attracted big money and film-making
attention.
  Another primary "Hale-Bopp & aliens" claimant has been one Major Ed Dames,
(formerly U. S. Army), who works now with a fading "psychic spying/remote
viewing" company called Psi-Tech. One of Dames' "trainees" and graduates is
an Emory University professor, Courtney Brown, Ph. D., who previously worked
at the Carter Center. Dr. Brown has published a book about "ET" interactions,
and recently, Dr. Brown has been reported as becoming a "believer" in the
Hale-Bopp "aliens-are-here" scenario, and he has reportedly spoken publicly
about this.
  Also, one Dr. Stephen Greer, based in Asheville, NC,  a physician, ("TM"
hierarch; Bah'a'i); and chairman of a non-profit group called "C-SETI"
(Center for Study of Extra-Terrestrial Intelligences)...has enjoyed high
levels of financial support (from Laurance S. Rockefeller; and the BSW
Foundation, in New York) for his proclaimed efforts (Project Starlight) in
making "contact" with "approaching alien beings."
Greer also has been reportedly advocating for some kind of "Hale-Bopp"
signalled imminent "contact."
  Beyond Greer, other advocates for Hale-Bopp as a "harbinger" for supposed
"alien contactings" have been the wife of former Reagan-era U. S. Ambassador
to France, Marie "Bootsie" Galbraith, (wife of Evan G. Galbraith, both
residing in New York City); and former Sergeant Major Robert Dean, retired
from the U. S. Army with duty at SHAEF, (Europe), in recent years a prominent
UFO "believer," (quoted most recently in the current issue of the tabloid,
"The Sun"). Dean is said to believe he's a reincarnated "Templar," from the
old Freemasonic tradition.
  Funding for these folks has come from Rockefeller and Las Vegas "UFO buff"
and real estate entrepreneur Robert Bigelow (who's had extensive dealings
with the Resolution Trust Corp. in "turning around" properties salvaged from
"fire sales" associated with the S & L scandals), and HRH Prince Hans Adam
II, ruler and head of government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, as
Defender of The Faith, etc.
  Prince Hans Adam has been a "behind the scenes" funder of so-called "UFO
believer" gambits since the late 1980s, including of a conference (TREAT-92)
headed by the wife of the current Chairman of PSI-TECH (referenced above, in
re Major Ed Dames), who is a retired Maj. General Stubblebine, former head of
the Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), also described as being
a "true believer" in the "alien hypothesis," as is his wife the "UFO
hypnotherapist."
 A former senior CIA scientist and neurophysiologist, Dr. Christopher "Kit"
Green, has described many of these folks (and their powerful backers) as
being part of an "international cult," infected with a "mental contagion."
(Interview with this writer, June 1994.)
  With these recent 39, and previous deaths associated with the so-called
"Solar Temple" of the late Luc Jouret, and in view of Jouret's previous
involvements (as a "trainer", though some said as "mind control" guru) with
several of Canada's powerful oil, gas and utility operations before his
death, those in search of more background and some answers associated with
this most recent tragedy (and perhaps "psychic homocide"?) of these 39 "true
believing" UFO cultists should cast their nets widely! These people were
murdered, whether directly or not.
  Two recent books provide various levels of documentation and context about
so-called "psi" and heavily focused "extra-terrestrial" or "alien
intelligence" interactions by operatives with high intelligence, but
apparently destabilized frames-of-reference and losses of perspective.
  1.  Schnabel, Jim. "Remote Viewers: The Secret History of America's Psychic
Spies." 1997. Dell (paperback). 452 pages.  $5.99. ISBN # 0-440-22306-7.  //
 Schnabel is a London-based "science writer" widely reported to be associated
as a friendly author for Central Intelligence Agency. He has written
previously about the so-called "alien abduction" phenomenon, in
"Dissociation" journal, back in 1994. His most recent book is the most
comprehensive and factual disclosure of U. S. government-sponsored research
and operations in areas of "remote viewing" and "psi." Schnabel touches on
allegations of so-called "applied anomalous phenomena" by other agencies or
"rogue elements" funded by outside sources. (Our own work has developed ample
and primary documentation of these "off-books" activities, targeting
belief-systems of U. S. citizens.)
The other reference is an unpublished, but scheduled book:
  2.  Marrs, Jim. "Alien Agenda: Investigating the Extraterrestrial Presence
Among Us." June 1997. Harpercollins. 464 Pages. $24.00. ISBN # 0-06-018642-9.
// Marrs authored the best-selling "Crossfire," described as the "most widely
read book about the JFK assassination." It is claimed that Oliver Stone based
his film, "JFK," in large part on Marrs' book.
   Marrs' latest book (in pre-publication version) includes considerable
material obviously provided by former (but highly controversial and
questionable) "ex-remote viewer," David Morehouse. And a great deal of
Morehouse's quoted narrative in Marrs' book is about "ETs," notably
"Hale-Bopp." It is probable that Marrs' (and Morehouse's) approach is one of
carefully crafted disinformation, as Marrs' book is notable for what he
leaves out...which is not much in terms of "UFO" activities in recent years.
Marrs' covers the field very credibly, although he neglects scenarios where
some of these described phenomena and experiences of "UFO percipients" might
have correlate causes in so-called "mind-influencing" technologies, either
via "hardware/software" approaches, or from purported "psi" and "applied
anomalous phenomena" techniques such as "dream influence," direct "psychic
attack" affecting emotions, and "psychic driving." This employs emotionally
based "reinforcement" of carefully crafted "alternative belief structures"
(alternatively described as "mind-viruses", similar in effect on the human
mind to computer-viruses), which have been described in psychiatric
literature, most frequently in terms of "CIA mind control." This, in recent
years, has become a euphemistic term as "mind influence" R & D has apparently
moved outside government and infested academic and philanthropic
institutions, here and offshore.

  A recent "Sheldon Nidle" script about the "Hale-Bopp" transferences
follows, as it was circulated LAST WEEK among various observers of these
trends and belief-system manipulations. We have two years' worth of data
(names; text; contexts; past associations; content-analyses, funding)
centering on the so-called "UFO field," (UFOlogy), now coming into public
domain and production.

Bio sketch: 
  (Dick Farley is a free-lance journalist and public policy analyst who has
followed these issues since 1973, while pursuing a parallel career in the
development of programming for non-profit organizations and mainstream
journalism. He was an honoree by Associated Press (Chesapeake Division,
Delaware/Maryland/District of Columbia), receiving the 1990 "Mark Twain
Award" for Investigative Reporting. He's been a published writer for 20
years.
  Recruited to work with the "Human Potential Foundation, Inc.," founded
(1989) by U. S. Senator Claiborne Pell and funded primarily by philanthropist
Laurance S. Rockefeller, Farley worked (1991-1994) for HPF president, Dr.
Cecil B. "Scott" Jones, Jr., who is a retired U. S. Navy Commander and former
naval intelligence operative, DIA "asset" and naval attache to Nepal while
assistant naval attache to India, later a contract operative for KamanTEMPO,
Inc., then Special Assistant to Senator Pell. Disagreeing with Jones'
approach to "UFOs," Farley on his own downgraded to consultant in Feb., 1994;
he later was laid off when HPF ceased its public operations in May, 1994.
  (In a separate and unrelated matter, Dr. Jones was accused by his female
Executive Assistant of allegedly "exhibiting improper behavior in their
personal relationship," a matter remaining unresolved between them. She was
abruptly terminated by HPF's board in April of 1994.)
  Farley served as Director of Project Development of the HPF, and is listed
as contract liason between HPF and Dr. John Mack's "Center for Psychology and
Social Change", in the documents conveying the first $194,000 from Laurance
Rockefeller to Dr. Mack's "PEER" Project studying "alien abductions," which
was routed through the Human Potential Foundation (1993). Farley was
acknowledged by Dr. John Mack, along with Cdr. Jones and Laurance Rockefeller
among others, in Dr. Mack's book, "Abduction," first published by Simon &
Schuster in 1994.
  Farley also contributed the "Matrix of UFO Beliefs," which was provided to
the Clinton White House in conjunction with Laurance Rockefeller's (4/93 &
2/4/94) approaches to Dr. John Gibbons, White House Science Advisor, to
encourage W.H. declassification of so-called "UFO information" the U. S.
government might be retaining.
  His "Matrix of UFO Beliefs" was included in materials the White House
released in answer to several Freedom of Information requests (1994 & 1995).
  Farley resigned his HPF position on 3 Feb 1994, so he could provide
independent documentation to the White House about the Rockefeller "UFO
Initiative," after Cdr. Jones refused to emphasize the demonstrable "mind
control" components associated with a predominance of purported "UFO"
experiences as reported.       
  Subsequent journalistic and private investigation by Farley and colleagues
has produced substantial documentation that considerable of the so-called
"UFO" and "paranormal" phenomena, widely reported as "ET-related," are
victimizations of U. S. and foreign citizens by agents, cultists and "global
mind change" advocates associated with transnational cartels &
non-governmental agents fostering clandestine Post-Cold War realignments.
  Farley is married to an environmental scientist, and they are parents of a
son with multiple handicapping conditions. He serves as an ordained and
ruling elder in the Presbyterian Church - USA. He is a former "Life Scout,"
worked previously (1981-1983) as Coordinator of Information and Policy
Analysis for the then- 200,000-member Cousteau Society, and is a registered
political Independent.
  His book about these issues is in preparation.

Update by Sheldon Nidle for The Galactic Federation March 18 ,1997 
(6Manik, 15 Ceh, 5 Eb)

Greetings! We come, as we promised, to give you some additional data about
your planet's holographic interiors, as well as the divine plan for each
soul grouping in your population. This data will primarily concentrate on
the first two groupings of "star seeds" and "advanced Earth souls". In
addition, we shall give you new intelligence about your planet and its mass
landings. So let us start this brief discussion with some more detail about
the post-mass landing scenario. This material can roughly be divided into
two partsothe interiors scenario and the teaching program. We shall begin
with the interiors scenario.
As we last stated, the first 30 holographic interiors are now completed.
These prototypes are only the first of hundreds of thousands of such
facilities that will be built during the next six galactic months. The
prime question should not be their exact number and location, but how you
will be quickly transported into these facilities. The key to this problem
is a unique set of technologies that have been modified by the scientists
and technicians of our defense forces. In our recent past, it was often
extremely necessary to teleport vast amounts of both personnel and material
from orbiting space stations to planet-side, or to evacuate these same
elements off-planet to awaiting ships in as quickly a time frame as possible.


Consequently, given the proper number of cargo and transportation ships,
the capability of those systems is quite enormous. For example, the nearly
one million ships that we now have available could easily teleport all
inhabitants of the 30 designated metropolitan areas, as well as their
personal goods, in less than one hour. However, we have set up a special
plan that lengthens this process to almost six hours. This evacuation plan
includes a number of important elements. First, we wish all such designated
Earth humans to have the time to decide what personal items they want to
take with them. Second, we want to quickly permit them to tell any
relatives and friends where they will be. All immediate family members will
be a part of this evacuation process. Finally, we want to have time for a
brief training in how to operate the new technologies that they shall be
exposed to.

Hence, the plan has been established to allow the maximum amount of
interaction conceivable between Earth inhabitants and Galactic Federation
personnel. The new environments will be paradises compared to the old ones
on the Earth's surface. Moreover, you will be allowed to carry with you
those items that you deem necessary. Any other items can be easily created
by the processors that will be provided to each household. You will not be
isolated. Communication technologies such as holographic video
teleconferencing and various telepathic devices make it possible to
instantly communicate with anyone you so desire. Finally, we will provide a
quick training of approximately 30 minutes that will prepare you to use
these advanced technologies. Included in this package will be rapid contact
to any technician that you may need to successfully work this equipment.

Having been put in these new habitats, you will quickly notice an important
fact. Your type of training and your immediate responsibilities are based
on your particular soul grouping. In previous messages, we have delineated
these soul groupings. Now, let us look more deeply at these soul groups and
their responsibilities in the post-mass landing environment. This
discussion will look at two pointsothe nature of their tasks and how
quickly each grouping will go into full consciousness.

The first soul group to be looked at is the so-called "star seeds". This
specific category constitutes less than two per cent of Earth's population.
You represent what we like to call our ground crew. You wonderful souls
have come from many different parts of our galaxy and in some rare cases,
even from other galaxies. Each one of you has the great responsibility to
act as both the teacher and counselor for your brethren. Many Galactic
Federation counselors have had several lifetimes on your planet. However,
you now possess a particular knowledge of what is presently happening on
your world. Your vital experience has and will be a vital link for the
entire training process. 
This primary reason is why you may have had past dreams in which you were
questioned about your daily life on this planet. However, many of you were
just questioned and then made to forget this experience. Federation liaison
teams were just seeking an appraisal of what is occurring on your world.
Because of your input, these liaison teams have designed a very accelerated
training program for you. This program will begin some two hours before the
mass landings. We will use protected scalar technology to initially contact
you telepathically. When the heavenly calming music begins, we will
teleport you to special transports for your training and transformation
into full conscious beings. Just before the mass landings begin, you will
be beamed back to your residences. Your task will be to assist all Earth
humans who are in panic over what is happening. You will also aid other
persons in adjusting to their new environment after the mass landings.

The second group that we will review is the advanced Earth souls. This
group can be likewise divided into three subgroups. The first subgroup is
composed of those souls that have been chosen to assist the "star seeds"
and the Galactic Federation counselors in completing their tasks. This
subgroup is only about seven per cent of the Earth's population.  Many of
these beings are now in the process of first "waking up" and  beginning to
understand what is about to happen to your planet. They will be given
priority in becoming fully conscious, if they are needed to assist us to
complete the ten-day accelerated training that will prepare most of you for
your new conscious realities.

The second subgroup is composed of those souls who are now completing their
present Earth karmic cycles. It encompasses over 77 per cent of the Earth's
human population. This soul subgroup is the major reason for the entire
mass landing scenario. Most of these individuals have been unable to fully
understand the vast changes now taking place around them. Yet they have a
feeling that something is about to happen. Unfortunately, this feeling is
completely encased in the many fears that are a part of their environment
as well as their genetics. Their training will consist of special
one-on-one counseling, as well as rapid schooling using various advanced
learning technologies. These specially prepared technologies will quickly
ready them to become full participants in creating Earth's new galactic
civilization.
The third and final Earth soul subgroup is those beings who are now
unprepared for this transformation. This subgroup consists of less than one
per cent of the Earth's human population. It is now being evaluated by
specially chosen Federation counselors. This soul subgroup will be
transported to a special planetary system in the Pleiades star cluster just
after the mass landings. The present profiles indicate that the majority
can be turned toward the Light. Those individuals who do will be given the
opportunity to return to Earth. However, the others who do not, will be
incarnated on less hospitable worlds where they can finally learn their
needed karmic lessons.

Let us now turn our attention to your planet. In the past few weeks, the
planet's magnetics have begun to dip to a level that indicated a quite deep
intent to shift into a new inter-dimensional reality before the galactic
month's end. To counter this potential problem, Federation scientists began
a designated program to stabilize Earth's magnetics as well as other
related phenomena. On 4 Chicchan, 13 Ceh, 5 Eb (March 16, 1997), they
introduced some changes to the Earth's hologram that will induce a slight
delay into the Earth's longing to now change into an inter-dimensional
being. This program will be completed by 7 Lamat, 16 Ceh, 5 Eb (March 19,
1997). 

These new changes to the Earth's hologram will permit planet Earth to
better phase its changes to accommodate the time frame agreed upon by the
Spiritual Hierarchy and the Galactic Federation. This process allows us to
consummate the final aspects of the mass landing scenario in truly divine
time. Right now, the various segments of the mass landing team are
assembling the final elements of this plan. This plan has, as you have
seen, a most complicated series of stages that have been completed. Only a
very, very, very few stages still remain that separate us from engaging the
mass landing operation. 

One of these vital procedures is the elimination of a vast amount of fear
in your general population. This factor is a prime concern of your Angelic
Hierarchy. They wish to have you know that their special procedures will
help you to bring this fear under control. However, we will discuss this
program in very great detail in our next message. It is essential that all
of you understand how easy it will be to bring this fear under control. We
know that this program can be quickly implemented and set the final energy
patterns for the mass landings. Just know that these mass landings will
happen very, very, very, very soon.

Let us close this message with a few words to all concerned. First, the
Galactic Federation is about to complete the greatest first-contact
operation in its history. We do not perform these tasks without much
thought and strategy. It has indeed been an incredible education program
for all personnel in our commands. Second, we wish to fully thank all of
you on planet Earth for providing the great assistance and patience that
you have given us. It is not easy to go through the great amounts of
transformation that you have and still live in your limited
three-dimensional reality. You have gone through much to complete this
landing process.  Third, we wish to thank planet Earth (Gaia) and her
Spiritual Hierarchies. They have gone much beyond what their duty demanded
to help us finish this operation successfully. Finally, we wish to thank
all the elements of Creation that have assisted us in completing this
operation successfully. We now leave you with salutations of Love, Light,
and Joy. 
Selamat Ja! (Be in joy!)

Please describe a cylindrical symetric chamber

That's the point, to give them a new personality through brain-washing.

Balancing Acts


In a day like today
(Or any other day),
We can count on the moon
To drive the sun away,
But what we do not see
(Or what we don't want to see)
Is that a balance is what
Makes 'we' be a we.

When the time is now
(Or any time but now),
We can rely on others
To show us how,
But what we can't seem to do
(Or seem to not want to do)
Is render that knowledge
And let our minds say it's true.

        I believe that one of Rand's key intentions with her terminology and
application of meanings to words was to focus on *why* we classify such
words as 'undesirable'.  If you take a look at the word "selfish" without
any of the culturally provided baggage, it basically means: 'one who is
absorbed in his or her own interests'.  I see nothing wrong with that as it
is, nor did Rand.
What is unfortunate is how discredited the word has become due to all the
baggage that has been associated with it through the decades.  Now the word
"selfish" has been perverted to meaning "miserly", "conceited" and "uncaring".
"Selfish" is just one of the words that Rand took the liberty of
re-evaluating.  There are thousands of fnords in the English language, and
it is a lot easier to create them than eliminate them.

        You forget that this is merely a list that deals with the arguments
and information provided by like-minded people...a list exclusively made for
such discourse.  Most (if not all) on this list do more for extropy than
check their mail every hour and subscribe to a few magazines.  Extropy's
something that I cannot even comprehend being idle and wishy-washy about.  I
would wager that most people on this list were extropians before they even
heard the term spoken.

        As I said, it depends on how you want to look at the meaning of
selfishness.  If you are totally unselfish (looking at the uncorrupted
meaning of the word) you are an altruist.  How can *you* have a cause if
*you* are not selfish?

>+ we need to be much more _short_ sighted, greedy and local when it

        I simply disagree, though I hope you intended a different meaning
than I received.  Extropy is generally a balance between short and long
sight, as well as a balance between optimism and realism.  When you are
enacting the present, always consider the ramifications it can have on the
future.

cloning could play a part in that.  Even so, it is not necessary to clone
adults.  Separating embryos at the four or eight cell stage will work much
better.

production and make heat transfer to the environment more efficient could
prove essential as the ozone layer becomes thinner and the earth gets war-

there are surely others which we know nothing about as yet.

have at least one normal gene, or (s)he would never have reached adulthood,
so ~50% of the gametes could be used for in vitro fertilization.  Once the

This raises an interesting point. What is the PURPOSE of establishing guilt?
Interestingly, in Shawn's original post he inquired into the concept of
"punishment" -a hot topic in debate circles. But the list did not pick up
that thread.
Culpablitity means one has been rendered "harmful" and punishment attempts to
repair and pervent further harm. Is it even effective? Can preventative
measures be more effective? 

>  Is capability of murder enough for guilt?
>  Who is not capable of knifing some one?

This raises another ETHICS question: Do you past experiences make you what
you are? 

(One comes upon this question when confronted with the OJ trials.) 

Most people would fear a known killer, they would judge him capable of
repeating the act - even expect it in some. 

Re: the last question:Many are capable, should we  punish them before they do
it? Many are not, should we punish them anyway ( in a sense we are, because
we all pay heavily for jails, lawyers and police systems)? Are you suggesting
original sin?
; - )
GC

( And again, since cloning , not replication, is the technology at hand, and
genomes don't come equipped with implanted memories, this 'identical copy'
thread - re; cloning anyway, is  a fun but 'mental' masterbation??  ; )

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Last Wednesday, March 26, from 1:00 - 3:00 on national television's The
Family Channel's hit program  "Home and Family" produced a segment on
"Fountain of Youth" with a focus on neurosuspensions.

Did anyone see it?  

I was the featured guest, along with David Caradine, the 1992 women's
olympic champion (swimming), Marilyn Keegan (radio personality and
psychologist).

The show's host, Cristina Ferrara (well known Ford Agency model) was
remarkably sweet and interested in cryonics.  She gave me the opportunity to
discuss a neurosuspension, why one would choose neuro over whole body, a bit
about the cryonics procedure, and why it is a viable measure in preserving
life.  I hadn't met Cristina before, so I didn't have a clue that she is a
very religious person, and openly believes Jesus her savior.  Even in light
of this, as I found out mid-way during the "live" show, she maintained a
sense of humor and sincere interest.  She also did not embarrass me nor
attempt to ridicule cryonics nor neurosuspensions (she even gave me a
complementary quote for my Web site which I will put up at some point.)

The show ended with twenty people on "stage" asking all sorts of serious,
informed as well as fun-provoking questions.  We laughed - kidded.  One man
who was self-professed "out of shape" teased me about the possibility of my
having to use his body as a resort if bio-tech bodies are not available at
my reanimation.  I told him I have an insurance policy against that option
-;)  He said he wanted Cristina's body (its' made a ton of money), and she
said she wanted one that had less bulk on it and searched around the room
for one that she would reserve.  Off the air, she asked me what Jesus would
do if he came to get her body and couldn't find her head!  (In that if she
was a neurosuspendee, her head would be in a dewar).  We had a good laugh.

Although the fun was during the last few minutes of the show, I did have a
fair amount of time to answer pertinent questions and to reach a lot of
America about extending life indefinitely and neurosuspension.

Subject: w00f: Worth reading...

This article is light background on Cults using the WWW. It's worth 
reading and includes more info on the weirdos who recently killed 
themselves. I've discovered that I have a videotape they sent me a couple 
years ago when they called themselves Total Overcomers Anonymous. I must 
say that the video is either the product of a disturbed mind or a very 
stupid joke. It's called "Beyond Human - The Last Call." If anyone's 
interested I'll type in the text on the front and back of the case for 
you. Anyway, here's the article:

Cybercults earn money, recruit on Web

It was advertised as a meeting on "UFOs, SPACE ALIENS, and their final 
fight for Earth's Spoils." 

But many of 30 young people crowded into the suburban Birmingham, Ala., 
library meeting room on April 9, 1994, were
disappointed. 

The speakers quickly veered away from ET and into a New Age mix of 
reincarnation, spiritual evolution and a Gospel where
Jesus was "the Captain" and God was "the Chief of Chiefs." 

Still, the three women and one man, pleasant and neatly dressed, made an 
impression on a few teen-agers. 

"They said, 'You may feel this speaks to you or rings a bell with you. 
This probably means you are one of these people waiting
to go to the next level,' " recalls Bob Waldrep of the Watchman 
Fellowship, a Christian ministry that tracks cults. 

Waldrep remembers two or three teens staying to talk with the speakers. 
He also remembers a chilling part of their talk. 

"They said to step out of the human kingdom to the next level you have to 
put away everything, family, possessions -
everything," Waldrep says. 

Almost exactly four years later, 39 members of the same cult did give up 
everything, committing a mass suicide that their
Internet Web site said would allow their souls to be scooped up by a 
spacecraft trailing the Hale-Bopp comet. 

The deaths apparently end the odyssey of the little-known group that 
started as a desert commune in the 1970s and evolved
into a cybertech cult whose bodies were found near banks of computers in 
a posh mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. 

It is this evolution that troubles cult watchers. 

The group used the World Wide Web for both its business, called Higher 
Source, and its Web page, Heaven's Gate, which
was used to snag new recruits. It used buzzwords designed to catch 
browsers whose interest ranged from UFOs and
conspiracies to the spiritual and religious. 

The Rancho Santa Fe group is not the only cult in cyberspace. 

"Cults are using the Internet for a number of different purposes - to 
recruit, to support themselves, and as apologists," says
John Knapp, executive director of trancenet.org a Burke, N.Y. group that 
follows exploitative psychological techniques that
appear on the World Wide Web. 

Steve Hassan, a Boston-based cult expert who has counseled former members 
and their families for 20 years, says the
Internet is a simmering cauldron of cult activity. 

"There are newsgroups about different cults, there are webpages put up by 
different cults. Aum Shinrikyo (the Japanese cult
that attacked the Tokyo subway with poison gas in 1995) recruited on the 
Web and produced animated videotapes," he says.
"I've heard of some people who have been recruited on the Web, but no one 
knows the numbers." 

Arnold Chanon Bloch, a Los Angeles psychotherapist who has worked with 
scores of cult members and their families, says,
"If the theology is carefully laid out in print, it's going to have an 
appeal to people who are experiencing a spiritual void or
unresolved psychological pain." 

Lure of the message 

There is little information about how many members actually were 
recruited that way by the Rancho Santa Fe cult. But Bloch
says there are times in our lives when we all could be susceptible to the 
lure of a cult's comforting philosophy. 

"A time of personal crisis, the loss of loved one, a medical problem, 
they can lead us all to ask questions that are hard to
answer," he says. "For people who are less socially integrated, I would 
say the Internet could be another pathway for groups
trying to recruit new membership." 

According to information garnered from the group's own leaflets, 
newspaper ads and its Heaven's Gate Web site, the cult
began as a commune in the mid-1970s and developed a cosmology drawn from 
Eastern and Western religions, New Age
philosophies, UFO rumors and Star Trek wistfulness. 

The cult sought new devotees, first by the traditional means of meetings 
and word of mouth and then by a growing use of
media. 

On May 27, 1993, the group, calling itself Total Overcomers Anonymous, 
took out a $29,911 three-quarter-page ad on the
op-ed page of USA TODAY titled, "UFO CULT RESURFACES WITH FINAL OFFER." 

In January 1994, according to its Web site text, "we sold all of our 
worldly possessions except for a few cars and changes of
clothing and set out cross country holding free public meetings from 
coast to coast for nine months . . ." 

It was during that tour that Waldrep saw the group in Birmingham. The 
members called themselves Sawyer, Even, Millie and
Nora. They said their leaders were Do and Ti, although they said names 
were as unimportant as the temporary bodies our
spirits inhabit. 

"They were pleasant, healthy, good-looking people who used UFOs as a way 
to draw people to the meeting, but the real lure
was to offer a way of filling the spiritual vacuum in the audience," 
Waldrep says. 

But when the face-to-face recruitment ended, the group sought other 
means. 

In September 1995 it surfaced on line as "Undercover 'Jesus' " and "ET 
Presently Incarnate." 

On its Web site the group members recounted how the verbal attacks and 
ridicule they received on their 1994 tour "was the
signal to us to begin our preparations to return 'home.' " 

The effect of the group's presence on the Internet remains unknown. But 
Waldrep, Bloch and the others familiar with cults say
their philosophies would hit the mark among the right audience. 

And, they say, a glitzy Web site gains a credibility among browsers. 

"I think people in general are willing and eager to accept what they see 
on the World Wide Web," says Larry Rosen, a
psychologist at California State University at Dominguez Hills. "It looks 
so professional, and you can easily slide from a Nobel
Prize winner's Web site to a Web site that can be created by anybody." 

David Greenfield, a West Hartford, Conn. psychologist who works with 
computer addicts, says part of the Internet's power is
that groups can present bizarre messages in a mainstream way. 

Recruiting followers on the Internet is more efficient because the cults 
"will reach a lot of disenfranchised people with it."
Computer communication requires no social skills, he says, and is for 
many users an isolated activity. 

"I'm not saying that everybody that hangs out on the Net all day long is 
a loser, but I am saying that if you hang out on the
Internet all day long, you will be a loser." 

As officials struggle with the task of identifying the victims in Rancho 
Santa Fe, Waldrep worries about the uncounted number
of devotees to this or other cults who may be out there looking for 
answers. 

"It saddens me that people are out there looking for something to fufill 
their lives and instead of finding that fufillment they find
something that leads to their deaths," says Waldrep.

Uh, this seems silly. You don't need to 'give a computer feelings and
emotions'. If (and that's a large if) our brains are simply sophisticated
computers, then you already are a computer program and you are already
programmed for those feelings and emotions (assuming that we include some 
simulation of the relevant body processes outside the brain itself); so 
whether you're running on silicon or goop is irrelevant. If we aren't just 
sophisticated computers (e.g. we have 'souls' or something) then uploading 
probably won't work anyway.

I may be missing something, but isn't this the kind of voluntary,

Speak for yourself... the vast majority of the human race probably fit
into that category (talking and imagining rather than doing), but the
extropians I've met don't seem to. This may be because I tend to meet
those who have done things which make them stand out on the Net.

Well, OK, I do like rally-driving, scuba-diving, jetboats and ultralights
and think that helicopters are totally cool, particularly when they're
leaning over on their side. But that's because I'm not entirely sure that
life-extension will be possible and I don't want to discover that in fifty
years time and realise that I'd missed out on a lot of fun for nothing.

Hmm, I wrote a PGP-aware email program for Sun/Linux/FreeBSD, which is
used by a lot of people around the world for secure, private email. Some
of my code was or is in the Mixmaster remailer, and I co-ran a remailer
for some time. I was also involved in the Digicash ecash trials a couple
of years ago. Other extropians have written code for PGP and released
secure Web servers and proxies. There seems to be a large overlap between
the active extropians and active cypherpunks. 

Of course from my point of view this was a totally selfish pursuit, as in
order to protect my privacy I have to work to protect privacy in general.
So what looks like altruism to one may be selfish to another.

It's just what any webauthor does to get his or her page to show up
first in number of hits, so its at the head of the list that search
engines return to browsers. It just like what every sex related

For the record, it appeared that I was being quoted as saying all the above,
but in fact, those were someone else's responses to things which I had said.
 Here are my responses to U.Sov.'s final comments:

>Furthermore, I think that the resources of the original should
>be divided equally with the clone, as the clone was just as responsible
>for achiveing the wealth as the original.

>Cloning is giving birth to a life form.
>Must I give up half of what I own to a child not yet born?

I would say that, in the case of complete and perfect replication (intact
with memories), not just regular cloning, then the copy is in fact just as
much the original as was the original at the time of the copy.  Thus, it
would be inaccurate to say it is "a child not yet born".  If you walk into a
duplication chamber of some type, and knowingly copy yourself, the "you" that
comes out of the side marked "the copy", will be no less the person who
originally walked into the duplication chamber than the person who comes out
of the side marked "the original".  It's not like a photo copying machine,
where there is a 15% degradation in quality.  It is 100% the original.  I
think the question of "who's who" loses meaning in the debate.  The fact is
you slit into two pieces (seemingly).

I would like to furthur one of my original comments which few people have
picked up upon.  The question of "punishment".  The only form of punishment I
think to be valid is to have the "criminal" make restitution to the best of
his/her/its ability, then to work on changing the original "flaw" which
caused the crime.  Remember, I speak only of real crimes, not socially
imagined ones (rampant in the imaginations of many).  To simply "punish"
someone causes no net benefit to anyone, but is rather a form of revenge.  I
see no purpose in prisons at all.  Either do as I suggest, or impliment a
death penalty.  I opt for the prior.  If someone is truely "beyond help", if
there is such a thing, then either hold them in a special labor camp until we
can neurally restructure them, or put them into cryo-stasis until that time.
 This would be the most logical and "humane" thing to do.  If anyone has
anything to add, please do so.

In response to another statement:
>As for neural modifications, I would doubt that
>they would be effective, without destroying the victims personality.

>That's the point, to give them a new personality through brain-washing.
>It is being done.

I don't think neural restructuring would destroy the original person.  I'm
only speaking of eliminating the particular characteristic which is harmful
(pleasure in killing, raping, stealing, etc.).  It would be the best thing
anyone could do for the person.  It involves less force than would killing
the person.  Force is not to be used EXCEPT in self defense or preventing an
"insane" person from doing furthur harm.  'Til next time, Shawn Johnson.

You cannot simply program emotions if the hardware cannot experience
them. My body including my brain can experience emotions. Computers, as
of yet, cannot experience emotions, and this is not so much a software
problem as it is a hardware problem. Thus, to further articulate my
statement:

Until there becomes an interest in developing the necessary "hardware"
to enable computers to experience feelings and emotions [felt
sensations] then uploading will remain somewhat of a ludic concept to
me. Once I am uploaded in a computer, if I cannot experience
emotions/feelings, then there really isn't any reason for me to continue
existing.

You can program to your hearts content for a thousand millinium, but if
you don't create the proper hardware or peripheals, computers will never
be able to experience emotions. It is extremely naive to think that you
can simply program emotions, as if some scientist could suddenly program
his Pentium 200 to enjoy data-processing.   

Without emotions there is no happiness, appreciation, joy, thrill,
ectsasy, exhileration, sadness, adventure, etcetera. Without emotion
there is no reason for me to exist. 

Explore and play!

Wrong. Objectivists (students of Objectivism) are NOT altruists promoting
selfishness. They are selfish people promoting rational self interest.

"Selfish" people promoting altruism can not be properly classified as
selfish. They may consider themselves as such, and mainstream society may
call them "selfish", but they are far from it. 

There is no conflict of interest among rational people. On the contrary,
there is a common interest in sharing ideas with other people. A rational
scientist developing nanotechnology who just found out that another
scientist next door has finally developed it for practical applications
would not sneak over there and steal or destroy his work. A "selfish"
person in the common context would. 

Two scientists who each have two halves of a puzzle completed would each
mutually benefit from sharing the info with each other (not to mention how
everyone else would benifit). Therefore, by working together, they are
acting in their own best interest by doing so. If one of them decides to
be "selfish" in the common context, they are not acting in their own best
interest, and therefore are selfLESS, caring more about social recognition
than self benefit.

Recent events involving a certain cult got me to thinking about the 
concept of transcendence, and how religious organizations tend to use 
the term in one way and transhumanists in another. 

I hereby propose the following definition to be added to Anders' 
glossary pages:

Transcendence:  Transformation of the identity, body, or mind into 
a more evolved or more complex state through processes consistent with 
the physical laws of the universe.  To be distinguished from the 
spiritual concept of transcendence, which implies movement of the soul 
into higher planes of existence.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

I'm not sure I'd agree with you on that. Perhaps that's the way that the
followers interpret things, but from my experience of Eastern mystics the
ego they're complaining about is the collection of ideas, plans and
misconceptions which seperate a human from external reality. Eliminating
that ego to 'become one with the universe' seems like a good idea to me.

There is a difference between a voluntary shrink-wrap license and
the Gnu copyleft; in the former, your acceptance of the terms must
precede your purchase, as evidenced by exchange of consideration.
That makes it a contract--and offer is made, accepted, and executed.
Stallman's software is free, and since no consideration is exchanged,
there can be no contract.  He simply gives you information, then
issues a unilateral pronouncement about how you will use it--or even
what you may derive from it--whether you consent or not.  And the
copyleft is (theoretically) binding even on those third parties who
come in contact with the information by perfectly legitimate means
without having examined any contractual terms.  It is, for example,
legal for me to post source code for GCC anonymously to the net. 
But then anyone who downloaded that anonymous post--and thereby
incurred real costs prior to examination of the contract--would be
bound by the copyleft nonetheless.

Trans- is a latin morphem meaning "over", "beyond"; it has nothing to do 
with transcendence (other than being a part of the word: 
trans+ascendere?). After all, transnational organizations are not very 
transcendent or religious.

Anders Sandberg responded:

Can you merely program a computer to see without creating optical
hardware? No! You can program pattern recognizing neural nets day in and
day out, but until you give the computer hardware [optics] to see with,
it cannot see ... no matter how hard you try to program it to do so.

Can you merely program a robot to walk? No! You have to give the thing
"legs" if you want it to walk, or wheels if you want it to roll. No
matter how much time you invest in programming a computer to either walk
or roll, that computer will do neither without the required hardware.

Can you merely program a computer to verbally talk? No! You have to give
the thing speakers or some other sort of vocal apparatus.

Can you ... ad infinitum

Emotions are felt in a physical manner. I *feel* sexual pleasure via my
organs. I *feel* hunger via my organs. I *feel* excitement via my
organs. Without this specialized hardware I would *feel* nothing. As a
computer I might be "aware" of conditions, but I would not *feel* those
conditions unless someone created specialized hardware that would allow
me to *feel*.

If a computer is to feel pleasure from the outside world it will require
peripheal nodes which can register sensation (pleasure and pain). If a
computer is to feel pleasure from its own internal processes it will
require internal nodes which can register sensation (pleasure and pain). 
We can program computers to think because that is what the hardware was
designed for. The hardware has not yet been designed to feel emotion.   
I imagine emotions will be incredably easy to program once we have the
enabling technology that allows computers to feel. But first there must
be an interest in doing so.

Like the man said, what evidence do you have of this?  The fact that
you experience physical sensations at the same time as your cognitive
state of emotion provides no evidence of which is cause and which is
effect, nor does it prove that there is anything necessary about those
physical sensations to achieve the cognitive state. 

What is the common cognitive process that occurs when a blind man
hears a beatiful piece of music, and a deaf man sees a beautiful
work of art?  They share /something/ in common we call "beauty",
but it cannot be the mere sensations that evoked it; it must be some
mental state that we can recogize and express.  Cameras and audio
recorders "see" and "hear" the same things, but they do not have
cognitive states.  A computer does.  To assume that a computer
can't recognize, experience, and express that same state from
whatever inputs it has is groundless anthropocentrism.  If a computer
tells me that the bit-pattern I just entered into its front panel is
beautiful, who am I to tell him otherwise?

What if the images that the computer analyses were generated with
a ray-tracing program? No optical hardware needed.

Randall Beer and his students successfully taught (programmed/trained/
evolved) a simulated cockroach to walk though it had no real (hardware)
legs. When the neural nets were later downloaded into a real robot it
could instantly walk in the real world.

Interested in an open-ended lifespan, we have made a public 
announcement on the Cryonet inviting people to a new
 organization called Metamorphosis Society and 
started its preliminary activities in Japan.

The key messages transmitted are as follows:

" We have to try our best to make our future in a 
good state. Those of you who could endeavor to make 
it good to the best of your ability come join us 
forming a cooperative network for it and take off to
 the future. Our successors will take care of 
reanimating us in the way we want."

Join us!!  You can find more details at the URL:
http//:www.suehiro.nakano.tokyo.jp/project/e-guide/
ms.html

The mailing list started on Feb 14, The following 
shows some of the participating members:

  $B!&(JKelly Anne Moy (Student coorinator of American 
Cryonics Society)
  $B!&(JJoseph Strout (Department of Neuroscience, UCSD,
 well versed in mind uploading)
  $B!&(JKlaus Reinhard (German active cryonicist)
  $B!&(JPaul Wakfer (Prometheus Project, President of 
CryoSpan)
  $B!&(JBen Best (President of the Cryonics Society of 
Canada)
  $B!&(JTakaaki Kaburagi (Co-founder of Metamorphosis 
Society)
  $B!&(JMizuho Hirose (President of Metamorphosis 
Society) 
 
The followings are subjects we talked about in 
February:

 -The status quo of cryonics in Japan and Germany.
 -Study on the feasibility of initial cool-down and 
perfusion in Japan
 (The pre-treatment should be followed by packing 
the body in dry ice and
 shipping it for the final cool-down and long-term 
storage in the U.S. It
 is not too easy; it is necessary to make a speacial
 effort to make it
 happen.)
 -How best we can spread the concept of the Society 
from now on.

 Again, Join us!  Please contact me at:

I am not my brain, that's just 4 LB's of gray goo, I am the information in my

I certainly can, a point. Maybe other things too, a quark, a photon,  
an electron. Perhaps someday these things will be found to be made of even  
smaller particles, perhaps not, as I said it's debatable.

That's real nice, but a do have a question,  
What is the radius of an electron? 
I have a few more questions too. 
What is the sex of an electron?  
What shade of color is an electron?  
What does an electron taste like? 
What does an electron smell like?  
Is an electron wet or dry? 
Is an electron happy or sad? 
What is the political party of an electron?

You say so. You're the one who said A=A, I am 100% aware of what I am 
100% aware.  Changes that are too small for me to be aware of are, 
well, too small for me to be aware of.

To repeat myself, that is NOT true. Two photons can be in the same place at 
the same time and not effect each other, otherwise everything would be a 
jumble, you couldn't see the moon or the stars or even the man sitting next 
to you.

You seem to be saying that someday we will find that in the real world two 
points can not be infinitely close together, it could be. If so then a line 
is made of a huge but not an infinite number of points, two points can only 
be in a finite number of positions. If so then Space-time is not continuous, 
it's digital,  and analog's last stand bites the dust.

Note that "extropiate" was defined in 1991 as "any drug having extropic
effects, including all cognition enhancing and life extending effects" (by
Dave Krieger).

Doesn't mean it can't be used with another definition, but it might be
confusing, especially because the suggested new use is derogatory and the
old one positive.

Perhaps we might begin thinking of the Extropy Institute as a vehicle
for granting degrees in the areas of Extropian and TransHuman
studies....

Some institutions, such as UC Santa Cruz have a history of granting
degrees in areas defined by the student. Perhaps the Extropy Institute
could form some alliances with same.....

As we eventually network our around the galaxy & the rest of the 
universe, are we to parralelled again in history with non fully 
civilised,societies (look at Hitler & the Emporer) having developed the 
technological basis to migrate, are we in for establishing empires of the

OK, what you seems to say is that if I put damage sensors in a robot, it 
would be able to feel pain. But this relates to the awfully tricky 
problem of qualia: does the robot *experience* pain, or doe it just think 
"pain"? How can we tell? 

(My personal view is that the hardware doesn't matter; after all, 
stimulating a sensor or nerve produces the same sensation, so the qualia 
are likely happining in the brain, which I also think could be run on a 
different hardware)

It would be quite possible to create programs that can watch their 
internal states and hence feel internal pleasure, no hardware needed. In 
fact, programs that watch or affect their own states have been written 
(but as far as I know nobody has done anything truly serious with it).

I have to say that I agree with Gregory here.  And it's not just sensors
that are the problem.  As I understand it, emotions are mediated by the
'R-complex' and limbic system in the brain. These electro-chemical
processes create the kinds of events we call 'pleasure' and 'pain' in
response to stimuli. They comprise primitive forms of cognition, highly
peculiar, particular, and specialised (i.e. they have to to with the
typical concerns of reptiles and lower mammals), that are 'gerrymandered'
by the neocortex. AI people could perhaps duplicate the functions of
these systems electro-mechanically right now, with enough work, but as
Dennett has said, what's the point? 

But unless you uploaded into a system that did duplicate them, you
wouldn't experience them, I think. (Then again, maybe that does provide
a 'point' to the exercise of trying to duplicate them?)

Speculation:- Without systems that duplicate emotional functions, the
nearest I can imagine to what it would be like uploading would be the
experience of doing pure mathematics: all experience would occur as a
kind of mathematical trance, except with sensory images as mathematical
symbols.

This wouldn't be transhuman so much as totally non-human, perhaps no
different from the experience of a built or evolved AI.

I am unable to connect to Russell Whitaker's copy of Engines of Creation
at http://www.asiapac.com/EnginesOfCreation/, nor for that matter to
his site asiapac.com, nor to his SGI web. I thought there was a mirror
of EOC somewhere in Europe (in Poland?), but I can't find that either.
Does anyone know what the story is?

I think it would be a good idea for a plaintext version of EOC to be
circulated on the net as well, eg via Project Gutenberg, in the
fashion of Bruce Sterling's Hacker Crackdown. This may be unfashionable, 
it might neglect the benefits of hypertext, etc, but ASCII texts do
at least spread a little more widely than HTML ones, at present.

Since I believe that only societies that discover capitalism will be
able to develop the requisite technology, I doubt that we will find many
star-roving socialist/fascist collectives - the only ones we do find
will be ones that stole the technology from the capitalist ones, just
like here on earth.  That might happen occasionally, I suppose, but with
the distances involved, it doesn't seem as likely or as frequent as the
earthly case.

This is one of the reasons I have always discounted contactee tales; not
because the possibility of close encounters is implausible, but the
stories they tell are implausible, they just don't ring true, they are
cheesy and cliched collectivist.

If we ever do come across any highly advanced civilisations, you can bet
your bottom dollar they will be capitalistic, trader civilisations.

  Does the Squirrel understand correctly, that an unaugmented biological
unit, scarcely two million years past its culture's invention of the
stone axe, is unwilling to consider that intelligent beings may have
thought of something that it did not think of, has not thought of, or
perhaps cannot think of?

I don't like bad science fiction where the evil computer is intelligent but  
can not feel, even in Star Trek only the humans have proper emotions, 
the alien Mr. Spok could never quite figure them out. Considering Evolution's  
experience in building such things, you could make a much stronger case that  
a computer, or any alien form of life, might be able to feel emotions but it  
could never be intelligent.

Nature found it much easier to come up with feeling than the ability to 
reason, it's certainly came up with it first. The most ancient part of the 
brain, the spinal cord, the medulla and the pons is similar to the brain of 
a fish or amphibian and first made an appearance on the earth about 
400 million years ago. According to Paul MacLean of the National Institute of
Mental Health it deals in aggressive behavior, territoriality and social 
hierarchies. 

The Limbic System is about 150 million years old and ours is similar to that 
found in other mammals. Some think the Limbic system is the source of awe and 
exhilaration because it is the active sight of many psychotropic drugs, 
there's little doubt that the amygdala, a part of the Limbic system has much 
to do with fear. After some animals developed a Limbic system they started to 
spend much more time taking care of their young, so it probably has something 
to do with love too. 

It is our grossly enlarged neocortex that makes the human brain so unusual 
and so recent, it only started to get ridiculously large about 3 million 
years ago. It deals in deliberation, spatial perception, speaking, reading, 
writing and mathematics, the one new emotion we got was worry, probably 
because the neocortex is also the place where we plan for the future.    
If nature came up with feeling first and intelligence much later, I don't see 
why the opposite would be true for our computers. It's probably a hell of a 
lot easier to make something that feels but doesn't think than something that 
thinks but doesn't feel.

It has indeed been unavailable this past week.
I have checked with Russell Whitaker, who maintains the EOC site. The
problem seems to be that the domain name registration is on hold, which he
is looking into. In the meantime, this link should work:
http://www.best.com/~whitaker/EnginesOfCreation/

I am also in the process of transferring EOC to the Foresight web site,
where it should be available later this week.

One of the most impressive things (well, OK, the ONLY impressive thing) about
USSR was it's commitment to technology and space exploration.

In my understanding of Extropy, anrarcho- capitalism is seen as a means to
create the only viable economic environment which aids change and rapid
growth.
However, it is not technology per se that capitalism will foster, but the
individual freedom to utilize it to our own ends.

In anarchy, any roving band of anything can just as easily 'steal' technology
( if by that you mean figuring out what has already been done and
implementing it to eveil ends). They could colonize offworld,  and under a
non restrictive government, do all and anything history has shown us humans
are capable of!
What the original post was asking about, IMO, seemed to be how we would be
percieved *developementally* as a culture, should we be able to propell
ourselves outward, and just how far along we are now. This concern over
technology developing ahead of our psychology is quite valid, and is often
brought up in a constructive manner. Sometimes it is used by Luddlike
characters to inspire fear of technology.
Again, to dismiss it, because we feel WE, as transhumnists, have evolved- is
not addressing a solution!

I hope we as a planet are evolving mentally and psychologically toward a
balanced, sane, rational state - it has been suggested that this takes work.
I personally see many people who I would not trust with a glue gun ; ) never
mind genetechs, SI weapons or replicators!

I think that such possibilities depend on the interelationship of
individual intelligence and sociability levels. For example, a highly
individualistis, even viciously animistic species may reach interstellar
capacity by having an extremely high individual intelligence. Such high
individual capability may overcome a lack of ability to cooperate, and
may be aided by extreme differentiation between the sexes, where the
males would be extremely agressive, individualistic, and intelligent,
while the females may be more cooperative, compliant, and submissive, so
there would be a alpha male pack phenomenon with numerous female
servants. Niven's Kzin are one example of this, though even they were
described by Niven as having acquired their technology from another race
involuntarily.

Primitive agressive species may also gain interstellar capacity by
acquiring advanced technology from other races who are not careful in
their planetary activities (Niven's Kzin), and are either attacked, or
lose technology due to vehicle crashes (shades of Roswell???). If such
were the current case, it is considered one reason for the Great Filter
question, as well as an explaination why our own government would not
admit to acquiring technology, as a tv broadcast goes out into space and
is basically an announcement to other races that we have acquired
technology we may not be  prepared to handle, or may abuse in an
expansionist way. Lack of radio signals from outside systems can easily
be explained by current technology. We currently have the capabilty to
jam EM broadcasts in a localized area, or jam broadcasts into an area
without disturbing the broadcasts within the area, all without giving
away a localized signature of the jamming source. If we can do this,
certainly more advanced races could do the same to us on a solar system
wide scale.

Actually, duplicating them has a point. As you say, they are a form of 
primitive cognition that is quick and not unnecessarily complex. This is 
ideal for simple robotics! Being a bit of a connectionist I might be a 
bit biased, but subsumption architectures and neural net modules are 
clearly very promising for building robots. Having a robot with a limbic 
system is actually a quite good idea; it will want to please its owner, 
it will avoid harm and mistakes (they feel bad), it would learn and 
associate. For many tasks there is no need for a complex brain, drives 
and motivation suffice quite well.

It would be meaningless to upload into a system that didn't duplicate the 
limbic system - why upload only *part* of the brain? Uploading will most 
likely encompass everything from the brainstem and upwards (and I'll 
admit that I have been thinking about the spinal cord too). The point of 
the Strong AI hypothesis is that duplicating emotion only is a matter of 
the right software structure, the hardware is irrelevant as long as it 
can run it.

I get you.  Yes, the types of hardware used are irrelevant - it might
even be found expedient to use some sort of genetically engineered
brain-like substance!  I just wanted to clarify (more for myself than
anyone else) that*some* implementation of R-complex and limbic
*functions* would be necessary for fully human experience as an
uploaded entity.  And I see what you mean in that it would make an ideal
first base camp for AI, being relatively less complex than neocortical
functions, therefore easier to implement.

Ramble:- That sets me thinking: 'fully human'.  Yes, I suppose one would
have to start off like that, to make it easier to 'get one's bearings',
so to speak.  But later on, the fact that you could turn sub-routines on
and off at will: how would that affect your psychology?  Take pain: it's
a warning sign.  People who don't feel pain die an early death, it seems.
There would be a strong temptation for the uploaded to switch off pain
circuitry quite a lot of the time.  Would that make you more of a risk
taker, or be likely to expose you to more risk?

e.g., would your self-monitoring then be like in a strategy game like
Command & Conquer, where all you are presented with is information on
the state of battle, and the condition of your forces, but you don't
'feel' anything?

(Interestingly, some games people are talking about having more
'feedback' in games- resistance from joysticks, mild shocks when 
you're hit, etc.)

Hmm, interesting.

Oh, I have considered it, and I've come up with a negative.  I think
that the memes of several property, rule of law, and trade, quaint
though they may sound to your ears, are 'forced moves' in cultural design
space,*especially* if we are talking about the possibility of  bringing
about a technologically advanced culture.  Analogous to the way, say,
that having bilateral symmetry and sexual reproduction are 'forced moves'
in biological design space. 

Anything beyond that is beyond the concept of society and civilisation altogether, 
and so advanced even Marx couldn't have conceived it.

You see, for me, most of the problems in society arise from lack of
observation of those principles, and to me social progress consists in a
gradual refinement, extension and improving realisation of those memes. 
We have *hardly even begun* to do this, and look at the curve of
progress in that short time, despite enormous ideological resistance
these past two centuries!

I think Vernor Vinge is a more accurate prediction than Ian Banks (much
as I enjoy Ian Banks!)

GG, your email address is in the UK, so it is odd that you need reminding
that it was fascists who made the big advances in rocketry in the middle of
this century.

Also, the Nazis were capitalists (despite the name 'National Socialists').
They didn't steal technology from capitalist, they *were* capitalists -- and
they developed a lot of it themselves.

The collectivist aspect of the United States has a much better developed
space program than any private industry initiative.

Your future is optimistic, but not based on historical fact.

Perhaps this is because we are not economically ready for a space
program.  Government can certainly accelerate development in some areas,
but at what cost elsewhere?  The Soviets launched the first satellite;
perhaps because doing so was too expensive for anyone private to do for
fun, and business couldn't see the profit.

Spaceflight is still bloody expensive, although avoiding any form of
nuclear motor wouldn't help.  Lucian[1] yearned for the moon and stars as
we do -- perhaps the sad fact is that we are not yet rich enough to
leave.

Hmmph.  If any private initiative had been able to go to the Moon, would
it have let the effort sputter out the way Apollo did?

Like most things about the mind, the weight one gives to the opinions of
others (let's call it "swayability") is determined partly by evolution,
partly by culture, and partly by individual reason and experience.  We can
disagree about what weight to assign to these three components.  However, if
there is any significant evolutionary component, I would suspect that it
would push people in the direction of lower swayability than is rational
under current circumstances.

Under the hunter-gatherer conditions in which our ancestors lived for the
past seven million years, a typical person only knew a hundred or so other
people.  Half of those were kids, and half the adults were stupider than
average.  The chance of coming up with a good idea that nobody else had
thought of was much higher than it is today.  Thus, the likely reward of
doing something most people thought was a bad idea was bigger than it is now.

This may explain the disparity between how Robin thinks people should act,
and how they actually act.  Are there any other cases like this, that we
might try to explain by evolutionary arguments?

Interesting.  When I published the suggestion, in 1971, that cryonicists
could freeze severed heads instead of going to the expense and added risk
of storing the whole body (a process now called `neurological suspension',
and in which I was anticipated in print by several years), I suggested that
the spinal cord should also be preserved.  It seemed to me then (and still
does) that a considerable amount of salient information is embodied/encoded
therein.  This would also be relevant, therefore, to upload procedures.

It seems to me that people most adept at computers have generally only the
most superficial awareness of their (and others') emotions.  
Passion and compassion are understood only vaguely and not given their true
 value for a life, and a society, that is enriching and fulfilling.

I agree with Dennet - whats the point?  Would we want our AIs to be motivated

just to be nice to them?  Like why should we hog all the good stuff, lets

You forget the Ziolkovsky/GIRD/Katjusha/Andrjusha product line, which, 
while certainly less spectacular, and distinctly more low-tech than 
Vergeltungswaffen (propantrioltrinitrate-gellied nitrocellulose rather than 
ethanol/LOX), were great for target saturation, both psycho & 
physiological target. First  crude "fire arrow" rocketry has been 
invented in China, and used in India against the British occupation, 
albeit in minor skirmishes, and to little effect. 
 
Interestingly enough, the most efficacious weapons, whether ICBMs, or 
bazooka-like fired recoilles antitank/fighter rocketry, are all 
intelligently guided actio=reactio rockets nowadays. While skull guns and 
cookie cutters is bullshit, g-amounts of lead azide detonating within the 
body makes great hydrostatic shockwaves, which trigger all affected neurons 
simultaneously, the next thing after the high-velocity cartridgeless 
ammo gun. Of course Vernor "Mr. Future" Vinge knew it right from the start.

> Also, the Nazis were capitalists (despite the name 'National Socialists').

They were not. Nazis were a grand-scale planned economy, Schickelgruber & 
consorts would have gone broke, if they hadn't started a JIT war. 
Assimilation of Swedish iron ore, and Romania's oil fields were 
choreographed right from the start. However, Adolf fell prey to Bill's 
assumption of being a generalist. While Bill backed out just in time, 
Adolf was demented enough to enforce it right to the showdown. According 
to Solshenytzin's "V kruge pervom" (dunno whether this is pure fiction, 
or actually authentic information), Voshd Narodov Dshugashvili (terminal 
syphilis and massive paranoia both kinda make a pattern), planned a 
counterstrike. Good things psychotics of any colour, whether "keine 
j"udische Physik", or "ich will keinen Kinntop im Kockpit" have been 
notoriously wary of technology.

Let's hope their successors won't notice a pattern, and act constructively.

Yet. I think soon dramatically falling LEO launch costs (and privately 
funded LEO-autoassembling autoreplicator missions to Luna may desert the 
barren realm of scifi) will cause a flurry of activity in low earth orbit 
missions, which will render NASA uncapable of action, since entirely broke.

But all the adults were citing the accumulated knowledge of centuries or even
millenia.  The Australian aborigines' Dreamtime techniques have apparently
preserved knowledge of geographical features from the last Ice Age.  So
you're not competing just with the few dozen currently living adults, but
also the thousands of dead ones whose ideas and experiences are preserved in
oral tradition.

The punishment for a wrong idea was much more likely to be death.  In our
benign society you can make a lot of boo-boos and come out OK.  Without
savings, medical care, charity, etc., and in an environment with many more
hositles, even minor mistakes could be fatal.  So the cost was very much
higher and cost-benefit, on the whole, was worse.  

In point of fact, "primitive" cultures are typically very conservative, and
their members are typically very conservative as well.  This is part of the
reason they have such trouble when pitched into contact with developed
societies.

I like this type of analysis.  But I don't know that the conclusion is quite
justified.  I see two problems: 1) One does not have to come up with an 
idea that is better than /everybody/ else's, just an idea that is better
than one's local peers for evolution to function.  2) Usable-idea space
is so much larger now than then, the proportions may actually be the
reverse of what you suggest.

There are values here, yes (except not for SDI, I think).   But with all of
them there remains substantial disagreement over whether they "work" i.e.
produce a successful society that meets basic goals like food, shelter,
security, etc.  Lots of leftists hold up pre-Thatcherite England as an
example of how socialism "works" and post-Thatcherite England as an example
of how capitalism "doesn't work".  Rightist generally do the opposite.

SDI was almost purely phrased as an arguement over whether it would "work"
i.e., stop enough nuclear warheads to reduce civilian casualties to at most
those typical of a major war.  Interestingly, the opinions seemed to be
dependent almost solely on whether the opinioned believed it would be a good
thing for the US to be immune to nuclear blackmail.  Those distrustful of the
US military almost always said it would fail; the rah-rah patriots almost
always said it would work.  Hmmm.

Can you provide me some references?  I'm always open to evidence :-) but I've

be - good Bayesian agents.

My version of the thread so far: Guru George claimed that a starfaring
civilization would have to capitalist, and not socialist or fascist. I
claimed that fascists can be capitalists so that distinction is confusing.
Furthermore, it seems to be that any of these three types could develop a
spacefaring civilization.

I also skipped Goddard. But there is no denying the "big advances" part of
my claim regardless. But your Soviet examples help make the point that
spacefarer need not be capitalists, thanks.

I was discussing rocketry in the context of space exploration, not weaponry.

I'm borrowing from Pournelle: I don't deny that they had a planned economy,
but that the capital was privately held (and therefore, capitalist). The
alliance between Hitler and Stalin is not so bizarre when you realize that
they had planned economies in common, even though they were at odds over
whether to have private or public property. Hmm, the American space program
to date has been as a result of central planning.

[Aside with respect to 'Socialists'. I met a 'liberal' in Vienna a couple of
weeks ago. I was surprised to learn that this is what a North American would
call conservative, or in this fellow's case, libertarian. Must have
something to do with the difference in voltage you use.]

I hope so. The railroad and aircraft industries in the US needed government
support initially, but then were able to cut the apron strings.

Generally only an issue when a crisis occurs (famine, drought, etc.)  Even
then the best options may well be recorded from the last time that happened,
300 years ago.

Over hundreds of years of trial, error, accident, and emergency, most bands
know most of what's edible around them.

Both, really, but I was thinking of hunter-gatherers (HG), as agriculture is
very recent in our evolution.

That's an interesting speculation, but factually HG groups don't do well,
even though theoretically their knowledge should give them a tremendous
advantage wrt nature films, plant botany, cult leadership, nature retreats
and no doubt many other things as well.  There aren't many HG, for biological
reasons; I think there should be enough room in our enormous society for all
of them to do well.

Can't argue with any of that.  The Cherokees learned everything they could

I believe your difficulty here lies in your assumption that emotions are
cognitive states. They are not. That is why we call them emotive rather
than cognitive. Cognitive --> cogito --> think, e.g., cogito ergo sum, I
*think* therefor I am. Emotions may influence thinking (abstract
thought), and thinking may influence emotions, but they are not one in
the same. They are qualitatively different.

Quantitative aspect of emotions: The neurochemical content of the
central nervous system.

Qualitative aspect of emotions: Sensations felt in the body, e.g.,
changes in blood pressure, heart rate, moisture in the skin, breathing,
body tempature, sensitivity, arousal in erogenous zones, etcetera,
etcetera.

Computers today can emulate the quantitative aspect of emotions. They do
not however have the proper embodiment to experience the qualitative
aspect of emotions. They cannot feel. Thus computers today cannot
experience emotions ... no matter how much programming is involved. They
may have the potential to experience emotions, but they cannot until
they have appropriate hardware.

Emotions are physical feelings that usually have corrolating thoughts.
For example, a person with depression will have a particular kind of
neurochemical content in their CNS. Those neurotransmitters will then
cause certain emotive feelings in the person and certain cognitive
thoughts in the person. However the person may seek a psychologist for
help, and learn to think in new ways, and though the person is thinking
differently it may take some time before the person *feels* differently.
Changing the cognitive thought won't necessarily immiediately change the
emotive feeling. That same person may instead choose to see a
psychiatrist who then prescribes prozac. The prozac acts then directly
upon the CNS effecting both the emotions and the thoughts of that
person. 
 
Emotions are irrational because they are not cognitive. Cognitive things
are rational. Why do so many people associate love with the heart rather
than the brain? Because emotions are not cognitive. Emotions can
influence the cognitive, and vise versa, but they are not the same.

We appreciate beauty because it makes us feel good. Not because it IS
good. This is called synesthesia. There is no appreciation without
sensation. My computer has absolutely zero ability for appreciation. No
computer has the ability to appreciate. Do not confuse error statements
with disastifaction. Those statements are coldly objective. You can make
your computer error ceaselessly and it will never feel discomfort.
However, if your computer felt a painful sensation everyone time it
encountered an error, then it would feel discomfort, and it might feel
anger, and those feelings of anger might then provoke violent thoughts
in the computer. But it must be able to feel, and to feel it must have
physical sensations.

Recognize perhaps, express [emulate in an artificial way] perhaps, but
theres no way in the world it could experience an emotion without the
proper hardware.

Him? The computer can only determine beauty based on the criteria the
programmer programmed into it. The computer cannot determine beauty
based on its own experiences of emotive affect. It may *know* what
beauty is supposed to be, but it has never experienced the emotive
sensations of beauty.

That would be much more like imagination than seeing. I do not require
eyes to see things in my head that I make up, but if I want to see
things from the real world then I need something that will recieve

It was trained to walk, but it could not walk until it had the robot
embodiment. It could think about walking all day long, but until the
instructions were downloaded into the hardware (the robot) there was no
walking going on.

The point in giving computers emotions was explained in recent posts. We
have been discussing the possability of uploading. Some of us here
believe that if we were to be uploaded the computer we are uploaded to
must be able to experience emotions in order for the uploading to be
worth while. If we are to be uploaded we want to be able to experience
emotions. Some do not agree with this. Some of us believe that in order
for a computer to experience emotions that the computer's hardware must
be designed for this purpose. Others here believe that any computer can
be programmed by a sufficiently intelligent individual to experience
emotions.

I think this is less true than most people think,
but more true than some of us would like to believe.

To the extent it's true, it's closely related to the *myth* of
computers, our culture's ideas and images of what computers are about.
Ted Nelson has written about it, and reading his _Computer Lib_ was
what switched me from being a computer insider wannabe to a computer
outsider-insider wannabe.  That is, someone who loves computers and wants
to know all the coolest things going on in the field while not buying into
the industry's notions of what's going on.

The Myth, though, provides excuses for crappy, nasty hardware and software
(the Technical Reason Too Difficult To Explain).
It provides rationales for people in charge of computers to have various
sorts of power over people who just use them.
It provides ways for people who aren't computer people to look down
on computers and those nerdy computer people.
It gives the "it's too hard" excuse for non-comps not to learn.
It gives a reason non-experts have to ask experts for help.
It gives a reason for experts to look down on users ("Lusers").
It gives people a way to feel like they know something important when they
learn some detail or collection of details.

In other words, it's an existing stereotype (or complimentary pair of
stereo(hah)types), that encourages people to sort themselves into two
categories, and then gives them incentives to maintain and exaggerate
the stereotype, not just in what they believe but by taking the roles and
acting out the stereotypes.  (Sometimes you play the expert in one context
and the user in another.)

Nelson pointed out that the stereotype isn't really justified by the nature
of computers themselves (which are just boxes programmable to act however
we want).  Instead it seems to be a way for our culture to play out various
inner conflicts and themes, like a Rorschach (sp?) inkblot.  One conflict
he mentioned was a scale:
     Computer (too cold)
                <----> Warm Human Being (just right)
                         <---> Bum, Nigger, Hippie, Psycho (too emotional)
The thing here is that in order to be at just the right point on the scale,
you need to have examples to the left and right of you to be "too far" in
either direction.  So "the computer" fills that "cold" role--as do
computer people.  Or maybe the computer people are on a scale of
   too obsessed/focussed/narrow <--> just right <--> airhead/A.D.D.

It's not reality, and it's not a Lie propagated by a Conspiracy either.
It's a game with incentives for everybody to take sides in and play, and
most people do.  And as part of playing, you pass on the incentives and
the Myth to others.

I don't know if my anger shows through here.  The idea that instead of the
truth, people deal in these *consensus travesties* of the truth, and
willingly descend into these childish role-playing games, leading "us
innocents" into the same roles--it gripes my butt.  Probably because I
was already sucked in.  I think I'm one of those people who would've gone
much further in the Nerd direction without _Computer Lib_ appearing at the
right time.

I don't know how we could be certain we were successful in giving the
computer emotions. I do know however that the computer will first need
the sensors to feel with in the first place. If that computer had
artificial cognitive intelligence, perhaps it would begin to show signs
of irrationality. If a person were uploaded into the computer, they
would know immiediately if that computer were experiencing emotions. If
the artificial intelligence were sufficiently intelligent, it could
probably tell us it was having a condition that it what was unfamiliar
with.

I agree different hardware other than the brain could suffice, but not
just any hardware. The hardware does have to have the capacity to
experience sensation. It does not really matter where the qualia is
occuring, just as long as it is felt and not just thought. If it is
merely thought then there is not any affective emotion occuring.

Whoa, big jump there from analysing conditions to feeling pleasure. My
computer can determine how fast it is operating in many different ways,
but just because it is aware of these internal processes does not mean
it can "hence feel internal pleasure". An alarm clock is aware of when
it should go off, but it doesn't get emotionally excited about the fact.
It just responds to these things logically; not emotionally. 

In

I would be extremely interested in a program which was claimed to
"affect" its own states, but the fact of the matter is, such programs
are "effecting" their own states, just as nearly every program does.

Thank you George for developing this further than I was able to. With
that said, I feel necessitated to start digging into this stack of books
(on neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, and neuropsychology) which I have
bought, but have yet to read. From an initial glance over them though
you would be amazed at how vaguely they deal with emotions. One book had
the following to say in its "Conclusion".

"I do not suggest for a moment that the material I have described is
anything like the complete and final answer to these questions.
Neuropsychology is still a very young science, taking its very first
step, and a period of thirty years is not a very long time for the
development of any science. That is why some very important chapters,
such as motives, complex forms of emotions and the structure of
personality are not included in this book."

Greg, your problem seems to be a language/concept artefact, you're mixing 
the abstraction layers. If you think computer, you instantly see a 
particular machine, programmed in a particular way. It's seseless to seek 
emotions, or hydrodynamical shockwaves in flipping bits, as trying to 
find emotion in spiking neurons. It's an activity pattern, a physical 
process occuring in the exquisitely structured space slab between your ears.

A computer simulation of a particular physical system has a degree of 
equivalence. If we're just after information about that peculiar system, 
information extracted is perfectly valid in the real world. Unless you are a 
part of the simulation (imagine the Universe, observers included, being 
sucked into your computer in a solipsistic implosion, we wouldn't even 
notice), you need I/O to be able to interface (look and tweak) with it 
at all, of course. 

A perfect simulation of the photosynthesis process won't feed anyone in 
the real world directly. Yet ANN-controlled agents moving in a spatial 
ALife simulation, looking for food and enemies look very much alive to 
me. Primitive, yet clearly alive. I wonder how an orthodox Brahmin 
must feel when cutting juice off a long-evolved ALife ecosystem. 
Technically it would be inconsistent behaviour, looking at your toes for 
fear of crushing bugs, yet carelessly flipping off the switch. 

Good thing thinking is mostly about processing information, and sensors and 
actuators easy to come by. Evolving agent behaviour in a robot colony is 
actually easier than to simulate it, because correct physics of a 
nontrivial dynamic structure assembly is terribly expensive (in terms of 
computer horsepower, and code complexity) to do.

Attaching particular values to certain physical processes is merely an 
artefact of the observer. You are within the you-system, that's why you feel 
about love, and pain differently. Torturing uploads by tweaking their 
R&P system representation is a crime, even though in cyberspace no one 
hears you scream.

All this discussion reminds me of the old line twins sometimes use
when some wit asks them, "How do you tell each other apart?"

"Well, I'm always here, but the other one is sometimes gone."

Well, I don't know about the rest of you zombies, and maybe I'm missing
something, but to me it doesn't really matter (at least as it pertains
to this) if the universe is discrete or smooth, infinite or finite,
analog or digital. And it doesn't really matter if machines can be
built that pass the Turing test, have emotions and self-circuits and
problems with the wife and all the rest. And if a simulation of a can
opener can ever open a can or only simulated cans. And if they duplicated
me on a system that used neurons or neural nets, and whether they called
it a computer or called it something else.

If they duplicated me atom by atom - right down to the electrons in my
self-circuit - he'd still be over THERE, and I'd still be over HERE. And
he could pass all the Turing tests and memory tests, and they could run
him for 9 months to make sure that the chaos goblin doesn't get him. And
he and everybody who knows me could agree that, boy, *they* sure can't
tell the difference. And this would all be very interesting.

But, call me old-fashioned, but the *second* somebody says, "It seems
to have worked. Two things that are identical in all ways are the same
thing. A *IS* A. We might as well dispose of the original..." well, he'll
be over THERE, and *I'll* be out the goddamn door.

I disagree strongly with this. This is a pernicious myth, and has no 
basis in reality. There are just as many teachers, politicians or 
janitors with superficial awareness of emotion as computer people.

Yes. The spinal cord has a rather stereotypal structure, so most people
involved with neurosuspension (and uploading) just think we could add on a
new spinal cord using some future technology and have the person up and
running. But there seems to be some evidence that even the spinal cord
learns, which means that parts of our motor skills may be present down
there. My guess is that we can create simple pattern generators over time
for certain actions, although control and integration are done in the
brain. Replacing the old spinal cord with a new might affect your motoric,
and your body may feel slightly wrong. I admit that this is just a minor
problem; I would accept being an upload with a slightly unfamiliar body
model which I in time will learn to like, but if we could I think we
should include the spinal cord in the suspension/upload.

These are big subjects which I don't have time to go into just now. 
I'll just say that: of course collectivists can occasionally do advanced
research, but at the cost of potential social progress that, if not made,
will lead in the long run to unrest and revolution, as happened in the
USSR; as I understand it, the Nazis had centralised control of their
economy, and their capitalism was not capitalism but mercantilism;
the collectivisation of the US space program for the sake of a
boondoggle in the 60s  *set back* space research from relevant trends (
flying craft that could take off from the ground and go into orbit, like
the spy planes of the 50s were tending towards) to irrelevant trends
(staged rockets).

I think this is largely a myth, though a myth with some foundation in
truth. It's certainly a widespread myth; I'm amazed and amused by the
difference in people's reactions when I meet them and tell them I'm a
computer programmer and when I tell them I'm a film-maker (since I'm
programming to fund my film-making). Because the stereotypes are so
different they treat me very differently even though I'm exactly the same
person; I think this says more about the general level of communication
between members of the human race than computer people. Most people care
far more about personas than the personality behind them. 

I think that a large part of the problem is that computer people are doing
things which 'normal' people simply cannot understand because they lack
the technical knowledge, and hence those people cannot understand the
computer people either. I can't, for example, explain to my artistic
friends why I object to Windows on aesthetic grounds (at the emotional
level the internals of the code are just horrid), while I can readily
understand why they prefer one book or painting over another. If everyone
programmed computers and only a few people painted we'd probably see a
similar stereotype in the other direction. Hmm, now there's an idea for a
story... 

As for passion, many of the people I know in the industry are so
passionate about whatever project they're working on that I avoid them for
the same reason I'd avoid an overly passionate artist; there's nothing in
their life except their work so they can't talk about anything else. 

Perhaps another issue is jealousy. Since programmers are so powerful in
modern society and their world is so hard for outsiders to understand, the
outsiders want a reason to feel superior. Hence, "well, computer people
may be creating all this technology around us, but I know all about
emotions and they don't so I'm superior". Bullshit, but probably
reassuring bullshit for some. 

I admit I do have a problem with people who do stupid things for no
rational reason and then complain about it and explain that 'their
emotions made them do it'; my goal is to maximise my potential for life,
and playing silly games like that isn't going to help. I can get very
emotional, but my emotions aid my goals rather than detract from them. The
difference seems to be that I've integrated my emotions into the rest of
my personality so that emotions are something that I have, whereas many
people feel that emotions are something external which happen to them. I
can understand why they do the things they do, based on the emotions they
have, but I still think it's very stupid. I would feel the same way 
whether or not I was a programmer.

Of course another issue is that computer programmers are well-paid
professionals and hence the people who take the job are more likely to be
rational and career-minded than the sort who'll chuck in a job and follow
some random person to Peru in the name of love. Most of the lawyers and
other professionals I've met seem to fit the 'emotionless' stereotype just
as well as most of the programmers. This is probably the 'foundation' I
was talking about above; professionals who have to work in teams and meet
deadlines must be able to switch off their emotions when neccesary in
order to get the job done. This doesn't mean that they're emotionless the
rest of the time.

site through History Connections--related to James Burke's program
"Connections." As part of History Connections, we have created a contest
called "Webweaving" in which we provide clues for users to make the
"connection." 

Your page contains material relevant to the connection, and we plan to
link to your site throughout April. The contest will then be archived
for a year.

The page we are linking to is located at:
http://www.unicorn.com//lib/law.html

There is the potential for hundreds of users to attempt to access your

This seems similar to myths like "rich people are often unhappy" or
"geniuses are usually slightly mad". They reassure the poorer and less
brilliant people that they still are better in some respects than the
billionaires and Einstein. There is a similar myth that many stupid or 
retarded people are actually quite happy.

This is actually relevant to our transhuman endeavors: we want to become 
rich, smart and happy beyond the wildest dreams of present humanity, and 
we won't choose one of three, we want three of three. No wonder many 
people have a hard time accepting it.

This is an excellent idea. Recent advances in science along with the
internet being an part of the life of the average American like never
before, extropian and transhuman memes have begun to ooze their way into
mainstream thinking. One only needs to see the way science fiction has
become one of the most popular genres in the 1990s media. 
 
As so-called "radical" ideas are embraced by the masses, it would be
easier to work to get some establised institutions to work with the
Extropy Institute for actual degrees.

Anyone else?

Thanks Gregory, I see the point is immortality. 
 Emotions are complex in many ways and not discrete distinct states in most
cases.  They are always on even if we're not keyed into them cognitively.
 Like clouds in the sky, to really duplicate them you have to duplicate the
whole sky.

A computer cannot be upset by the data being sent to it as this person

The computer is effected, but not affected by the data. Humans are both
effected and affected by the data which they recieve. I could program a
computer to respond "Please get me off this mailing list!!" with two
exclamation points, but the computer has not actually *felt* the need to
express itself in that way. It was merely the logical way for it to act
based on my programming of it. If my CNS effected only my thoughts and
did not affect my emotions, then I would would be just like a computer,
purely rational (cognitive) and lacking any irrationality (emotive).   

By the way, I found John's post on the emotional computer extremely
informative.

If it was like imagination then the vision program would be able to
change what it was trying to see. Since the images come from outside
the program (perhaps they were generated years ago by another computer
and are merely stored on disk), they are an objective feature of the
program's world. It is not at all like imagination.

If it looks like it is walking (it moves around its world) and thinks
it is walking, then what is the difference? I suppose you could define 
"walking" narrowly enough to exclude what the simulated cockroach is 
doing, but that is like saying computers don't do math until the results 
are printed on paper.

If you read Hermann Oberth's works, you will see that he concedes that
all of the Nazi rocket technologies were cribbed from the publicly
available patents of Dr. Robert Goddard of Massachusetts. He developed
his 35+ patents on all aspects of rocket technology using private funds.
The only public funding he ever got was a one time $5,000 grant from the
Smithsonian Institution, which does not go very far with rocket
technology.

While large capital programs for space exploration up to the present
have typically been only nationally fundable, if you look at the
receding size and scope of national programs since the early 70's, you
can see that the bureaucracy has run up against the one thing it is
inherently incapable of overcoming: the economic obstacles to
commonplace, everyday use of space, which is mostly embodied in what is
known as the mass fraction.

That NASA has publicly announced its intention to exit from overseeing
launch operations within  the next decade shows that communal operations
that are funded by taxes on a capitalist system are unfeasible.
Lockheeds VentureStar launch vehicle, along with projects by Pioneer
Rocketplane, Kistler Aerospace, Lunar Resources Company, LunaCorp,
SpaceHab, Bill Gates' and Bruce McCaw's Teledesic Corporation, and
Boeing's SeaLaunch project are examples that the future of space travel
beyond nationalistic bravado belongs to free enterprise.

There is consideration. It simply is intangible. You get use of the
source code, the author gets intangible rewards -- pleasure, spread of
personal fame, etc.  I've asked lawyers about this sort of issue in
the past. According to them, it is unlikely that any modern court
would refuse to enforce a copyleft on the basis of a lack of exchange
of consideration -- this is (apparently) rarely if ever an issue in
any modern contract dispute, simply because "consideration" is such a
fuzzy concept.

I know fairly good lawyers (like Lance Rose) who claim that a properly
phrased "free software" license is indeed enforceable in court.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org


A fairly long time ago, realizing that I was spending more time
talking than doing, I unsubscribed from "Extropians", deciding it was
a net waste of time for me. Recently, just for the heck of it, I
joined again (getting the digest).

A recent essay by "anonymous" claiming, essentially, that Extropians
talk far better then they act, seems to have hit a nerve among many
people who have written back denouncing the essay.

I must say, however, that in my opinion there is much truth in what
"anonymous" says.

I dropped off the Extropians mailing lists many years ago largely
because I realized that I was spending lots of time talking about how
good it is to be a greedy rich bastard, and spending very little time
actually becoming one. Long before that, I noted that many -- not by
any means all, but many -- extropian types spent lots of their time
talking a much better game than they played.

The phrase "impoverished Extropian" should be an oxymoron, but there
are, in fact, a number of people associated with the Extropian
movement for whom the words "if you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"
apply.

Now, this isn't universally true among the Extropians I've met. Some
are perfectly in control of their finances and either of independant
means or well on their way to getting there.

It is, however, disquieting to me that more Extropians I know have
financial problems than the non-extropian members of the
intelligentsia that I know. (I'd draw comparisons with "average"
people in general but I don't spend time with many so I can't.) I
would have expected this to be radically the reverse, given the
laudible Extropian respect paid for capitalism, but somehow doctrine
doesn't translate into action.

This may be found in other venues as well.

Many years ago, long before I first heard of Extropians, I switched
from a high fat, meat oriented diet to a fairly healthy low fat vegan
diet. I did this purely because I want to live a long time and be
healthy while I'm alive -- a fairly common Extropian sentiment. When I
first met fellow Extropians, I expected most of them would have
similar dietary tendencies -- indeed, I expected them to be more
radical than myself, given that many of them lived in California,
which at the time was a much easier place to live comfortably while
following an alternative diet.

Instead, I discovered, much to my shock, that many Extropians (not all
by any means, but many) did not translate their desire for long
lifetimes into healthy eating -- probably the easiest form of life
extension available, and provably far more efficient than the tiny
edges most life extending substances yield. I met people happy to try
taking deprinyl(sp?) but not very willing to give up a high fat diet,
even though the former has substantially smaller effects on average
longevity than the latter.

Understand, I don't have trouble with the idea of taking life
extending substances, but I would have thought that putatively
rational people would go for the mechanisms with the biggest gain in
average lifespan first before seeking tiny improvements.

Anyway, in summary, I believe "anonymous" is probably extreme in
lumping all extropians in to the same category together -- many are
not the "altruists preaching selfishness" that "anonymous"
decries. However, I will point out that a disturbingly large number of
"Extropians" are, in fact, "altruists preaching selfishness", and that
it is indeed somewhat disturbing that comparitively many do not
practice what they preach.

I agree it is not like imagination, but it is also not like seeing the
real world either. Perhaps a better analogy would be of remembering in
which case the computer is accessing the memory of another computer. But
it is still remembering an image that is not from the real world. It is
not seeing in that sense of seeing. At best, it is seeing
metaphorically. If computer A was able to access the memory of another
computer, computer B, which had hardware for seeing the real world, then
computer A could then be said to have the ability to see via computer B.
But at some point along the chain, hardware must exist for recieving
data from the physical world.

I can watch a movie and people might look like they are being killed,
but they are not *really* being killed. Its an illusion. What you are
talking about is an illusion of walking. What I am talking about is real
walking. The difference: One is an abstract concept or emulation of
walking, and the other is ACTUAL walking. I can go to a video arcade and
play a simulation driving game, but I am not really driving anywhere. I
may go through all the motions of driving, and I might even be tricked
into feeling a sense of movement, but I have not driven anywhere. I am
still in the same location as I was when I put the quarters in the
machine.

What you are asking for is suspended disbelief. You want me to entertain
your illusions. But just as I will not entertain the illusion of a
Christian god, I will not entertain the illusion of artificial life. I
am not saying that we will not be able to create life from silicon or
something else, but what I am saying is that it will not be called
artificial life, for artificial life is just that, artificial. It is not
real. To date it has been nothing more than a model, and a poor model at
that of life. This is not to say it will remain this way.

No it is not. Math is an abstract concept. It can take place in abstract
space. Math does not require legs as walking does, math does not require
sensations as emotions do, math does require hardware though. Math
requires a computational device, either a computer or a brain capable of
processing mathematics.

Eugene, I found your dialogue informative, but we have a major
discrepancy in our judgement of what is real. Alife is as real to me as
is someone being killed in a television show. It is *artificial*. Thats
why they call it *artificial* life. It is not real. If I am to be
uploaded into a computer I don't want *artificial* emotions. I want
emotions that I can really feel and experience. I would not accept a
conceptual abstraction of emotions that merely effected and did not
affect me. 

In your dialogue you refer to "Alife" rather than "Artificial life". I
know this is common practice, but there might be another level of denial
involved. 

Cheers!

I intended to reply (and still will) to John Clark's provocative post about
AI and Emotions, for I think there is a great gap in cognitive science when
it comes to understanding emotional thinking. Evolutionarily ( when building
a mind) it makes sense to understand it first. A feeling machine being *easy*
to make, intrigues the hell out of me, and I want to know more!
But wanted to point out that the above seems to ME, like a purely emotional
response. [ I hope I am adept at handling emotions and computers, and get
better at each as I learn more about both.]

Pernicious! What a great word!
Yes, I agree, it is a common ailment, thick skin, being shut down,  low EQ,
whatever you want to call it! Construction workers,baseball players, cops,
any field dominated by men, we could point a finger at all of them in turn
and probably find evidence to support a low Emotional IQ theory.*Workaholism
probably plays a much larger role in arrested developement than the type of
skills being utilized.*
Generalizing like this based on (?) personal experience does little good -
and IMO - can harm.

It is the stereotyping that I object to, a reverse of a common prejudice
towards artists and women, saying  they are ALL feeling.. these false
dichotomies ( as Steve's post said, will read that computer lib) only serve
to create false dichotomies in people's already prejudiced minds.  A lot of
this kind of Myth comes from technophobic meme spreading  <IMHO> where human
emotion is held up as some kind of sacred cow - as if technology and emotion
are incompatible. I find this entropic.

It is not an error, and you still have yet to provide any evidence of
your preposterous claim that computers cannot experience emotion.  A
simple thought experiment should suffice to show your mistake: Other
mammals clearly have emotional states.  Fear, lust, hunger, and other
experiences are not unique to Homo Sapiens.  But our machinery is
different.  What emotions does a dolphin feel in its "melon" sonar
sensory organ?  What erogenous sensations does a cat feel in its 2nd
and third sets of teats?  What olfactory images are invoked in a dog's
brain when he feels fear?  What emotional associations does a whale
make with depth and pressure?

Even if we postulate that one must evolve a more complex brain than
those other creatures to have emotional states similar to ours, it is
clear that the emotional states are felt in /whatever hardware/ is
available to feel them.  It is palpable nonsense to say that because
my mouth is dry when I feel fear, that fear therefore requires a mouth
and salivary glands.  Fear /is/ the cognitive state associated with
those bodily reactions, or whatever the reactions to it are in another
kind of body with different inputs and outputs.  To claim that a
computer can't achieve that same state with whatever inputs it happens

They won't feel fear in exactly the way I do, but then neither do
you or anyone else.  That doesn't mean you don't feel fear at all.

> Recognize perhaps, express [emulate in an artificial way] perhaps, but

Who decides what hardware is "proper" for experiencing fear?  It obviously
doesn't require arms or legs; a paraplegic can feel it.  It doesn't
require sight or hearing or smell or touch; those whithout those inputs
can still fear.  Don't patients with artificial hearts feel fear?  Those

by this reduction, the only organ needed to experience fear is a brain,

Please give me evidence of this.  Why is my assumption that a computer's
cognition  /does/ include states analagous to our emotions have any
less weight than your assumption that they don't?  I refuse to be so
anthropocentric without reason.  We are not unique.

But your double will not be over THERE because he'll be running for the door

Being a capitalist does not neccesarily mean that one favors being a 
greedy bastard.  It means that one favors an economic/political system 
in which being a greedy bastard is /profitable/.

Capitalism is an ideal system for many of us who do have more 
important things to do in life than become rich.  It ( ideally ) allows
us to spend the minimum ammount of time money-grubbing and the
maximum doing more important things like like making love or dropping
acid.

There are many interesting related issues here, but most of these
considerations are irrelevant to the puzzle I was talkikng about.  To
get the prediction of agreement, you need the two sides to know that
the others disagree, and in which direction.  Punishment and
idea-space sizes are irrelevant, as are scenarios where you both know
someone else knows something you don't, such as good food plants.
Also irrelevant is disagreeing with people in the past, who certainly
can't know that you disagree with them.

The size of the population who disagrees is relevant, but our
ancestors did have to deal with beliefs communities of varying sizes,
so they presumably learned to condition their strategies on this
context, though the max size they ever dealt with is much smaller than
for us.

I'd be more tempted to look at evolutionary strategies for pretending
to disagree when you really didn't, in order to promote information
aggregation, take credit for originating discoveries and to
demonstrate strength of character.

With all due respect Greg, I think that you have a bit of denial here as
to what Alife feels. Since we are simulating creatures of instinct,
which react to stimuli, then, Alife has really no distinction from
biolife. Animals merely react to input via sensory nerves as pre
programmed by evolved instincts. There is absoulutely no difference,
unless you are an adherent to the Gaia theology. What we are currently
simulating is merely at the level of animals operating on their lizard
evolved cortex, over time, being able to reach higher orders of
simulation will eventually make us able to "simulate" human behavior and
reasoning. At which point, A-Greg will debate with Greg over who is real
and who is not real......

I'm saying that I do not know enough about the details of these
disputes to evaluate the degree to which they are counter-examples to
the theory in question.   I gave a long list of the details I wanted.
Sorry - academic theory evaluation really does put a high premium on
paying attention to details.  I'll understand if you don't have the

How about the entire literatures in experimental game theory and
decision theory over the last few decades?  Standard journals where
such articles (sporatically) appear include Games and Economic
Behavior, Theory and Decision, American Economic Review, Econometrica,
& lots more with "Game Theory" in the title.

Transhuman studies?  Kathryn was studing Sociology (I think), I'm
doing economics, other folks here are studying philosophy, computer
science and areospace engineering.  I don't think all these people are
well advised to study in the same department under the same advisors.  

You'd have better luck creating a list of sympathetic professors who
are interested and able to supervise students with transhuman interests.  
This is how most minority academic communities work.

This implies that centralization in fact does do better at providing
public goods such as defense.  So future hope would have to be based
on changing this somehow by inventing better decentralized
institutions, or on less need for public goods in the future.

Huh?  New high tech includes lots of relatively fixed capital.  If
silicon valley were invaded today, do you think all the workers there
could carry away most of the local capital on their backs, and start
up anew somewhere else together without suffering much harm?

What if I personally build a model of some simple portion of the
real world (say a square room with coloured boxes) and that is used
to render photographic quality images that the program perceives?
Would you call me program's optical hardware?

When the simulated cockroach walks it goes to a different location
in its world (and also on the screen). You can measure the distance
it travelled. You can add a wall to its environment that it cannot
walk through so it has to walk around it. Would you claim it is moving
without walking or that it is not moving?

Many artificial things are real. Ask someone with an artificial heart
whether they are really alive or if its just an illusion.

OK, let's say in order to walk something must move by use of its legs.
The simulated cockroach does this. If it doesn't move it legs in the
right order and it the right way, it doesn't move, therefore it walks.
I mentioned that the same program downloaded into a real six-legged 
robot allows the robot to walk in the real world to prove that the
simulation was sufficiently realistic to model the real world.

The purpose of prisons should not be to "punish" anyone. The purpose of

The distinction between natural and artifical is artificial. Man is 
product of evolution, a natural process. Our technological designs shows 
darwinian signatures, we ourselves are subject to darwinian selection, 
though the fitness function shows alarming dynamics, even our thinking 
process might be based on mutation and darwinian selection on cortex module 
level. We might stand onto our heads, we still would be natural. 

I'd say ALife rendition vs. life is a snuff movie, not a fake.

> why they call it *artificial* life. It is not real. If I am to be

In my interpretation, I do not care about the origin of the process, solely 
about its properties. If the life nucleation event on Earth was caused by a 
cruising alien probe, are we then artificial? And if we are, has this 
any impacts on our daily life? This discussion reminds me of medival 
scholastics, on the properties of souls, by definition nonimmanent, 
undetectable entities.

> uploaded into a computer I don't want *artificial* emotions. I want

If I would perform the cruel trick of anaesthesizing you during your 
sleep, vitrifying you, then uploading (Omega Uploads Ultd.) you and your 
entire room, there would be no perceivable discontinuity. You would need 
start doing physical experiments to find inconsistancies.

(This is assuming perfect uploads, with nonperceivable neural damage, and 
fakespace renderer artfacts also distinctly perception-subthreshold. The 
first uploads will sure be different, Frankensteinian, crude. It will be 
riddled with artefacts, most of them not very pleasant).

You've run into that most cruel trap, fencing with words in a room full of 
smoke and mirrors. I've seen many who never made to escape from there.
 
Concepts are our tools, choose only the suitable, and use them wisely.
I wish you luck.  En garde.

ALife is shorter. 

Don't get me wrong, current critters are way below the nematode level. The 
particular physics of the ALife implementation are highly simplified. It 
is a caricature, yet current models do not aspire to mirror reality. 
There are just experiments to elucidate certain aspects of artificial 
ecologies, cooperation strategies, neodarwinian nonlinearities. 

An upload otoh is a very accurate copy, though certainly not 
at individual ion channel activity level. Nobody in the ALife community 
is talking about uploads yet. Most neurosci, and computational neurosci 
guys merely snicker if you utter "upload" in their presence. Those who
don't, have never heard that term. We'll live and see, who is right.

Much of the value of high tech industries lies in the minds of its
employees and the software, data, and knowledge that they generate. (for
example, most stock analysts say that half the value of Microsoft stock
is representative of Bill Gates' brain's value) Seeing an invasion even
a few hours away would enable Silicon Valley businesses to dump their
mainframes onto systems at remote locations, and provided that their
employees for the most part make it out with their brains intact, can
rebuild their company with only minimal losses, possibly as little as a
30-50% loss in value. The defensive advantage of less likely insurable
intangible assets like brains and bytes is that they tend to be highly
portable, while tangible capital assets like lithographic chipmaking
devices and networks are highly insurable and thus easily replaceable as
opposed to being not very portable. High tech industries can operate
defensively in a scorched earth retreat strategy.

While one chipmaking plant can cost upwards of $1 billion, keep in mind
that the big three car makers each spend that every year on developing
one new car model. While Intel and Mocrosoft are the big boys of high
tech, keep in mind that they are no where near as valuable as GM or
Ford.

We are talking about a technique that is not cloning but production of
human analogs, much like bringing your duplicate here from a parallel
universe. In the case of analogs, property rights as well as personal
responsibility are indeed shared. Imagine someone killing someone then
making 10 duplicates of himself. Pleading guilty gets him 20 years, with
parole at 8 years, yet with shared responsibility, the 8 years are
divided among 10 analogs (plus the original, who may even into hiding)
so they each serve 9.6 months before getting out on good behavior. Since
they would be sentenced at the same time, they would most likely serve
at the same prison, and would hang together, so they wouldn't have to
worry about bending over for the soap.

IF the individual is sufficiently wealthy, as long as they don't mind
diluting their wealth by the number of analogs produced, and can escape
wrongful death lawsuits, this would be a useful option.

True, I have shown no evidence. And you have shown no evidence of your
"preposterous" claim that computers can experience emotions. I can only
show that there are no computers today which experience emotions. You
cannot show me a single computer that does experience emotions. I have
merely shown reason.

The machinery is different, but the machinery/hardware is still capable
of experiencing emotions. Computers today are not. We have a great deal
more in common with mammals than we do computers.

Whoa! I never said anything about requiring more complex brains to feel
emotions ... I said that appropriate brain/hardware is necessary. As a
matter of fact I believe the simplest of mammal brains can experience
emotions, though the most complex of computers cannot. There are
probably an infinite number of hardware designs with the potential to
feel emotions, but the computer is not yet one of them.

No, but they need some way to feel it, and IMHO the more things to feel
with the better as far as I am concerned. If they cannot feel it then it
is not an emotion, it is merely an abstract thought.

Artificial Emotion Program:

  IF x occurs THEN run fear subroutine

  fear subroutine:
      PLAY scream.wav audio file
      DISPLAY ominous.jpg image file 
 
Is that an emotion!?! When exactly did the computer feel an emotion? The
computer is processing its data and x occurs. But it did not feel x, it
merely recognizes x in a very detached manner. The computer then runs
the fear subroutine. The computer "appears" to be displaying an emotion,
but it never felt one. And it does not feel itself playing the sound
file or displaying the image. It merely does it without feeling. Perhaps
you would like to rewrite my hypothetical program above to show me how
theoretically you believe a computer could experience emotions without
hardware for experiencing sensations. Anyone? Please, this would be most
enlightening. You might even recieve the Nobel Prize.

They won't feel it if you don't give them something to feel with. What
part of your computer has the ability to feel? Exactly which part(s) can
feel?

Only one thing is required, humans and other mammals tend to have a
great number of physical organs to feel with. Computers have zero.

Because emotion is not simply a cognitive thing. Take the physical
aspect away from emotion, and there is no emotion, there is only
cognition, thought. Cognition can influence emotion, and emotion can
influence cognition, but they are not the same thing. The primitive
cognition of the limbic system can influence emotions in less evolved
animals, and the emotions of less evolved animals can influence the
cognition taking place in their limbic systems. But both things are
required, an appropriate program and appropriate hardware.

Your statement that any hardware will do is just as ludicrous as saying
any program will do.

A computer cannot say something feels good in the way I can say such. It
can analyze data inputted to it and come to the purely abstract
conclusion that according to all its data this incoming data should be
considered a "good" feeling. But it is not feeling the data. It is just
running subroutines and more subroutines. All the computer has done is
label the data. It has given the data a name and that is it. The
computer can then be programmed to blow bells and whistles but the
computer will in no way ENJOY blowing bells and whistles. It just does
it. There is no way I could scare my computer, there is no way I could
anger my computer, there is no way I could embarass my computer, there
is no way I can give my computer pleasure or pain, no matter what data I
send it or in what fashion I handle it. How is this so difficult to
understand?

All this stuff about one little religion.  I've followed this religious
stuff for man years
now,  and it doesn't  sound much diffrent than any other christian dogma
of all the
christians of the world. Almost all christains and many other religions
feel they
have to die to enter heavens gate.  Many  think it will be done in a
rapture where
all rightous people will leave their humanly  carcasas on earth and  be
taken up  to another
place at god's (some alien who they don't know) bidding.  Sounds the same
to me.  Most
christains today fully and openly plan to die,  and even look forward to
it.  This is
 why it's so hard to get them interested in transhumanism.  They want to
go an
 be an angel or trekee in socalled  gods kingdom, or on his spaceship, 
where
 who knows what they will do.

I think the entire USA is making a bunch of hoopla about something they
say is weard
inyet they are all a bunch of weard hypocrytes,  because they believe the
same thing.  The
only diffrence,  is that most christians and others don't have enough
guts to get it
over with on their own timeline.

I would say that almost all religious fanatics of this sort  that are
death orented are kooks.
It's time people start seeing through this BS.

In what objectively demonstrable way does what you have just described
not apply word-for-word to a human brain?  I may concede that /your/
computer on your desk now might not experience fear or joy, but to
blindly assume that such experiences /cannot/ be experienced by a more
powerful computer in /exactly/ the way I do is to postulate that my
brain is something other than the mechanical process that occurs in it--
in other words, that's tantamount to dualism, and other mystical bunk.

I know that I feel.  I experience it directly.  It would be outrageously
arrogant of me to assume that my particular bizarre construction of
proteins was somehow more capable of that than a similarly-powered
organism implemented in semiconductors.

You acted then as the "optical" or seeing hardware. Sort of like a
seeing eye dog. You acted as the computer's vehicle for viewing the
world. Instead of a camera anylysing a space and rendering it in a
computer, you analyzed the space and rendered it into the computer.

It is a real physical apparatus. It is not artificial in the sense that
I was using artificial. I was using artificial (and perhaps
inapproriately) as the opposite of real. It is not an artificial
computer abstraction of a heart without physical embodiment. Only a
physical "artificial" heart could replace a physical biological heart.
We could not remove the person's heart and then program that person to
think in a different way so that they would not die with the removal of
their heart. The physicality of the artificial heart is not artificial.
You have replaced a physical thing with a physical thing. What we are
debating is the ability to replace physically felt emotions with
something not physical, something purely abstract. There probably are
physical things that can be replaced by abstractions, but not all
physical things can be replaced by abstractions. Emotions cannot.   

No one has shown me any evidence that a computer has the ability to feel
emotive sensation, and I do not believe our discussion is progressing in
that direction. Thus at this point, at least for the time being, I
propose that we agree to disagree.

Explore and play!

If you recognize the flight reactions of, say, a lizard as "fear", then
I would have no hesitation to say that a robot programmed with certain
tropisms, sensory inputs, means of interacting with the environment,
memory to learn, and a program about as complex as whatever would be
a reasonable calculation for the MIPS of a lizard brain, then YES, its
invocation of that routine based on its inputs, and the reactions it
sends to its outputs are not a whit less categorizable as "fear" than
those of the lizard.  I see no reason to assume otherwise.

I might ask the same of you?  What parts of you and me feel?  The only
reasonable answer I can find is potentiation patterns in the brain, which
are precisely copiable onto silicon.

> Only one thing is required, humans and other mammals tend to have a
> great number of physical organs to feel with. Computers have zero.

Mine has a scanner, a tablet, a trackball, and two printers.  It doesn't
have any locomotion or manipulation devices, but it certainly could.
It also doesn't have as complex a brain as we do, or even as complex as
a lizard, but probably more complex than, say, a cockroach.  Does a
cockroach fear the light?

I guess it comes down to two things: (1) Which is the more conservative
assumption in light of our lack of evidence?  I contend that it is more
reasonable to assume that we are not unique; you seem to assume that
there is something special about "living" things (whatever that means).
(2) Is there in fact something about the physical sensations associated
with certain emotional states, without which they would be qualitatitvely
different?

Of course I don't mean to paint Extropians with the same brush.  Instead 
I'll take the other simplified approach and divide us into two 
groups.  The "Select" are those of us who will be selected by nature and 
each other to make it to  the future: to the Singularity, should that 
occur, or otherwise through cryonics, uploading, and the wonderful
future beyond.   The  "Compost" are those who, by neglect, will 
find themselves doomed as  all humans before them have been 
doomed.   Of course luck will play a big part, but of the 
factors under the control of our persons and our  small groups,  
the following are some concrete manifestations of character which 
distinguish Select from Compost:

Select					Compost
--------				------------
Knows the locations of the local	    Can point out all the Apollo 
  healthy restaraunts, 24-hour drugstore,	landing sites on the Moon.
  hospital, health food store, and 
  technical bookstore

"Vegan" an important dietary habit	"Vegan" a fascinating creature 
					    met while on a trip

Overcomes addictions			Thinks nicotine's "smart drug 
   					   effects" outweigh the risks

Telecommutes				Joyrides in personal airplanes

Can on occasion predict particular      Can precisely pinpoint 
  market prices using unique 		  the date of the Singularity
    information				

Can recognize and differentiate between	   Can nitpick all the physics 
  good and  bad epidemiological studies        errors in a sci-fi movie

Knows the names of good doctors,          Knows the names of the 
	dentists, and nutritionists	     entire "Deep Space Nine" cast


Develops relationships and community	Treats cryonics like an 
	towards  mutual assistance        anonymous cash transaction
		in cryonics	

	And the #1 way to distinguish Select from Compost:

Evolves via daily survival & growth	Evolves via alien upload to a comet




Onwards,
Zylof

Vegan is but one diet among many and certainly not the last word in life
extension.
Joyriding in personal Airplanes sounds fine to me, the risks may for some
individuals outweigh the joy of it, for others life is for living it to the
hilt, otherwise why do it.
Uploading and Offworld exploration is a primary  goal of many transhumanists
and Extropians. 
Smart Drugs and Drug Addiction are two different topics, even recreational
drug use is accepted in many lifestyles causing little or no harm.
Scifi movies have nothing to do with this discussion, but let people enjoy
them and nitpick, bad techno memes are worth debunking.

You sound preachy. 
Thanks for sharing.

Those little bug buggers have a lot to answer for.  First sex, then
genocide.  I wondered idly one day if
the horror of  single-generation mass deaths by infection caused by
bacteria and viruses introduced into long-isolated places such as Australia
and various islands is not the time-compressed equivalent of a very
stretched-out Great Dying in other places.  Leaving aside the matter of
bugs evolving commensal forms - but even then, what is mild in populations
exposed to bugs from birth is hideously lethal otherwise.  Fences (and
rivers and oceans) might make good neighbours, but the better they are the
more of your kids die in the long run.  (This fact, BTW, presumably
falsifies Hoyle & Wickramasinghe's bugs-from-space theory.)

If I hit my finger with a hammer that is an objective fact and my smashed 
finger is a physical object, but the pain I experience is subjective, it is 
not physical it's mental, and there is no way I can prove to anybody else 
that it even exists. Nobody will ever be able to prove that a computer feels
emotions, but nobody will ever be able to prove that I do either.

As I said I can't prove it, but it sure seems like a very good bet to me. 
A computer works by manipulating electrons in a dry semiconductor substrate. 
A brain works by manipulating ions in a wet protein substrate. 
I can think of no unique property of ions that grants them and only them the 
ability to generate emotions.

I still hold some small hope for you to understand, so I'll try one
more tack: from where you're sitting now, look up to the corner of
the room you're in.  See it?  /Where/ do you see it?  Sure, it appears
to be in the corner of the room, a few feet away.  But you don't have
any tentacles out there; your eyes are next to your head.  But your
eyes aren't really seeing it either; they're just photosensors.  The
act of /seeing/ is occurring in the processes of your brain, where
you are processing data from the retina, concluding that those data
represent a corner 10 feet away, and then causing you to /experience/
a corner that /appears/ 10 feet away.

Now, pinch your hand.  Feel that?  /Where/ did you feel it?  You
didn't feel it with your hand, because if you could, it wouldn't have
any need for the nerves that carry the impulse up to the brain to do
the feeling.  And the brain doesn't send anything back down to the
hand.  The /feeling/ happens right up there in your brain, and the
processing arranges things so that you /believe/ you are feeling it
in your hand, and it even back-patches the timestamps in memory so you
think you felt it when the stimulus actually happened.  The brain is
very good at that, as evidenced by things like phi experiments and
sound compression (that takes advantage of the fact that sounds can
mask other sounds that occur forward in time).

So, tell me again where those emotional experiences occur?  Sure, I
may experience fear viscerally, but there aren't even any nerves in
my viscera, so those experiences are taking place /in the brain/, as
patterns of chemical transmission and potentiation.  It then produces
some outputs like heart rate, sweaty palms, etc., which I also become
aware of /in the brain/.

Now then, what is the difference between "fear" manifested as patterns
of chemical transmission and potentiation in the brain, and those same
patterns manifested as electrical transmissions and magnetic storage
in a computer of similar speed and capacity?  When computers become
sufficiently powerful to learn the way children do, and control their
own sensory inputs and mechanical outputs, in what way would reactions
of its software be qualitatively different from those of our wetware?

Why do you continue to label him an inferior being?  Either you are
postulating dualism (and say so if that's your case), or else you
are simply a "carbonist" for reasons you will not justify.
