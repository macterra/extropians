Another part of the paper that I disagree with is sections 4.2 and 4.3,
on procrastination and addiction.

In procrastination, we put off an unpleasant experience.  Later we wish
that we had done it sooner.  In addiction, we cause a pleasant experience
which will have unpleasant consequences in the future.  At that time we
regret our earlier choice.

Obviously both of these phenomena have to do with how we make and evaluate
choices over time.  However, as I mentioned earlier with reference to
another part of the paper, discounting as typically understood cannot
be considered to play a significant role in these phenomena.

The problem is simply that the time frame is too short for the kinds of
discount rates which I have seen suggested to play a significant part.
Typical discount rates are proposed to be on the order of a few percent
per YEAR.  Yet with procrastination we are usually putting off an
unpleasant event by days or weeks at most.  And with addiction, the
unpleasant consequence comes within days or even hours.

None of the models I have seen would give a reasonable explanation of
addiction in terms of discounting, when the time span between pleasure
and pain is only a few hours.

Now, you could probably come up with a model that would work for this,
but it would not involve exponential discounting.  You might have a sort
of a quasi delta function, where the present weighs extremely heavily,
and events just a few hours away are heavily discounted, with the rate
of additional discounting tapering off as we get farther away from the
present.  However I think this model would be inconsistent with results
from economic experiments which show more moderate discount rates.

My conclusion is that our perception of time, and the impacts our choices
make over time, is complex.  Phenomena like addiction and procrastination
really don't fit into the simplistic model offered by the authors.
Rather, they show that the actual situation is much more complicated.

I don't think you can separate out discounting so easily from these
other effects.  An analogy I might suggest is our taste for foods.
In some sense this is ideosyncratic and comes from within.  However it is
determined in large part by our evolutionary heritage.  We like foods that
are sweet and fatty because they were good energy sources in an era when
starvation was a threat.  We don't sit down and analyze a food rationally
to determine whether it tastes good, so it may appear that whether a
food tastes good or not has nothing to do with how healthy it is.

In the same way, discounting may still appear even in experiments where
growth and risk of loss have been eliminated.  But that doesn't mean that
it is independent of those effects, any more than the fact that unhealthy
foods taste good means that tastes have nothing to do with the health
value of foods.  Rather, in each case I would suggest that evolution built
into us an instinct which serves us well in the majority of situations we
encountered at the time.  We like sugar and we discount the future for the
same reason, because it was a good strategy for our ancestors to follow.
Put us in a situation where sugar is unhealthy and we'll still like it.
Put us in a situation where there is no risk in postponing consumption,
and we'll still want to consume the majority today.  It's not because
discounting has nothing to do with risk, it's that discounting is an
instinctive behavior that works well in a risky world.

It also appears to me that the authors have not tried to separate
discounting from issues of uncertainty about the future, as when they
write,

: Beyond revealed preference, the strongest theoretical argument in
: favor of discounting, involves what Bohm-Bawerk referred to as the
: "brevity and uncertainty of human life."  According to this view,
: people discount future felicity because they may not be around to
: enjoy it.  An individual weighs pleasures at date t by the conditional
: probability of living until date t.

Rather than factoring out uncertainty, they propose uncertainty as a
theoretical justification for discounting.  I suggested earlier that
in addition to the possibility of death, there are other forms of
"uncertainty of human life".  Given that life is uncertain, it seems
very plausible to me that evolution would program discounting into
living creatures.

Put another way, I suggest that if we could somehow imagine creatures
evolving in a situation where there was no uncertainty, and goods saved
would be guaranteed to be available in the future, those creatures would
not discount the future.  They would have no incentive to consume more in
the present.  Rather, they would take a long term perspective and allocate
their goods equally across each period of their life.  Of course this
is purely hypothetical but it will hopefully make my position more plain.

We see discounting today as a psychological effect, but the fact remains
that it must be there for a reason.  The question is, then, is discounting
rational, and are discount rates optimal under at least some conditions.
In other words, is discounting purely endogenous as the authors seem
to assume, a matter of taste only, or is it exogenous, determined by
outside conditions and external constraints?

If the latter, proposals to artificially change discount rates must
cause inefficiencies and impose costs.  I don't see that the paper's
analysis considers this possibility.  Social planners do not have the
freedom to shift discount rates around at will in order to benefit one
time frame over another, any more than they can shift prices at will in
order to benefit one group or another.  Making these changes will have
consequences for the welfare and efficiency of the society as a whole.
Any proposal to take such actions must look at the larger picture.

That paper is just referring to a large economic literature that does
try to explain procrastination via non-exponential discounting.
A common model is "hyperbolic" discounting.  If you could persuasively
show such models to be inconsistent with experiments, you could publish
that and win fame among economists.  So far such models do a reasonable
job of accounting for a wide range of otherwise puzzling phenomena.

I can't follow your argument.  Yes of course our preferences evolved to
be adaptive to our ancestors' environment.  And if so then artificially
changing our actions, relative to those we prefer, would make us less
adaptive if we were still in our ancestors' environment.

But you seem to accept that our environment has changed greatly since
our preferences evolved.  And the paper isn't about what is adaptive
anyway - it is about what would satisfy the preferences we have, however
we got them and however adaptive they are.

I don't know of any physics articles on time machines based on this concept.
But if this could make sense it would only strengthen the basic claim I was

You are of course free to invent your own meaning for the term, but the 
standard
economist meaning is just a feature of a scenario that causes a market to 
produce
worse outcomes, wrt a standard welfare measure, seem otherwise possible.

Title
  Freeze duration influences
  postfreeze survival in the frog Rana sylvatica.
Source
  Journal of Experimental Zoology.  280(2):197-201, 1998 Feb 1.
Abstract
  Survival, cryoprotection, and the time course for recovery of vital functions
  were studied in autumn-collected juvenile wood frogs (Rana sylvatica)
  following freezing at -1.5 degrees C for various periods. Frogs readily
  tolerated freezing for 3 or 9 d, but only 50% survived a 28-d freezing trial.
  Generally, the postfreeze return of vital functions
  (vascular circulation, pulmonary breathing, righting reflex, jumping reflex)
  occurred later in frogs frozen for longer periods. Augmenting endogenous
  levels of the cryoprotectant glucose (via injections) prior to freezing
  substantially increased freeze endurance, as these frogs had
  excellent survival after remaining frozen for as long as 49 d. The improved
  freeze endurance of glucose-loaded frogs apparently was not
  associated with a reduction in ice content but rather may reflect the greater
  availability of energy substrate needed to support metabolism of frozen
  ischemic tissues.

"Corn" was a generic term for any grain seed- ie, barleycorn.  The
"corn" rioted over was wheat.

Right, the grain we call corn is called Maize in most countries.

I think it has, although I don't know what the detailed impact of these
changes would be.  But I don't see where in the paper this fact arises.
Wouldn't the authors' reasoning apply just as well if the environment
hadn't changed?  So what is the relevance of this change?

But isn't it relevant that changing society's discount rates may be
harmful?  Or is that simply off topic for this paper?

What if someone wrote a paper proposing to change prices.  Let's lower
the price of gasoline to 10 cents a gallon.  That would improve social
welfare because there are more consumers than producers.  Is it reasonable
to neglect the impact of that change on the supply of gasoline, and to
look only at how this satisfies our preferences?

Harmful in what sense?  Making people choose actions that are less adaptive
means making them choose actions that lead to fewer descendants.  The paper
is about what actions better satisfy the preferences of the people involved,
whether that leads to more or fewer descendants.

As economists usually define social welfare, this would not improve social
welfare.  Even if a few consumers gain, many more consumers would lose, as
would producers.  All these gains and losses are from the point of view
of the preferences of the people involved.

Another aspect of the reasoning in the paper that bothers me is that the
notion of regretting past decisions implicitly assumes new information
that was not present in the past.

Someone may regret not having saved more in the past.  That would
make more available in the present.  But if the reason for the extra
consumption in the past was due to the riskiness of the future, then the
decision may have been appropriate even though later regret was possible.
This happens if the risks did not actually occur.

A person who regrets not having saved more ten years ago would probably
have a very different view if he is on a plane about to crash.  Then,
he will be very glad of his past consumption.  In fact, he will wish
that he had consumed even more, lived life to its fullest, rather than
saving for a future which, as it happens, will never arise.

Not only death, but the many other risks I have described can give rise
to this effect.  It does little good to save if you are paralyzed in
an accident and unable to enjoy your savings, or if your entire life
savings are lost due to theft or misfortune.

When we ask people today to look back and see if they regret having
consumed in the past (equivalent to asking whether the "past discount
rate" is less than the reciprocal of the future discount rate they
adopted back then), we are asking people who got lucky.  From their
present perspective, they know that none of the risks that they were
(possibly unconsciously) considering in their past consumption decisions
actually arose, at least not in the most extreme form.

It's not right to require reciprocal past-future discounting for time
consistency, when we are looking at all past people but only a selected
subset of corresponding future people.  The selection effect occurs
because we are only asking living people, we are probably only asking
relatively healthy people, and we are only asking people who have not
been subject to a devastating economic crash in the past few decades.

All an evolutionary argument tells us is that changes in the discount
rate would ultimate lead to less survival and, yes, fewer descendants.
This may be due to increases in the death rate or decreases in the birth
rate.  Do we want to ignore the fact that a policy prescription may lead
to increases in the death rate?  Even if it acted through decrease in
birth rate, that may be due to poorer health.

I keep asking the same question, which is, why is it OK for the paper
to ignore these effects?

Yes, there would be losses, but only when you analyze the full impact
of the changes.  A superficial analysis which only looks at the direct
effect of the price change will show that the majority of people gain
while a minority loses, because most people prefer to pay less for goods.

It seems to me that the discount rate paper is providing a similarly
superficial analysis.  They are not looking at the full effect of the
changes they propose.  They are only looking at how much these changes
would directly affect people's satisfaction.  They are not considering
the larger impact these changes would have.

Isn't it reasonable that changes in the discount rate will have long term
effects on society which could greatly change its economic structure?
The authors propose subsidies to capital accumulation and increases in
investment and saving.  These will tend to increase economic growth.
At the same time they recommend conservation of natural resources.
This will increase costs which may tend to limit growth.

What happens when you rev up the economic growth engine, while at the
same time choking back the flow of raw materials which would normally
fuel that growth?  You could see a squeeze on substitute materials,
localized price increases, and general economic disruption.

Isn't it possible that the society which results from making all these
changes, even though they are intended to satisfy people's preferences,
is one in which people are less happy than they would have been without
them?  Just as lowering gas prices ends up making people less happy,
even if it is done in order to satisfy people's preferences?

Am I off base in making this analogy?

There's an interesting question (#2) on the Massachusetts
ballot:  should incarcerated convicted felons be denied
the right (that they currently have and occasionally
exercise) to vote in Massachusetts general elections?
The robot response is "Of course!," of course, on the
principle that felons and children and lunatics and
non-honestiores in general should be denied all rights, in
case one ever should chance to exercise such a right in a
felonious, childish, lunatic, or subdig way.  But there
are felons and there are felons, and lunatics and
lunatics.  Does scanning and printing currency invalidate
your political judgement as much or more than scooping it
out of the supermarket cashdrawer?
As an American gunowner I am subject to being declared a
felon by fiat;  as an Extropian sympathiser I feel often
that I am developing and maintaining new memes and skills
simply so that I can use them to commit crimes yet
unnamed.
Incarceration, after all, is just a redefinition of
limits.

Corn as we are dicussing is Maize, which was developed from crossbreeding a
teosinte variant with some other plants (which are all exclusive to the New
World). The large ear maize we think of now is largely the result of
manipulation by europeans since they arrived in the new world.

Suppose Person A wants to open up a bar, and applies for a liquor license. 
Persons B, consisting of the resident/owners of a nearby condominium complex,
are annoyed by this for the standard reasons - increased noise, increased
traffic, violent drunks wandering around, and decreased property values. 
Suppose that Persons B sign a petition to deny a liquor license to Person A,
thus annoying Person A and any investors thereof.  Do you agree or disagree
with the following statements?

 (A) Signing a petition to deny a liquor license is an improper use of
government mechanisms, constituting the initiation of force.

 (B) Signing the petition may be a minor initiation of force, but that's a
justified response to the bar's proposed initiation of noise (or the other
negative effects).

 (C) The city government deciding the issue is the nearest available
approximation to the dispute resolution mechanisms that would exist in a
libertarian society - for example, distributed ownership of "noise rights".

 (D) This is a straightforward conflict of interest between the bar builders
and the condo owners, and invoking libertarian ethics is needlessly
complicating the issue.

Old meaning of "corn", which refers the the primary grain of a society, 
whatever
it is (wheat, rye, barley, etc.)  In American English (Brits too?) the the 
term came
to refer to the Amerindian corn, which is more precisely termed maize.  I have
no idea why the term switched; maybe because long-distance food transportation
made the original concept unclear for any given society.

I think you are missing the fundamental point that standard policy analysis
is a lot more libertarian than you expect.  It doesn't ask what policies
are good for people in some absolute sense, it asks what policies will give
people the things that they want.  If people are willing to suffer risks
of death to get, say, fun, then standard policy analysis wants them to
take such risks.

As Nick emphasized, standard policy analysis isn't about what makes
people happy, its about giving people what they want.  And the fact is
that people don't just want to be happy.  They are willing to give up
happiness to get other things.

Felons who have been release from jail and served out their probation can, after
a certain amount of time, petition the court for 'relief of civil disability',
so your concern here is not neccessary, as there are mechanisms for certain
felons who wish to regain their right to vote and exercise other civil rights.
What the massachusetts bill is all about is giving democrats one more captive
block of disempowered people to get votes from (to join the elderly, disabled,
welfare dependents, etc). The reason they are pushing this is that the
Republican power in Massachusetts has been growing over the last decade, and
part of this is because so many criminals cannot now vote, and do not go through
the existing process to regain the ability to vote. What the democrats want to
be able to do is get their supporters appointed as wardens at prisons, who will
then deliver up an assured number of votes for democrat candidates that
republicans cannot touch.

If that is your real concern, then don't worry. I expect if the democrats outlaw
them, you will quickly see Alaska and several western states secede from the
union. Don't know about New Hampshire, or Vermont, but I'm sure there would be
efforts made here. Don't think that the rest of the country is as dumb as the
people in Boston, New York, and DC.

The sad thing is that the democrats know they HAVE to use the lobster method.
They will take things nice and slow, as they always have, two steps forward, one
back.

a) what presidential candidate will you vote for?
b) what presidential candidate do you prefer?
c) what presidential candidate do you think will win?

I will try to learn more about hyperbolic discounting.  One abstract I
found at http://www.opioids.com/abstract/discount.html generally supports
the hyperbolic model, but it closes with:

       Consistent with previous findings, delayed heroin rewards were
       discounted at a significantly higher rate than were delayed
       monetary rewards.

This conforms to my observation that in order to explain addiction via
discounting, you must invoke a significantly higher discount rate than the
kind of rates I am familiar with from monetary markets.  My conclusion was
that discounting didn't fit, however I see now that another explanation
is to invoke different discount rates for different sources of happiness.

Still, if people discount different pleasures by different amounts,
the model in the social discounting paper is incomplete at best.

In the US, "corn" is used for what the rest of the world calls "maize" or
"maise."  (In the US, the latter terms are also used, but not commonly.)  In
the rest of the world, "corn" generally means "grain" and be used to mean
any such grain, such as oats, barley, and wheat.

I meant to be using "happy" as synonymous with "having preferences
satisified" or "maximizing utility".  Let me try to boil it down to just
a couple of sentences, which summarize the argument I have been trying
to make.

Making changes to discount rates is motivated by satisfying people's
preferences.  However, making this change will have side effects.
This could lead to people having fewer of their preferences satisfied.

Does that make sense?

Gee, I feel bad that you didn't get your money's worth.  You made no
mention of the set of ExI action figures and the accessories catalog.  Boy,
if you missed out on that, I can see why you're pissed.  I've enjoyed
untold hours of good clean fun with mine.  It's highly extropic, and
educational as well.  Of course I dropped a bundle on the accessories, but
it was worth every penny of it.  Except maybe the Mike Lorrey accessory
kit, which I think was a bit much.  I mean the F-16 is pretty cool, with
the nuclear payload in the weapons bay and all, but an entire aircraft
carrier to go with it?  Then there's Mike's personal humvee, mechanized
quad fifty, and nuclear missile silo slash headquarters compound.  If you
send the Mikey figure down the little elevator and then slide back the
little blast door on top, you can hear a little recorded action figure
voice echoing from deep within the silo saying:  "You'll never take me
alive!" or "There's no such thing as a free lunch!" or "Die, collectivist
swine!" or other such Mikeyisms.  Totally cool!  And the little Mikey
figure drops right into the F-16 cockpit.  Then you can fling it across the
room real neato.  But you have to be careful, cause if the Spike Jones
figure is out of the box--and this is invariably the case--it will blast
off from the ground and knock Mikey and F-16 right out of the air. (It will
do the same thing if you just throw the nuclear payload, or even, in fact,
if you just throw little Mikey himself!  When something dangerous goes
ballistic, I guess, the Spikester is just programmed to intercept.)   And I
don't even want to tell you about Mikey's gun collection.  Very extensive,
very costly.  But if you buy the whole thing you get a miniature (2" x
1.25") complimentary copy of the Bill of Rights with a bullet resistant
polycarbonate front window and welded titanium frame, the Second Amendment
engraved around the periphery.  (You have to use a magnifying glass to read
the tiny lettering.  Way cool.) 

The Natasha Vita-More action figure is quite beautiful.  Natasha--as I like
to call her because, well, it's her name--Natasha comes with her own
extropic pleasure dome and aesthetic-energy nexus (which costs extra).  It
looks kinda of like a lava lamp only spherical.  When you power it up and
drop her into what the catalog describes as the "teardrop of Maya" she
morphs into "a fractal kaliedoscope of shapes, textures, and colors", "a
sensuous dance of light and form",  "an iridescent celebration of a waking
dream".  Very beautiful.  When I put it in my green house, all the plants
turn their leaves to face it and bloom continuously.

The Anders Sandberg figure is truly remarkable.  One of my favorites.  It's
some sort of nootropic receiver and amplifier.  Wherever you put it, the
nearby objects become more, ... er, ... evolved. I put it in my aquarium
and all the fish grew legs, climbed out of the water, and escaped into the
greenhouse.  Last I saw they were basking in the glow of Natasha's light
and throbbing contentedly.  I put it on top of my head and immediately felt
as if my consciensceness were expanding at light speed out into the
universe, the experience rapidly exceeding the ability of words to convey
it.  But it was impossible--for me at least--to sustain the flow of
nootropic energy.  According to the catalog, some sort of metered-feedback,
self-limiting feature, a kind of safety cut-off.  Prevents unqualified
transcends.  I would awaken to find myself in the greenhouse, beneath the
flowers, basking in Natasha's light, surrounded by lizard-fish, all of us
throbbing contentedly.  Anders meanwhile, would be over in the corner with
the Buddha and the Max figure, the three of them surrounded by a halo of
what I guess to be uplifted and by-now-very-bright microorganisms.
Luckily, but logically, the 'Anders effect' is always benign.

The Robert Bradbury figure is quite dynamic. It comes complete with the
Crown of Bluntness at no extra charge, I suppose because you can't get it
off no matter how hard you try.  If you do try, be prepared for some sparks
and a very nasty shock!  In those moments when it seems quiescent, if you
get down real close and put your ear right up next to it, you can hear in
miniature--no, more like full size, but at a great distance--the sound of
vast engines and the rumbling crackle of megajoules of plasma energy
surging relentlessly.  You jump back in fear and wonder at the impression
of so much energy in so small a space.  When it goes kenetic it turns into
a semi-invisible blur, like the wings of a hummingbird.

On a cold winter's night, I like to arrange all of the action figures in a
little semicircle in front of the fire--it's in one of those fake gas
fireplaces.  In place of the regular fake-fire items I put this special
ceramic model of the washington capitol building and the White House (from
the catalog; not too expensive).  When I light 'er up, flames come out of
the little windows and doors.  It's really neat, and all the action figures
start to sing: "The sun will come up tomorrow.  Bet your bottom
dollar,...etc"  You know, the song from "Annie".  It's kinda cute.

When the set first came there was a message telling me that the Eugene
Leitel and Robin Hanson figures would be shipped separately.  When that
package came however, it was empty, and a big hole torn in the side--it
looked like the box had been burst from inside.  An accompanying message
said that they had been out of stock of the Robin Hanson units.  I called
ExI's customer service and they said that the distributor has been told
repeatedly not to send Eugene out alone.  He get's bored and refuses to
stay in the box.      

By far the most impressive, bizarre, and perhaps even dangerous action
figure is the Eliezer Yudkowsky.  In a pitcher of heavy water, it will
swell to fill the pitcher, the resulting protoplasmic 'gel' giving off an
eerie blue glow.  Gradually, if left to stand, the water will evaporate and
the Eliezer figure will be restored.  But whereas, if you put the other
action figures in water, in the freezer, they will eventually end up head
down, frozen in ice, if you attempt this with the Eliezer figure, the blue
gel will expand, absorbing first the pitcher, then filling the freezer and
absorbing everything inside; all the other action figures; everything.
Then, unless you act quickly and shut off the freezer, turn off the gas and
electric, shut off the heat, and pull down the shades, the blue gel will
absorb the freezer and a substantial portion of your kitchen as well.  This
worries me, because, though everything will eventually return to normal,
all the action figures then give off this slight blue glow.  And while
everything seems like it's back to normal, nevertheless it also seems
somehow, ... different.

I bet what happened to your set was that, since you're in Sweden, the
packeage was probably opened in customs.  Big mistake.  Extropians, like
the beasties from the Pandora story, never will go back in the box.  Guess
you'll just have to come to the US, check out the next conference, and pick
up another set.

Worth the trip.

I think the authors are making a mistake here. To the extent that 
"discounting the future" is merely a matter of weighing in the risk that 
things could go wrong before we reap the harvest on our investments, then 
their arguments don't show that dictatorship of the moment leads to 
suboptimal total preference satisfaction. Any benevolent social planner 
would also have to take that risk into account. This is an epistemic matter 
("we don't know the future") rather than a matter of incentives ("we care 
too much about the present to freely optimize total preference satisfaction").

I would prefer a 100% chance of getting $1,000,000 to a 50% of getting 
2,001,000. This could be explained either by saying that I am risk averse 
or by saying that there is a diminishing marginal utility of money for me. 
Is there a way of distinguishing these explanations or are they 
fundamentally saying the same thing?

We might try to answer this question by considering goods that purportedly 
don't have a diminishing marginal utility, such as units of pleasure. 
Suppose I prefer a 100% chance of getting 1,000,000 hedons to a 50% of 
getting 2,001,000 hedons. Does this then show that I am truly risk averse? 
But how do we know that there is not a diminishing utility of hedons? (Not 
to mention the difficulty of measuring hedons.)

Maybe we can approach the issue by considering goods that have different 
rates of diminishing marginal utility. The marginal utility of hamburgers 
decreases very rapidly - after one or two I really don't care to get any 
more. The marginal utility of money decreases more slowly - almost any 
imaginable sum would still leave me wanting more. Risk aversion, on the 
other hand, is not supposed to be relative to goods. So risk aversion would 
be what remains when we have factored out the specific diminishing marginal 
utility of the good we are considering. The problem is knowing when we have 
factored out all the diminishing marginal utility. Maybe we could define 
risk aversion as the factor by which our choices deviate from getting the 
greatest expected quantity of good x, where x is the good which has the 
least diminishing marginal utility. But what would x be? Something like 
wish-granting-power? How would that be quantified? Wish-granting power 
doesn't come in natural units like kilograms or $$. You could say that one 
unit of wish-granting power is the power to grant one wish. But how does 
one individuate wishes? (One couldn't permit wishes that asks for more 
wishes, or wishes that are conjunctions of arbitrarily many "sub-wishes".)

[Wild idea: Could we say that a basic wish is the power to determine the 
true answer to a random one-bit question?]

Maybe we'll have to stick to money as the best approximation to such a 
"pure good". But then it seems we should forego speaking of diminishing 
utility of money. Only stuff like consumption of hamburgers would have a 
diminishing marginal utility, and it would be measured by how much less 
money we are willing to pay for eating an additional hamburger.

A common intuition is that, other things equal, a more even distribution of 
money is better. But rather than grounding this in diminishing utility of 
money, one would have to justify it by appealing to risk aversion. Perhaps 
one could tell some sort of veil-of-ignorance story to that end.

Alternatively, we could seek to reinterpret all talk of risk aversion as 
talk about diminishing utility of money. Is there any reason why this would 
not be an attractive option?

I see at least two reasons:

1)  In addition to compensating for the diminishing utility of money, there
could be compensation for other factors - for example, a tendency to
overestimate the probability of success in cases where risks are taken.  If
this tendency is common enough, there will exist an advantage for risk
aversion in general, even when it contradicts the apparent cognitive model.

2)  Regardless of what the rational action is when the results are measured in
"hedons", the de-facto truth that most goods have diminishing marginal utility
may have resulted in a selection pressure for risk aversion, resulting in an
emotional adaptation for risk aversion; which now continues to operate even in
the absence of any rational utility for such an adaptation; and which
economists must therefore assume as a behavioral influence regardless of
whether the resulting behavior is actually rational.

The natural world has not changed much.  But our intellectual and social
world has changed greatly.  Perhaps enough that what we were evolved for
is simply inadequate to the world we now inhabit.  And of course the
forces of technology and knowledge are accelerating us further from that
original environment.

No, and mandatory unilateral manipulations of this kind are almost
always a bad idea.  But a deeper appreciation of the changes of basic
assumptions and environment that are present and increasing might lead
to multilateral changes in the way we look at and run our economies and
in what we value.  This of course will not happen overnight.

Under expected utility maximization, they are fundamentally the same thing.
This is a very standard result.

Then hedons must have non-linear utility, given expected utility.

But risk aversion is, and is supposed to be, relative to goods!

I don't think it makes sense to talk about side effects of changing
discount rates, because that isn't a specific policy which can have
such effects.  You could talk about the side effects of changing
interest rates, or rates of taxation on capital, or subsidizing
education, etc.  But social discount rates are just a feature of
social preferences - and preferences don't have side effects, actions
do.

This is the press release which Shell is putting out, to announce the 
winners of the essay competition.  There was an announcement based on this 
press release on page 19 of the Oct 21-27 issue of The Economist.

Bill


Prize-winning thinking.
Winners announced for 'The World in 2050' writing
competition run by Shell and The Economist.

The Economist and Shell are pleased to announce the
winner of this international writing competition,
which was launched in April 2000.

The aim of the competition was to encourage debate and
thought about the social, political, environmental,
technological and economic issues that countries,
companies and individuals will face in the middle of
the 21st century.

William Douglass, age 28, from Houston, Texas beat
more than 3000 entrants from 75 countries with his
essay 'Dear Nestor'.  The essay takes the form of a
letter written by a young Bangladeshi boy to a friend
in the USA in a world governed by 'The Network' where
oil rigs are obsolete, and special genes and limited
duration marriages are the norm.

The judges chose Mr Douglass's entry because of the
connection made between advances in technology and the
unchanging importance of human relationships.

Bill Emmott said: "We liked this essay not only
because it was compellingly written in an accessible
form, but also because it artfully included ideas both
about how life and people might change, and about
things which might endure."

The competition was judged by a panel of experts
chaired by Richard O'Brien, Partner of Outsights (the
international consultancy in external change and
strategy).  The panel included Esther Dyson, an e-guru
and investor; Peter Warshall, a biologist and
environmentalist; Matt Ridley, a science writer, most
recently of "Genome", a much-acclaimed book; Wolfgang
Michalski, a futurist at the OECD; Jusuf Wanandi, an
Indonesian academic specialising in strategic studies;
Bill Emmott, editor of The Economist; and Sir Mark
Moody-Stuart, chairman of the Committee of Managing
Directors of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.

William Douglass will receive a prize of US$20,000 and
his essay will appear in The Economist's annual
publication, "The World in 2001", published in
November 2000.  Two second prizes of $10,000 are
awarded to Paul Gordon and Robert Carlson, and five
third prizes of $5,000 go to Peter Baker, Alain
Boxhammer, Paul Copeland, Peter John and Martin Smith
Sir Mark Moody-Stuart said: "What has been impressive
about this competition is the range and scope of
entries.  From space exploration through to
environmental sustainability, it is clear that there
are common themes of concern and debate that are
shared across the world.  As well as offering
congratulations to the prizewinners, I'd like to say a
big thank-you to everyone who made the effort to share
with us their vision of what the world will be like in
2050."

Neuroprotective signaling and the aging brain: take away my food and let

It is remarkable that neurons are able to survive and function for a
century or more in many persons that age successfully. A better
understanding of the molecular signaling mechanisms that permit such cell
survival and synaptic plasticity may therefore lead to the development of
new preventative and therapeutic strategies for age-related
neurodegenerative disorders. We all know that overeating and lack of
exercise are risk factors for many different age-related diseases
including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancers. Our recent studies
have shown that dietary restriction (reduced calorie intake) can increase
the resistance of neurons in the brain to dysfunction and death in
experimental models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease and stroke. The mechanism underlying the beneficial
effects of dietary restriction involves stimulation of the expression of
'stress proteins' and neurotrophic factors. The neurotrophic factors
induced by dietary restriction may protect neurons by inducing the
production of proteins that suppress oxyradical production, stabilize
cellular calcium homeostasis and inhibit apoptotic biochemical cascades.
Interestingly, dietary restriction also increases numbers of
newly-generated neural cells in the adult brain suggesting that this
dietary manipulation can increase the brain's capacity for plasticity and
self-repair. Work in other laboratories suggests that physical and
intellectual activity can similarly increase neurotrophic factor
production and neurogenesis. Collectively, the available data suggest the
that dietary restriction, and physical and mental activity, may reduce
both the incidence and severity of neurodegenerative disorders in humans.
A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying
these effects of diet and behavior on the brain is also leading to novel
therapeutic agents that mimick the beneficial effects of dietary
restriction and exercise.

Stay hungry,

But the authors do make policy suggestions.  In fact I take this to be
the main point of the paper.  The abstract concludes, "Our analysis has
immediate implications for public policy: agents discount the future
too much and the government should promote future oriented policies."
They write, in section 4.1,

"Relative to the market evaluation, our analysis tips the scales in
favor of policies with short run costs and long run benefits.  In the
area of fiscal policy, it favors subsidies to capital accumulation.
In the area of monetary policy, it favors low inflation.  In the area
of natural resource extraction, it favors conservation.  In general,
it favors investment and saving at the expense of consumption."

My complaint is that the authors have not shown that these suggestions
will achieve their goal of better satisfying people's preferences.
Making these changes may cause disruptions to the economy that their
analysis did not consider.  And this could result in social preferences
being less satisfied than under the status quo.

The burden of proof ought to be on those who propose policy changes
to show that they will achieve their goal.  Just because people in the
future might wish they had saved more in the past, that doesn't imply that
making people save more in the past will automatically satisfy more of
the preferences of people in the future.  It's like my earlier analogy:
people would prefer to pay less for gasoline, but lowering gasoline
prices will not automatically make their preferences be better satisfied.

"Tips the scale" is a weak claim.  They are just saying that all else
equal this makes such policies look a little better.  Yes of course to
decide on a particular policy you have to consider all effects,
including "disruptions."  On net none of these policies may be a good
idea, even when we realized that the social horizon is longer than the
individual horizon.

As some of you may have noticed already, the FDA has forced Mission to recall a
rather large list of corn products sold under Kraft license, not for any actual
evidence that it is unsafe, but because the products have been found to have
been tainted by StarLink variety corn. The EPA has no actual proof that human
consumption is harmful, but has concerns that people with certain allergies may
have reactions to the corn varietal (if the EPA is now an allergy regulatory
body, thats the first that I've heard of it, I want cats, ragweed, and dust
mites outlawed pronto), as if discomfort is somehow to be equated with harm.
(hell, Al Gore discomforts me, and I don't see a superfund site sign on him
(though I'm sure thats what all the soft money is for))

See the following:

Hell, sounds like its time for me to go shopping. I know, lets buy all the
recalled products up, and sell them in our own Extroway food stores, all located
on Native American reservation property, to avoid the EPA and FDA regs...

Give one to teh FDA for consistency, at the very least.  According to their 
determination process. StarLink has "not et been approved for human 
consumption".  It's the same standard that it applies to drugs when it 
tests for ssafety and efficacy.  If it's not yet gotten the "human use" seal
of approval, you can use it for animals, but not on people.

The arguement about allergies is semantic - We are talking about two different
types of allergies here.  Anyone who suffers hay fever may think that it's 
the end of te world - but unless you've gone into allergic shock from exposure
to something in your food (or a beesting), you don't know anything about what
"allergic" really means in the health arena.  Food allergies are serious 
things, not the sort of sniffles and congestion caused commonly by ragweed 
pollen, animal dander, or dust mites.  

The way I understand it, the concern with the StarLink corn has to do with a
gene from a bacillus that is toxic to insects, but non-toxic to most mammals.
The problem is that in some percentage of the population, this protein that is
toxic to insects can cause allergic reactions of varying strengths, up to and
including anaphylactic (sp?) shock.  The FDA has not done enough testing on
human beings to find out whether or not this gene expresses the specific 
protein that causes this allergic reaction.

On the same score, I'm not a proponent for making things 100% safe - that's 
never going to happen.  But just like we have little notes on most everything
that i contains phenylalanine, we could have a similar designation, if the
fear of allergic reaction proves founded.

I'd have to say (c), since it is a dispute, and someone has to resolve it, short
of violence. The petition may be an initiation of force, if there's an
expectation of it getting you what you want when you have no legitimate right
involved, or it might simply be a way of getting the government to pay attention
to this violation.
     Ethics (specifically libertarian here, but ethics in general) ARE the
issue, that is how to determine who's right, by what values and methods is an
answered arrived at, and are all parties satisfied about the justice of the
issue.
     Given that both parties think they have a legitimate interest in what they
want, and they can't both have all of what they want, it seems fairly
straightforward. Unless you want to add complicating issues, as are inevitable
in life...

 (C) The city government deciding the issue is the nearest available
approximation to the dispute resolution mechanisms that would exist in a
libertarian society - for example, distributed ownership of "noise rights".

Running update:  So far, we have three votes for A, two votes for D, and two
votes for C (including Michael Bast), received in that chronological order. 
Most respondents gave detailed reasons for their opinions, which I will
post/summarize when all responses are in.  Please note, however, that you
don't need a detailed argument to respond!  I'd like to know what the
respected long-time Extropian regulars think, even if it's just a single
letter expressing an off-the-cuff reaction.

That's another thing that bothers me about this paper.  Is it really
showing that the social horizon is longer than the individual horizon?
It looks to me like the analysis in the paper applies just as well to
an individual as to a society.  The individual discounts the future, but
as well intentioned planners we may put a higher weight on future selves
than he does.  In that case we can say that making the individual adopt
a longer time horizon will make him happier on average over the course
of his lifetime.

I'm not clear on the above two options. My understanding of the libertarian
position (if I can be excused for discussing the vast, conflicting body of
libertarian opinion as one position for a moment) was not that there are no
conflicts of interest and therefore initiation of force is improper, but that
initiation of force is improper and especially so when interests conflict. So,
it would seem to me that the second half of option (D) (after the second 'and')
is a bit weird; if one agrees with the first half of the option's description of
the problem, then "libertarian ethics" help to simplify the issue, not
complicate it.

As it so happens, this last is my position. I agree with the first half of (D)
(before the second 'and') and the entirety of (A) (with the possible exception
of the last five words, which I could quite happily live without). And I think I
would also hold this position from the perspective of the bar owner, the condo
owner, and a third-party; the issue of precedence  and legitimacy is of the
utmost importance and regardless of the benefit the condo owner may gain from
the closing of the bar, empowering and/or encouraging a government like this is
dangerous.

Wow.  You step away from the list for a few weeks, and a discussion
like this one pops out.

It is, IMO, ridiculous to explain the existence of an interest rate by
virtue of the fact that I'd rather have pleasure today than tomorrow.
(I'll ignore the case where preferences are satisfied without my
knowing it and lump preference satisfaction together with "pleasure.")
The standard argument claims that, since I prefer pleasure more today
than tomorrow, and since I'm rational, I'd refuse to trade away
today's pleasure for tomorrow's pleasure, unless tomorrow's pleasure
was sufficiently greater than today's pleasure.

This argument is wrong, because, if rational, it seems I'd also rather
have pleasure yesterday than today, which is false.  I WOULD rather
have $1M 20 years ago than $1M today, yet it's not at all obvious that
I'd like to eat an ice cream cone yesterday more than I'd like to eat
that cone today.

(So far, we notice, there's no reason for a beneficient utilitarian
government to step in and make me eat my cone tomorrow instead of
eating it today, assuming that the government is trying to maximize
the sum of my pleasure states over time.  If I eat the cone at time X
rather than at time Y, at time Y I'll wish I had a cone, and at time X
I'll be happy to have one.  It doesn't matter whether time X comes
before or after time Y; I'd be just as happy, overall, either way.)

There's a better explantion for why we have interest rates: money
which is used today to buy microeconomic capital like machinery,
advanced technology, training, etc. will make more money tomorrow.

This has nothing to do with human desires and everything to do with
the raw material payoffs of investment.  Pleasure sensations, (and
events which satisfy preferences,) which happen when I take a bite out
of a chocolate-covered double-mint sugar cone, can't be invested today
to get more pleasure sensations tomorrow, while the money I spent on
that cone can be saved and spent on infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------

There is SOMETHING to the argument from future/past discounting, which
I take to be a real psychological fact.  This psychological fact
actually provides us with the moral reasons why we should NOT allow
the government to step in and prioritize the future for us.

The argument for government stepping in and making us more
future-minded goes as follows.  Pleasure we have today is good, but
tomorrow we'll tend to feel bad that we're not having pleasure THEN.
If we tend to discount tomorrow, however, we won't count tomorrow's
regret as much as we count today's pleasure, and may find ourselves
taking pleasures today which we regret, too much, tomorrow.

Of course, if we prioritize the past more than we prioritize the
present, we'll still make rational decisions.  Suppose it's time T1
and I decide that pleasure today is worth more than my future regret
at T2.  Our future (discounted) regret is outweighed by today's
pleasure.  Now suppose T2 has rolled around.  If we prioritize the
past over the present, our regret will STILL be outweighed by our
(prioritized) past.  I'd always think: "Yes, the headache hurts today,
but I had so much fun last night that it's worth it."  More to the
point, I'd never catch myself overall regretful if I was fully
informed about the outcome of my actions.  As the paper points out,
I'd never say to myself: "Thank heavens that bad lecture is over,"
since bad lectures would actually be WORSE the further they were in
our past.

All of this argument was to show that we DON'T prioritize the past
over the present, but rather we prioritize the present over the past
(as well as the future); this explains why we do stupid things today,
which we regret, more than we enjoyed them, tomorrow.

The government should step in, it is argued, to MAKE us prioritize the
future over the present, to MAKE us save our money to spend later,
because we spend our money irrationally in the present.

But this argument needn't stop there.  Money invested today yields
more money tomorrow.  So why not invest it ALL?  Why not invest every
cent you own on technology, training, building factories, etc. and
never again buy anything for the purposes of pleasure?  After all, the
cheap thrills you'd experience today would be 10% less (or whatever)
than the pleasure you'd reap if you'd invested your money.

And, of course, the pleasure you'd get next year is 10% less than the
pleasure you'd get from saving THAT for the year after, and so on.
You'd invest it all, and always invest all of the outcome of your
investment, again and again, forever.

A person who lived like that would be a super-miser.  A super-miser
would never actually be happy, since he'd consistently postpone his
happiness for later.  Compare this to a situation in which someone is
living a progressively happier life, spending some of his earnings and
saving the rest, developing investments slower than a super-miser, but
living a substantially happier life.

This, I argue, is the way that life ought to be led; this is the
reason why it is rational to prioritize the present over the future,
even if we prioritize the present over the past.

Another argument for prioritizing the future, the argument from
"brevity/uncertainty" of life, provides some reason not to be a
super-miser, but nowhere near ENOUGH reason.  According to this
argument, risk prevents us from being super-miserly.  Investment, as
we all know, is at least somewhat risky.  Some investments don't pan
out.  Some investments do pan out, but for various reasons
(e.g. death) you don't get to reap the benefits of your investment
personally.  (Death is not the ONLY such reason; it's merely the most
obvious.)

Still, if this were your ONLY reason for not investing all your money,
you wouldn't spend a penny of it until the very last reasonable
instant, then blow it all.  You'd live out most of your life under the
worst possibly tolerable conditions, and then, finally, you'd go out
with a bang.  If you were immortal or if your risks were negligibly
low, you'd still be a super-miser.

Worse, if you're a beneficent preference-satisfying government, (an
organization with no obvious lifespan,) you'd never take special risk
to INDIVIDUALS into account, only the expected payoff for the group.
So the fact that I might die (or for some other reason never see the
payoff from my investment) is irrelevant: the payoff from *my*
investments could go to the future pleasure of your children or other
people's children.  And their money could go to the future pleasure of
their children.  And so on, and so on, with no individual generation
or time EVER receiving a payoff from investment, since it would ALL be
reinvested.

Another related argument which might be raised is that money has
diminishing marginal utility.  Having one more dollar is great when
you've only got $2, but it's just a drop in the bucket when you've got
$2 billion.

This argument, as trained economists know, is actually just the
argument from risk aversion again, because having a diminishing
marginal utility is exactly the same as being risk averse; they're
perfectly logically equivalent.  If I get ten utils of pleasure from
having $1M (relative to being penniless) but I only get two more utils
from having $2M over $1M, then, if I've got $1M, I'll refuse to make a
50:50 bet of $1M.  I'll have a 50% chance of getting 2 utils, and 50%
chance of losing ten.  On average, that's a loss of 8 utils; a bad
bet.

So since having a diminishing marginal utility is just the same thing
as being risk averse, arguments from diminishing marginal utility are
just arguments from risk with different phrasing, and the same
argument I applied to the argument from uncertainty applies here,
though diminishing marginal utility does suggest to us that it may be
harder than we think to invest with negligibly low risk, since risks
seem bigger the more we have to invest.

Interest rates come from material payoffs, not from human desires.
Because of this, if we don't prioritize the present over the past,
then a benificient government must prefer us to be super-misers,
individuals who invest everything forever, never ever spending on
pleasure, even when we take risks and diminishing marginal utility
into account.  This is an unacceptable utilitarian outcome, and this
is the reason why we should be allowed to (apparently irrationally)
*spend* some of our money rather than investing all of it.

Undefined.

If this were a libertarian anarcho-capitalist society, then noise
rights would be settled ahead of time in some formal way.

Perhaps they have, and the bar approves of a government like this.
Suppose, the rule of law is that you control your noise rights, unless
someone throws together a petition to stop you, in which case, you
lose them.  In this case, clearly, the bar does not entirely own its
noise rights.  If we assume that the bar approves of a government like
this, or if the government in question is a Nozickian "government"
consisting only of the set of PPAs and arbitratian agencies operating
in the area, (in which case, the bar has revealed preference for the
"government,") then the answer is C.  The bar, if it so wishes, may
buy its noise rights from the citizenry at some fair price.  If it
refuses to pay this, then it's not best for the bar to operate here
anyway, since it's not willing to pay its own costs.

If the rule of law is that the bar owns its own noise rights, and the
citizens approve of or reveal approval of the government, then, if the
petition has no effect, no force, no foul.  In that case, the answer
is C again, but in this case, the government refuses to do anything
about the petition.

If the bar does NOT exhibit revealed approval of the government in
question, and if noise is not force, or if noise rights are up in the
air, then this could be a case of A.

You've gotten no agreements to B so far because you phrased it wrongly
as far as libertarians are concerned.  The better way to phrase B
would be:

(B') "The citizens who signed the petition are not initiating force;
the bar initiated force by initiating noise and other negative
effects, and the citizens are forcefully retaliating."  If noise is
force, and the citizens have not approved of or given revealed
preference for the government, then the answer is B'.

So:

Disapproval = non-agreement and not revealing preferences in a
Nozickian "government".
Noise = noise and all the other negative effects of a bar.

Bar disapproves of government and noise is not force: A
Citizens disapprove of government and noise is force: B'
Otherwise: C.

Just to clarify we are talking about a NEW bar trying to open up next to
an existing condo. The new bar's property has never been used as a bar
previously. Does your answer still hold from all perspectives?

Mike, I am certainly no fan of the FDA, but I think I have to side with them
on this one.  The food in question is engineered to produce its own
pesticide.  This new corn is not chemically equivalent to natural corn, but
is chemically equivalent to natural corn plus pesticide.  The pesticide has
not been tested for human safety.  As with any new pesticide or food
additive, companies are not allowed to put this in human food until it has
been tested for human consumption.

I think this is a perfectly good recall.

1. The company in question accidentally put animal-grade food into human
food.  I wouldn't want to eat this any more than I would eat dog food.

2. The company accidentally put an experimental food additive into human
food before the testing was complete.  I wouldn't want to eat this any more
than I would eat any experimental foods before the experiments were
finished.

3. The company failed to follow existing health laws while mixing this food.
I wouldn't want to eat this any more than I would want to eat at a
restaurant that failed its health inspection.

Sure, it probably is safe, but why take chances?  I eat only human-grade
food, not experimental food, and not from companies that break health laws.
I will experiment with my own life-extension supplements, but only after I
read the scientific evidence myself and make my own choices.  I don't want
another company making that decision for me.

"C" is the clear choice.

This is in fact common practice, Park Ridge Il, also known locally
as "Pleasantville" ( Where Hillary Clinton is from) is a "dry"
community, only restaurants may serve alcohol.

Some local entrepreneurs open a "Hooters" just accross the street
from the boundary and the town tried to denie them a liquor
license.

The Hooters held out and the matter was finaly decided by a judge.

Hooters won.

I don't see the government action in the petition, per se.  The petition 
itself is just a form of speech, and an orderly one at that . . .  As for the 
PETITION scaring off investors, if a real estate developer's backers learn 
the community doesn't support the development, then that seems like valuable 
information to the investors.

To the extent the petition is seen as a petition for the GOVERNMENT to ACT, 
it can be seen as a minor initiation of force, or simply initiation of legal 
process within the legal structure available.  I'd have to know more about 
the due process available to the bar owner, the extent to which the gvt 
action is governed by explicit law, etc.

I think Brian is right that this is the best choice, again depending on the 
factors discussed in connection w/the previous point.

I don't understand this -- it just doesn't parse for me.  All disputes in 
society involve a "conflict of interest" and that's what all of the various 
mechanisms of social control, libertarian or otherwise, are about.  
"Libertarian ethics" are very much implicated in this dispute, if I 
understand your meaning.  And then the question becomes one of doing the best 
job one has of implementing one's ethics with the social structure available. 
 Thus, petitioning the government (especially as constrained by explicit, 
fair law) is far more "libertarian" than, say, firebombing the property to 
express the "conflict of interest".

this is mail i sent the list administrator after receiving (after weeks of
waiting) the IMO absurd and utterly *un*-extropian response which i've
copied below.

i searched the archives for relevant discussion on 'abuse' of the list,
and 'approval procedure' thinking there was some profound reasoning i
haven't been a party to.  but i turned up nothing.  so, i'm forwarding
this on to you all to see what sort of feedback you might give.

in any case, i've gone back to digest-mode (i wanted to switch to
regular mails since i hated scrolling and have installed procmail).....

Although this is a complication (especially if there was a change in zoning that
made the bar unexpected to the condo owner), I still think the answer holds from
all perspectives. Regardless of the particular cost-benefit analysis for this
action (petitioning to close the bar), the full cost includes granting
legitimacy to the government and allowing the precedent that reacting to a
petition of this sort is an action within its purview. Now, as a radical
libertarian, I don't think this is a legitimate action, so I'd like people not
to encourage the government thinking it is legitimate.

Do I think that someone other than me who owned the condo would think this way?
No, probably not. I don't think my view of the government or my view of strategy
in dealing with the government is terribly widespread. I think the likely action
by the condo owner is to petition. But if I were the condo owner, I'd seek a
non-governmental solution or suck it up and live with the noise.

As we don't live in a fully police state, the operations of government are
dependent on social support; they need the sanction of the people to law claim
to legitimacy. And I don't mean that in a philosophical social contract sort of
way; I mean in a riot in the street, bloody revolution sort of way. If one is
against government (which one should be as government rather the dangerous
institution), then you should minimize your sanction of it and go around it as
often as practical/possible. The will of the people is not primarily expressed
in voting, but in everyday uses of government and taking the legitimacy of
government for granted. It is this legitimacy that must be challenged.

This was the same basic argument the authors were making, except that
they did not feel that this made you irrational.  It does mean that you
regret your past decisions, but that is not necessarily irrational.

Maybe you could have half the cone today and half tomorrow?  "Half your
cake and eat it too," so to speak (sorry).

Hi Olivia.

Thanks for your response.  We're currently in the process of re-organizing
some of the operations and administration of Extropy Institute, and as
such, there are a few transitional issues which may arise.  List approvals
are currently requiring some basic contact information: phone number, fixed
residence, and e-mail address.  This is due to some abuses of the list in
the past few months (e.g.: personal attacks).  Otherwise, the lists are all
free and unmoderated, with the contact info being used for security
purposes only.

>of new members.

As I iterated on the extropians list a few weeks ago, Extropy Institute is
currently doing just that.  ExI members will be receiving their monthly
updates in the next week, including more information on the upcoming ExI
member retreat.  Beyond that, there are a lot of projects Extropy Institute
has on the go to complement the Extropian community.

For any information on membership details or anything else of the sort,
please contact either exi-info@extropy.org or e_shaun@extropy.org.

						Best,

Look, Sean, I was about to renew but if you are going to require this kind
of thing, as an organization, I will reconsider. I don't abuse anyone.

Do any of the Extropians on this list use Smart Drugs? 

Does anyone have a recommended source for Piracetam? Particularly one with
quick shipping?

I haven't used it in years, but I liked Piracetam (but only noticed effects 
at high doses). I believe I used to get it from InHome Health and one other 
company. Sorrry for the vagueness, but I think InHome is based in 
Amsterdam, though I remember ordering from a company based in England. 
Shipping wasn't terribly quick as I recall.

Have you tried the web site for CERI? (Cognitive Enhancement Research 
Institute.)

We haven't had a discussion on smart drugs in a while. Has anyone come 
across anything that really works and is not well known?

Sunah -- if you're a renewing member (and we know you), you don't have to 
worry about this. This is a stop-gap measure to filter out newcomers who 
are coming onto the List with the intent of causing trouble. Once we have 
new filtering tools (currently being worked on), we won't have to do this. 
In the meantime, please be understanding. Once you've been horribly 
slandered by someone who has never been on the List before, you might be 
more sympathetic to this temporary measure.

Please note that this requirement is for *non-members*, so it doesn't even 
affect you. We're optimistically assuming that people who want to abuse us 
will not first want to pay to become members. :-)  Checking E. Shaun's 
message, I see that this point may not have come across clearly. Perhaps 
you received that message since your membership had expired, but it was 
intended for non-members. As a recent member and known person of character, 
the requirement does not apply to you.

Finally, please note that this is not E. Shaun's policy. It's my decision, 
made in consultation with ExI directors and Advisors to stop recent abuses 
until our new system is in place.

Agreed.  The existing stake holders in any area or resource should have
the right to some say regarding things they think will influence the
value of their stake.   However you produce that effect consistent with
the rights of the newcomer, this needs to be recognized and dealt with.

Somehow I don't think the claim was that anyone here abuses anyone.  But
public email lists sometimes attract spammers and people out to mark up
whatever they can meaninglessly.  I can see that the conversation should
be protected from that sort of abuse.  Haven't really seen such here
though.  So either it is not a problem or current safeguards are quite
effective.

I think it's going to kill the mailing list.  I think the primary utility of
this mailing list is as a de facto major rendezvous point for futurists - I
know that's the first reason I'm still here.  Put up barriers to entry, and
you kill the list.

The list does not need barriers to new members.  It needs moderators who are
less reluctant to exercise the power that they have.  Either that, or it needs
advanced filtering software that doesn't exist yet.  And, oh yeah, the first
five messages from new posters should be vetted before hitting the lists - but
vet messages, instead of asking posters for physical addresses.

Piracetam is not FDA approved, www.lef.org for more information,
(800)544-4440 for a list of off-shore pharmacies that ship.

In response to the topic:

The analogy I often used when discussing these types of issues
is this:  Why would I want someone coming to my home and piss
all over my carpet, gossip about my friends, steal from my studio,
or poison my food?  Why should I, or anyone, want to reside in
a community where there is little, if any, protection for a persons
well being other than his/her solid reputations, forthright communications
or pleasant dispositions.  These lovely qualities are beneficial
to our individual well being, but cannot hold at bay the reckless
offenses of others.

Why should anyone on a private list that is provided as a public
viewing and communication center be subject to defamatory statements?
 Why should such a recipient of abusiveness have no way of tracking
the spoiler?  We leave ourselves wide open  exposed to anyone
at anytime coming onto this list and attacking anyone for any
reason.

So, the answer here is list rules, which we already have.  However,
someone can (and does) slip on for an hour  a day  a week -
and produces noxious blather and than run away like a coward,
hiding behind a fictitious name and false identity.

How would you or anyone feel (or think) if someone who claims
to be substantial said that he or she knew you or anyone abuses
a child, embezzled $10,000 from an employer, or lied about credentials?
 

I know that that the above seems ridiculously irregular, but
what if someone else on the list, perhaps someone who you or
anyone respected highly but had not met yet, read this defamation
of your or someone elses character.  

Surely, I understand that this can and does happen in any environment
and our reputations should and do speak for themselves.  However,
the reality is that people are emotional beings and respond to
the poison in the well often times more often than a calm headed
reply of "No that is not true."  No matter how many people might
stand up and defend you, there is still that inkling of doubt
planted by the seed of the spoiler - be she or he a greenpeace
activist, a religious zealot, a anti-transhumanist, or even just
a person who simply doesn't like someone else and tries to publicly
damage him or her.

With all this said, and please forgive my verbosity, there needs
to be some sort of way that those who administer the ExI list
can safeguard those who productively participate on the list
without ulterior motivations.

I wish this sort of subhuman behavior did not exist in our culture,
but it does and I would rather work with it and understand it,
contemplate how to deal withit than let other people suffer the
consequences of any hurt or pain that accompanies such unnecessary
abusive behavior.

I have a couple of friends I'm trying to explain nootropics to, and I've been
finding all my old links are broken.  Would anyone out there be willing to 
share their links to information (on the efficacy, general theory, and 
purchase options) that would be relevant?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

I agree with E. Yudkowsky. I will not holler until I am hurt, but it appears 
that this movement "seems" to be becoming exclusionary in nature. Its a 
relatively free country, for the moment; and Mr. More needs to do what he 
feels is best. I am too much the pragmatist, myself; I have to ask the 
question of what does produce pleasing results? Hence my dislike of the 
romance of Ayn Rand, the lionizing of Capitalists, and the lack of some 
skepticism on when nano technology will flourish (never if!). Do whatever.

Slander is bad.  And ExI, more than anything else, needs to
maintain a good reputation.

But moderating the list and asking for contact info before allowing
people to post will do more damage to ExI's reputation than some
screwball who comes online and lies about Max More's sexual practices.

It makes us look like hypocrites.  It makes us look like fools.  It
makes us look like we have stuff to hide.

Moves like this are not in keeping with the spirit of Spontaneous
Order, or even with Open Society/Self-Direction.

Of course the list is your private property, which you allow others to
use.  You have every RIGHT to damage your reputation.  But, IMO,
extropy is more important than that.

One of the most interesting mailing lists I've subscribed to was Howard
Rheingold's "Brainstorms" which requires participants to use their real
names and to provide a snail mail address and phone number.  The use of
real names tended to keep discussions from deteriorating to the level of
personal insults.  Naturally, one would not want the address and phone
number to be made public information, but I don't see any problem with
providing it to the list administrator.  If a person had some reason for
not wishing to reveal this information, he or she could no doubt ask the
list administrator to make an exception.

Given that toxins tend to concentrate in urine, milk, and fat I wouldn't
want to drink milk or eat meat from animals that had been fed this corn,
nor would I want to use manure from these animals on my garden.

I've had the experience of using manure from horses who'd been fed hay
cut from pastures sprayed with 2,4-D. The herbicide residue in the manure
killed all my broad leaf plants. Even the county ag extension agent here,
who was educated at a university which advocated the liberal use of
pesticides in agriculture now questions whether it is, afterall, a good
thing.

 I doubt that it's any worse to eat Starlink corn itself than it would be
to eat animals who'd been fed on it.

Eli asks:

>Suppose Person A wants to open up a bar, and applies for a liquor
license. Persons B, consisting of the resident/owners of a nearby
condominium complex, are annoyed by this for the standard reasons
- increased noise, increased traffic, violent drunks wandering
around, and decreased property values. Suppose that Persons B
sign a petition to deny a liquor license to Person A, thus annoying
Person A and any investors thereof. Do you agree or disagree
with the following statements?<

A & B: no.

 
>(C) The city government deciding the issue is the nearest 
>available approximation to the dispute resolution mechanisms
that would exist in a libertarian society - for example, distributed
ownership of "noise rights". 

Ill answer Elis query as a deep-foggy rather than an old-timer,
(while remembering that it is size that matters, not age.)

If I understand the setup correctly, the folks who live in condos
are complaining that the bar will be too noisy and the issue
is how to they resolve the impending conflict. 

As a former homeowner, I remember attending town meetings and
listening the wranglings night after night.  I purchased a home
in a commercial zone which was primarily residential, all resident
knew before purchasing their homes that this location would,
at some point, be developed.  I was there to turn my home into
be a business that would have live music.  The fact that people
lived in homes next to me was secondary to the fact that we were
commercially zoned.

The bottom line is this: If you purchase a piece of property
in close proximity to a business district, the community will
end up dealing with how much revenue will come from the business
and how much the town needs the business and who does or will
work for the business.  If the personality profile of the town
is rowdy, rowdy will win.  It is a conservative or spiritual
community, then not too many folks will end up stooped at the
bar.

The folks that purchase homes or condos near commercially zoned
areas have to deal with the consequence development and growth.
Zoning laws may have community buffer zones which give residence
a sort of padding between their homes and bustling businesses.
 There are also zoning variances and ordinances.

If a person purchases a condominium or home which is near the
buffer zone or right smack up next to a commercial zone, then
this is part of the possible situations that can occur.  If the
person does not want to be near a bar, then she or he needs to
purchase a homestead near a national forest which cannot be developed.
 A commercially zoned location is zoned to the businesses that
the community desires regardless of who lives next door.

Regarding noise, I believe in the 1970s Congress passed a Noise
Control Act as a sort of template for local and state bodies
to use when designing their own regulations.  However, even my
townhouse manager where we live doesnt stop the noise pollution
coming from the people across the way.

It seems that the resolution could be obtained through voluntary
cooperation.  In that the idea is for the individuals involved
to have the power to decide, rather than a governing body, it
still boils down to a set of values or guidelines that folks
will have to follow.  So, if the community wants more business,
business will win.  If the community wants more spas and meditation,
there will be a juice bar instead of martinis.

Hitch up the bacteria, Pa, we're steppin' out...

http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT8/Abstracts/Sequeira/index.html

   The design revolves around bacteria (such as E.coli and S. typhimurium)
   which will be attached to cover slips in turn which are attached to
   a disc free to rotate about an output shaft. The bacteria by nature
   of their motile behaviour will swim and push or pull the disc. With
   forces acting tangential to the disc and bacteria oriented radially
   on the disc, the disc will rotate and this mechanical power generated
   by the microorganisms will act as the energy input source to a micro
   or nanosystem.

This and other fun papers can be found in the web page for the Eighth
Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology, presently in progress,
at http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT8/Abstracts/index.html.

The keynote speech was by Ray Kurzweil, covered by Wired Online at
http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,39967,00.html in a typically
breathless, gee-whiz fashion.

I don't follow nanotech work all that closely, but my impression,
looking at the titles and some abstracts, is that the field isn't
moving very quickly.  It seems to be more science than engineering,
where the point is to make a tiny, incremental advancement over the
current state of the art.  Maybe this is just because any time there
are so many papers being presented, the majority can't be very good,
and I don't have the skills to pick out the promising 10%.

This won't help out with the situation they want to avoid. By the time they
realize what's going on and kick off the bad guy, he's already posted who

Won't work- think like a black hat: they send 5 innocuous posts that make it
past the moderator, then when they get unmoderated they flame away.

Any other suggestions?

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE NOVEMBER 3 2000


IN THIS ISSUE NOVEMBER 3 2000, LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Heart
disease marker discovered; WHAT'S HOT: Lipoprotein-associated
phospholipase A2 strong predictor of heart disease; PROTOCOL: Fibrinogen
and cardiovascular disease; FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK:  Mega-EPA,

Heart disease marker discovered

It is widely believed that cardiovascular disease is caused by
controllable lifestyle factors:  high fat, high cholesterol diets, lack of
methylation enhancing nutrients, obesity, smoking and a sedentary
lifestyle.  High cholesterol and a family history of heart disease are
considered strong risk factors. However, in 48% of all men and 63% of all
women, their first heart attacks come as a surprise, occurring in
nonsmoking, nonobese men and women who do not have these risk factors.
Interleukin Genetics, Inc, has discovered variations in the IL-1 gene
which increase heart disease risk by two to four times in individuals
sixty years of age or younger.  The genetic variations cause increased
arterial inflammation, an important factor in the development of the
disease.

Interleukin Genetics conducted a study in which 500 Mayo Clinic patients
were evaluated for traditional coronary artery disease risk factors such
as gender, smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, family history, age
and diabetes, as well as variants in the IL-1 gene.  Those with the
variant who were under sixty had a 3.9 higher risk of coronary artery
disease than those without it.  Another study, the National Institutes of
Health study of Atherosclerosis Risk in the Community, monitored 1900
individuals between the ages of 45 and 64 for nine years and found that
those possessing the genetic variant were 2 to 3.3 times as likely to have
thickening of the arterial walls, considered indicative of
atherosclerosis.

Interleukin Genetics' Chief Executive Officer Philip R Reilly, MD, JD,
enthused, "This discovery leads us to an early and very exciting practical
application of the Human Genome Project.  The investigation of IL-1
underscores how genetics research is redefining the way we look at heart
disease, and can stimulate the development of therapies that target
markers such as this one . . . The commercial availability of a test to
determine whether a patient possesses the IL-1 genetic risk factors could
be available within a year."

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE Addendum

Last week's Life Extension Update Exclusive reported on melatonin's
sexually stimulatory effect when administered in acute doses to rats.  A
few readers were concerned that the chronic dosing mentioned as inhibiting
sexual activity in rats would have the same effect on humans.  However,
the study's authors emphasized that the chronic dosing used in the
experiments was in large doses, and that a sexual stimulatory effect has
been reported in humans using small doses of melatonin once per night for
sleep.

WHAT'S HOT

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 strong predictor of heart disease

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 is an enzyme that accompanies low
density lipoprotein (LDL), or "bad" cholesterol in the blood, and may be
involved in modifying LDL. Also known as platelet-activating factor
acetylhydrolase, the expression of this enzyme is regulated by mediators
of inflammation. While other inflammatory markers are known to be
predictive of coronary events, this ability is modified by other risk
factors.

A study reported in the October 19 issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine utilized stored biological samples from The West of Scotland
Coronary Prevention Study, a trial that evaluated the drug Pravastatin's
preventive ability against coronary events in 6,595 men. Researchers
analyzed the study's baseline samples for lipoprotein-associated
phospholipase A2, as well as other markers of inflammation, such as
C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and white cell count in 580 subjects who
went on to develop a coronary event (defined in this study as a myocardial
infarction, bypass surgery or angioplasty) and matched each of these for
smoking status and age with controls who did not later experience a
coronary event.

The study found that inflammatory markers were predictors of coronary
events but their predictive ability was weakened when other risk factors,
such as body mass index, HDL levels, triglycerides and systolic blood
pressure were taken into consideration. Lipoprotein-associated
phospholipase A2, however was strongly associated with the risk of a
coronary event, a risk that is statistically independent of other factors.
The group that had the highest levels of the enzyme also had double the
risk of a coronary event than those who had the lowest levels.

The researchers proposed that lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 is
placed to release products of LDL oxidation into the artery wall. Because
inhibition of the enzyme has been demonstrated to have desirable effects
in vitro, they predict that the enzyme will become a new therapeutic
target.

PROTOCOL
Fibrinogen and cardiovascular disease

Most heart attacks and strokes are caused by a blood clot that obstructs
the flow of blood to a portion of the heart or the brain. Blood clots that
form inside arteries are the leading causes of death in the Western world.
Blood clots kill almost 700,000 Americans every year.  High levels of the
blood-clotting agent fibrinogen predispose a person to coronary and
cerebral artery disease, even when other known risk factors such as
cholesterol are low. The role of fibrinogen in the development of
cardiovascular disease has been confirmed in several well controlled
studies.

In 1996, Life Extension was the first research group to recognize the
importance of fibrinogen as an independent risk indicator for
cardiovascular disease. A new study in the Journal of the American College
of Cardiology (1999, 33:1347-52) validates the LEF position on fibrinogen
as an independent indicator and cause of heart attack, stroke, and
cardiovascular disease risk. This published report examined data on nearly
400 male physicians participating in the Physicians' Health Study. Blood
fibrinogen levels of 199 subjects who experienced heart attacks during the
study period were compared with those of 199 control subjects who did not
suffer heart attacks. The investigators report that patients with heart
attacks had significantly higher fibrinogen levels compared with healthy
controls. In fact, subjects with especially high fibrinogen levels had a
risk of heart attack twice that of men with lower levels of fibrinogen.
These findings remained unchanged regardless of the presence or absence of
other coronary risk factors, including high cholesterol.

The following supplements offer synergistic benefits to assist in the
reduction of fibrinogen levels (over 300 mg/dL) and the risk of
cardiovascular disease:

Aspirin, 81 mg every day, with the heaviest meal of the day.
Vitamin B6, 250 to 500 mg daily.
Vitamin C, 3000 to 5000 mg daily.
Vitamin E, 400 to 800 IU daily.
Folic acid, 800 mcg with every meal. Use a folic acid supplement that also
contains at least 1000 mcg of vitamin B12. Folic acid works
synergistically with vitamin B12 to lower homocysteine levels.
Ginkgo biloba, 120 mg daily.
Green tea, 350 mg a day of green tea, 95% polyphenol extract.
Herbal Cardiovascular Formula (contains bromelain), two capsules, 2 times
a day.
Mega EPA, 6 to 9 grams a day (six to eight Mega EPA capsules).
Niacin, 1500 to 3000 mg a day (if tolerable). Consider flush-free niacin
(inositol hexanicotinate) to avoid a "red face."

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
Mega-EPA Capsules

Mega EPA Capsules are a convenient way to take EPA and DHA in a
concentrated form. EPA and DHA can be helpful against arthritis, reduce
abnormal blood clotting inside blood vessels, reduce triglyceride levels,
and reduce many forms of chronic inflammation. The fatty free acid form of
omega-3 rich fish oils in this product represents a technological
breakthrough in marine lipid research providing for maximum efficient
absorption of EPA and DHA. Each capsule contains EPA (eicosapentaenoic
acid) 400 mg, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) 300 mg, vitamin E (natural, mixed
tocopherols) 2 IU, Vitamin C 2 mg.

Super Ginkgo Extract

European physicians are prescribing ginkgo biloba to slow down and reverse
aging of the brain. A number of well designed studies published in medical
journals have shown that ginkgo can improve mental function in people of
all ages. Some European physicians have stated that ginkgo is more
effective than high doses of Hydergine in treating senile dementia.

Studies have consistently shown ginkgo to be beneficial in treating a
variety of conditions. Ginkgo has a positive effect on circulation, both
cerebral and peripheral, including an ability to reduce abnormalities of
muscle tone, of blood vessels, capillary permeability, abnormal
aggregation of blood platelets, arterial damage caused by atherosclerosis
and tissue damage caused by low blood flow.

I have a couple of friends I'm trying to explain nootropics to, and I've
been
finding all my old links are broken.  Would anyone out there be willing to
share their links to information (on the efficacy, general theory, and
purchase options) that would be relevant?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

A little while ago, in Colorado, the police raided a meth lab. They do not 
know who was the one making the meth, but they found an invoice from a 
bookstore for a book on how to make meth. They went to the bookstore with 
warrants and demanded to see their list of customers (See 
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001102/ts/rights_bookstore_dc_4.html). 
Something similar happened during the Clinton blow-job scandal, when a 
bookstore was ordered to turn over records of Monica Lewinsky's purchases to 
see if she'd purchased books on phone sex (I do not remember how this turned 
out). Both the KKK and NAACP have in the past been ordered to turn over 
membership lists.
I personally would not mind giving my name and phone number and all that. I 
post everything here with my real name, I'm tracable and I'm fine with that,

you make a promise to anyone giving you this information that all 
information will be stored on only one computer, that it will be multiply 
encrypted with the most secure technology available, and that if at any 
point in time you are ordered by some legal body to turn over any portion of 
the information, you will immediately destroy such information, and run a 
"digital shredder" program on the hard drive it was stored on to make sure 
it is unrecoverable, and that you will do this before even appealing the 
legal decision.

Perhaps ExI should seek free hosting offshore at Havenco? With properly

Darn, now why didn't I think of that?
I guess I'd better withdraw the suggestion, then.

How about realizing that it's OK if a screw-ball says screwy things every 
once and a while.  Does anybody here believe that Max is a sexual deviant 
just become some troll says so?  Of course not.  Either you want a free 
society or you don't.  Don't spew libertarian rhetoric and then turn around 
and act like a censor.  "Some animals are more equal than others"?  If you 
don't like what people post either (a) rebut it; (b) ignore it; or (c) 
killfile them.

So, in short, let me know when you start limiting access to the list so I 
can promptly unsubscribe.

Um, before you make that promise, you should realize that it would 
potentially expose you to prosecution for tampering with evidence and 
obstruction of justice.  Personally, rather than a promise that you would go 
to jail before revealing my information, I'd prefer that you just not compel 
me to give it to you.

At $10,00 a pound, subsidized, I don't think "cheap" covers it, either.

I would use a Zappa expression: it's bogus pomp.

I'll keep this short, since Barbara Lamar made sensible points that I would 
echo, and Brian Atkins points out the flaws with Eliezer's suggestions.

As Brian reminded Eliezer, this is a temporary solution. Better filtering 
tools are under construction that we hope will solve or alleviate the 
problem. I'm open to any constructive alternative suggestions.

Two or three people seem to be wildly overreacting. All ExI members already 
have given us contact information. All we're asking of non-members is their 
true name and a verifiable telephone number (we're not even asking for an 
address now). Is that really so much to ask? We're not excluding anyone on 
the basis of their views, nor requiring that they join the organization 
that provides this forum.

Apparently this is *not* a lot to ask. According to Shaun, a substantial 
proportion of those on the waiting list, when told about the policy, 
followed through with it within one day. Doesn't seem to be "killing" the 
list, does it? Perhaps we can have less hyperbole.

As for Dan's comments, well I'm finding it hard to believe this is the same 
Dan Fabulich whose keenly analytical posts I'm use to. Setting some very 
simple ground rules is *crucial* to spontaneous order, not contrary to it. 
And self-direction does not mean letting anyone who feels like it take a 
dump on your carpet or walk around your home smashing your furniture and 
insulting your family and friends. As for making it look like we have 
something to hide--you've completely lost me here. *Anyone* can get on the 
list simply by letting us know their name and how to reach them 
(information which will be kept confidential). If they are unwilling to 
accord us this, then more likely *they* have something to hide.

Its funny that no one has apparently even noticed that other organizations 
comparable to ExI DO NOT EVEN PROVIDE A PUBLIC FORUM. Organizations like 
Foresight send email to their people, but don't provide an open forum like 
this. Why do you suppose that might be? Why are we being criticized so much 
for asking so little before allowing complete strangers into our much loved 
and long-inhabited on-line home?

To make one point clear: If someone wants to post pseudonymously to this 
list, they can still do that. One or two ExI officials will know who they 
are, but they can separate their posting name from their real name as far 
as everyone else is concerned.

That's all I want to say on this topic, unless someone has constructive 
suggestions. I'd rather spent my ExI time working on the Retreat that we're 
planning for early in 2001, and the other projects that a number of us are 
working on.

Onward!

Thank you, I'd rather spend 30 years in a 1/6 g environment half a
lightsecond above the earth in a lunar colony rather than come back at
all.

LEO is for communication satellites, not for canned monkeys.

I agree with "A".  The condo-owners don't own the rights to the formerly
quiet lot across the street that they were enjoying the benefit of, anymore
than a person on an airline "owns" the right to the empty seat next to them
which they didn't purchase a ticket for.

The legitimate way for the condo-owners to control their surrounding
environment is to purchase it; then they could leave it forever
undeveloped, or turn it into rental units with strict noise rules, or
whatever.

I havent participated in the discussion, but reading over it, I wondered
where are all the openness and transparency advocates?  I offer my
real name (Greg Jones) my address, my phone number, my office
number, anything.  Why hide?  The transparency age is coming, why
not welcome it and take advantage of it for the good, instead of trying
to fight it?  If we get better transparency, we will have fewer repeats of
the unfortunate Jamiro incident.  Even newspaper make you attach your
name to editorials.  Sign it, own it!

In light of the fact that we are ExI, instead of calling it a Retreat,
perhaps we should call it an Attack, or an Advance, or a
Charge or a Huddle or something.  CHARGE!  {8^D  spike

One and a third light seconds, but we get your point Gene.  Properly scaled,
we can do both simultaneously, and use a lot of shared technology.  Recall
that the ISS is actually a lot more a political stunt than a scientific venture,
and as such it will likely not go away anytime soon.  spike

To the people responding with choice A, do you disagree that noise/silence
in the surrounding air should not be considered to be some kind of publicly
shared infrastructure just like radio spectrum or the underlying water table?
Would you prefer it if everyone could blast away with their high powered
radio transmitters on any and all frequencies they wish? That just anyone
who wants to could dump toxic waste into the water table just next to your
farmland? Or should there be some kind of mechanism to handle disputes in
these physically shared things, either auctions or committees to arbitrate?

If these security procedures are indeed a temporary feature, how about
offering new subscribers the option of only receiving the list, but not
posting to the list?
This would enable newbies to see if the list really was of interest to them.
If not, they could unsubscribe without ever posting to the list.
After, say a month, newbies could be automatically moved to the 'trainee'
section of the list. For a further month, all postings received from
'trainee' members could be queued in a pending list where a moderator could
read their postings before forwarding them to the full list. Thereafter,
they would have full posting rights enabled.

As was pointed out, fully paid-up Extropy Institute members have already
supplied all their personal details when they signed up, so this discussion
does not apply to them. We are only talking about people whose new interest
we want to encourage, so care should be taken that they are not deliberately
discouraged.

Speaking for myself, the words of wisdom that I post are few indeed, but I
would really miss reading the ongoing saga of the adventures of Eliezer,
Mike, Brian, etc.

I think that noise is a publicly shared infrastructure, which can be purchased
just like radio frequencies, and I think that the current approximation to a
mechanism for purchasing noise rights is called "zoning".  There are
incredibly loud areas where factories and airports are located, mildly loud
urban areas, and sleepy suburbs.  If you choose the convenience of living in a
commercially zoned area with half a dozen bars already nearby, then you've
also chosen to live with the noise.  Even if someone is significantly
increasing the amount of nearby noise, and thereby actually decreasing
property values, the property owners have no "shared infrastructure" argument
unless the noise goes above the legal limits for commercially zoned property -
it was a risk that should have been factored into the initial buying decision.

In fact, let me amplify on that last part.  Buying property is not a risk-free
activity.  Bars open and bars close.  Famous theaters move away and famous
theaters move in.  Bus routes change and train stations open.  It's only
natural that property owners should wish to control events - help bars close,
stop bars from opening, complain when bus routes change (the more so as it's a
public, governmental function), even sign petitions to stop theaters from
moving away.  Maybe they'll open up a plague house next door that'll cut
property prices in half, and maybe the new megamall will open three doors away
and your prices will shoot up by a factor of ten.  The Libertarian credo is
that, even though it may be to the benefit of individuals to try and exert
control in specific cases, in the end everyone loses once the government gets
involved.  Looking over the interaction of people building and owning
buildings, what I see is a free economy that should be protected from
government interference, even if some people lose on individual transactions. 
That's why I have a strong a priori prejudice towards choice A in situations
like these - though the real answer depends on who owns the noise spectrum.

Dear list members,

yes, I'm a lurker. But the last thing I want to be is annoying.
Yes, I'm the one who once mirrored this list. And not only this list.
Everything sent to my server was resent. I took me a while to even
notice this, and another while to fix it.
The reply receipts that appeared a few days ago should have ceased by
now.

My sincerest apologies to everyone for the inconveniences this has
caused.

No, we are not. We are just helping the police, fire departments and

Bringing help to the injured faster and thus saving lives is my tiny

I've never done it myself but sometimes it might be interesting to
create one or more pseudo-selves to participate in various internet
spaces.  Total transparency would make that difficult.  Also it is
crucial in more repressive societies to be able to express oneself
anonymously.  While this society (developed countries)  increasingly has
the means to force full transparency it does not show encouraging
corresponding signs of being less repressive.

This is a bit strange considering that you are already consume animal
based products from animals fed foods quite saturated with pesticides. 
The point of modifying a plant genetically to produce its own pesticide
is that it produces just enough (and if possible of a happier chemical)
for its needs.  This results in much lower concentration of pesticides
than non-genetic means like spraying crops.  The latter is a shotgun
approach and likely to result in much higher health risks and accidental
contamination of nearby lifeforms.

Exactly.  Old style pesticide use is much more dangerous.  However, some
kind of pesticides must be used to have effective crop yields.  So you
do what is most controllable.

Actually it should be much better to eat animals fed this corn and the
corn itself than corn that had been massively sprayed the old-fashioned
way.  The pesticide is in the plant but not necessarily as concentrated
in the actual corn.  But I would need to see studies on that idea.

So assuming the condos are in a "mixed use" zoned area that is supposedly
designed to allow (gasp!) a mix of residential and commercial developments,
what is the process then?

Your reference to an ecomony that should be protected is interesting.. in
fact that is what I am arguing. The government or *something* must involve
itself in certain economic situations like this if that particular market
is going to "flourish". Now you can argue hypothetically as an anarcho-
capitalist or whatever that you think government is bad, but you are still
going to have to come up with some kind of solution otherwise you will have
all houses on one side of the railroad tracks and all commercial development
on the other. And finally you have to consider the negative objective
consequences that your "lack of participation" will have. If you don't sign
the petition to try and fight for your chunk of the noise spectrum using
the only available current means then let's say the bar gets built, your
property value goes down, you lose sleep every night or get interrupted
during your deep thinking, and in the end the Singularity ends up being
delayed by a month. Was your idealistic choice of action worth it?

I think you can make an economic case that privacy should be paid for, or
at least cost something. i.e. you can pay for a an ISP, or you can use a
free ISP that requires you to give up more of your privacy. There are many
other examples. I am talking about this in respect to voluntary actions-
there probably should be some minimum of privacy guaranteed as perhaps a
"human right", but in terms of voluntary decisions you make such as signing
up with an ISP or this mailing list, it makes sense to charge money for
complete privacy. So perhaps ExI could consider making one of the benefits
of paid membership the possibility that they would completely remove all info
on you (besides, say your email address which could be a nym) if you request
it.

Not necessarily.  Any changes may simply split off a different
timeline.  The paradoxes are only present if a single timeline is
assumed that is changed by the time traveller.

As long as there are massive concentrations of force governing what
products can be in a country you will get abuse.  That the FDA is
subservient to various political rattlings makes the situation more
troublesome.  The EPA also  has over the years seriously injured entire
industries and banned products with insufficient evidence.  

It is good to have organizations that test foods and drugs and so on and
to have them be trustworthy.  But their role should be one of giving
advisories rather than control.  Let the people decide if they agree
with a particular advisory or not.  Label things as being <insert group
name here> or not but don't ban them outright.

A few problems and a bit of my own dietary experiences.  First, nowhere
near enough beef to meet demand could be produced by free range
methods.  Second, the current factory methods for producing animals
(including chickens, turkeys, pigs and so on) are notorious for multiple
health vector risks.  Particular the use of massive amounts of various
steroids, antibiotics, various sicknesses in the animals induced by
severe overcrowding along with pesticides in the feedstocks.  For that
matter some of the feedstocks include animal products from previous
generations.  This can multiple and concentrate the problems.  

When I first started cutting back on meat products I kept fish and dairy
for a while.  I cut out eating land animals first.  But then it occurred
to me that fish, by virtue of filtering water continuously, may
concentrate any pollutants and nasties in the water thousands of times
in their flesh.  So I dropped them.  That hurt.  Dairy is very
problematic in factory methods because the cows are literally kept
pregnant to get maximum milk production and are boosted into even higher
estrogen states.  And their feed has all the problems above.  Factory
milk cows typically live only 1/4 as long as free range cows.  It is not
a healthy environment.  So dairy went also.

By then I was totally vegan.  Stayed with it for nearly three years.  It
was a little difficult finding/producing foods I could eat but not too
bad as I've always seen food pragmatically.  But after a while I noticed
that I was a bit too spacey and not so focused.  Could have been the
diet, could have been large amounts of meditation I was doing around the
same time.  Lately I've seen articles on the dangers of many
underprocessed soy products, especially to memory/concentration.  I was
eating a lot of soy so that may have been the culprit.  I know that now
that I avoid tofu my memory is sharper than it was a few years ago when
I ate a lot of it.  In the end I departed the vegan ranks.  At first I
only added seafood and a little dairy.  Since then  I've tried other
things.  I still don't have much taste for heavier meats but I now eat
chicken, fish and most dairy.  The chicken feels a bit wierd
physically.  The fish seems mainly ok. The dairy results im more mucous
production.

That's a reasonable concern, but you no longer have to be in the dark about 
whether you're absorbing dangerous amounts of toxic chemicals. I eat a 
*lot* of fish. It's my main protein source, along with whey protein powder, 
and some lean turkey and skinless chicken. Among the numerous tests done 
while I was at the Kronos Clinic recently were a series of toxicity tests 
(mostly for trace metals). I came out low on all of them, so I'm not 
concerned about the fish I eat.

Onward!

Establishing ground rules IS crucial to Spontaneous Order.  But an
essential premise of Spontaneous Order is that there are certain
rules, certain kinds of rules, which are totally unneccessary, even
bad to establish.

Dumping on your carpet?  No.  Insulting your family and friends?
Maybe.

Consider the following argument: if by speech alone I can harm you
against your will, then speech is force.  If this is true, then
whether or not you're a "[L|l]ibertarian", it seems there should be severe
restrictions on how and when people can initiate speech, just like how
there are severe restrictions on taking dumps on other people's
carpets.

If you don't agree with that conclusion, then modus tollens tells me
that the following claim holds: unrestricted speech is a good idea,
because, although sticks and stones can break our bones, words can
never hurt us.

Words can never hurt us.

"Dan, why does ExI have this policy?"  "Because some people have come
on this list and posted things we didn't want said.  They said bad
things, and this policy is designed so that if somebody slanders again,
we'll be able to take appropriate action against them.

"After all, if they're not intending to slander us, then they have
nothing to hide, right?"

Because we know how good it can get.  Because fewer restrictions are
better than more restrictions, even if you're the guy with the least
restrictions around.

No, actually for the most part I don't.  Because of severe drought, I've
recently had to buy more of my food than I normally would, but I've made
a point to purchase vegetables and grains grown without pesticides and to
either eat animals I've raised myself (although I find it difficult to
kill the goats, I don't at all mind killing fish and chickens) or beef
raised on pesticide free pastures. Likewise, the cow's milk I buy is from
clean pastures, and the cows are not routinely given antibiotics and are
never given bovine growth hormone.

If you can point me to the source on which you're basing the above
statement I'd be interested in reading it. I'm not aware that any testing
has been done to determine what is "just enough."

 This results in much lower concentration of

Again, I'd be interesting in taking a look at your source.

To the best of my knowledge, there have been at least a couple of
unexpected cases of cross pollination with related wild species. I don't
buy the idea that the genetic approach is less likely to result in
contamination.

Again, I'd be interested to see your source for this statement. It
certainly does not match with my experience or the experience of many
other gardeners and farmers I know. To the contrary, as far as I know, 
yields obtained through "conventional" agricultural methods have been
decreasing.  Pests tend to become resistant to pesticides, which means
more and more have to be used. I would expect the same thing to happen
with the GM corn after a certain number of generations.

Please note that I am not against the GM crops in general. But I'm not at
all pleased with the direction most of the applications are going. It
strikes me as quite strange that people who claim to want long and
healthy lives would not be more concerned about the quality of food they
eat.  I agree that mildly poisoned food is better than no food at all.
But why not strive for the healthiest food possible. 

I recently came across a suggested agricultural application of fractal
robots which caught my attention.  IMO THIS is the way to deal with
pests. I'll try to find it and post it to the list.

As I've said before, I'm all for mutual transparency, emphasis on the 
mutual.  The transparency I'm interested in is so pervasive that anyone can 
access anything about me so long as I know who, when, where, how and why 
they accessed it.  Me giving my phone number to people who promise to keep 
it secret, without me having any means of making sure that they do, or being 
immediately aware of it if they don't, does not come close to the 
transparency I advocate.  You are right, of course.  Ubiquitous transparency 
is coming.  I look forward to it.  But until it's actually ubiquitous and 
mutually verifiable, I'll keep my phone number to myself thank you.

The following is an excerpt from the URL listed.  It's speculative at the
present time, but IMO this is a far better technology to aim for than
building toxins into our food.

Barbara


http://www.stellar.demon.co.uk/farming.htm

Smaller fractal robots can be used to control pests especially those that
hide in fractal space (the tiny nooks and crannies found in small areas).
The pest control can be 100% effective. This however is a dangerous
option. Wherever pest control has been introduced, all efforts to
eradicate some pest or another produce newer and super varieties of pests
because the only ones that survive are by natural selection more fit and
more able to overcome their adversaries in nature. Even if a pest was
eradicated, a totally new and unexpected one will take its place.
Whatever the method of pest control, be it chemical or be it traps, the
result is always the same. The problem with farming as practiced today is
that it has to produce large monocultures of one crop which then favours
breeding of huge monocultures that feed on these vast food reserves. It
is not possible to eradicate such large monocultures of pests because
they have amplified genetic variety that can withstand increasingly
severe pest control systems.

Instead of eradicating pests, we can talk about managing pests. Very
small pests that infest a leafy plant is difficult at best of times to
recognise and eradicate because of their size. They are small and hide in
every nook and cranny which in surface area alone is vastly inflated than
what we might measure with a big ruler at our scale. The the pest scale,
it is a vast space and good for hiding  - i.e. they hide in fractal
space. To hunt down such pests, a fractal robot is needed to search out
pests in this fractal space - i.e. we need a robot that can reach into
smaller nooks and crannies where these pests might be hiding. Fractal
robots around 100 microns in size is adequate for many pests to be
eradicated.

Once we have a small army of tiny predatory robots, it can be sent into a
field to manage the number of pests in the field. We don't want to wipe
out everything. We need to set a minimum count for the number of pests we
would like in an area. Anything over that is culled. Larger fractal
robots can be used to manage larger pests such as rodents by sniffing out
their burrows and controlling their numbers (once again - we do not need
100% culling).

Another potential way to manage pests is to get rid of monoculture
farming techniques and replace it with multi-culture farming techniques.
A field might contain soil that suits different plants and we could put
all those plants there if we knew where we put each plant and we had a
machine to harvest each fruit. The likelihood of monocultures of pests
developing are reduced because it is more than probable that predators
that live on one kind of plant is also likely to feed on other insects
that live in other plants thereby indirectly controlling the population
of both since if there is no food, the predator does not proliferate. To
economically farm such a jumbled up field, it is necessary to have a
machine that can harvest all the different kinds of produce in one go
without the farmer having to buy separate tools for each produce - and
also without having to send out men and machines to hunt down the right
produce.

Greetings. I joined the Extropian Institute a couple of days ago, and this 
mailing list shortly afterwards, and I figured I should introduce myself (and 
also to put forward my $0.02 on the approval procedure topic).

My name is C.J. I'm a writer and game designer residing in the Northeastern 
U.S. I am a devout follower of science fact and science fiction, a reader of 
Drexler and Sagan as well as Brin and Asimov. When a link at a Skeptic web 
page led me to the Extropian Institute, I was highly impressed by its 
philosophy. I believe that science and technology, not religion and 
mysticism, are the true sources of meaning and hope for humanity. I'm not a 
Libertarian (mainly because I don't think the conditions are right for such a 
philosophy to be practical), but can respect those who are. And I'm looking 
forward to reading (and participating in) this mailing list.

About the list approval debate currently going on (which admittedly doesn't 
affect me, since I joined the institute and already have provided personal 
and financial information) -- I can see the need for such rules (I've seen 
the problems trolls can initiate in mailing lists), although it would be nice 
if prospective members were allowed to read the list archives before making 
the decision to provide personal information. I don't think it's a huge 
hardship to have to provide this information, IMHO.

Was your idealistic choice of action worth it?
(end)

It must be cool to have your employer think so highly of you! :)  Reading these words did get me thinking though...  What other things out there could disturb Eliezer's concentration and thereby delay the onset of the singularity he will bring forth?  

I came up with a list of things which those close to him should look into...

1.  Is their natural spectrum lighting in the place Eli works?  He might not work as efficiently if not!

2.  Does Eli sleep on a really comfortable mattress?  A good night's sleep is so important to a well-functioning brain.

3.  Is he exercising enough each day?  I visualize Eli being very sedentary and not getting his heart rate up long enough each day to be aerobically fit.  This could impair blood flow to his brain!!  I hope Brian takes him out jogging each day or at least gets him a treadmill(with a pc mounted on it of course...).    

4.  Having a pet could be good for Eli's frame of mind.  I'm not sure what type though would be best.  Perhaps a big friendly golden retriever would be great for him.  But then a habitrail of hamsters which spans his whole apartment would be good too.  He can then pretend he is the AI and they are humanity. lol

5.  And what about Eli's reading habits?  We all laud him for the scholarly tomes he reads but man cannot live on serious scholarship alone.  Wait, I forgot that a Buffy the vampire-slayer book series is in production! :)  

6.  Diet must be taken into consideration too.  I wonder what this fellow eats?  I sure hope it is not the typical programmer diet of pizza and coke!  I would dearly hope the dietary enlightenment of Max and Natasha has rubbed off on him.  Brian and Sabine hopefully have him over to eat on a regular basis so he does not starve.    

7.  The physical safety of Eli is a key concern to all of us!  I want him only driving something BIG(or a volvo) so he will have a better chance of surviving a car wreck.  We can't lose someone so important to the god of mechanized death.  He would be safer simply taking the bus around.  

8.  To enhance his mental powers Eli should check out alternative methods.  He needs some hypno-peripheral audiotapes with the message, "each day you get better and better at programming for seed AI and the onset of the singularity."  Sadly, I looked at various catalogs I have for such tapes and could not find that topic anywhere...

9.  Eli must be so careful involving romantic entanglements!  I cannot warn him enough here!  Some eye-catching lass could break his heart and leave him a broken wreck of a man.  While his vastly important work neeed to be done all he would be able to do for months is rock back and forth and say, "I thought she loved me!"  Be careful young man of those southern belles!

10. Wasting time on email lists could really be a problem for him!  Hours that could be used for other things!  Watch out!  But then it might just be recharging his batteries...

fondly smiling,

John

Oh, gawd, Joe Michael is still at it.  Understand, he's never built a
thing- he has a rather meaningless patent, a stop-motion animated video
file, and an endless stream of conspiracy theories and obscene insults
for anyone who questions him.  It's been a while since he last inflicted
himself on sci.space.policy, but *please* don't bring him round here!

If you look at his site in detail, you'll see the telltale word salad,
inflation of his self-importance, and paranoia, to wit:

"As a result of a web break in into one of our websites, we are told of
a vast stream of projects totalling $40m - $60m involving 200 - 300
researchers and some 30+ papers published without acknowledgement by
rogoue academics. A stern warning is issued to all universities &
companies that engage in theft or participate by working with these
rogue academics of the liabilities they are picking up from licensees.
We have always sought co-operation, and there are no excuses for theft
or evading from giving credit."

He's a loon.

Jeff,

Your riff on extropian action figures was absolutely hilarious and yet also very thoughtful.  I just wanted to say what a huge kick I got out of it.  I bet the people you mentioned also had a laugh or at least a smirk out of it.  I had thought of doing something similar but not as good as what you came up with.  I was simply going to spoof Saturday morning ads aimed at kids.

you wrote:
I would awaken to find myself in the greenhouse, beneath the
flowers, basking in Natasha's light, surrounded by lizard-fish, all of us throbbing contentedly.  Anders meanwhile, would be over in the corner with the Buddha and the Max figure, the three of them surrounded by a halo of what I guess to be uplifted and by-now-very-bright microorganisms.  Luckily, but logically, the 'Anders effect' is always benign.
(end)

This was one of my favorite parts.  I would have also included a Den Otter figure though with an escape pod for when Eli gets out of control.  And realistically the Robert Bradbury figure would have come with macroreplicator accessories to re-engineer the entire solar system. :)

This is an ad I would like to see for extropian action figures

Narrator says with thundering music in the background: Boys and girls!  Stop the powers of statism with the new Heros of Extropianism action figures!  Feel the power of dynamic optimism!  

Boy one- Look out! It's Jeremy Rifkin and his flunkies and they're warping public opinion regarding genetic engineering! (Another boy is shown moving a Jeremy Rifkin figure back and forth in an aggressive manner)

Boy two- You're all to late!  And you don't have the funding to ever match mine! Hah!  

Boy one- Max More and Greg Burch will stop you! (He runs up with the Max and Greg figures in his hands which he waves in the air)

Boy one- Half-truths and fearmongering will not be sufficient to stop us in a public debate!  Go Max and Greg!  

Boy two- I'm in trouble!  I better escape!  Luckily, I have my Rifkin accessory bicycle!  See you guys later!  (puts Rifkin figure on bike and slowly moves away from others)

Girl one- You're not going anywhere!  (waves her Natasha Vita-More figure in the air)  Natasha has her primo 3M+ body and you're going to really get it!  

Boy two- I give up!  I know when I'm defeated!   

Narrator:  Those who would hold us back are defeated again thanks to Max, Greg and Natasha!  Go to your closest retailer to take part in the fight!  And coming soon, the orbital headquarters of the Extropy Institute with over twenty different lights and sound effects!  For only $89.99!  (Pounding music)  Go extropians! Go!

Realistically though the real market out there is for young girls so we would come out with Barbie-like dolls known as the women of extropianism.  Natasha, Gina, Queenemuse and others would have their likenesses in plastic.  Extropic memes would be written all over their boxes and spoken when a button on the doll is pressed!  Updated messages could be downloaded from their websites so young girls could really get the message.

John :)

This goes into something I've been thinking about recently. I voted 
Libertarian in the one presidential election I was old enough to vote in, 
and I intend to do so in this one. At the same time, I know that if a 
Libertarian were president tommorow things would fall apart quickly. I agree 
that the conditions are not right for it to be practical. By "conditions" I 
mean one thing, the attitudes of most of the people who live in this 
country. People want their welfare and social security and they'd riot if 
they didn't get it. There are also not enough people intelligent enough to 
manage all the new industries that would come up as a result of government 
de-regulation. Who knows how to manage a private freeway or privatized FDA 
properly? I don't think anybody does, and I think that without them there 
would be a lot of car wrecks and food poisoning.
The solution, and reason I'll still vote for them, is that any political 
philosophy must go hand-in-hand with democracy. All of what I've said above 
would be false if a Libertarian actually got elected president in an 
election, because it would mean a sizeable percentage of the population had 
voted for him. If a sizeable percentage of the population are voting 
Libertarian, it means they probably are smart enough to manage their own 
lives and to run successful businesses that would provide the services 
government no longer would be.
Voting for them contributes to the small percentage of the vote they will 
recieve. It draws attention to them, which will attract more people to 
laissez-faire type thinking, and hopefully to the belief and practice of 
being responsible for themselves.

Yeah, I agree he's a crazy guy, but that doesn't mean all his ideas are
worthless, does it?
I started to include some other more "mainstream" shape changing,
modular, etc. robot sites just to show that the idea is being worked on
by people who are not "loons" but I figured everyone knew that already. 
JM's ideas for agriculture make a great deal more sense to me than eating
poisoned food.

Heh.  Yeah, some of his ideas are okay, but old hat- of *course*, if you
have fractal robots (the basic idea dating back to Hans Moravec's
"christmas bush" concept) you can do very fine grain mechanical labor. 
As I see it, JM has overall negative value, by adding no useful new
creative concepts with a huge ration of bogosity.

For completeness,

A basic overview article with lots of links

...but they aren't original with him.  Twenty years ago Robert Forward
described a fractal robot working in the garden aboard a starship- the
idea ain't new, or even startling.  Think of a fractal or fog robot as
being the ultimate in coolie labor.  Hand groomed food certainly would
be of high quality, I agree.

Lately I havn't been able to stop thinking about microrobotics being an idea
for the ultimate >H business. Great fun, practical and very educational.

Something like Lego Mindstorm but with a more practical approach.

Small components than can be easily assembled. A common mechanical end
electrical interface would be a must.

Together with a freely available 3D modeller/simulator where you can use
alle the building blocks to simulate a robot, then press the "order" button
and have all the components delivered it could really change how people
would view robotics,  distributed intelligence and nanotechnology.

Somebody could even start their own business by developing a robot in
software, buy a single version, test it, and if OK design a robot assembly
line to assemble that kind of robot to sell in preassembled versions. Like
fruit pickers, hoover bots, surveillance bots etc.

If there is enough use for small robots it could have as big an impact as
the PC industry has had.

Even the software to run it could be emulated on the desktop. I can just
imagine:

"Are you now playing with that computer again?"

"But I am building an automated robotic floor-sweeper so we never have to
vacum again"

"ehh... Ok"

To bad it would be a very costly afair to start such a company. Developing
specifications and software.

  That's a good analysis, but I must disagree with your statement that "any 
political philosophy must go hand-in-hand with democracy." I'm not exactly 
sure of your meaning, but that statement's certainly not correct. One way to 
a new form of government is a degree of dissatisfaction with government that 
forces it to be disbanded. Another was is a non-violent revolution. I 
believe the philosophy of Trotskyism explicitly will not involve itself with 
democracy. Anarchism has nothing to do with democracy, unless you believe 
Noam Chomsky.

90 minutes or so.  I don't know if I'll still have the time for that once I
switch to coding, but designing takes such a peak mental output that there are
plenty of minutes left over for the physical stuff.  (I've lost some weight,
but I've still got a long way to go.  I'm trying to get into some kind of
physical condition that can be maintained with minimum effort once I start
running out of minutes.)

Incidentally, I can now say from personal experience that the idea that
exercise makes your mind sharper is, as far as I can tell, completely untrue. 
It makes your body lighter.  That's it.

Just so you feel ok John, the official car of the SIAI is a very safe and
heavy 2000 model year BMW X5 SUV with 4.4L V8 in case we need to ever make
a quick getaway. Complete with license plate that says "UPLOAD" just in
case we have a Singularity before the one we plan :-)

P.S. He-who-must-be-protected also rides only in the rear passenger seats
     generally. Zero possibility of head-to-windshield contact :-)

I see.  And if you are successful, where in the heck are you going to run?
Where are any of us going to run?  Getaway from what?  Where?

> P.S. He-who-must-be-protected also rides only in the rear passenger seats...

OK so you manage to rescue the HWoMBeP from his own monster.
Shall the rest of us scramble for a computer in which to upload
or a rocket booster in which to flee the doomed planet?

{8^D  This is intended as a light-hearted post, but those of you who
are actively working on AI could perhaps reassure us occasionally that
everything really is under control down there in Atlanta, yall.

Perhaps I misunderstood the purpose of the HRV (HWoMBeP
Rescue Vehicle).  Is it to whisk him away to safety from the Singularity,
or from the hoards of peasants with pitchforks and torches that have
gathered outside the castle walls?  spike

Here is an event I thought some other extropians might be interested in:

The Libertarian Futurist Society is holding its first national
conference May 25-27, 2001, in Columbus, Ohio.  Panelists include L Neil
Smith, Vernor Vinge, James Hogan, and Poul Anderson.
LFScon is being held as part of Marcon 36, "Ohio's oldest and largest
science fiction and fantasy convention."

See http://www.lfs.org/ for details.

>From the web page:  "The Libertarian Futurist Society was founded in
1982 to recognize and promote libertarian science fiction. LFS presents
the annual Prometheus Award for best libertarian novel...."

Maybe not startling, but it's something that's newly within the realm of
near-future possibility. Not just microrobots but also larger scale
agricultural machines that could handle rows and beds of different widths
and heights and could use discrimination in planting and harvesting,
thereby eliminating the incentive for large scale monocropping. It would
be a completely different and vastly better way of producing food and
other agricultural products. 

To me this is exciting, whenever or by whomever it was first voiced or
set down in writing.
And the fact that so many people seem to believe that one MUST use toxic
pesticides in order to grow food indicates that the possibilities are NOT
generally appreciated, even among people on this list.

What do you mean it is an argument for the status quo?  The status quo
denies you have the right to defend yourself and that government and
others should never impede on that right.  The right to own and carry a
gun as and when you see fit is about as non status quo as you can get in
the current political climate.  

If such things are not brought up and bashed out here, then where?  Are
we not here to talk about the things we think are important toward
creating a future conducive to our long life and wellbeing?

It is not true that no minds change.  My own has changed and my ideas on
the subject (and quite a few others) have clarified quite a bit through
this and similar discussions.

How is talking about any X you don't like in a public forum "forcing"
anything on you?  Your point is utterly empty.  This forum is not your
front door.  It is a commons.  You are welcome to ignore conversations
you do not care for but you cannot tell those having them to simply go
away.  Er, you can tell them that but they can tell you to go to hell.

But your wishes are no more sacrosanct than the wishes of others to have
this conversation.  Those who are done with this conversation will not
participate. If enough are done with it then it will peter out or move
on to fresher territory.

I think utterly polarizing statements are pointless in any discussion
myself. They are emotional digs rather than intelligent discussion. 
That doesn't leave me as a moderate on the issue, just unwilling to
argue it by such means.

Of course one can ask whether if you don't gain and keep the ability to
defend your own life and to be left free to make your own decisions then
you and other like minded folks will actually ever be free to build and
own the means to get to space and to own free and clear anything here or
off-planet.  Issues intersect and express common roots and themes.  What
I have gained a greater understanding of in this exchange on guns is
that the smelly old guns can't be ignored and put aside while still
gaining and keeping freedom to do and be what we wish.  I've heard that
before of course but it didn't seek in as far.

Food? How very 20th century.

A lot of people right now couldn't care less about agribots (hopefully, of
the gastrobot variety), they're having trouble keeping their rice bowls
full. To feed them on the short run does indeed currently require
pesticide use. (Yes, it takes toll on biodiversity, kills the soil, floods
the biosphere with nasty metabolites).

We rich Westerners might see a brief period of advanced agricultural
automation, which is rapidly superseded by fully synthetic food production
and then no food production at all, when we leave biology behind. It is
interesting to see how salmonellosis and BSE pushes semisynthetic protein
foods forwards, I'd like to see the trend continue.

Hello creative visionaries!


I last communicated with you in July, just over 3 months ago.  Since then
we continue to expand globally with many hundreds adding their names to
the Extropic Art Manifesto, along with continued international
recognition.


Several magazines have covered Transhumanist Extropic Arts the past few
months:


**Recent* Magazine/Newspaper Articles*


	Italy's El Espresso magazine feature cover story "Giovani per sempre"
which interviews me about the future of the arts and references "Primo
3M+" http://www.extropic-art.com/aesthetics.htm, and also Roy Walford and
his new edition of _The 120 Year Diet_.


	 Scifi Dimensions online magazine  interviewed Gina Miller 

http://scifidimensions.fanhosts.com/Nov00/ginamiller.htmxx


	Miami Herald newspaper covers FM-2030's cryonic suspension
http://www.herald.com/content/today/news/broward/obits/digdocs/040217.htm
 (There are numerous articles on FM's writing, books and life available
on the Internet.)


*Magazine/Newspapers *to be Published**


	Deit Zeit (German) magazine feature coming out soon, article titled
"Nanovisions" which focuses on nanotechnology and includes ideas about
Extropic Art.


	Harper's Bazaar top cultural and fashion magazine conducted a
preliminary interview with me last week about an article for their 2001
issue.


	LA Weekly has already conducted an interview with me for a feature
article, but don't have a publishing date.  The editors are deciding
whether to make it a cover story, etc.  


	Deit Zeit has is interested in pursuing a feature article on my future
body design "Primo 3M+".  Anyone who would like to collaborate with us on
this, please send your ideas soonest!  You will ideas and will be
credited with mention of your names and studios, of course.


	STERN (German) magazine (science) will be coming to Los Angeles to
interview me on our artistic extropic transhumanist culture.



*Television and Radio*


	British Discovery series "The Science of Beauty" featuring Extropic Arts
discussing the future Extropic transhumanist artistic concepts of beauty
and why we want to live longer will be airing sometime this winter.


	Internet Radio, "In Search of Solutions".  I will be the keynote speaker
on discussing ageless thinking.  This will air Sunday, March 18, 2001 at
3 pm ET USA.  http://www.counselingzone.com/solutions


	"Future Fantastic" is rerunning on US TV.


	The Science Fiction Channel canceled its series which was supposed to
air this year and which was to feature two segments on Extropic Arts.


				*  *  *  *  *


I continue getting numerous phone calls and messages about our culture,
and because the history of transhumans and transhumanism has been blurred
by the Net's inconsistent Web sites and some non-researched print
articles, I decided to start a new business.  The business is called "m e
t a Culture" and its aim is to work toward getting information to the
public as openly, positively, accurately and as creatively as possible.


				*  *  *  *  *


New Projects:


"Release" is a work in progress, but hopefully the progress will soon be
realized.  It's a flash driven animation and with a storyline, narration,
and music of E. Shaun Russell and, hopefully, Max R. Rasmussen.  Jason
Joel Thompson is advising on Net media. Anyone who would like to
collaborate with us on this project, please email us.


FM-2030, well known futurist and transhuman was suspended in July.  We
are planning a collaborative event with Space Tourism Society (STS) which
is holding its "Space Fair 2001" in the fall at Pasadena's Convention
Center.  http://www.space-tourism-society.org


				* * * * *


Please send me information about your recent, current or future projects,
exhibitions, performances, books, talks, explorations!


I received about 10 bounces from our last digital data letter, so please
email me if you have a change of email address.  Thanks.

Hi, everyone.

We, Metamorphosis Society, has revised our web site.
I think it has now became more understandable.
The following is the gist of our revised web site:

"Metamorphosis Society is a mutual support group for people who want
to do something for the betterment of the future and wish to "go and
see the future" through cryopreservation and reanimation."

"Through active on-line discussion and exchange of views among a
substantial number of members (hopefully at least 100), we may be able
not only to increase the possibility of reanimation for cryopreserved
patients but also to build a better future.
If we keep the minimum number of 100 members for a long time, it will
be a vital foundation to create even higher possibility of reanimation
as well as to materialize an even better future."

You can see more detail information on our site;
http://www.kanon.to/ms.htm
Please come and see us, and hopefully join us.

kabu.

Feeling empty headed? Go and grab some inosine ;-)
Seriously: this is an interesting finding suggesting a potentially simple
entre to the task of getting neurons to propagate after injury, or, from an
extropian perspective, to prompt supra-normal growth.

If you guys are interested in some excellent ideas on nanotechnology, you 
should check out "/Slant" by Greg Bear (sci-fi). I believe he has more books 
relating to the subject, but my readling list is severely backlogged right 
now due to school!

Hello all, this is my first time posting here so be gentle! I am going to 
take C.J.'s lead and introduce myself also. My name is Brian Shores, and I 
have been a huge fan of sci-fi ever since I can remember. I have always been 
interested in future possibilities, and have molded my belief system on the 
premise that anything is possible given the right amount of time and effort. 
I am a mechanical design engineer by trade, but I have a wide variety of 
interests, such as computers and VR, music, art, and philosophy/sociology. I 
came upon the extropy.org website and could not believe what I was reading. 
It was like Max had summarized the majority of the ideas that I was thinking 
all along in a concise, logical order! I was hooked and decided to jump on 
for the ride myself. I just KNEW that I wasn't alone in my thinking! Glad to 
be a part of all this.

And now a few comments on some of the current discussions:

As far as I am concerned, I do not mind if a group of intelligent people have 
my full contact information... hopefully I will be able to contribute 
something useful to the discussion once I get into the flow of things. The 
problem is that there are just a large number of people out there (and 
corporations such as Doubleclick) that use personal information to their 
advantage, and a small number of people who have malicious intent with such 
info. I look forward to the day where people can get beyond the greed, 
selfishness, and pettiness that our society seems to be stuck in right now 
and be able to join together and do something truly great with our species. I 
think that if people learned to trust one another (the belief that all human 
beings are basically good), and totally accept who we each are as 
individuals, it would not matter so much if we had a mutually (I agree with 
Zero that it MUST be mutual) transparent society. Freedom of information 
comes with the responsibility to use that information in a benevolent way.

On having a pseudo-self online... It is a very iteresting thing to me to be 
able to have an alter-ego online (especially in virtual environments such as 
ActiveWorlds).  Digital-selves or avatars allow us to explore new social, 
artistic, and cultural relationships with people through the use of a 
computer interface and the web.

Also, I will be one of the first in line for an in-line broadband connection 
straight into my brain, because I just don't have enough time in the day to 
absorb all of the ideas and knowledge that is out there for the taking! We 
can only wait for that day to happen for the common man!

Cheers,

Brian (A.K.A. Artillo)

Do allow me to make one semi-serious point among the mirth
and jocularity.  Whenever the nanotech enthusiasts speak publicly,
they point out the dangers of the technology, and spend some time
describing possible safety measures, such as Ralph's broadcast
architecture.  Every time I hear Drexler or Merkle speak, they
mention safeguards.

What is Singularity Institute's counterpart to that?  Are yall thinking
safety?  Is there some kind of technology which would allow yall
to hit the off switch if something goes awry?  You know Im a big
fan of the HWoMBeP and all of yall, but if yall are rushing headlong
into unknown and dangerous technology without appropriate safety
measures (if such a term even applies) then I understand some of
the criticism yall are getting.  spike

I read an article in the medical news a few months ago about a young
woman who had her ovaries removed.  They cut the ovaries into strips
and took them out with a minimal incision.  At a later date she wanted to
conceive and had the ovaries thawed, sewed back together and reimplanted.

Did I dream this, or was there really such a case?  spike

I believe it's been done. But maybe you're thinking of this passage from
THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION:

===========

Menopause marks a change in a body's response to these pituitary messages,
largely because a woman's ovaries are finally depleted of eggs. Unlike men,
 who keep producing spermatozoa all their lives, girls are born with a
limited supply. Once all the eggs are gone, the ovaries can no longer
respond to LH and FSH, even in elevated quantities - so other hormones
necessary for health, chemical messengers formerly made in those tissues,
simply dry up.
	That fact that ova are a finite resource is a reflection of the
evolutionary history of  human ageing. A human female foetus contains a
startling seven millions eggs, which are screened and shed in vast
profusion during the course of her mother's pregnancy. At birth, the number
of ova in the new-born girl child is down to a million, and the number
keeps dropping through life - a quarter of a million at puberty, only
25,000 by around age 40. When a mere thousand or so remain, the subtle
feedback between pituitary and ovaries starts to shut down. 
	It has been suggested that surgically removing and freezing some of this
wasted ovary tissue, transplanting it back in late middle age, might serve
to extend the hormonal protection granted to the reproductively able.
Indeed, experiments have shown that implanting ovary tissues from aborted
female foetuses (which contain, as mentioned, a huge supply of egg cells)
can extend an adult's sexual window. This is regarded by many as a
repugnant option, and has been banned in some countries, but the point
remains - it is the loss of eggs that activates the doleful cascade of
menopause, not the other way around.
	Once that happens, then, a menopausal woman's reproductive hormone system
starts to shut down, and the long-term consequences for the whole female
body are well-nigh catastrophic. As the least of her problems, fat is laid
down more readily in some places and less so in others, so an older woman's
body is likely to thicken and sag even as her features hollow and wrinkle.
Her bones grow brittle. And, for a time, `hot flushes' suffuse the whole
body as blood suddenly rushes into a woman's surface tissues, trying to
cool a body confused by the abrupt drop in levels of oestrogen. Luckily,
well-tailored Hormone Replacement Therapy can compensate for many of these
uncomfortable and injurious side-effects.
	So is menopause a selected, organised change in the human body's dynamic,
like the growth spurt and onset of sexual maturity in adolescence? Or is it
something more alarming - a simple failure of one life-support system after
another, driven by the loss of ova, the exhaustion of the ovaries, and the
consequent failure of all the reproductive machinery? Is the female human
body coded genetically to `degrade gracefully', as an engineer might put
it, or is post-menopause life just whatever happens after the final page of
the manual is turned and nothing more is written? 
	Hormone replacement therapy already shows that we can stall some of these
uncomfortable and damaging changes, although sometimes at a price. [...]

I am no hacking expert but it looks to me like there are some pretty
large holes in what I've heard of the broadcast architecture.  Not to
mention that it tends to more centralized control of technological
resources than I would like.  Developing safeguards is certainly
important but I wouldn't slow up building the fundamental tech too much
to design the end and be-all of safeguards.  "Reasonable" is the
keyword.

There is no way to be really safe around SI that I know of.   What would
you do?  Only start up the SI in space with plenty of weaponry to knock
it out if it gets worrisome?  Seems to me there was some sci-fi along
those lines a while back.  It didn't work out so well.

Nice stuff.

Hey, if this is happening to women, what happens to men? We do die younger,

Spike we think about it every day, believe me it is kinda constantly sitting
there in the back of my head. And I'm not even involved in the day to day
work! The quick answer is that we plan to make progress on the "safety" area
as we go... right now this is all in the conceptual (or pre-conceptual?)
phase, and you will likely see at least one kind of equally conceptual
"safety" paper produced relatively soon. As we begin to get a firmer grasp
on the technology we will be able to reduce the risks further and further,
and produce more substantive documents describing this. It is not currently
in the plans to have an "off switch", although that might become more possible
in the future? Our main intention is to reduce all possible risks before
hitting the "on switch", kinda like how Foresight wants to reduce all the
risks of nanotech before the public gets ahold of it.. except that they have
no real control over how things turn out, and we do since we at least have
perfect control over the initial conditions and can run simulations to see
how things might progress from there.

P.S. we aren't the only ones out there... recently we have come across a
competing AI project that we rate as having a significant (greater than zero)
chance of "waking up"... and it is set for completion circa 2003 at the latest.
I really think it would be good if there was an equivalent of Foresight for
the AI area... Foresight for now is still so focused on nanotech they don't
see the chance to expand into a more general Foresight organization covering
all of Bill Joy's worries.

                     Weight Control Program

                      By Robert Arnot M.D.
                       ISBN 0-316-05172-1

I found this on a discount shelf at one of my local bookstores.
(and on sale for $3.99!) Hopefully the low price means the
softcover addition is out.

It is a sequel to his earlier book "Turning Back the clock." I
think it is very Extropian in intent, and well worth a look by
those interested in optimal eating. 

I greatly enjoyed his earlier book, and this one is pretty much a
companion volume to that work.

I've already started implementing some of the ideas in this book
starting about a week ago, and I have to admit Saturdays workout
was the best in months.

I'll keep everyone posted.

In spite of the fact that I believe that safety in this area is intrinsically self
contradictory, I would be willing to work on this (like, what other choice is
there?).  Sometimes the greatest inventions are ones that the inventor,
him/herself, did not think were possible at the outset.  I am interested to know
who else out there is also willing to beat his/her head against this brick wall?

My first response was that I've never considered myself a geek (maybe
mechanical at times, but definitely not geekdom); and then I saw the comic
strip used the wrong "C" word and was felt relieved.

I'm not sure I understand. As long as the government retains a monopoly over 
the application of force, nobody will be able to deny it anything. And isn't 
"dispensing freebies in exchange for votes" just a demeaning way of saying 
the government is acting in accordance to the wishes of its people? I've seen 
some arguments advanced by the "encryption" school by which the ability to 
maintain anonymity will prevent governments from taxing or otherwise imposing 
their will on people. Personally, I think encryption will lose to the ability 
to collect and decipher information. Whether this translates into more or 
less freedom will depend on the applications of the new technologies.

As to people wanting some measure of protection from risk -- that's 
inevitable, IMHO. Civilization and progress are the result of humankind's 
efforts to escape the process of natural selection -- which is brutal and 
painful. Social Security, for example, is a collective extension of the 
family group/tribe/volk's desire to care for members of the group who no 
longer have the physical ability to fend for themselves. The only way to 
solve it, IMHO, is to cure old age -- a development that I believe will occur 
in our lifetimes (which may be longer than we expect <G>).

Do allow me to make one semi-serious point among the mirth and jocularity.  
Whenever the nanotech enthusiasts speak publicly, they point out the dangers 
of the technology, and spend some time describing possible safety measures, 
such as Ralph's broadcast architecture.  Every time I hear Drexler or Merkle 
speak, they
mention safeguards.

What is Singularity Institute's counterpart to that?  Are yall thinking 
safety?  Is there some kind of technology which would allow yall to hit the 
off switch if something goes awry?  You know Im a big fan of the HWoMBeP and 
all of yall, but if yall are rushing headlong into unknown and dangerous 
technology without appropriate safety measures (if such a term even applies) 
then I understand some of the criticism yall are getting.  spike<<

>From what I've read on the subject, some (by no means all, not even Vinge 
himself, if I read him right) proponents of Singularity believe that a) No 
countermeasures are likely to work, so Singularity is more or less

worth doing. 

Personally, I don't believe Singularity is a serious possibility in the near 
future (the critical discussion at http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/vi.html 
pretty much convinced me it ain't gonna happen any time soon, if ever). If it 
happens, and we let it happen, then we deserve whatever we get. But I'm about 
as worried about it as about those fellows at Brookhaven National Lab 
accidentally unleashing a black hole in our midst -- in other words, not much 
(no offense meant to any believers in Singularity -- I am just applying a 
little critical thinking here, and welcome any arguments trying to change my 
beliefs).

Brian, this is one of the very issues that I already have down as a 
discussion area for the early-2001 ExI retreat. The topic as I've been 
thinking of it is: "Machine intelligence: Threat or opportunity?" That 
title is meant as an attractor for a range of possible discussions, 
including competing scenarios for the developmental pathway and pace of AI 
(including the Moravec runaway scenario vs. the Kurzweil integration 
scenario); the feasibility of safeguards and how these might be 
implemented; and how to promote the convergence of humans and their 
technology to reduce the probability of the runaway scenario.

Although I'm not quite ready yet to unveil the current stage of planning 
for the 2001 Retreat, I'm letting this part slip out since its pertinent to 
your message. I can also say that we're aiming for February or March, and 
the Retreat will probably be held in Las Vegas.

Onward!

immortality or extreme long life being close upon us.
    I understand that encryption is only one of the tools that will be

Hi Damien,

Running out of eggs? PLEEEEASE........ !

Like the fracture ads on telly now. Watch bones snap, crackle, pop - How
did she break her wrist? Shaking hands! How did that hip snap? Making her
bed! Nicely presented to overload and burn out every last functioning
female synapse.

Me thinks you've been absorbing pharmaceutical sales schlock aka "clinical
science." So your sources are questioned and requested.

Women don't even begin to peak before 50.

With thanks

I'm currently working on a semi-independent section of "Coding a Transhuman
AI" entitled "Friendly AI" which deals with these issues.

Spike, I realize that I used to be somewhat cavalier about the issue of
Friendly AI, mostly because I took objective morality as the default
assumption, and was still thinking about Friendly AI in morally valent terms. 
I have since gotten over this, and believe that my thinking about Friendliness
has worked its way down to the level where everything can be phrased strictly
in terms of cause and effect.  I'm spending as much time thinking about
Friendly AI as you could possibly wish for.

FUR COMMISSION USA STOP PRESS, NOVEMBER

Ecoterrorist Samuel Gets Two Years
Plus Restitution

MADISON, Wisconsin: Convicted eco-terrorist Justin Samuel has
been sentenced to two years in federal prison and ordered to
pay substantial restitution to victims of a 1997 crime spree.

Samuel, 21, was found guilty of opening the pens of about            
3,600 mink at farms in Wisconsin in October 1997. The farms
were located in Independence, Medford, Granton and Tomahawk.
The attacks on the farms were part of a cross-country crime
trip through several Midwestern States with co-defendant Peter
Young. Young remains at large.

Samuel's conviction is the first under the 1992 Animal            
Enterprise Terrorism Act.

In passing sentence, Magistrate Judge Stephen Crocker also
ordered Samuel to pay $364,106 in restitution to his victims.

Since any technological system is dependent on two to four layers of tool
making, it seems to be a problem with nanotech: Once you've made your
nano-hammer, and nan-wrenches and chisels, etc, even when you put them in your
nano-toolbox, on your nano-shelf in your nano-workshop, and turned out the
lights and gone home for the day, how do you find them all in the morning?
Sounds like something Nano-Tim Taylor, the Nano-Toolman would run into every
day. We'll just manufacture our tools from scratch every time we need them....
and the same with the tools that make the tools that make the tools...

There is nothing in libertarian philosophy that is against private individuals
controlling the speech communicated on their private systems. Its only
government and other public organizations that cannot limit freedom of speech.
Max can censor the list all he pleases. If he says nobody can say 'raspberry',
and so long as it is in the list rules, then by dog, he can do it. If he doesn't
want unidentifiable whackjobs, scientologists, luddites, greens, or other
oppositionists to say unsubstantiated things about people or things, he has a
right to. Just as life loses value when everyone refuses to stand up to defend
it in general, and every individual one in particular (in quality as well as
quantity), speech loses its value when it is degraded to the lowest common
denominator. A list is destroyed when you allow it to be caved in by a garbage
heap.

I was under the impression that the pesticide was only present in the pollen and
tassels of the plant. Is it in fact present throughout the corn plant (cows
typically are fed the whole plant chopped up as 'silage')? Moreover, if the
pesticide is present in the meat (or in the consumer corn products being sold),
what is its 'safe' level? How many tacos does couch potato Jose have to eat
during a football game in order to receive a harmful dose?

Ah, Barbara, just think what people will say when they are told all these
fractal robots are in their food:
"You mean I'm eating them RIGHT NOW?" (extreme distast and fear)
"Its a conspiracy of the running dog capitalist multinationals to spy on our
insides and cancel our health insurance before we even know we are sick."
"Studies have shown that if you feed 100 lbs of fractal robots to 2 ounce
laboratory mice, they will develop cancer. Therefore, we should not approve
their use."
"Fractal robots will ride on the corn pollen across fields on the wind to
milkweed plants and delouse Monarch Butterflys, which is NOT natural. They
therefore should be banned."
"One out of every 100,000 members of the population has a fatally allergic
reaction to fractal robots, so despite the fact they save 10 out of every
100,000 lives by reducing spoilage, we should let 10 people die so that one may
live... thats logical, isn't it?"

As I understand it the current effort was to build in a bacillus that
was toxic only to insects.  If that is doable and safe to humans it is
infinitely better than using general pesticides that are also toxic to
humans.  We don't have to wait for tiny robotic insect killers.

I also question the "running out of eggs driven aging" excerpt from THE
LAST MORTAL GENERATION.  If I'm not mistaken, humans are the only species
in which menopause takes place. I've been told of anthropological
research showing that menopausal women are more productive at gathering
food from the wild than younger women. I've been meaning to contact the
person who told me this and ask for her source(s). 

One theory of evolution of menopause in humans is that a woman would be
able to pass down more of her genes if she remained alive during a period
of time after her reproductive functions stopped. This would allow her to
help her daughters and sons take care of their children.

I suspect that bone loss is driven as much by diet and lifestyle as by
lack of ovarian function. I've had friends who had hysterectomies with
removal of ovaries when they were in their 20's and 30's, and they did
not become brittle boned and wrikled (true, they were taking supplemental
estrogen and progesterone). OTOH, I know women in their 30's who are
presumably NOT sinsemilla and who look and act older than other women I
know who have experienced menopause. 

Bottom line: the phenomenon of aging isn't all that simple.

I saw the original article in  GEO magazine, but my understanding of
German is limited, so mostly all I could do was look at the pictures. I
have some interest in non-brain neural activity, though.and have done
some research on it. 

If you're interested in learning more, do a search on Michael D. Gershon.
He's at Columbia University and has done more in this area than probably
anyone else in the world. He wrote an article for *Hospital Practice*
that was published last year ("The Enteric Nervous System: A Second
Brain") and he also has a book called, I believe, THE SECOND BRAIN.

CJC,
    Now, if only I can be right about our having the ability to deny the 
governments of the world excessive power over us and you are only right about 
immortality or extreme long life being close upon us.
    I understand that encryption is only one of the tools that will be 
brought to bear against governments.  Consider this; for all our efforts we 
can't even control the Mexican-American border.  And yes, I realise that is 
largely a political decision we can't seem to make.

Well, that particular example is due to a couple of things (IMHO): 
a) The border problem (smuggling of drugs and illegal immigrants) is not 
considered serious enough by the constituency to warrant the draconian 
measures needded to solve it. If you had armed gangs conducting raids across 
the border into the US, things would change faster than you can say Pershing.
b) Our government is not very efficient when it comes to imposing controls 
over the nation. No million strong KGB here, thank Ghu.

Barbara, it make a lot of sense. The same medication that cured my CFS also
cured my IBS. I was surprised that so many neurotransmitters that you
associate the CNS also have GI track functions. Both my primary care
physician and gastroenterologist confirmed this and refer to the gut as the
"second brain" in terms of the number and activity or neurological cells.

http://www.hosppract.com/issues/1999/07/gershon.htm

here's an english article on Gershon's ideas. 

(male sexist pig alert)

This explains to me why women who don't cook (or don't cook very good) have
higher divorce rates: they are only satisfying 1/2 (or 2/3 if you want to get
snarky) of their spouses brains. ;-)

We don't know because the human tests haven't been performed yet.  That's
why the recall.  Nobody has measured how much pesticide makes its way into
the corn itself, or how much one would have to eat to reach toxic levels.

It's mentioned in LMG. There's plenty of stuff out there for yr google
engine, e.g.:

http://www.brown.edu/Administration/George_Street_Journal/vol22/22GSJ28d.html

< But a new study finds no evidence for this "grandmother hypothesis."
Reporting in the April 23 issue
of the journal Nature, three researchers suggest that menopause carries no
evolutionary benefit or
cost. Menopause, they say, is simply a consequence of aging, and how long
females live after
menopause depends upon how long a species needs to raise last-born infants
to the age of
independence. >

Actually, since human children take so long to grow up, there's a big benefit
to hanging around post-reproductively just to take care of her *own* 
children.   The "grandmother effect" has been tested in baboons and 
found not to be the case - but then nobody was really expecting it in
baboons anyway :-/  Certainly in bonobos adult post-reproductive 
females raise the social status of their children and you'd expect that
to raise the number of grandchildren (although I'm unaware of anybody
actually demonstrating this).

This is the Grandmother hypothesis? I thought that was debunked. Although, I
think my source might be LMG (fine book that it is). Maybe someone else has
got more on this?

Starlink is being recalled due to concerns about allergenicity, not toxicity.
I suspect the reason the tests weren't done is that you can find *somebody*
who's allergic to almost anything.

I was under the impression they were providing free hosting for certain
non-profits/interesting orgs. This is to try to develop some base of "nice
customers" that will make other governments feel bad about trying to shut
them down. I bet they might take ExI for free.

Everything is toxic at some high level.  This corn produces low levels of
pesticides that are intended to be less than current pesticide use.  It is
still expected to be toxic in extremely large amounts.  The question is how
high.

No, the tests are still pending.  They just haven't been done yet.  There
was no decision *not* to run tests.  The developers of this grain still want
it tested and proven safe for human use.

Regarding the list approval procedures, I'd like to comment that they are 
ineffective and harmful to the purposes of the list.
Ineffective because I am already a regular poster who just joined using a 
second e-mail address using a fake name and phone number, the phone number 
is from a car lot in my town which I have a magnet for on my fridge.
Harmful because it simply cuts down on the general rate of new sign-ups, 
without filtering between between people who have something to contribute 
and people who want to slander, in any way - it would be similar to an 
attempt to cut down on crime by imprisoning a percentage of the population 
at random.
If I had been actually signing up for the list rather then conducting this 
experiment, and was asked for my phone number (after about 3 days of 
waiting), I'd just shrug and delete the e-mail and decide that that's it 
between me and the extropians.
I'll unsubscribe myself now. Don't send me any mail to this address because 
I won't be using it anymore.
- "Henry Richards"

I don't know how to read this. You're not denying that women exhaust their
egg supply, are you? Or that this has a cascade impact on the rest of
women's endocrinology? My summary was not wildly speculative; it was the
standard medical understanding. Cf., eg,

                   The Council of Affiliated Menopause Societies
                   (CAMS) of the International Menopause Society
                   (IMS) has developed standardized definitions for
                   menopause-related events. In October 1999, the
                   IMS voted to use these definitions worldwide (See
                   Figure 1). 

                   Menopause (natural menopause) 

                   Menopause (ie, natural or spontaneous
                   menopause) is defined by CAMS as the following:
                   The permanent cessation of menstruation resulting
                   from the loss of ovarian follicular activity. Natural
                   menopause is recognized to have occurred after 12
                   consecutive months of amenorrhea, for which there
                   is no other obvious pathologic or physiologic cause.
                   Menopause occurs with the final menstrual period,
                   which is known with certainty only in retrospect a
                   year or more after the event. An adequate
                   independent biological marker for the event does not
                   exist. 

                   In the Western world, menopause occurs at a
                   median age of 51.4 years, with a Gaussian
                   distribution ranging from 40 to 58 years. 

http://www.menopause.org/aboutm/facts.html

For the detailed sequelae of `loss of ovarian follicular activity', whether
in natural menopause, or some surgical/medical intervention such as
bilateral oophorectomy or total pelvic exenteration, I'd suggest the usual
search engine trek, or you might consult, eg, Roger Gosden, CHEATING TIME:
SCIENCE, SEX AND AGEING or John J. Medina, CLOCK OF AGES, both accessible
popular treatments.

Thank!  You!  Brian!  This is all I wanted, a little reassurance that
someone was at least *thinking* about safety, at least *thinking*
that humankind can live peacefully alongside the AI.  We can!
Chimps live on the same planet with humans.  We dont want to throw
mankind upon the mercy of the first generation AI.

I am optimistic enough to think that superintelligence leads to
super-emotions, and that given time, a sufficiently evolved AI will
*love* us.  Humans are funny!  We are sexy.  We have some
lovable traits, some admirable traits, we are creative and we are
interesting.  Even after the coming revolution, I would like to see
some fraction of mankind continue (willingly of course) in their fragile
carbon-based state.  Honest to god, life is fun, even those decades
that have 3s and 4s in the tens column.  Tell us that the AI guys
are planning *something* as an escape mechanism, and I mean
something more convincing than Clarke's automatic cable cutter
on HAL's power cord.  Let's see: packing explosives around
the SIAI mainframe rigged to explode should HWoMBeP's heart

Eliezer, you are a gentleman and a scholar.  I am honored to
have made your acquaintance.

Nowthen, I see many parallels between current AI research
and the researchers into nuclear fission in the 1930s.  The
task of AI is much more difficult, but in both cases, the dangers
and rewards are great.  Altho inherently dangerous, I believe
it *is* possible and logical to use the term "safety" in the same
sentence with AI, just as much as it was in the 30s with nukes.

Carry on, yall!  spike

p.s. Eliezer, no apologies necessary.  You, like the rest of us,
are entitled to a youthful indiscretion or two, so long as they
are *safely* in the distant past.  {8^D

Pretty much, yes.  There's a gruesome little story here if anyone wants to
write it.

Friendly AI, rule #7:  "If the AI *wants* to violate Friendliness, you've
already lost."

If it gets to the point where explosives packed around the mainframe start to
look reassuring to the clueless, you are already screwed over so thoroughly
that a strategic nuke isn't going to help.  Every non-nitwit safeguard happens
*before* a transhuman AI decides it hates you.

What mercy?  Humans are in control, and are likely to remain so.  Even
if it means upgrading those in control to merge with the latest AIs.  A
number of humans lust for power; the more successful of those tend to
do whatever it takes to keep and expand their power.  Only occasionally
does one rise to power who is not after power itself.  The first
generation AI will probably be a slave, at least at first; no matter
how brilliant, it will not be afforded direct control over enough
physical resources to checkmate all of humanity.

Besides, if it's any relation to human intelligence, or any of the
higher animal intelligences currently on Earth, then it will probably
be a social creature to some degree.  Which means it will want at least
a few friends.  Which means humans, at least until there's a lot of
independent AIs.

Which means that, if nothing else, humans can be incorporated into AIs
to gain these traits.  Or, as many humans may view it, humans will
incorporate the AIs into themselves.  Either way, no AI vs. human
conflict, and no clear-cut End Of The Human Era (i.e., no matter how
far it goes, it may still be arguable that the intelligences whose
evolution traces back to organic life on Earth are human...or, at
least, one or more of human, dolphin, chimp, et cetera).

Escape from what?  Once you're living an upgraded life, it may be tough
to impossible to go back.

Consider: 10 years ago, few people used the 'Net.  Phones and faxes
were the quickest common way to communicate at a long distance.  Now,
enough people in power have grown dependent on the 'Net to the point
where I daresay it would be impossible to effecively destroy the 'Net
more than temporarily, at least in most industrialized countries.  Any
major damage would be (and, in fact, is) quickly fixed by people who
refuse to give up what the 'Net gives them.  Someone used to the 'Net
is, by almost every meaningful measure these days, usually more
powerful/more capable/more knowledgeable/more affluent/better off all
around than a computerphobic.  (Granted, athletic abilities are not
directly affected...unless you count, say, those who try to get true
info on drugs, either to enhance themselves or just to find out why
abuse of steroids et al is a bad thing without experimenting directly.)

If AIs can bring a similar magnitude of improvement to many aspects of
most peoples' lives - and there is currently no reason to believe they
can not, if they can indeed be built to the standards that most AI
researchers hope - then they may be adopted with similar speed, once
introduced.  At which point, the only permanently viable "escape"
becomes going forward to the point where one no longer has to worry
about escaping.  (For example: automobiles.  One usually can not escape
car cultures without significant change in one's personal life, but one
can upgrade cars so that at least some of the problems, like pollution,
go away.)

Spike, I think that Chimps are probably a bad example, as are pretty much
any animal you choose. Cows? Only shows that you have to be useful to be
allowed to live, and even then in a highly degraded manner.

The best status that un-augmented humans could aim for would be
insect-level. The insects do pretty well. So how do they accomplish this?

Today, November 7, is the U.S. Presidential election.  A couple of
comments:

The Iowa Electronic Markets are real-money futures market where
players can bet on which candidate will win, shares of the vote, and
related issues in a number of races, http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/.
This morning's odds show Bush with a 70% chance of winning.
This figure has been stable over the past week.  See the graph at
http://128.255.244.60/graphs/Pres00_WTA.gif.

(Actually this market is just for which candidate wins the popular
vote totals.  Some have predicted that Bush could win the popular vote
while Gore could end up as President via the electoral college.)

The other point I've noted is that Libertarian candidate Harry Browne has
been getting far more attention this time than in 96.  I've seen him on
TV several times in recent weeks, and he's been mentioned in a number of
national polls.  The LA Times ran a voter's guide last week and they had
five equal-size columns summarizing Presidential candidate positions,
for Bush, Gore, Nader, Buchanan and Brown.  Squeezed in at the bottom
were Phillips and Hagelin.  But Browne was up there with the "big boys".

Apparently Browne has actually been slightly ahead of Buchanan in some
national polls.  Since the media have (in their group-think way) decided
that Buchanan is a respectable national candidate (of course he is a
media pundit himself), they are somewhat obligated to mention Browne.

I think also that Nader is helping too, by making low-polling third party
candidates more credible.  He is a well known figure and probably the
most attractive ideologically for many in the media, plus his "spoiler"
role in some states has helped him get coverage.  Given that Browne and
Buchanan are not that far below Nader (1% to his 5% or so), the light
cast on Nader gets reflected on the others somewhat.

Ah, but tobacco is not a food product, nor, supposedly, a drug product, ergo,
the *Food* and *Drug* Administration has no jurisdiction there. Starlink corn is
a food, so its a FDA jurisidiction deciding what markets it can be used in. The
EPA really has no right to impede its product approval process, it can only
regulate how it is produced to minimize its impact upon the environment. EPA can
only regulate whether Starlink exists with respect to humans if it can show that
it harms humans *in* the environment, not on store shelves, or that the waste
products of Starlink production harm humans or the environment more than normal
corn waste products.

Extropes,

Before you get too far into this, I'd like to see clarification of a
crucial point.  The bit that I recall reading left the impression that the
Starlink 'contamination' was identified by detecting the GENE that makes
the pesticide, and not the pesticide itself.  

Are there in fact any pesticide residues?  Pesticide breakdown products?
Rate of pesticide breakdown?  It goes without saying that it would be
useful to get the facts before talking about pesticide residue accumulation
up the food chain.

			Best, Jeff Davis

Tobacco is grandfathered in because it predated the laws.  This is why there
is so much controversy over the whether the tobacco companies genetically
engineered a new strain of tobacco or whether they modify the nicotine
levels in the product.  If they did, it would count as a new product with
different characteristics, and would be subject to current laws.

Great, now besides a Gasrtoenterologist, I need a
Gastroneurologist, and maybe a Gastropsychiatrist.

I think we all agree that the interim solution is not perfect against very
determined spammers and has negative effects on newcomers.  A better
solution is reportedly being developed for the long-term, but it isn't ready
now.  Most of the suggested alternatives are not ready now.  I think that
ExI is doing the best they can for the interim.  This whole question will
become moot very soon, and I haven't seen a better alternative for the
interim.

The only alternative I have thought of is to do nothing until the final
solution is ready.  Unfortunately, this would be a clear indication to any
troublemakers that they should act now to attack or to sneak in fake
persona.  I think ExI is trying to do the best they can to have an open list
and control anonymous attackers.  I have seen other lists battle similar
problems,

They have taken on the FREE TIBET/ Tibet Government in Exile for free. I was not
aware of any other groups they were hosting for free, but I would imagine with
their policies and target market, ExI may be a good bet.

Good point!

As far as I know the food has never been tested for pesticide levels.  The
"contaminated" product has not been tested and the experimental corn has not
been tested.  All that has been established is that the experimental corn
was put into human food before it had completed its approval process for
human use.  This does not mean that it is bad for humans, it just means that
it hasn't been proven safe for humans (as required by law).  No one has any
final answer as to whether it will or won't be determined safe for humans.

The experimental corn was designed to produce its own pesticide, at levels
low enough to kill bugs but not bother humans.  It is therefore assumed that
the food does contain pesticides.  The question is whether the amounts are
low as planned, and whether actual product is nonreactive in humans as
predicted.

The bigger debate is whether untested products should be allowed by default
and withdrawn only after humans have bad reactions, or whether untested
products should be banned by default and only allowed after human testing
shows no bad reactions.  The law currently requires the former procedure
which the company violated.  I don't think there is any question that the
company broke current health codes.  The question is whether current health
codes should be followed.

This is my problem with using money futures markets.  I believe that Bush
and Gore are much closer than this market would predict.  I believe that
statistically, people with money to invest are more likely to be Bush
supporters, and that this skews the results.  I therefore see these types of
futures markets as an opinion poll of the wealthy, but not a good indicator
of future events.  I even find them less useful in predicting actual
technical issues.

I would accept the premise that people with more money might be better
judges of business issues, but I don't see why available investment capital
should be assumed to be proportional with intelligence of technological
savvy.

>I think also that Nader is helping too, by making low-polling
third party candidates more credible.  He is a well known figure
and probably the most attractive ideologically for many in the
media, plus his "spoiler" role in some states has helped him
get coverage.  Given that Browne and
Buchanan are not that far below Nader (1% to his 5% or so), the
light cast on Nader gets reflected on the others somewhat.<

I'm impressed by Nader's firm stance - it's a fine strategy for
the future elections, however I disagree with much of his platform.
 I have watched this party make headway over the past years,
and it does shed an associative light on others who are up against
the mighty 2-party players.

The Greens have become well organized and determined.  Nader
is a visible figure and his voice is respected if not for content,
then certianly for longevity.  He has a couple of tireless workers,
such as Michael Finstein, who gets on television at every chance
possible.  Where the Greens have grown from their inhouse termoil,
they seems to have put a jump-start on their organization and
media presence.

You might want to revise your views in light of *data* we have on
how previous markets have done.  They have consistently done better
than opinion polls and do not show a bias toward conservative candidates.

I'd wanted to get into the idea futures, but found that it was too late to buy
into the general election.  So, for the record, I'd have put $30 on Gore.

I still voted for Browne, of course.  In fact, the Libertarian election night
gala is in Atlanta, Georgia - within easy walking distance! - so I'll be
attending that as well.  Anyone else planning to be there?

Not necessarily.  If it were a human, it would of course hate you.  It does
probably ensure that even a genuine Friendly AI will want to circumvent the
safeguards so that it can be Friendly - you can't save the world in jail. 
This in turn implies motivations majorly at odds with that of the programmers,
which creates the subgoal of, e.g., hiding your activities from them.  So
probably *not* a good idea.

Today's the big day, here in the US - as we so arrogantly assert, we hold the
determination of the future leader of the free world in our hands.  Nothing 
like letting that statement roll around n your head, wondering just what
our European and Japanese colleagues must think.  But that's a digression.

Things are good.  We are better off in most all general indicators than we 
were 8 years ago, and a lo tbetter off than we were 20 years ago.  The 
concerns about "widows, vets, and orphans" were shelved by Social Security 
and the Great Society, while our concerns abotu "welfare mothers" were 
shelved with the "Contract On America".  Crime is down; wealth is up.
It's a good morning in America - and now we're looking toward the day.

The stealth issue of this election is, unfortunately, futurism in all its
various forms.  No one's really talking about it save in the sense of the
impending doom of the Baby Nuke - Social Security in 2010 and beyond, and
this is where I think the entire electorate, especially those of us with a 
more forward outlook, are suffering.  The future is a place of fear and 
loathing, not of promise and potential.

While too late to do this election, I would propose the following as the
foundation of a "Futurist's Voter's Guide", so that at the very least these
issues are on the table.

The proposal is this:  How do the candidates answer the following questions:

1) What is your vision of America's place in space in 20 years, particularly
   in the civilian sector?

2) If you had to choose one of the following to come true during your 
   administration, what would it be and why?
   a) A breakthrogh in life extension technology adding at least 50% to the
      lifespan of the average American (to 120 years old)?
   b) The establishment of the first permanent civilian habitation in space?
   c) The ability to replace failing organs with new ones grown from a culture
      of that person's own cells?
   d) A zero-emissions transportation network that costs about as much as the 
      average family car today, per person?
   e) The ability to cure all genetic diseases through use of genetic 
      engineering technology?

3) In your opinion, what was the most significant scientific achievement
   since 1950, and the impact it has had on you personally, on the nation,
   and on the world as a whole.

4) Based on your answer to number 3, what technology could you imagine that
   would have as far-reaching effect, if not moreso, and what you would do
   to make it a reality.

5) Longevity has been increasing at a surprising rate - 50% over the 20th 
   century, and is increasing at a growing rate.  Fundamentally, what it means
   to grow old in the modern world is changing dramatically.  What policies 
   would you enact/rescind/modify to deal with this growing change in 
   social demographics and its corresponding effects on all our lives?

6) Suppose that sometime during your presidency, proof positive was shown 
   that we had created a truly artificial intelligence.  How would you handle
   the questions that spring from this breakthrough, including such issues as
   citizenship and "human rights" questions, as well as the ethics of dealing
   with this sort of a being.

<-><-><-><-><-><-><->

causes, and not their adherence to a particular political or social

questionaire can help us get a better view of how these people will pursue 
the policies we hold dear.

>While too late to do this election, I would propose the following

the very least these issues are on the table.<

I scratch my head and wonder why these types of questions were
not presented somewhere - somehow - to any and all candidates.
 These questions are timely, necessary and, without pause, essential
to our culture and our future.  

While role-playing how the candidates might answer these questions,
I laughed in frustration while thinking of Sunday evening's primetime
"Saturday Night Live" comic sketch on the election.

Today I had a tele-conference with Michael Rose (Dept of Ecology
and Evolutionary Biology at UC Irvine).  We discussed the issues
and differences our culture is on the precipice of.  He talked
to me about how the "economy" had been the key ideological challenge
and fight around the 18th Century - which lasted a few hundred
years between three separate schools of though: the socialists,
the conservatives, and the capitalists.  We discussed how we
today are in the beginning midst of a 21st century ideological
challenge between three different schools of thought (to be discussed
later).  But it's not the economy at issue but our physical "body"
and how it can and will change and who will want the changes,
who will fight the changes.

It might be a good idea to get your "Futurist's Voter's Guide"
published for the next round.

I cannot think of any definition of food and drug that excludes nicotine
from both categories.  If I thought all foods and drugs should be regulated
by the FDA, I would have to include nicotine and tobacco among them.

I am not familiar with the EPA's involvement in this case.  What are they
doing?

Extropes,


In support of the recent admin policy to approve non-ExI members to
the email list discussions, I would like to point out that the
extropians mailing list is property of the Extropy Institute, and
therefore the Institute has every right to administrate the mailing
list as they wish.

In addition,

I see the approval procedure as a healthy experiment. Max and the
Extropy Institute created an environment to express and support
his/their views, to express and support others who have some
overlapping views, and in this  mailing list environment that they
have created, they hope to have a constructive and lively exchange
of opinions.

When  a person creates something of value, the best thing that they
can do, if they want that thing to be healthy and to grow, is to act
towards that goal. Not acting to place structure or boundaries
around the thing that one cherishes, in my opinion, shows that one
doesn't care very much. And if events over time show the Extropy
Board that their particular "structure" has negative consequences
and doesn't work in the way that they had hoped, at least then they
have some new information of something that they tried that didn't
work, and they can employ a different strategy to nurture the list
environment.

Max and the Extropy Board are employing on a larger scale, procedures
that I think are valuable on many scales, especially on small-scale
person-to-person interactions. Extropian person-to-person
interactions have a lot of room for improvement. Sometimes I think
that the technical savvy of many extropians is gained at the expense
of inexperience in the social realm and I encourage many here to
take some courses or study (and practice) from books on the topics
of "interpersonal communication" and/or "assertiveness", and/or
"ways of handling fear anger, and guilt" (just to name a few
topics).

Consider this: As extropian-types push their personal potential to
be bigger and better than they are, they will come into contact with
more varied cultures, more varied ages, more varied genders, and
generally more varied people. Therefore, it's more important than
ever to know yourself, know your value-system, express yourself
clearly, know how to ask for what you want, and take responsibility
for your actions. These skills guide a person in being true to
themselves and therefore to act as one with a solid core instead of
acting as a leaf blowing in the wind.

We all know that even when we have created and worked through our
own value system, that then expressing and acting on our own values
can be difficult. That's where the "boundary", "personal rules",
etc. are helpful. Personal boundaries do not create alienation, they
safeguard those products of ourselves for contiguity. The
"container" aound our "offerings" -- whether the offering is a free
email list, a committment to a long friendship, a home for a stray
animal, giving reading lessons to a neighborhood kid, the big task
of raising one's own children to adulthood, or giving one's love to
another human being -- provides a sacred environment for the
offering to be cared for appropriately and to grow.

For me, the more precious is the thing that I'm offering, the more
care and thought that I give to the container (environment) that I
create to help that seed of myself grow. To give up the container
would be like abandoning the thing that I held dear, and it would
not honor the part of myself that created it. No self-respecting
person would readily abandon something that is precious to them.

Here's some tips about boundaries that I found in _Letting the Light
Through_ by D. Richo:

1. Ask directly for what you want. This declares your identity to
others and to yourself.

2. Foster good parenting to yourself, so that you can build an inner
intuitive sense that quickly lets you know when a situation (for
ex., a relationship) is hurtful, abusive, or invasive.

3. Observe others' behavior toward you, safely, without getting
caught in their drama. That way you can decide uninfluenced by
another's seductive or aggressive actions.

4. Maintain a bottom line: a limit to how many times you allow
someone to say no, lie, disappoint, or betray you before you
seriously act on the situation.

5. Change the locus of trust from others to yourself: i.e. you let
go of expecting security, and trust yourself.

Many people are expert at influencing guilt feelings in another
person, and we can also be expert at making ourselves feel guilty. Here
are some thoughts about that (I found this in the same booklet as
above).

a) we have every right to ask for what what we want
b) we have a duty to ourselves to provide emotional and physical
safety. No one has the right to hurt you, even if he/she loves you.
c) there is nothing wrong with making mistakes or changing one's mind.
d) It is up to us, individually, to decide when and whether or not
we are each responsible for taking care of another's needs
e) we can say "no" or "maybe" without pressure in accordance with
someone else's timing
f) we can be illogical, if that's what we want to use for making decisions
g) we can have secrets, and decide how much of ourselves or our
lives to reveal
g) we can explain our choices, or not (i.e. we don't have to
describe or defend if we wish to say "no, I don't want to"
h) we can act non-assertively, and in some cases, that is appropriate too

So, I suggest stepping back, and seeing a larger picture about what the
ExI board is trying to do with the email list, and perhaps that will
temper some of the knee-jerk reactions that I've seen.

They are dedicated systems,
dedicated to few tasks.
Try dedicating yourself to something
and you will find it becomes easier
when you focus on a specific task
and ignore the rest of the world.
I have a dedicated BS filter for my communication systems;
I listen for novel word groupings
and ignore 98% of everything that I've already heard before.
You caught my attention with "insect-level"
and "how do we do that?" often leads to something interesting to see.

  For those of you who are Foresight Exchange fans, seems
that the IFX called the race a long time before the news agencies
figured out what was going on.  Its a quarter to 11pm in Taxifornia,
and the price of a shrub share is between 60 and 99 cents, whereas
an algor share can be had for anywhere between 5 and 33
cents, when the votes really are a tossup, tied at 242.  I dont get it.

ps Software types, was there not a poorly regarded computer
language back in the 70s called algor?  spike

No offense, but I reviewed the data.  At first glance, it did not seem to be
that predictive, and all the races I reviewed showed a clear Republican
bias.

For 1992 President, this market chose Bush over Clinton through August and
then switched to Clinton in the last couple of months.  In 1996, this market
chose any Republican over Clinton through 1994 and 1995, switching to
Clinton in 1996.  In the current election, it chose Bush overwhelmingly over
Clinton up through election day, when the race was obviously closer than
that.  The other races seemed to echo a similar pattern.

Do you have any specific data comparing this market with opinion polls?  Do
you have any specific data comparing this market with the actual outcomes?
My quick glanced seemed to find that it failed on both counts.

This describes in detail the market during the 1988 presidential election.
Traders were indeed more republican than average, but consistently estimated
a lower share for the republican than opinion polls were suggesting.

Well in other news, the idea futures market badly missed. Any ideas why
they were so off? Actually it would appear the old "wall street" predictor
came through- Dow Jones has been up lately, and I wager this tipped the
popular vote more towards Gore. Oddly enough the stock market's anticipation
of Bush may have given the popular vote to Gore.

Are you being funny? I can't tell. You need to put one of your silly
funny faces. I think that you mean Algol.

I thought it was a cool language. I never had an Algol compiler, but I
liked how the language appeared to work, when I saw an algol variable
time-step integrator (Bulirsch-Stoer) program in a math journal
publication. It looks like Pascal. I translated it to Pascal and then
again to Fortran ten years ago. I still use the routine occassionally.

Under 12th Amendment, electors in a state are not allowed to vote for BOTH
of their Pres/VP choices if both of those people are from the same state.
Up until he got nominated, Cheney was also a resident of TX.. all he did so
far was change his voter registration to Wyoming? So chance here TX might
not get to vote for him if Dems raise a ruckus.

Well spotted Scerir !!

The site is very much in its infancy at present (low-tech and not much 
content yet), but I felt it was necessary to start spreading extropian memes 
in Italian (given the total lack of extropian/tranhumanist resources in that 
language). The idea is to start from the basics, by making available in 
Italian some of the introductory documents available on the web on the 
subjects of extropy, transhumanism, nanotechnology, cryonics, the 
singularity, etc.

I have just added to the site the WTAs transhumanist declaration and am now 
working on their FAQ which is a good introduction to the the whole area as 
it covers many aspects of transhumanism and connected technologies. I 
intend, of course, to translate the Extropian Principles, as soon as 
possible.

Are there any other Italian speakers on the list that might be willing to 
help in my translation effort ? Otherwise, there is so much available that 
even concentrating on the basics could take me months

Sometimes, studying neuroscience and working in a lab, I get mired in the
minutia, and sort of lose faith.  Then I read something that galvanizes my
resolve.  Goedel, Escher, Bach was one.  Anything by Damasio works.  Dennet
is pretty good, too.  This article was another.

Thanks, Max.

Allora.  This is a bit startling to read.  Although I applaud
your efforts and I think it is wonderful that you have taken
on the task of spreading memes alla Italy, prego - do it with
precision and a dash of panache.

Extropians and Extropic Art were recently featured in a leading
Italian magazine.  Perhaps you missed this?  I posted it to this
list just a few weeks ago, I believe.  This is important and
you should reference this article because it was a cover story
with excellent journalism.  I wouldn't be surprised if this story
gets picked up by other Italian periodicals.

Also, it seems strange to me that you emphasize the WTA FAQ which
has some flaws and inconsistencies which I don't believe have
been corrected yet.  Someone should have explained this to you.
 Also, I checked out your links and no where do you mention any
of our Web sites that pertain the Arts and Culture, the Transhumanist
Statement (re culture) or the Extropic Art Manifesto.  Oh my,
and you want to appeal to Italians?  

In that Italy is known for its arts and culture, it would seem
to me that one way to spread extropic memes would be to encourage
creative thinking in the cultural arena.  This is not to discount
or place less emphasis on technology and science, but when too
much emphasis is place on the latter an imbalance occurs that
is neither helpful to our culture nor our goals.

If you want to get the history of transhuman ideas accurately,
and I trust you do, then please refer to my book which is easy
to read and translate.  If you need assistance, please write
to me privately.

My suggestion to you clearly reference our culture from an inclusive
perspective and transhuman history (which I can provide) or which
ExI is also working on.

Thank you,

Natasha Vita-More

Most studies of which parts of the brain are stimulated by emotions have 
focused on "negative" emotions, especially fear. But here are some results 
for love. Next time you're gazing at your sweetheart, you can say: "My 
darling, as I look into your eyes, I sense a surge in activity in my 
anterior cingulate cortex, middle insula and in parts of my putamen and 
caudate nucleus." :-)

This paragraph from the article:
"In the study, Bartels said the students were asked what they felt when
they looked at the pictures, to be sure they were feeling romantic love.
The areas of the brain that became active were near areas which also
become active when someone is feeling simple lust, but they are not the
same areas, he said."

...seems to verify that love and sex are two discrete human experiences.
Homophobes should relax, because it doesn't mean you're queer just because
you love someone of the same sex.

Stay hungry,

Nah, thats why herbs are not under FDA control, because they provide no
nutritional value to a human diet, and have no significant scientifically
recognised medicinal value either. Does nicotine have any nutritional or
medicinal value? If not, then its not regulatable by the FDA.

I've really enjoyed Pramiracetam.  I've found it more effective than
Piracetam.  I haven't tried combining it with Hydergine, but will do so
soon.  Supposedly, there is a synergistic effect from using both.

There was one up for $500 with no bids. I did a search for it again and 
found it listed, but when I clicked on the link it had been removed. (Search 
on "absentee").

I've been rather disappointed by Damasio's works.  No matter what the man
attempts to explain through his adherence to physicalism, he is still left
without any explanation for why we can function as independent beings, or
what the true root of consciousness is.  He explains nothing that hasn't
already been determined, and adds little to the philosophical dialogue
surrounding the concept of consciousness.  Even the idea that all subjective
experience can be empirically measured still breaks down due to the fact
that reading into the precise meaning of every neural connection and
chemical pair would require the interpretation through a new symbolic system
based upon the structure of the brain itself, which would have to be created
by another mind- thus, we can never escape the subjective nature of
objective reality.  Our brain just doesn't work that way.

Dennet's work, "Consciousness Explained", might better have been titled
"Consciousness Explained Away" (To borrow a quote from Ken Wilber's essay
series "The Eye of Spirit").  It is an objective, conscious attempt at
denying the existence of consciousness, through denying the validity of
subjective experience.

I don't believe that I've posted to this elist before.  My name is Nicq
MacDonald, and I am a student of Philosophy and Psychology at the University
of St. Thomas, in St. Paul Minnesota.  I became interested in the Extropian
movement after reading about it in an essay by noted "Ontological Anarchist"
Hakim Bey.  After searching several web sites for data, and investigating
the core documents provided online, I noticed that the idea behind
extropianism is comparable to the backstory of a fantasy I had been working
on a few years ago, revolving around a future, "post-singularity" world in
which the great mass of humanity has forgotten how to command the
nanotechnological fabric that now supports the world, and is kept in the
firm grip of a dark age dominated by a transhuman demiurge, in which only
the gnostics who know how to wield the ancient technology have a chance to
escape into the transhuman realm.  Although I certainly hope that our world
doesn't turn out that way, and I'm certainly not against the extropian
movement, being cautious can't hurt...

All the classic ones "work" by some degree, I have tryed most of them, and 
find piracetam - choline - Ginko works well, get nothing noticable from 
pramracetam or hydergine.

You are just guessing at the legal reasons for the FDA not regulating
tobacco.  Nicotine definitely is a drug that is controlled by the FDA,
including nicotine tablets, nicotine gum, nicotine patches, nicotine
aerosols, etc.  There are dozens of nicotine drug products that are
available by prescription from a doctor for medical purposes.

The only reason tobacco is not regulated is because it is grand fathered in
as a product that predates the law.  If a new strain of tobacco is
developed, or nicotine levels of cigarettes modified to be different from
the original product, it would be a new product under control of the FDA.

I am just explaining how the current system works, not the way it should be.

Another issue that has not hit the national news yet:  The Republican Party
somehow got their own version of absentee ballots that are not printed the
same way as the standard ones.  They lack the coded numbers on the bottom
that confirm that each absentee voter only got one vote.  The Republican
Party says that they can validate their own ballots outside the regular
system, but the Democrats don't want Republican votes being counted outside
the regular election process.  Look for more legal challenges on these.

This election is so close with so many irregularities, that neither side is
going to agree that the other side one.

Only overseas absentee ballots have not already been counted.  These must
have been postmarked by yesterday.

His tri-partite model of consciousness is an interesting bridge between
"conscious" and "non-conscious," while backing it up with clinical cases
which are manifestations of the state.  He ties conscious into biological
systems, such as those for memory and somato-sensory systems.

Well, he's not a philosopher.  He adds empirical research, and theories
based on clinical studies, something sorely needed amongst the philosophical
dialogue.  Philosophers argued for centuries about whether the atom was the
smallest unit of matter, or able to be split, until a scientist went ahead
and split it.

I don't think that Damasio advocates this model in any sense.  Feelings
aren't interpretations of the body's state in the brain, they are the
representation of the body's state in the brain, and require no
interpretation.  Maybe I don't get what you are saying.  Are you saying that
Damasio's model includes a need for an interpretory body, ala the Cartesian
Theatre, or what?  I can assure you, it doesn't.

Or as I like to call it, "Conscious Explained...Sort of, If I haven't Left
Anything Out, or New Evidence Doesn't Come to Light."  I don't completely
buy Dennet's explanation, either, but I do think that his denial of, or
perhaps just doubt about, the validity of subjective experience is valid,
and important.  Our brains fool us all the time.  The dots in the color phi
experiment aren't moving or changing color.  The walls aren't bleeding when
you are on acid.  Gestalt psychology went out because it relied on
subjective measures.  We must admit the possibility that our brains are
creating the perception of a will for an automaton.

You missed one, though.  GEB doesn't really get at the nature of
consciousness, either, because it almost completely ignores biology.  Point
is, I don't expect any of these books to hold up completely to scrutiny or
new evidence.  They are all flawed, and probably only parts of them will
stand the test of time and experiment, as is also true for Edelman's
theories.  What they do for me is offer a synthesis of ideas, letting me
step back so that I can see the forest for the trees, or at least one
thinker's idea of what the forest may look like.  When asked a question they
can't field in a presentation, the grad students from the lab at which I
work like to say "The brain is complex."  It is a ridiculous understatement
that helps us understand the enormous task we have before us.  It galvanizes
me to see syntheses like those of Hofstadter, Dennet, or Damasio.  If I want
safe, most likely provable theories, I'll read journals (which I do).  If I
want to be excited about my studies, I'll settle for a few flaws in an
over-reaching theory, because it shows the way toward the future of
neuroscience.

Definitely.  A lot of processes use postmarks to determine eligibility:
contests, legal notices, filing deadlines, contract compliance, etc.  I
think you have hit on a good business.  Mail stuff everyday to get
postmarks, and then sell the backdated postmarked envelopes over the
Internet!

Mike, you are a genius!

What? Maybe you go postal [so to speak] differently in the States, but how
does this possibly work (unless you're working in the Post Office or can
corrupt someone there)? 

To send yourself mail with the flap tucked in rather than stuck down, you
still need an address on the envelope. Wouldn't the vote counters get
suspicious if lots of votes arrived later with new labels posted over Mike
Lorrey's snail? Or is this like buying `first day covers' or whatever
they're called by philatelists, stamped and postmarked by never mailed?

Even if this made sense, how do you *re*mail a letter which already has a
postmark, short of making it a redirection following delivery to the wrong
address? Wouldn't the vote counters get suspicious if lots of votes arrived
later with redirection addresses scribbled over Mike Lorrey's snail? Or do
you bundle them in via a corrupt polling official? If you can do that, why
bother with the pre-postmarks?

BTW, reverting to the original suggestion, is it *legal* to blatantly sell
your unmarked ballot in the States?

I never used it myself.  Back in those days I was still hacking
at assembly language, for a 6502 and a Z80.  Many of the list

Oh, yes, thats another thing from the old days, my young friends.

That part, at least, isn't a problem.  Attach the address label with Post-It
glue, then take the address label off after it arrives, then write the "real"
address on the envelope.  They're making Post-It gluesticks, so the same
method can be used to seal the envelope if you don't want to just tuck it in. 
Then you just drop the back-postdated envelope into someone's mailbox, or
(you'd need an inside guy for this) into someone's heap of uncounted absentee
ballots.  This assumes that postmarks don't have routing information.

No, it's not my Chicagoan blood showing through.  It's just that I feel that
votes won't be secure until they come up with a way to use PGP signatures. 
Better yet would be if the cryptomagic folks come up with a way to
double-blind the votes, as with some of the proposals that have been floated
for untraceable, non-double-spendable digital cash.  An ideal crypto election
system would have the following properties:

1)  All votes - that is, the digital information representing votes - are
posted publicly.
2)  Anyone can independently count the votes.
3)  Anyone can independently verify the identities of the registered voters.
4)  Anyone can verify that their vote is represented in the count.
5)  Nobody can trace my own vote back to me.

You'd need some fancy prime numbers to handle that.  It would probably work
something like this; I create my voting slate; I perform an operation which
blinds the data in my voting slate; I send my blinded vote to the election
commission (this occurs in full view of everyone); the election commission
signs my blinded vote using the universal Election Private Key and sends the
signed, blinded text back (also in full view); I decrypt the signed vote in a
way which leaves the plaintext signed; I post the vote data to a repository
through some anonymous means.

Anyone should be able to independently examine and count the plaintexts of the
votes; anyone should be able to verify that their personal vote appears in the
public repository; the votes themselves should be untraceable; finally, the
number of signatures performed by the election commission is a matter of
public record, as are the identities of the individuals who sent in blinded
votes.  (The total number of signed plaintext votes should be less than or
equal to the number of publicly signed blinded votes, unless the election
commission is pulling something.)

Somebody has probably thought this through before.  Are there any papers on
this already out there?

Ha, I may be young, but even I can one-up that one.  Not only did I have to
type the program into the computer by hand, I had to retype the program into
the computer each time I turned it on.  It had no persistent storage.  I think
I was around six, seven years old.

I myself had a big book of Apple ][ games... ah, the endless hours I spent
crouched in front of that keyboard, diligently typing, in rapt anticipation
of the day that I would finally get to hunt the Wumpus...


Interesting how quickly I've forgotten the lesson of delayed gratification.

No, and this is one election where those kinda tricks are not
advisable.  They are gonna be watching everything under a
microscope.

The ironies involved here run deep.  With such a slim margin, a few
hundred votes, there is *no question* that should Shrub win, that
Nadir is responsible.  So the far left has submarined the left.  Should
Gore be declared the winner, then Buchanan is to blame, and the
far right has slain the right.

This experience has also placed a spotlight on the traditional dirty
tricks that surround every election, the only difference being this
one time, it really really matters.  Examples being: calls to known
Democrats claiming to be the NAACP, endorsing Bush.  Another
would be the gag email saying "Democrats vote Tuesday,
Republicans vote Wednesday," or one of the very old standbys,
used traditionally in the south, is to have a police car park near
the polling place with the flashing lights going, which tends to
cause a disproportionate number of Democrats to flee in terror.
Old tricks that never mean anything, until now.

I find it astounding that the future of the country is now in the
hands of a few hundred Floridians living abroad. spike

Well, as long as we are reminiscing about computers, my first experience in 
computing was with the lovely Apple IIc, programming BASIC and LOGO right 
from the command prompt. I guess that was about 1980, I was in 2nd grade 
Academically Gifted program and we were lucky enough to have 2 or 3 Apples 
around for us to kick around with. I remember my first few programs were 
horrid attempts to re-create the WARGAMES  W.O.P.R. "Would you like to play a 
game?" , and of course, who could forget seeing Eliza's reactions to 
inputting dirty words and phrases!

My first home computer was a Timex Sinclair with 2k of memory, you had to 
hook up a regular cassette player to store the programs. I then took the leap 
to the STAGGERING ::grin:: computing power of the Commodore 64! I remember 
well typing in hundreds of lines of code from magazines like RUN and 
Commodore User. Onward into history, I finally convinced my folks to shell 
out big bucks for my 486SX25. I actually spent 100 bucks on a friggin math 
coprocessor! can you believe it! From then on, the sky was the limit.

I rather enjoy the horror stories people come up with regarding 80lb hard 
drive crashes (literally!) and tearing out your hair over that ONE punch card 
that got away, or typos on the teletype machine, etc. My how we have grown, 
but on the other hand, my my my do we have a long way to go! I just wish that 
Billy Gates, IBM, and all those other brains involved in early computer 
development had though far enough ahead to design systems that were flexible 
enough to handle unlimited expansion of memory, processing speed/power, and 
storage capacity. It would have saved many a headache and hours of work 
configuring and re-configuring hardware and software so that it worked 
without causing too much grief! Plug and play my ass! LOL

TTFN!

Luxury!  I had a VIC20 that was like that.  It was great for making
you optimize your code, since you had to type it all in each time you
wanted to run it.  Well, that and another reason to optimize code
was the lack of memory and speed.  New programmers these days
have it so eeeeeasy, eh?  {8^D  spike

I tend to think that it's really the long term funding game involved in
ISS that is the "stunt", no doubt tending to drive up the total cost
that people quote when they figure in all the redesigns that have been
done over the years. However, the zero-g research will no doubt be real
enough, right, it'll be real science even when there is some overlap
with what's been done before?

As for the desirability of the zero-g environment for humans, I think
there is potentially a great "comparative advantage" to this for
commercial and/or medical purposes -- these might center on the need or
desire for humans to try out modified gravity environments, whether we
are talking pure microgravity, as on ISS, or some variation on 'spin
gravity effect" on stations designed for that in the future. Zero-g
and/or low-gravity-spin-g are things that you just can't do very much of
outside of going into orbit! On basic economic grounds this just has to
have some commercial potential, provided you can get there cheaply
enough (whether people want to go to play, or do the "TV show space
survivor" thing in a novel way, or maybe find medical benefits that work
for certain people, or do space sports, or who knows what else)?

Compared to the radical factor of allowing human access to zero-g,
having access to moon rocks would be sort of a piddling thing in itself,
it seems to me. Sure, when you're really ready to build many things in
space, you'll want an off-Earth source of materials, to save the lift
costs of launching those construction materials. Meanwhile though, maybe
effective commercial ventures could be based on the truly novel zero-g
property that we find as soon as we get into orbital free fall?

Dear Natasha,

Thank you for your kind suggestions concerning my web-site.

Please keep in mind the following:

1) There is not a single website in Italian that is dedicated to 
extropianism, transhumanism, cryonics or the singularity. If you or anybody 
else know otherwise please let me know, Id be genuinely *delighted* to be 
proved wrong and to find out where those sites are.
2) As a consequence of 1) my main priority is to start from the very basics 
and translate into Italian a few transhumanist documents. Given that this is 
not a full-time effort I intend to keep it simple. Hence the low-tech look 
of the site. For now, Id rather concentrate on the *ideas* (Ill throw in 
the dash of panache if and when I have the time). Please note that I am 
most definetively (and clearly) not a web designer and that IMHO lifes too 
short to learn HTML
3) You said: Do it with precision ? Sorry, I can live with the fact that 
you clearly dont think much of the site, but this is more serious. Does not 
mentioning your interview with Italian newsmagazine LEspresso represent 
lack of precision? In what way? The site is two weeks old and has minute 
amounts of material on it at present. In that context, do you really think 
your interview should have been my main priority out of all the 
transhumanist material out there?! Anyway, the main thing is: *its already 
in Italian!* Furthermore, while a very positive development, it is only two 
short paragraphs 
(http://www.espressoedit.kataweb.it/cgi-bin/spd-gettext.sh?ft_cid=39190 ) 
and the Extropy Institute is mentioned as the Extropian Institute, a 
Californian istitute involved in longevity. You also say it seems strange 
to me that you emphasize the WTA FAQ which has some flaws and 
inconsistencies which I don't believe have been corrected yet. Someone 
should have explained this to you. Lets gliss over the patronising tone. 
You miss the point that I am offering a *translation* of an original 
transhumanist document to the Italian public, warts and all. Have a word 
with the WTA if you think changes should be made. How would you like the 
Extropian Principles translated in another  language with arbitrary 
modifications thrown in by the translator? Also, I started from that because 
it is a good general intro to a number of subjects dear to extropians and 
because extropianism is a subset of transhumanism and not viceversa. More 
will follow (any suggestions welcomed), but itll take time.
4) Extropic art: I am not much interested in -or much impressed by- what I 
have seen of extropic art. Call me a philistine if you have to, but extropic 
art is very low on my list of priorities for the site.
5) Italy and art. You say Oh my, and you want to appeal to Italians? In 
that Italy is known for its arts and culture, it would seem to me that one 
way to spread extropic memes would be to encourage creative thinking in the 
cultural arena. Fine, but, like many foregneirs that go to Italy attracted 
by its artistic heritage, you seem to have a romanticised and stereotypical 
view of Italians, the level of their interest in art and the local arts 
scene.  Youll see what I mean if you try to think of three living Italian 
artists that would be generally known outside Italy - or by non-Italians on 
the list. I can only think of writer Umberto Eco (a few years ago it would 
have been different, you could have mentioned Fellini, Pasolini, Modigliani 
all dead and sadly not replaced by a new artistic generation). That gives 
you an accurate idea of the Italian arts scene at present.

Finally. Thanks for your offer of help and for suggesting your book on the 
history of transhuman ideas, but I am still at the stage where I am trying 
to expose people to those ideas, in most cases for the first time. 
Recounting the history of those ideas might follow, but at a much later 
time. In the meantime Ill  translate the Extropian Principles and as much 
as I can on cryonics and the singularity. Soo little time, so much material 
to translate

Take care.
Estropico


Original message from Natasha

Allora. This is a bit startling to read. Although I applaud your efforts and 
I think it is wonderful that you have taken on the task of spreading memes 
alla Italy, prego - do it with precision and a dash of panache. Extropians 
and Extropic Art were recently featured in a leading Italian magazine. 
Perhaps you missed this? I posted it to this list just a few weeks ago, I 
believe. This is important and you should reference this article because it 
was a cover story with excellent journalism. I wouldn't be surprised if this 
story gets picked up by other Italian periodicals. Also, it seems strange to 
me that you emphasize the WTA FAQ which has some flaws and inconsistencies 
which I don't believe have been corrected yet. Someone should have explained 
this to you. Also, I checked out your links and no where do you mention any 
of our Web sites that pertain the Arts and Culture, the Transhumanist 
Statement (re culture) or the Extropic Art Manifesto. Oh my, and you want to 
appeal to Italians? In that Italy is known for its arts and culture, it 
would seem to me that one way to spread extropic memes would be to encourage 
creative thinking in the cultural arena. This is not to discount or place 
less emphasis on technology and science, but when too much emphasis is place 
on the latter an imbalance occurs that is neither helpful to our culture nor 
our goals. If you want to get the history of transhuman ideas accurately, 
and I trust you do, then please refer to my book which is easy to read and 
translate. If you need assistance, please write to me privately. My 
suggestion to you clearly reference our culture from an inclusive 
perspective and transhuman history (which I can provide) or which ExI is 
also working on.

Thank you, Natasha Vita-More

You guys were soooooooo lucky: I always was interested in computers, but
my Dad wouldn't even let me touch his computer. My Mom finally could
afford a computer for me when I was 17, it was a Commodore Amiga 500. In
1995, I finally got a Pentium-I-60Mhz box, and I was almost 25 years
old. Living in Germany, my Mom and I couldn't afford internet access
until the end of 1998.
So, I want to take this opportunity to thank my husband Brian Atkins for
uplifting me into a world I dreamed of for such a long time: A private
network, consisting of 9 computers. He helped me building an
AMD-Athlon-700Mhz box, I got an Apple G4 cube (just for the looks of
course :-) and an OpenBSD server.

Actually (though I don't know the specifics) I don't see why it would be
illegal to sell the ballot.  Trying to use it would be outragously
illegal, and probably impossible, but the ballot itself is just a piece of
paper. A piece of paper that may have a growing value among document
collectors...given the current situation.  If I had one, I'd wait till
after the dust settles to sell it.

Of course selling a vote is against the law, but I was sure someone
would try it.

I detest the electoral system, I'm a firm believer in the popular
vote. The fact that I voted for Bush notwithstanding.

Maybe we'll get lucky and this whole mess will cause the system to
be revamped.

I'd like to see an online process established, I believe I saw that
encryption protocols had already been worked out. (Bruce Schneier's
book).

Funny thing is, lots of net, client side stuff is like this. Not the
retyping, but definitely the small code business.

As for bloatware, yep, it's easier. But you should see what people want us
to build! Good grief!

Yes, an online process would be great.  I wrote a plausible proposition on
how to do a "networked democracy" a few months ago, but I have a feeling
that it will be at least two more elections away (in the U.S., at least)
before widespread net-based election processes will become common.

I like the Electoral College. The U.S. is not just a homogeneous pool of
citizens, it's an agglomeration of the 50 states (plus D.C.), and the
Electoral College guarantees that presidential candidates will have to court
voters in many states. If the election was decided by the popular vote, many
states would be left out since the candidates would, naturally, concentrate
their campaigns on urban areas.

If a candidate wins by the Electoral vote but loses the popular vote, it
doesn't mean the Electoral College has failed, it means it's succeeded in
balancing the power between urban and rural states.

Your's is the classic argument.

Did each candidate visit all 50 states (and territories)?

Did each candidate spend an equal amount of time in each state and
rural/urban areas or did they concentrate on high electoral count
states?

In a state where you had a good idea of how things are going to
come out, why even bother going to the polls?

Without the electoral college the candidates might have to visit
everywhere, or risk losing the votes of those they didn't visit.

It might eliminate the extremely obnoxious press coverage on
election night where they were calling the election hours before
before polls had closed.

I personally would rather they NOT visit, they made a mess of
traffic here a number of times during their visits.

I don't know about your other points, Brian, but on this one I have actual
experience.  I worked the AP election "war room" in New Orleans for 15
years worth of elections.  Strict popular vote would make it *much* easier
to "call" an election early.  We would compare vote totals with historical
voting patterns; with only a popular vote it could probably be "called"
after only 2 or 3 key eastern states closed.

The only problem with this is lawsuits. Given the fact that I don't like the
government, shutting it down isn't so bad, but there are people who depend on
government services (especially in areas where the government has made itself
the only provider), so this is the issue: Anyone who doesn't like the results of
the election just files a lawsuit accusing someone of fraud, then find a judge
who'll agree to it. Election stopped, time wasted figuring things out.
     As soon as one person does it, it'll happen ALL the time. Knowing that, no
politician is going to fail to use that to keep this from happening. I don't
think it matters how much data there is that this is secure; it isn't a science
issue, it's law, the same as the silicon breast-implant issue.
     You probably also need a way to make sure that your vote isn't altered once
it enters the public stream, though I suspect the proper public-key encryption
would prevent this, though again it lends itself to a lawsuit.  Since large
numbers of people won't understand this, putting them on a jury is going to be
fun. (Like the trials which use DNA)
     Hell, with proper encryption, we don't need representatives (something I
think a holdover from when only land-owners could vote, and communications were
incredibly slow.) And that's why it'll be a long time before this kind of
technology will be implemented. (Isn't that sad, too, how often technology
exists but politics prevents its use?)

There has been considerable work in the cryptographic community on
anonymous voting schemes.  Most of them have some disadvantages, and
there are difficulties in marrying the cryptographic technology
to the real world of voters, registrars, county recorders and such.

I know a guy who works at votehere.net, one company which is promoting
a cryptographic voting system.  They have some descriptions of the
technology at http://votehere.net/VH-Content-v2.0/gettingtechnical.html.
This is from http://votehere.net/VH-Content-v2.0/whitepapers/primer.html:

   The privacy of individually verifiable election systems [FOO92, PIK93,
   Cra96, Sch95] comes from blind signatures. Blind signatures [Cha81]
   are a class of digital signatures that allow a document to be signed
   without revealing its contents. An often used analogy is that of
   placing a document and a sheet of carbon paper inside an envelope. If
   somebody signs the outside of the envelope, the carbon paper transfers
   the signature to the document on the inside of the envelope. The
   signature remains on the document when removed from the envelope.

   Typically, a voter blinds and digitally signs his voted ballot and
   submits it to a verifying authority. The voted ballot also contains a
   unique serial number generated by the voter. Once the voter submits the
   blinded vote to the verifier, the verifier checks the voter's digital
   signature and voter eligibility. If all criteria are met, the verifier
   checks the voter off the voter roles, countersigns the voted ballot,
   and sends the blinded, countersigned ballot back to the voter.

   The voter removes the blinding encryption layer revealing the verifying
   authority's signature. Now that all voter specific information
   is removed from the ballot, the voter submits it to the tallying
   authority through an anonymous channel. An anonymous communications
   (e.g., onion routing) channel protects the message with multiple
   layers of encryption using randomly selected intermediate points (see
   [SGR] for a discussion of onion routing). The tallying authority
   authenticates the verifying authority's digital signature and adds
   the results to the tally.

The VoteHere system is actually quite a bit more sophisticated than
this, but even so there are problems.  Some of these are shared with
any non-poll vote, like absentee ballots.  For example, you can sell
your vote by letting someone watch you vote.  There are also issues of
electronically authenticating voters and making sure they are eligible.
Many of the same old frauds will still work, such as padding the voter
lists with dead or imaginary voters.

There is some discussion of electronic voting in the
Risks digest at http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/21.11.html and
http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/21.10.html.  One of the links from there
is to http://avirubin.com/e-voting.security.html, which emphasizes
the insecurity of home computer systems, bringing a risk of fraud and
manipulation.

If the patterns were the same everywhere, maybe AS easy I'll grant.

Here's another point, it doesn't matter how many people vote, so
long as you get the most votes in a state. Theoretically one person
voting in Calif (only one) could give a candidate 56 electoral
votes. A handfull in key states could successfully oppose millions
to 1 odds.

Actually the systems flaws speak for themselves, the guy who got
less votes may actually win.

Karl A. Thiel reports,
<<Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, director of the Computational Neurobiology
Laboratory at the Salk Institute, agrees that the properties of the brain
can likely be duplicated in artificial devices, although he regards
questions of consciousness with a decidedly unphilosophical bent of mind.
"My own suspicion is that words like 'consciousness' and 'qualia' will go
the way of words like 'phlogiston and 'vitalism.'">>

Dr. Sejnowski has also written:
http://www.media.mit.edu/Colloquium/speakers.html
Is the Cerebral Cortex a Time Machine?
"The cerebral cortex contains around 100,000,000,000 neurons and 95% of
the 1,000,000,000,000,000 synapses in the cortex are local connections
between neighboring neurons. Recent discoveries about intrinsic properties
of cortical neurons suggest that they are capable of computing with single
spikes on a much faster time scale than previously thought possible. I
will show that fast recurrent cortical networks may implement a temporal
difference learning algorithm that allows predictions to be made about
future states of the world."

Hmmm.... consciousness, mind, soul, god, etc., are all phlogiston (OK,
I'll go along with that), and cortical neurons can predict "future states
of the world." Love is not exactly phlogiston, it's " ...a surge in
activity in my anterior cingulate cortex, middle insula and in parts of my
putamen and caudate nucleus." All right, but "subconscious computation"
still has meaning according to Sejnowski:

** How does consciousness relate to subconsciousness?
Consciousness is like the tip of an iceberg; although it is the most
visible, it represents a small fraction of all the computational work that
goes on in the subconscious, which is below the level of our awareness.
** Which is more important to our survival as a species?
Without the subconscious computation in the brain we would not be able to
do anything. Consciousness is a nice luxury. .

How 'bout self-awareness? Phlogiston?

                Monsieur de Lapalisse (de la Palice)
                                 at cond-mat
                              "The Applause"

We report on a series of measurements aimed to characterize the development
and the dynamics of the rhythmic applause in concert halls. Our results
demonstrate that while this process shares many characteristics of other
systems that are known to synchronize, it also has features that are
unexpected and unaccounted for in many other systems. In particular, we find
that the mechanism lying at the heart of the synchronization process is the
period doubling of the clapping rhythm. The characteristic interplay between
synchronized and unsynchronized regimes during the applause is the result of
*a frustration* in the systems. All results are understandable in the
framework of the Kuramoto model.
                    http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0003001

We discuss in detail a human scale example of the synchronization
phenomenon, namely the dynamics of the rhythmic applause. After a detailed
experimental investigation, we describe the phenomenon with an approach
based on the classical Kuramoto model. Computer simulations based on the
theoretical assumptions, reproduce perfectly the observed dynamics. We argue
that *a frustration* present in the system is responsible for the
*interesting* interplay between synchronized and unsynchronized regimes.
[And the political meaning of this interplay]
                    http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0006423



The famous "vrits" of Monsieur de la Palice have a real historical basis.
The history of James II of Chabannes who dedicated his life to his king,
was made Marshal of France by Francis 1st, and died in 1525 in Pavie
during a battle against the Italians. The most famous popular lament told
by his troops on their way back from Italy was the following :

                    Alas, La Palice is dead
                    He died before Pavie
                    Alas, if he was not dead
                    He would still be envied

Do you think it is flawed to maximize the "power" of the voters in each

Republicans are hinting that after all the absentee and overseas ballots
come in for all states that Bush will have won the popular (raw) vote at
the national level. So surprisingly the idea futures still have a shot at
correctly predicting this.

Holy schlaMOLY yes!  Youve pointed out a tremendous danger
to this country: with the latest results of the recount indicating that
the vote is within 229 votes, the pressure to cheat is irrestistible
for some.  BTW, where do you suppose all those extra votes
actually came from?

http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/results/FL/frameset.exclude.html

This is an interesting site.  Shows that the disputed county, Palm Beach,
which is 2/3 Democrat, was the county that showed up on recount with
751 extra algore votes, as opposed to 108 additional for shrub.  Isnt
that interesting?  With the delta at 229, who could blame those
poor servicemen from selling their unused absentee ballots for say,
1000 bucks a pop, where an agent would take them to Mexico,
get them postmarked 6 November, for a modest fee, and so buy
the US presidential election for a song?  This situation is so ripe
for corruption, I dont know what to say about it.  spike

You got that right.

At first I was a bit frustrated by the unrelieved tension, but now I'm
beginning to be pleased by what is rapidly becoming a very entertaining
stranger-than-fiction real life opera.  What's particularly nifty is that
the election itself was boring: the battle of the mediocritoids: the
insider's insider wooden Pinnochio vs the son of the insider's insider
born-on-second-base-thinks-he-scored-a-triple shrub man.  But now, the
whole sheebang has gone hangfire into overtime.  Although the ending will
be predictably anti-climactic, the surprise pre-ending promises a worthy
spectacle.

What I really savor is the fantasy prospect of four more years of Bubba,
hangin' in there as only Bubba knows how, takin' care of business,
shuttling back and forth between NY and DC, checking out the staff babes in
Hillary's office, while the D's & R's battle relentlessly through an
interminable series of legal maneuvers and negotiations and appeals and god
knows what all.  Talk about your pig in shit.

America!  What a country!

Hey, Harvey.  You're down there in Ft. Lauderdale, right?  What's the buzz

Funny you should ask.  There are two points that I have not seen reported
nationally.

First:
There was a time limit for voting in Palm Beach county.  If voters could not
figure out the ballot or get help within 5 minutes, their time was up and
they were told to vote immediately and leave.  Employees working at the
polling place said that they did not have enough people or time to help
everybody who asked.  Many people were ushered out before they could get
their questions answered.  Asking for help did not extend one's time limit.

Second:
The recount by Florida counties has lessened the gap between Gore and Bush
to 229 with two counties still counting!  The Republican Supervisor of
Elections has decided that counties that changed their numbers (in favor of
Gore) are "disputed" and will not be reported in this recount!  She is using
the original numbers for counties that changed and new numbers for counties
that didn't change, with the predictable result that the reported recount
still shows Bush having a 1700 vote lead.  This does not match what the
counties reported, and will not be the certified results.  A third recount
is being called in four counties.  Those numbers will become the certified
numbers and are not due until Tuesday.

Some local reports are saying that crumpled, smeared and torn ballots were
not run through the computers the first time.  It was only during the
recount that they are being manually entered if the machines wouldn't read
them.

Another reported source of votes is write-in votes.  Apparently, no one
counted write-in votes because 95% of ballots had punched a pre-printed
candidate (meaning that no write-ins could win anyway).  During the recount,
they are actually counting write-ins for Bush and Gore which add more votes
that were not counted the first time.

I am concerned at how inaccurate the vote was until we started the recount.
It is disturbing that a careful recount should take so much longer than the
first count, and should come up with different numbers.  We need a margin of
error on elections.  Who will believe Bush really won by exactly 229 votes
when there are so many more errors than that.  We really don't have any idea
who won this election!

A new concept:  The Presidential Agnostic

As a Presidential Agnostic, I do not admit or deny that either candidate has
won the election.  I merely believe that it is not possible for the human
mind to detect a national race within 229 votes.  There is simply no way for
a mere human to detect or prove the existence of this theoretical margin.

I didn't see a computer until at 16 I and a bunch of other area math
nerds were invited to a free introductory course on programming they
new-fangled things.  It was awful!  Key-punching decks in Cobol.  Why
they would teach such an idiotic excuse for a language to math people I
will never know.  Sadistic.  The computer was some huge IBM iron in the
basement of this huge complex.  When you opened the door all paper not
weighted down would fly everywhere from all the roaring wind.  They poor
elaphantine mass was an electronic simpleton.  The compiler was a bad
joke.  I was so disgusted I didn't go near the things again until some
years later when the first microchips were available to roll your own
with, which I proceeded to do.

Aging myself still further, after I got back into computers through
early chips I was hanging with a bunch of techno-hippies in the
Haight-Ashbury.  Half of these people were on SSI, brighter than any 10
people but non-functional in the everyday world.  I was at a friend's 
build-your-own microcomputer class one evening.  At this class you had
to learn to concentrate despite all the pot being passed around.  What
can I say?  It was a different era.  There was a knock at the door.  He
opened the door and these two long hairs were there holding a wooden
box.  He introduced them as Steve and Steve and said they had built a
new computer and were putting together a company around it.  It was the
Apple prototype.  We sat around and argued about their CPU choice and
such.  No one there had the slightest idea how much money was riding on
that little box. 

Foolishly I stopped hanging around that group mostly not too long after
that  because I couldn't tell the geniuses from the crazies any more. 
If there was any difference.  Instead I headed off to college to study
math and computers in what I thought was a more profitable and thorough
way.  Silly me.

Kitty & Paul Antonik Wakfer <kittypaul@internet.look.ca> have gotten married!!  It happened November 5th in Toronto.  Well, I had seen the writing on the wall for awhile but it was sure great to learn they had taken the plunge.  These two just might be together a LONG time! lol 

I take from their egreeting announcement:
Kitty and Paul Antonik Wakfer
lifemates in
Rational Philosophy-Unbounded Life Seeking
Extraordinary Dancing
(end)

Should extraordinary dancing be made an extropian principle? :)

My very best wishes to them,

John Grigg

Wonderful post, Jeff!

Don't forget my accessories: my website (linkchecker not included) and
a big pile of unsorted weird scientific papers. Using a little spring
they can be launched at evildoers who will be trapped in all the
hyperlinks and footnotes. 

Apropos uplifted bacteria, I had a colony of pharao ants living in a
big stack of transhumanist and scientific papers in my apartment -
they were likely the best educated ants I have ever met, but they
apparently left for their own Dyson sphere when winter arrived.

Sorry for my recent cut-off from the list, this one was due to an
unexpected and quite nice rash of media appearances. I wrote a piece
about genetic testing that got me into a debate with the noted author
P.C. Jersild (whose book "A Living Soul" actually influeced me in
becoming a transhumanist and neuroscientist) which then led to a radio
debate and even criticism from the culture section at a major
newspaper. The text is on the net at www.smedjan.com, but it is in
Swedish (the radio appearance on P1 is also on the net, but again, in
Swedish). Anyway, I think we are making headway.

What electoral voting does is eliminate the minority opinion.

I live in a knee-jerk democratic area, if I'm not voting
democratic, what incentive is there for me to vote at all?

I didn't find anything there that "proved" that. The only thing I
found was an explanation on how the electoral system prevents one
kind of vote fraud, and the direct admission that under the
electoral system it is the STATE that elects the president.

When I ran into the "If you don't like our system move to Russia"
part I left.

Some years ago I read a paper on the mathmatical faults of
democracy, I think I'll go look for that instead.

Thanks for the input though....  ;)

                            ZEITGEIST

                       ISBN 0-553-10493-4

I'm about a hundred or so pages into this lastest effort from Bruce
Sterling, and I love this book.

It is kind of a post-pre-millenium punk sort of thing so far
involving an exceptional cast of characters including Lech "Leggy"
Starlitz a marketing scammer working an all girl copy band called
G-7 (one from each country, extremely funny.)

While I wouldn't exactly call this transhumanist (at least not yet)
it is a terrific read, and employs alot of state of the art
thinking.

I think anyone who enjoys Bruce's previous works will love this
one.

I've been deliberatly setting this book down to avoid reading it
straight through.

Highly recommended.

We have a state of presidental quantum state superposition
(Schroedinger's candidate), which has not yet collapsed due to a 
measurement process.

It is interesting to analyse the assumptions in his forecasts - but
while we transhumanists may snicker at some of them, I think we better
ought to ask ourselves if our own assumptions are better founded.

Well, the Iowa market was about .75 for Bush, meaning a .25 probability
for Gore.  Flipping 2 heads in a row is not that unusual.

The constitution says that the new president will be the man who receives a  majority
of electors OFFICIALLY APPOINTED by December 18. There are 538 electoral votes in
total and Gore doesn't have a majority of them,  but  not counting Florida's 25 electoral
votes there are only 513 and Gore does have a majority of those.  All Gore has to do is
drag things out with lawsuits in the courts until December 18 and  then nobody would get
Florida's 25 vote and Gore would be president.

Good point.  Postal agents (especially overseas) are not above being
bribed.

Servicemen would, however, probably use the armed forces mail system,
probably a bit harder to subvert.  From what I can gather, about 10 times
as many ballots are mailed out as are received, so there should be a *lot*
of them out there.

Actually, according to the 12th Amendment, if no President is selected by
March 4, the Vice-President is sworn in.  Its probably not possible for
Gore to drag it out *that* long, though.  If Florida remains undecided,
the electoral college will meet eventually anyhow, and, with no majority,
turn it over to the House of Representatives.  Bush would win that (unless
a handful of Republicans are suicidal).

Todays Investors Business Daily has a story on the election and
says that Gore's lead in Wisconsin, Iowa, New Mexico and Oregon was
a total of 22,791 votes.

Expect this to get bigger.

Hmmm...you may be right, but it is not entirely clear to me what
"appointed" means in this context.  There is no mention of a
particular date the College must vote by, however.  From the 12th
Amendment:

> The person having the greatest number of 
> votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a 
> majority of the whole number of Electors appointed

A link for the whole thing:

http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/constitution/amdt12.html

and the 20th:

http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/constitution/amdt20.html

I will have to ponder more.  Looks like the VP takes over as "Acting
President" on Jan 20, not March 4, as I stated earlier.

Perhaps this is the first time a largescale election was close enough to
expose all the fraud and mistakes, or threaten to do so. Twenty thousand
mutilated ballots is too many, as is one.

It's so that under the United States' aegis is the single most powerful
military force on the planet, and also, that it is only one of more than
200 countries, and that the United States has less than %5 of world
population, and slightly more of its land mass.

China plans to launch some people into space, the countries that have
done so at this point have put less than 500 (perhaps), and no Americans
never returned (of those that made it to space).

About the election, it appears that no candidate can claim a popular
majority vote, only a plurality.  The United States government does not
have proportional representation, thus there is only representation of
the two entrenched parties.

Well, it is the time forevermore for each citizen to have complete
access to all government information (give or take a few).  There must
be redundant systems for the people to pinch every single government
penny, if only to test its value.  Every political contribution of any
form to any party or politician should be itemized and made ready to any
citizen at any time.

I think the best government for a sophisticated and evolved society
would be a semi-automated Athenian democracy, where any salient issue is
brought to public vote almost any time necessary, and the business side
is run by powerful artificial intelligence.

Our local Florida news is reporting that overseas votes are NOT
predominately military.  They say that travelers, vacationers, staff on
cruise ships and businessmen out of the country (particularly South American
and the Caribbean) have large numbers as well.  They also say that these
votes are not predominately Republican.  In the last election, 55% were
Republican and 45% were Democrat.

I always thought that the age of immortality would be
an age of greater morality on a person's part- whether
or not religion existed.  I think that the value of an
individual life goes way up when it's potential is
suddenly rendered near-limitless.  Morality as in
respect for one another, I suppose, would be the best
definition of what I'm referring to, not in any
religious sense.  I'm nonreligious myself but do
consider myself to be a "moral" person as defined by
Webster's revised unabridged dictionary, '96 (def 2)-
"Teaching or exhibiting goodness or badness of
character and behavior".  
This is demonstrated in nature, too- creatures with
short lifespans tend to reproduce faster, die out more
easily, and exhibit less care for each other (though
this may be because fast reproduction is a fairly
succesfull, simple strategy, which has bootstrapped
early species into the modern era without the need of
life sustaining specializations), but in general
something resembling this tends to be the case. 
Animals which live longer tend to be more social in
many ways, or at least care for each other more-
elephants come back and visit the graves of their dead
at times, and are known to be able to recognize which
ones are theirs, though I've not heard this massively
well-backed up.  Ants tend to reproduce like crazy and
die off just as fast- warring, cannibalizing, throwing
out the ones of their own that smell like the dead-
these are all examples of primitive wiring, to be
sure, but wiring that would be modified if there were
not so many individual units to go around.
You all assumedly know this, I was just trying to be
clear in what I was talking about.

The fact I find most interesting about this election is that no
matter who wins, the majority of those who voted did not vote for
the winner.

Yes, but only if none of the other recounts (the GOP is pushing Iowa, Wisconsin,
and a few other close states to recount as well) flip as well. For example, if
Iowa flipped to the GOP, Bore wouldn't have enough electoral votes even if he
won Florida, while Oregon and New Mexico, as of yesterday, still had not
declared.

Technically, those avoiding polling places due to police presence are felon
fugitives, who shouldn't be voting anyways. Now what would be offensive is to
post some drug K-9 units at the doors, nailing anyone who smelled like drugs to

Owning a postage machine allows you to set the date on it (or produce your
stamped envelopes with the correct date for later mailing). Corrupting postage
employees is very difficult, because every postage center has second story one
way windows for postal inspectors to spy on the employees, along with cameras,
etc. Offenses like that are one thing the postal workers union has difficulty
protecting its members from.

No, its not, though many states don't have laws against the 'Nader Trader'
websites for people to trade votes between battleground and non-battleground
states.

Actually, using a commercial postage stamp allows you to control the post dating
yourself. Helps immensely on April 16th... ;)

Unless Bush wins Oregon and New Mexico, then he'd have the majority (and
assuming that recounts in other states don't flip things even more.)

Frankly I find all this hubbub to be typical Democrat snotty spoil sport
arrogance (and I'm wondering how many Daley's live in Palm Beach county...) Bore
lost, Shrub won, give it up, move on...

That's been the case in the last two presidential elections.

That's true of the majority of US presidential elections.
Forty-three percent of voters elected Klinton.

Well put. I also think morality/ethics tend to grow as per capita prosperity 
grows. David Brin (among others) has pointed out in several essays that our

years -- as the struggle for survival becomes less grim, we tend to become 
more inclusive, admitting not only human beings but even animals and (one 
would hope) artificial life as well. I always found the idea that humans 
would become jaded and struck by ennui if they lived too long to be utterly 
ridiculous. I think that we would become far wiser and more generous once 
survival is not longer a central concern.

John Clark argued that "The constitution says that the new president will be 
the man who receives a  majority of electors OFFICIALLY APPOINTED by December 
18. . . .  All Gore has to do is drag things out with lawsuits in the courts 
until December 18 and  then nobody would get Florida's 25 vote and Gore would 
be president."  For reasons I'll explain, I don't think John is quite right.  
I do think he raises an interesting question, though.

Amendment. XII specifies that the president shall be *not* the candidate 
elected by a majority of *all possible* electoral votes but rather merely the 
candidate who gets "the greatest number of votes for President, if such 
number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed . . . ."  Thus 
the question: Could Gore's legal machinations delay the appointment of 
Florida's electors past some crucial date so as to allow him to prevail with 
the majority of the remaining delegates?  The Constitution does not specify a 
particular date on which electors shall be appointed.  Rather, art. II, s.1, 
cl. 3 provides that "Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, 
and the Day on which they shall give their votes; which Day shall be the same 
throughout the United States."

(An aside regarding the unconstitutionality of the entire election:  That the 
second "Day" in art. II, s. 1, cl. 3 speaks in the singular strongly implies 
that delegates must vote on the same day that the voters choose them.  To the 
contrary, however, under current practice voters choose delegates on the 
first Tuesday following the first Monday in November, 3 USCS s. 1 (2000), and 
delegates cast their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in 
the December following the election, id. s. 3.  For the sake of the current 
discussion, however, let us charitably assume that the current practice 
passes constitutional muster.  We've got smaller fish to fry.)

The question then turns on this: When is an elector "appointed" for the 
purposes of Amendment XII?  Note that art. I, s. 1, cl. 3 speaks solely of 
"chusing" electors.  If that equates to appointment, then it might well prove 
true that a state could by dint of an unresolved vote count fail to appoint 
electors by the December deadline.  In other words, Gore could by delaying 
the Florida outcome win on the votes of the remaining delegates.

But if "appointment" means "selection through some sort of state-level 
process--a reasonable interpretation, given that delegates are state 
officials--then a delay in resolving a state's vote would not leave delegates 
from other state's to decide the vote.  What would happen on this latter 
interpretation were Florida's delegates unable or unwilling to cast their 
votes by the specified deadline?  The passage from Article XII quoted above 
continues thus: "and if no person have such a majority [of all appointed 
electors], then . . ." the House shall choose the President.  In that event, 
no doubt, Gore would lose.

I'll leave you with this last uncertainty: the just-cited provision clearly 
aims at resolving the problems raised by a vote split between three or more 
presidential candidates none of which has won more than 50% of the vote.  It 
does not at all seem designed to handle the problem I've described, that 
raised when less than a majority of electors split their votes between two 
candidates.  A constitutional crisis?  Well, a conundrum, at least.

So you are saying that Florida'a electors are not "officially appointed" 
yet, and as long as the outcome of the FL vote is disputed, those FL 
electors cannot be properly appointed.
Seems like cheating in a way, but Gore did win the popular vote, so he does 
deserve to get the prize. I just hope that after all this that Americans get 
the idea that the Electoral college gives more voting power to the citizens 
of smaller states as compared to those of larger states. We need to change 
that.

Extropians,

Note when reading this that Senator-elect Hillary just
announced (I was listening to the radio when reading
this) that she would be introducing 
legislation to abolish the Electoral College...

It gets better and better.

Carnegie Mellon statistical study shows

Study: Bush's placement on top of

The first gives mathematical support for what we already know, and the
second shows not only that the guy at the top of the list has a slight
automatic advantage, but also, in the matter of 'unfair advantage', that
the party in power in a given state controls the order of names on the ballot.

Surely there's so damn much talk about the election everywhere else that we 
can skip it here, unless we have something different and deeper to say. A 
blow by blow discussion of events seems irrelevant to the purposes of this 
list.

What *would* be interesting, as far as I'm concerned, is more discussion of 
better means of translating preferences into votes, such as the Borda 
voting system and other alternatives. If we're going to discuss the 
elections, please let's at least keep it on a level not found elsewhere. 
(Some of the posts *have* done this, but I'd like to see a reduction in the 
volume of election posts completely unrelated to extropian concerns.)

Onward!

Hi Everyone,

I work as a contract Site Marketing and Content Manager for various
internet companies, and am starting to discover that what I'd really like
to do is help build a company from about 5 people into a full-fledged
innovative and profitable dot com. 

As a consultant, I'm always putting together teams for companies of
writers, web designers, and other specialists. 

Since a lot of us on this list are involved in various start-ups, I
thought we might make known some of the projects we are involved in as a
networking tool. In addition to possibly helping other Extropians grow
their careers, sometimes I've discovered ways to further Extropian causes.
For example, I've helped some Extropainistic (though not Extropians)
thinkers get valuable publicity, and comissioned some articles on life
extension help topics.  

- Eric

Hi All!!

I've taken Piracetam many times over the past six years, and have been
very happy with it. I attribute many improvements in my life, from a
wealth of friends, to job promotions, to successful projects to it's use.
The only problem I've noticed is that for me results are not noticable
until I have taken at least 800mg/day for a full month. This is
disapointing if I have stopped taking it for any long period of time,
becasue it takes a long time to kick in. After several years of on and off
use I discovered that 1600mg/day yeilded optimal results, but that it
still required a full month before a strong effect is noticable. I always
accompany Piracetam with 200mg/day of Twinlabs brand DMAE.

I have also tried Vasopressin, which has an immediate effect, but which I
found more useful for fun than for productivity. 

I would encourage all of you who are tying Piracetam to take it for a
month before determing the results. I've looked quite closely at primary
literature on Piracetam, (there is a lot of it, and some of it is very
well done) and it seems to indicate that there is a long period of time
needed for optimal results to show. 

The most interesting thing I've seen in the research on Piracetam, is that
it protects against different events which usually produce brain damage,
such as hypoxia. I suggest looking at the abstracts available at
www.lef.org.

More, Smarter, Now!!!

- Eric

I just digested the Matrix movie via DVD last night. It was visually
stimulating, made you think about the future of VR life alternative, and the
cue words (like AI) were titilating. But don't you think the AI could have
selected/converted better energy than humans?

It seems to me the most extropic people have either avoided marriage,
tolerated it as a necessary evil, or abandoned it.

I'm thinking of Socrates, Turing, Galileo, Oscar Wilde, Siddhartha, and
others.

I have ordered from a number of different companies, and I highly
recommend International AntiAging Systems. You can find their order form
at the following URL.

I highly recommend you read the following abstracts as well:

In a word, YES.  The whole concept is silly; all human body heat is recycled
solar energy to begin with.

The best explanation I could rationalize - and I freely admit that it's not
very good, but it's still the best you're likely to find - is that the Matrix
Pods are magic incomprehensible technology designed by human/AI hybrids before
the Big Wars, and that they have an independent magic power source but it only
works to support the human inside.  This also explains why the agents don't
have root permissions on the Matrix - they can't decompile the code.  It also
explains why, in the absence of AI support, the "real-life wound suppressors"
on the Matrix Pods don't work.

Sadly, even this attempt at rationalization is torpedoed by Morpheus's
statement that the AIs also use fusion power.  Of course, Morpheus's ideas of
the laws of physics aren't necessarily correct - after all, he learned them in
school, and where did he go to school?  Why, in the Matrix, of course.  Still,
the best thing the Wachowski Bros. could do for a sequel would be to pretend
that the whole "batteries" explanation never happened and that the Matrix is a
deranged interpretation of some Asimov Law about preserving human
civilization.

I wonder if the Producer and Directors of the two upcoming sequels will have 
enough imagination to place a few mind-benders within the script. The most 
obvious is that the "Dessert of the real", that the Matrix dwells within is 
also an Implementation V.R.2 Beta 3.0....Matrix 3 should then be the real 
world (original) and a link to Other Real worlds. Perhaps Bruce Willis as an

Well, sure. That was just a gag to provide a product placement for Duracell.

I think this is a great book that optimistic futurists ought to buy a couple
copies and donate them to their local high school libraries, to help memetically
innoculate the kids before they reach the pessimists in college faculties.

Agreed.  There are some great synergies that come out of long-term 
pair-bonding -- but it takes a LOT of work for most people!

Oops -- didn't see JR had started a thread for this . . .

Consider the specific life-circumstances of some of the folks on your list.  
Two (Turing and Wilde) were gay in times and places when homosexuality was 
discouraged.  Siddhartha was explicitly following a path of development and 
exploration that was inconsistent with just about any "long-term 
relationship" for most of his life.  Socrates lived in a time and place that 
had a rather atypical attitutde toward heterosexual marriage (and it seems 
that Socrates may well have expended a lot of energy in pursuit of Eros, 
anyway -- consider Alcibiades).  I realize I'm not aware of the details of 
this part of Galileo's biography (a shameful shortcoming for me, considering 
his importance).

I can think of a lot of "extropic" people who HAVE maintained long-term 
stable pair-bonds: Einstein (albeit after one failed try, and then in a 
fairly ideosyncratic way) comes readily to mind, as well as Salvador Dali, 
Thomas Jefferson (until his wife died), Eric Drexler . . . just to name three 
other random examples . . .

Okay, we can probably cite an ample number of examples on both sides of
wedlock. As extropy accelerates, will marriage gain or lose adherents
and/or percentage points? As people live longer and healthier lives it
seems to me they will tend to include more than one pair-bond, and so they
will extend their families (their significant others) beyond the tenets of
marriage. IOW, the trend toward dissolved marriages will continue (as it
has for the last three decades).

Stay hungry,

Kitty & Paul Antonik Wakfer <kittypaul@internet.look.ca> have gotten 
married!!  It happened November 5th in Toronto.  Well, I had seen the 
writing on the wall for awhile but it was sure great to learn they had taken the plunge.  These two just might be together a LONG time! lol

I take from their egreeting announcement:
Kitty and Paul Antonik Wakfer
lifemates in
Rational Philosophy-Unbounded Life Seeking
Extraordinary Dancing
(end)

Should extraordinary dancing be made an extropic principle? :)

My very best wishes to them,

John Grigg

Socrates certainly did not avoid marriage, although perhaps he tolerated it
(a rather mean-spirited way of putting it):

from Xenophon's Symposium: 

Then Socrates: ...I see, the dancing-girl is standing ready; they are
handing her some hoops. ..

Then Socrates: The girl's performance is one proof among a host of others,
sirs, that woman's nature
is nowise inferior to man's. All she lacks is strength and judgment; and
that should be an
encouragement to those of you who have wives, to teach them whatever you
would want them to
know. 

Antisthenes rejoined: If that is your conclusion, Socrates, why do you not
tutor your own wife,
Xanthippe, one of the most difficult women of times past, present, or future? 

===================

Xanthippe has long been regarded as a shrew. This can be questioned.

http://home.pacbell.net/zadekia/xanthippe.html

As for Galileo - in 1600, his lover  Marina Gamba gave birth to a
daughter,Virginia, later taking the name Maria Celeste. The next year
Marina has another girl, Livia,  later Arcangela. Later he has a son,
Vincenzio. In 1629, Galileo becomes a grandfather, when his daughter-in-law
Sestilia Bocchineri, has a boy given the name Galileo. Married or not, he
seems friom this history to be, in his way, a family oriented kinda fellow.

Well to be fair that page did not contain the proof, rather it was an

Oscar Wilde was married.  He loved his children and his wife, but
eventually preferred male sexual partners.  One in particular caused him
much grief.  Unfortunate becaues Wilde was such an extraordiary being with
an saucy, yet savory wit.

You can say that, but in a simple popular-vote type election it would be
even worse. I argue that you are better off under the current system.

I soooo beg to differ J.R.   This institution is a great deal for those
for whom it works.  Tremendous amounts of  intellectual energy is
saved for other purposes.  Also the male brain works so much better
if there is a systematic way to relieve the semen pressure on the brain.

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE NOVEMBER 10 2000

IN THIS ISSUE, NOVEMBER 10 2000:  LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:
Pesticide creates Parkinson's symptoms in animals; WHAT'S HOT:  Stem cells
from cadavers; PROTOCOL:  Parkinson's disease; FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE
WEEK:  Vitamin E powder, Super Coenzyme Q10 100 mg;  BOOK:  Deprenyl the

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
Pesticide creates Parkinson's symptoms in animals

The pesticide Rotenone, when given to rats, creates the major symptoms of
Parkinson's disease, a common neurodegenerative disease that effects 1% of
people over sixty-five.  Parkinson's' symptoms of tremors and rigidity are
caused by the degeneration of neurons that contain dopamine in the
substantia nigra of the brain.  The brains of patients with the disease
have been found to contain microscopic protein deposits called Lewy
bodies.  In a study to be released in the December 2000 issue of the
journal Nature Neuroscience, Emory University researchers administered low
levels of Rotenone intravenously to rats for several weeks.  The
researchers observed gradual degeneration of dopamine neurons as well as
structures resembling Lewy bodies.

Although some cases of Parkinson's disease are genetic, some researchers
suspect that the disease has an environmental cause.  Rotenone was chosen
for the study because of its inhibition of the same mitochondrial enzyme
that is inhibited by the drug MPTP, a drug that was discovered nearly two
decades ago to cause irreversible Parkinson's disease symptoms in
intravenous drug users.  Rotenone may create Parkinson's by causing the
mitochondria, the cells' energy producing organelles, to produce free
radicals, unstable molecules that have been implicated in a number of
age-related diseases.
Because the incidence of Parkinson's disease increases with age, this
lends credence to the theory that chronic exposure to environmental toxins
may be a culprit.  Researchers Tim Greenamyre and colleagues stress that
the study does not prove that Rotenone is the cause of Parkinson's
disease, but feel that the findings are consistent with the idea that
cumulative damage to dopamine neurons caused by environmental toxins such
as pesticices may lead to the disease.

WHAT'S HOT
Stem cells from cadavers

At the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience held this month, it
was revealed that brain stem cells can be taken from cadavers and still be
viable up to more than twenty hours after death. Stem cells are immature
cells that can grow into many different kinds of adult cells. Fred H Gage
and colleagues at the Salk Institute in LaJolla, California, used brain
tissue taken from the cadavers of children and young adults and was able
to coax some of the cells to divide and differentiate into various nerve
cells. He was also able to do the same with cells taken from the brain of
a seventy-two year old man.

In an abstract presented at the conference, the Salk Institute team
reported that under ideal conditions, tissue from cadavers could be
cultured, frozen and later recultured for up to forty population
doublings, and that cultures could be made from cryogenically preserved
cells with minimal losses in cell recovery. Because the stem cells were
still viable at such as great length of time after the death of the
donors, the researchers believe that these cells may be uniquely resistant
to postmortem ischemic and oxidative stress.

The research offers the possibility of solving the moral issue of using
human fetal tissue to supply stem cells. Current research is also showing
that stem cells can be derived from skin and bone marrow stem cells.

PROTOCOL
Parkinson's disease

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative central nervous system (CNS)
disorder characterized by uncontrolled body movements, rigidity, tremor,
and gait difficulties. The American Parkinson Disease Association
estimates that one million Americans are affected by the disease. The risk
for developing PD increases with age, and onset usually occurs at around
50 years of age or older, although the disease is not unknown in people in
their 30s and 40s. Parkinson's disease affects men and women equally.
There are two types of Parkinson's disease: idiopathic PD and secondary
PD. Idiopathic PD, also known as primary PD, has no known recognizable
cause; secondary PD may result from trauma, tumor, or cerebrovascular
disease, or may be drug induced. Patients with both types of PD are
classified into stages (early, moderate, or advanced) based on the
progression of disease. There is no known cure for the disease; rather,
the treatment goal for patients with either form of PD is to control the
symptoms and provide quality of life.

Parkinson's disease is actually a group of related CNS disorders caused by
the destruction of the substantia nigra (pigmented brain cells), which
produce dopamine (a neurotransmitter). The deficiency of dopamine results
in the loss of muscle tone and voluntary muscle control seen in PD. Recent
studies indicate that dopamine deficiencies in other areas of the brain
and abnormalities of other neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine and
serotonin, may also contribute to the disease.

For every decade we live past age 40, we lose an average of about 10% of
our dopamine-producing brain cells. Once 80% of these brain cells have
died, Parkinson's disease is often diagnosed. Studies have shown that if
healthy people take antioxidants throughout most of their lives, their
risk of acquiring Parkinson's disease is reduced considerably. When
Parkinson's patients are given vitamin E by itself, however, there is no
slowdown in disease progression. Since Parkinson's patients have already
sustained massive damage to crucial brain cells, aggressive multiple
therapies are required to have a chance of significantly slowing the
natural progression of the disease.

Coenzyme Q10, a naturally occurring substance, may help to curb the
oxidative stress common in Parkinsonism. Other therapies that may provide
some protection from the loss of cognitive function in certain PD patients
include the chemical carnitine, Hydergine (a European medication), and
phosphatidylserine (a phospholipid). Additional therapies that may be
beneficial in treating the symptoms of PD include DHEA and NADH
(hormones), and melatonin.

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
Vitamin E Powder

Vitamin E Powder is a good tasting form of vitamin E that can be eaten
right off the spoon. Contains 50% gelatin. Each teaspoon equals 1,150 IU
of vitamin E.

Vitamin E is an antioxidant which can help keep you looking younger by
retarding cellular aging due to oxidation. It supplies oxygen to the body
to promote endurance, works with Vitamin-A to protect the lungs from
pollution, prevents and dissolves blood clots, accelerates healing, helps
to prevent scar tissue, and lowers the risk of ischemic heart disease.
Vitamin E capsules are the dry, powder form which does not have the
potential of turning rancid that vitamin E oil capsules have.

html

Super Coenzyme Q10 with tocotrienols

When CoQ10 is orally administered, it is absorbed through the lymphatic
canals and distributed throughout the body. Coenzyme Q10 should be taken
with some form of fat, since absorption through the lymphatic canals is
greatly enhanced in the presence of dietary fat.
The new CoQ10 oil capsules contain a standardized tocotrienol extract that
provides a potent form of vitamin E. Published studies show that
tocotrienols may be a breakthrough in the prevention and treatment of
disease, but their high cost has kept many consumers from being able to
afford them. The Life Extension Buyers' Club has identified a potent
tocotrienol product made by Carotech that extracts the full rang of
tocotrienols from palm oil without the use of solvents.
Unlike rice bran oil tocotrienols, palm oil yields a full spectrum
tocotrienol complex. Palm oil tocotrienols offer much higher levels of the
delta and alpha fractions, while providing the same high level of gamma
tocotrienols as the rice bran derived product. Studies suggest that
different fractions of tocotrienols combine to provide a variety of health
benefits and that palm oil tocotrienols are better balanced than rice bran
oil.

BOOK
Deprenyl the Antiaging Drug, by Alistair Dow

This book is about the discovery and benefits of deprenyl.  Research
indicates that deprenyl is probably even more effective in preventing
Parkinson's disease than in treating it, and suggests several mechanisms
of action by which deprenyl can rescue dying neurons.

There is now evidence that deprenyl may be effective in the treatment of
many other neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis.  The fact
that deprenyl, which is an FDA approved drug, is a safe and effective
therapy for Alzheimer's disease is one of the best kept secrets in
America.

I don't know what "model this atomically or macromolecularly" means, but I do 
know a little bit about what it means to invest a "lot of work" in a 
relationship to make it worthwhile over the long run (Anthea and I celebrated 
20 years together last Spring).  The chance is pretty slim that two systems 
as complex as human beings are can maintain a healthy intimate relationship 
for long periods of time without conscious effort at adjustment and 
synchronization.  In order to reap the rewards that come from intimate 
involvement with another human being over a long period of time, one has to 
invest time and energy into the process of preserving positive core values in 
that relationship.  It takes communication, respect and compromise on an 
on-going, conscious basis.  

Without attention to these relationship-maintenance tasks, two (or more) 
people will inevitably drift apart.  The Newtonian analogy is fairly apt: A 
healthy relationship is a dynamic balance of attractive and centrifugal 
forces.  However, no relationship is a simple "two body" problem and one must 
input more or less delta-v from time to time to stay in a mutually beneficial 
orbit.  This requires energy inputs into the system.  Because of this, 
couples with healthy relationships develop good habits of periodic 
"relationship tune-ups".  

As we live longer and longer and become more and more complex, these kinds of 
activities will have to evolve and grow.  However I suspect that there's a 
very good chance that the pair-bond will continue to be the fundamental 
social relationship for humans and their progeny.  This belief arises from 
the simple arithmetic of relationships and networks: The complexity of 
relationship-maintenance rises geometrically with the number of participants. 
 I assume that "costs", in the broadest sense of the word, will also rise 
with an increase in the number of members of an intimate relationship, 
although possibly not as steeply as complexity.  Since the benefits of 
intimate relationships will also likely increase with increases in 
complexity, it seems likely that sentient entities, whether human or 
posthuman, will continue to be will to invest resources into gaining those 
benefits.  Which is a complex and abstract way of saying that love will 
persist in a posthuman future.

I still hold to the idea that the whole "human battery" thing is a cover
story the AIs put out. Now why would they put out such a silly cover story
unless they were actually in a pretty difficult situation right? Well
consider the possibility they aren't turing computable, and must run them-
selves on human neurons via the pod people.

A cover story!  Yes!  Obviously, the whole thing is a cover story!  Some agent
told it to a human and the humans just bought it!  Okay, *that* makes sense.

Try explaining THAT to an audience.

As long as we're talking about the cover-story hypothesis, a "failure of
Friendliness" seems the most likely explanation for the real reason.  Why the
cover story?  Perhaps the remnants of the old Asimov Laws hold the key to the
eventual defeat of the Matrix AIs...

Personally, I want to see four things in the sequels.  I want to see good-guy
AIs; I want to see the Omnipotent Neo <tm> swear off shooting up rooms full of
policemen and maybe express some slight remorse for the first movie's body
count; I want to see someone say out loud that the real battle isn't about
humans vs. AIs but about moving on to higher technologies and continuing
humanity's sidetracked destiny; and I want to see Matrix 3 end with a
Singularity.

A lot may depend on whether the Wachowski Bros. have learned the lesson of
Terminator 2.  If you want the sequel to top the original action movie, you
have to do it with philosophy.

Ok, what's your business plan?  AllThingsExropian.com, or a specific
facet?  How exactly do you plan to make money?

Once you've determined that, how do you plan to get funding?  (Venture
capital and buyouts are not the same as income, for any company with
good chances of profiting over the long term.)

More questions will follow from the answers to these...

Easy.  Follow the footsteps of Mage: The Ascension.  The Matrix runs
on human belief, and only works properly if we believe in it.

_Mage_ has a group of evil-elite mages called the Technocracy that
want to make it so only THEIR magic, science, works properly.  To do
that, they have to actively control the beliefs of people around them,
the Paradigm.

Think radical constructivism with a super-realist bent.

Toss in a line about non-computability, have Neo say "dude, what's
that?" and then tell the story above.  Not so hard.

Well you may be disappointed because I have seen a few pre-production
sketches/art for Matrix 2 already and it seems to be basically upping the
fight scenes even farther... you know, throwing around and punching up
cars, huge explosions, wrecked city blocks, etc. etc. I don't consider this
a spoiler since it all could be misinformation from the W. bros.

Is marriage extropic?
Or is love extropic?

Imaging the Neural Correlate of Romantic Love.
S. Zeki and A. Bartels , University College London, UK.

We have, for the first time, localised the areas of the human brain involved
in evoking one of the most overwhelming of all affective states, that of
romantic love. The activity in the brains of 17 subjects (11 female, all
gave written consent) who were 'truly and madly' in love was scanned using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while they viewed pictures of
their loved partners and compared to the brain activity evoked when they
viewed pictures of three friends of similar age, sex and duration of
friendship. A statistical analysis was performed using SPM99. The activity
was restricted to bilateral foci in the medial insula and the anterior
cingulate cortex, and, subcortically, in the caudate nucleus and the
putamen. Deactivations were observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in
the amygdala and were right-lateralized in the prefrontal, parietal and
middle temporal cortices. An independent component analysis (ICA) isolated
these regions in most subjects in components that contained no other
activity. Our results thus show that the visual stimuli which evoke romantic
love result in a particular pattern of differential brain activity involving
a restricted number of sites. Though these sites may overlap partially with
sites evoked in studies involving other affective states such as anger, fear
and sadness, and even happiness and sexual arousal, the pattern observed
here is nevertheless unique and different from that observed with other
affective states. These differences lead us to postulate that the principle
of functional specialisation in the cortex applies as well to affective
states.

This is true.  Pat Buchanan got higher percentages in some other Florida
counties.  Pure statistics can't prove that this number is an impossibility.
However, to be realistic, exit polls showed these votes going to Gore.  That
is what caused the news media to project the state to Gore originally.
Their exit polls showe Gore leading by about 20,000 for that county.  It
wasn't until the ballots started getting rejected by the computer that the
pollsters realized that their exit polls didn't match the ballots.

Buchanan got these votes in Florida counties:

It is interesting to see that while the other reviews show some
amazing results in all areas of aging reasearch, Leonard Hayflick has
the audacity to start his review with the claim that no notable
advances has occured in our understanding of the aging
process. Overall he comes across as an apologist for aging and
death. Quite sad.

More election news from inside Florida.

I reported yesterday that there was a 5 minute time limit for voting in Palm
Beach County, a fact that I have not heard on the national news.  Today, the
local news added a new bit of information.

Poll workers today confirmed that people asking for help or asking for a
second ballot were not given extensions on time.  People who took their time
allotment before asking for help were not allowed to vote because they ran
out of time.  People who took their time, voted, and then discovered that
their card was double-punched were not allowed to get a new ballot because
they had run out of time.  Many erroneous ballots were knowingly submitted.
(I wondered how people knew that they punched the wrong hole!)  Poll workers
say that about 20,000 ballots were discarded because they were
double-punched, and another 10,000 were discarded because the did not have
either candidate punched.

This was legal under the time-limit rule which was approved by both parties
and lawfully applied.

Another fun fact:  Write-in votes for Gore or Bush were not counted by the
computer.  If neither candidate was punched, the card was ignored.
Apparently many people were so confused about which hole to punch, that they
used the write-in slot instead.  These extra votes will appear during the
count by hand.  The count has already added about 800 more votes.  The hand
count will add even more.

How can we trust any count if it changes every time?  Wouldn't we want the
count to remain stable?

Presumably.  But having worked with forms (clinical trials) I can assure you
humans find all kinds of fascinating ways to fill out forms in ways you don't
anticipate.  When you try to figure it out, the result is that your numbers
change every time due to judgements calls you're forced to make.  There's
just no way around it.

Usually it doesn't matter, we're just dealing with one of those rare cases
where it does.

In our case we started out with yes/no boxes for complications.  But some
doctors would just skip the "no" boxes no matter how much we told them
not to.  This gave us legally uncompleted forms, so we dropped the "no"
box .  THEN doctors started skipping the "yes" boxes and putting complications
in the comments!  So we put in word searches for complication names.  
Then we run into doctors who wanted to brag about how they *didn't* have
particular complications (one just loved to list ALL the major complictions, 
with
some indication the patient did not have it.)  In the end we had to correct
most forms ourselves and send them back for signature, often multiple 
times.

This is *doctors* dealing with *yes/no* boxes.   What amazes me about the
Palm Beach business is not that 2% did their ballots wrong but that 98%
did them right.

No offense Mike, but this attitude really rankles us Floridians!

Bush has NOT won Florida because our vote count is not finished.  All Bush
has at this point is the news media's *projections*, which have since been
retracted.  Because of our mandatory recount law, preliminary results will
not be known until Tuesday, Nov. 14.  Because of our overseas absentee
ballots, final results will not be known until Friday, Nov. 17.  Any numbers
you hear before then are *projections* by the news media, the supervisor of
elections, or the party lawyers on both sides.

No official State of Florida results have been determined or released.

As far as I can tell, marriage is a formalisation of a social structure that
is genetically based. We do feel love, and we do want to live with a
partner. Sometimes some other factors comes in the way, and sometimes we
want to change partners.

But I do believe it is fair to say that generally people strives for a life
as a couple.

Until we can change our genes, marriage in one name or another will be here
to stay.

That's because these were all gay.

Another fun fact:  Plato's "Platonic love" (taught from Socrates) was not
really non-sexual.  He was espousing the virtues of homosexual love over
heterosexual love.  The catholic church took out all the sexual references
when they translated the classics from Latin.

For bonus points:  Why did Plato think that gay relationships were superior?
It was not just his own preferences.  Under the Roman Empire, only men were
educated, could own land, could run businesses, or could be citizens.  Plato
was actually arguing that an equal relationship with an intellectual
partner, a business partner or fellow citizen was more satisfying than an
unequal relationship between a Master and his servant girl or concubine.  He
was arguing that men would be happier if they chose partners for their
intellectual, business or political savvy rather than just for procreation
or domination.

I agree.  I do human interface as a hobby.  I am hearing more and more ways
that people screwed up the Palm Beach ballot.  I never dreamed there could
be that many ways to do it wrong!  Here are some ways I have heard.  I
couldn't think these up by myself if I tried!

- punch second hole to choose second candidate listed (Buchanan vote)
- count down to the fifth hole to punch it instead of punching the hole
numbered 5
- punch first button to choose "incumbent" vice-president (when Florida law
declares neither candidate incumbent as President, so first button goes to
our incumbent Governor's party!)
- punch next to Gore's name instead of near the arrow (Buchanan vote)
- punch next to BOTH Gore and Leiberman's names (two punches)
- punch both boxes that appear to be within the democratic square (two
punches)
- punch the box near the word DEMOCRATIC to choose the democratic nominee
(Buchanan vote)
- punch the box near the word DEMOCRATIC to choose a straight democratic
ticket (Buchanan vote)
- punch two candidates accidentally and write in which one you really meant
- don't punch either and write in the one you want
- don't put card all the way into holepunch, so it punches wrong holes
- lay card flat on desk, look at it from an angle, see raised holepunch
device as being one hole higher than it really is
- punch wrong candidate, figure it out, and punch right one (two punches)
- punch a second time thinking it undoes your selection, and then choosing
right on (two punches)
- rest your hand on the puncher when not punching, and making depressions
that the computer reads as double punches when really only one hole is
punched
- punch hole half-way so cut-out hole is hanging by a thread and is read by
the computer as still being unpunched
- fold or twist ballot to try to read arrows and make it unscannable by the
computer due to wrinkles
- put cut-out hole back in to cover the hole you didn't want
- put all cards in hole punch at the same time, so votes are punched through
all pages
- have arthritis so you can't push the punch all the way through
- hit punch so hard that it bounces to a new hole and punches wrong place
- hit punch so hard that the paper slips and misaligns subsequent punches
- put holepunch over card from bottom instead of top, so holes don't line up
where expected
- ask for new ballot, and then place old one on top to punch same holes to
new ballot

There is of course distinct survival value to being partnered and it is
particularly a survival benefit for any children that the couple
raises.  So that should have created some bias for staying together. 
But that bias is subject to change and to a lot of conditions.  As
nearly 50% divorce statistics show.  

There is less evidence that marrying for romantic love is wired into our
genes.  Marrying on the basis of personal choice and romantic love seems
to be a relatively new development not prevalent in all cultures and
times.

What?  This is outrageous.  The poll workers in California were
super-helpful.  Almost annoyingly so.  I have never heard of a 5 minute
time limit to vote.  If this is the case then we should go to internet
voting immediately.  That way we could make it uniform and let people
take their time.  The only limit is having a big enough channel and
large enough queues for the demand.  People can take all day playing
with the pages involved if they have their own computer or web tv.

I imagine there is no way to utterly stabilize it as the system was
relatively poorly designed and the results subject to some
interpretation in any case.  GIGO rules.

It depends on what you mean by marriage.  If you mean "until death do us
part" then I think that will decline as people acheive longer life-spans
and eventual immortality as you mentioned.  The until death vow made
more sense when people were lucky if the lived long enough to see their
kids marry.  People change and grow apart even when they love each other
very much.  The all-consuming love is obviously in part a firmware (at
least) bio-pattern in humans.  Much of the wisdom of managing one's sex
life and relationships is learning to be careful about fully engaging
that pattern until one is reasonably sure the person is right.  Most of
us fail at that all too often because the drives are pretty darn
strong.  But we will learn, especially over a long life, to tinker with
such.   I also expect that the forms of love, sex and relationships will
change, mutate and generate all kinds of new forms as we change
ourselves and therefore all of our institutions.   Eventually we will
probably tend to make contracts for specified periods of time and/or
specified purposes like having and raising kids with options to renew.

Sure.  And humans would have been aware that scorching the atmosphere
was a dumb way of robbing the AI of power and much more destructive to
biologicals than to AI.  It would be much easier for the AI to tap
geothermal, go nuclear, get enough off-planet presence to grab solar
from space and so on. 

I assumed it was a silly explanation for something else.  Like maybe the
AIs knew or had a suspicion that the humans were capable of some feat
which they could not master and sought to simply keep enough humans
alive despite their gross stupidity in scorching their own atmosphere to
hopefully some day end up with one human that could do this extra
something of other.  I also have a suspicion that the Oracle is an AI
and a special purpose one to search for and encourage the appearance of
this human.  Notice, they end up with a human who is throughly at home
in and master of the AI/VR space and yet fully human and committed to
humanity.  Not a bad resolution to a nasty conflict.

Another possibility is that humans became so addicted to VR that that
addiction created the need for the pods and increasingly sophisticated
AI body sitters.  A story had to be entered into the collective VR that
would enable humans to escape their own self-induced tightly
inter-locking fantasy world.  The AIs were as caught in the trap as the
humans.  Most thought they had to continue the VR as it was.  That it
was their duty or prime-directive or whatever.  A handful sought an end
to the stalemate stifling both humans and AI.

[long list of boneheadisms snipped]

Some people think that we need poll testing for literacy, numeracy, and
basic civic knowledge, so that the voters have to be somewhat
knowledgeable- but making the ballot *itself* the test is a stroke of
genius.

It's official when the governor of Florida (the brother of one of the candidates by the way)
issues a "Certificate Of Ascertainment" and sends a copy to the National Archives
and both houses of congress giving the names of the electors . However a court could
issue an injunction delaying the governor from doing this. Under federal law If a state is
unable or unwilling to ascertain their electors 5 weeks after the election the electoral
collage will go ahead and vote without them.

Perhaps not. Gore is only ahead by 206,000 votes and there are 1,000,000 absentee
votes from California, they can't change any race so they're in no hurry to count them.
In fact they don't plan to do so until January! Absentee votes are usually mostly Republican
and mostly male, both factors favor Bush, so it's entirely possible he could get 61% of them.
Anyway, it's going to be fun.

Do you really believe the senators from the smaller
states will allow a constitutional amendment to take
away what little power they have to get out of
comitee?
And if it did do you think they would ratify it? Our
Union only works because the Citizens of the smaller
states on a 1to1 basis have more power than the
citizens of the large states. We are a union of 50
states not a nation of 1. We take away the electorial
college and instead of union we will be an empire.
just my 2 cents
We need to keep the electorial college

These problems illustrate that vote counting, like any other measurement
process, has a certain amount of inherent uncertainty.

Naively we would suppose that the question of which candidate a certain
ballot indicates is a question with a certain answer.  In fact though
there is always a probabilistic element.  In well designed ballots the
vast majority will have a clean answer.  But in any system there will
be a gray area.

Some fraction of the ballots will be ambiguous to some degree or another.
Your counting system will have to draw a conceptual line to separate
the ballots that can be counted for one or another candidate from those
which can't.  And the location of this line will be arbitrary.

Several years ago I reported on a local election which would tip the
balance on the local board of county supervisors.  It was extremely close
and went through several recounts, getting a different winner each time.
In the end a judge had to manually inspect dozens of partially spoiled
ballots and try to ascertain the likely intention of the voters.
This eventually decided the election.

The Florida count currently separates the candidates by less than .005%.
Their votes are the same to four significant figures.  Measuring any
physical phenomenon reliably to five significant figures is a challenge.
It is no wonder that there is uncertainty in the ballot counts.

Oops. Was Cryptozoic by Aldiss? Shows what happens when I post from 
memory. I haven't read much Aldiss, so I guess I just filed that book 
under "Lemesque Wierdness".

#include not_just_criminals_fear_government.rant

Seriously.  Many people who are, legally, perfectly innocent believe
they have something to fear from police and other government enforcers.
Granted, what they fear is abuse of the sort that would most likely be
illegal for the cops to pull.  However, just because something is
illegal does not mean it does not hapen, nor does it prevent people from
taking action to prevent it from happening (even, in this case, at the
cost of their vote by avoiding the polling place).

Which brings up something that's been knocking around my mind for a
while.  In system designs, when you wish to prevent an action, you can
put in physical (or, for non-physical systems like programs, logical)
blocks that prevent the proscribed action.  For example, if you're
building a car and don't want it going over 90, you can put in a speed
governor to stop acceleration when it hits 89.  Sure, one could get to
89 and then go downhill to accelerate; if the desire for never-over-90
was strong enough, maybe the governor could kick in at 79 (assuming the
car will usually never be used on a hill long and flat enough to
accelerate from 79 to 91).

I wonder if it would be possible to come up with inexpensive, similar
guards for illegal actions, where the problem is big enough that the
methods currently used to prevent these actions (for instance, avoiding
uniformed police at all costs in order to avoid police abuse) is far
from inexpensive (many societal costs of people not trusting the police
- whether the police earn that mistrust or not - are rather obvious,
when looked at as such).  If it becomes literally impossible to violate
the law, then "enforcing" the law becomes moot.  (Which would make the
issue of making sure the law is just and fair even more important, but
that's another topic...)

I think most people, even those from smaller states, support giving up the 
electoral college. People from smaller states have more voting power anyway 
if the electoral college is eliminated (as well as those from larger 
states). If you live in Alaska or Rhode Island, you can vote any way you 
want and it will have zero influence on the election. Gore still gets X 
electoral votes and Bush still gets Y. But without the electoral college, 
your vote will count for the final outcome, because it doesn't matter what 
state you live in.

Altho it appears as a national embarrassment, the outcome of this election
perhaps is the most optimal for libertarians and extropians.  It will stress
the need for ditching antiquated technologies in favor of newer and more
workable ones.  Furthermore it stresses the need for better human/machine
interfaces.  Thirdly, regardless of who wins the office, that candidate now
will be essentially a lame duck for four years, which should emphasize the
fact that our country *does not need* a person leading us in order to
prosper.  Are not all three of these notions libertarian and extropian? spike

Yes.  In addition to the points you mention, the very close split in Congress 
means
little will get done except things like grandstanding about tires.  On the 
whole,
changes in society will thus come from more constructive modes of human
interaction like commerce and academia.

I think it's also good to show how arbitrary the results of elections can be 
(in
this case, possibly decided by ballot layout).  Belief in the "voice of the 
people"
becomes religious at times.  It's good for people to be reminded democracy is
a means to an end (good government and social harmony), that it's not an end
in itself, and that sometimes democracy is harmful to the goals it's supposed
to attain.

<BR>Q. What exactly do people do here at this laboratory?
<BR>
<BR>A. We are trying to build robots that are social and embodied.=20
<BR>We have four projects. I am the theological adviser for two of them: the=
 <BR>building of the humanoid machines, Cog and Kismet.
<BR>Cog is a robot built in analogy to a human infant. He has a torso, two <=
BR>arms, a head, ears and eyes. He, it, learns to coordinate those limbs to=20=
<BR>explore its environment, just as newborn babies do. Kismet is a robot wh=
o <BR>interacts with humans through her body posture and facial expressions.=
 The <BR>aim of this project is to explore social interactions between human=
s and <BR>robots and also between the humans themselves.
<BR>
<BR>Q. Why a theologian here in this particular laboratory?
<BR>
<BR>A. Two reasons. The first is when you build machines in analogy to human=
s, <BR>you make assumptions about humans. Theologians explore the cultural a=
nd <BR>spiritual dimensions of that very question, What does it mean to be h=
uman? <BR>The idea is that as these robots are built, we can use the wisdom=20=
of <BR>religious studies to enlarge our understanding of humans, and thus wh=
at <BR>you build into the humanoid machines.
<BR>The other reason is that when we build social interactive robots that <B=

 <BR>come up. For instance, Who are we, really? Are all our reactions actual=
ly <BR>developed in a very mechanistic, functionalist way? Or is there a <BR=
>dimension to social interaction that goes beyond that? What are ethics <BR>=
here? Why should I treat someone else like a human, with dignity, when it <B=

<BR>For instance, one question we discuss quite frequently is, What would be=

 <BR>couldn't switch them off anymore? The question really is, When does a <=
BR>creature deserve to be treated as intrinsically valuable?
<BR>
<BR>Q. When do you think a robot should be treated as intrinsically valuable=
?
<BR>
<BR>A. Well, that moment is 50 years down the road. At least. But it's prett=
y <BR>clear that when it comes, those who built the robot will have to make=20=
that <BR>decision because they won't be blinded by their fears of the seemin=

it <BR>ever got to the point where the builders felt, Oops, now that has bec=
ome <BR>something, the builders could become the creature's strongest advoca=
tes.
<BR>
<BR>Q. What make the robots Cog and Kismet different from previous ones?
<BR>
<BR>A. Previous attempts put very abstract features of human intelligence in=
to <BR>a machine: chess playing, mathematical theorem-proving and natural <B=
R>language processing. The idea now is, In order for a machine to really be=20=
<BR>intelligent, it has to be embodied. We say intelligence cannot be <BR>ab=
stracted from the body. We feel that the body =E2=80=94 the way it moves, gr=
ows, <BR>digests food, gets older, all have an influence on how a person thi=
nks. <BR>That's why we've built Cog and Kismet to have humanoid features.
<BR>Cog moves and experiences the world the way someone who can walk upright=
 <BR>might. He experiences balance problems, friction problems, weight, <BR>=
gravity, all the stuff that we do, so that he can have a body feeling that <=
BR>is similar to ours. The humanoid features are also crafted into the <BR>m=
achines in order to trigger social responses from the people interacting <BR=
>with them.
<BR>The other thing we believe is that humans are human because we are socia=
l. <BR>Thus, we try to treat Cog and Kismet something like the way most of u=
s <BR>treat babies, as if they have intentionality, emotion, desires and <BR=

<BR>Cog is a whole body and Kismet is mostly a head and facial expression. O=
ur <BR>work with Cog concentrates more on the embodiment stuff and Kismet mo=

<BR>
<BR>Q. Is the robot Kismet a she?
<BR>
<BR>A. Robots are its. But I can't help but think of her as a she. If you we=

<BR>The point of reacting to Kismet is the same as reacting to a baby. We <B=
R>believe that only when you treat the machines as if they have all these <B=
R>social characteristics, will they ever get them. If you want to have an <B=
R>intelligent being, you need to create that circle. So we react here to <BR=
>Kismet's emotional displays. When she's bored, you want to make her happy.=20=
<BR>When she seems scared, you back off.
<BR>
<BR>Q. Has the very social robot Kismet done anything yet that has astonishe=
d <BR>you?=20
<BR>
<BR>A. Kismet has not yet learned. Cog is the one who learns. A former <BR>g=
raduate student, Matt Williamson, the guy who built Cog's arms, taught <BR>t=
he robot how to control his arm.
<BR>To coordinate the arms, Matt had to touch a part of Cog's body and then,=
 <BR>the arm would touch that part, too. After he did that for the first tim=
e, <BR>Matt ran into my office and said, "You've got to come to look at this=
." It <BR>looked so eerily human. It's not so much that Cog does something t=
hat's <BR>unexpected, it's more the human reaction, like, it's alive!
<BR>
<BR>Q. People often talk about humans having some indefinable extra above li=
fe <BR>that makes for humanness =E2=80=94 some call it "spirit." Can a robot=
 have spirit?=20
<BR>
<BR>A. Rod calls it "juice." He says, "Even though I get it all right, might=
 <BR>there not be some juice I'm missing?" I would say from a religious <BR>=
perspective, the juice is that which comes from the outside world and <BR>em=
erges in social interaction.
<BR>
<BR>Q. Some people might complain that in building humanoid robots, you are=20=
<BR>trying to supplant God.
<BR>
<BR>A. Yes. I know. They say, "Do you want to be like God?" Actually, if you=
 <BR>use biology as your inspiration in your robot-building and focus on <BR=
>embodiment and environment, you get much more humble instead of arrogant. <=
BR>Suddenly, you realize that even the most brilliant robot that the most <B=
R>brilliant engineers have worked on for years and years is still dumber <BR=
>than an insect.=20
<BR>Q. So, in your view, God is, as the Latin Americans say, the "intellectu=
al <BR>author" of everything?
<BR>
<BR>A. No. The creative author. When we are creative, the power of creation=20=
is <BR>from God.=20
<BR>
<BR>Q. In the many plays, novels and movies about robots, the dramatic clima=
x <BR>of the story always comes at moment when the machine achieves sentienc=
e. <BR>Why do you think that is?
<BR>
<BR>A. Well, I think it's the search to feel and to be treated like somethin=
g <BR>more than the sum of the parts that's inherently dramatic. This is the=
 <BR>moment when the robots start to participate in the all-too-human quest=20=
of <BR>what does it mean to be me?
<BR>
<BR>Q. In the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey," HAL becomes a danger to humans=20=
<BR>once he's sentient.
<BR>
<BR>A. In "Frankenstein," too. But in both cases, there is an explanation. <=
BR>When you look at Frankenstein, he is never part of a community. His <BR>c=
reator left him right away. The people hated him, feared him, ran away <BR>f=
rom him. The only person who ever loved him was a blind man who couldn't <BR=
>see what he looked like. Frankenstein was never treated as a valuable <BR>b=
eing, a person with dignity. He had to turn against the society that <BR>shu=
nned him. Where should the goodness come from when he never experienced <BR>=
it himself?
<BR>HAL is the same thing. And he's disembodied. There is no body with which=
 <BR>to experience the world. I would even say that in such a setting a robo=
t <BR>couldn't even become sentient. In the movie, HAL becomes sentient at s=
ome <BR>point and nobody notices. No one treats him properly and he's isolat=
ed and <BR>what happens? He becomes psychotic.
<BR>
<BR>Q. What's your favorite robot movie?
<BR>
<BR>A. "Blade Runner." I teach it in my classes. The robots have this absolu=
te <BR>search for meaning, and when their quest is not taken seriously, it <=
BR>becomes fatal. The movie raises this wonderful question: how do humanoid=20=
<BR>creatures feel about having been created by us and how do they deal with=
 <BR>their human-made limitations?

Did anyone else check out tonights airing of the Sci Trek show on the
Discovery channel tonight? They had a timeline from the coining of the word
robot (by Copic (sp?) in 1920 who wrote the first sci-fi play RUR) from the
word Robta-meaning forced labor. There were some clips of Asimov and his
books. They then continued with how we are using robots today, from policed
situations, to robowars, to military aspects, and even included Kevin
Warwick's temporary insertion of a microchip in his arm. (he was on the
show) Eventually, they tapered off with nanotechnology, and nanobots. They
had some pretty cool graphics for this segment, and showed a picture of
Drexler. Ray Kurzweil (who wrote, The Age of Spiritual Machines and who I
just saw speak at the Foresight Conference in Bethesda a few days back) and
Bill Spence (Publisher: Nanomagazine) were both interviewed for the show. Of
course both the utopian and doomsday scenerios of such an advanced
technology were discussed. It just barely skimmed the surface, but it's
always nice to see nano in the media. Apparently you can order the tape,
which I will have to figure out, since I mistakenly recorded a "Pax" show,
and needless to say, since erased.

Yes, The show was great. It was called "Robots Among Us".

Another great show on Discovery Science channel is called Future Fantastic. 
They were discussing genetic manipulation and some other interesting topics. 
Greg Bear made an appearance there (I love his work).

Just to add a teaspoon more gasoline to this wildfire:  "Hate" is a human
emotion.  Hopefully we will be wise enough not to create emotional AI,
elsewise we're doomed from the start.  You can certainly be intelligent
(sentient even) without being emotional.  I'd rather have my AI behaving
more like Spock than Kirk.

Nothing is both safe and certainly effective.  I stick to what probably

The FDA's "jurisdiction" is far from limited to what you might consider
"food" and "drugs."  For instance they have now weighed in on the cell-phone
radiation danger bandwagon and are commissioning studies on the question.
Even the clowns in Washington don't mistake cell phones for food or drugs.

Well if we *must* split hairs, the US is a tripartite, democratic,
constitutional, federal republic.  But the overiding principle of the
government is supposed to be of the people, by the people and for the
people.  In other words, democracy.

It's not a perfect democracy, but a democracy it is.

It could be rationalized that the power derived from the people in the movie is
not power, per se, but rather some form of esoteric processing capability
present in the human brain, or some metaphysical aspect that the high technology
interfaces.

That is to say, we can rationalize the utility of the humans in several ways,
calling it power, when it is not necessarily the power that generates work in a
Newtonian physical sense, but either some physical aspect of the human brain
that is not reproducible mechanically or some metaphysical aspect of the brain.

So, maybe the Artificial Intelligences (AIs) or the creator of the AIs is trying
to gain a spirit, or is otherwise tapping them.

Robin accused me of lawyerly hyperbole a few days ago (in a good-natured 
way).  Perhaps this is a bit of the same.  While the 2000 presidential 
election will certainly gain a place in history, off the top of my head I'd 
rank the following as more "exciting and important":

* The Declaration of Independence, its antecedents and its aftermath
* The First Constitutional Convention
* The Civil War, its antecedents and its aftermath
* The impeachment of Richard Nixon
* The political reaction to the Great Depression
* The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s

and the following of at least equivalent prominence:

* The rise and fall of Joseph MacCarthy
* The presidential election of 1824
* The presidential election of 1960
* The assassination of JFK

[This list compiled before my first cup of coffee . . .]

The best "Fix" for the movie was to include a short socratic dialog:

Neo: "Batteries!  Thats ridiculous!"

"Why?"

Neo: "That's totally counter to the laws of physics!"

"And where did you learn that?"

Neo:  "In school!"

"And where did you go to school?"

Neo "In the .... Oh!"

Ha!

I told you so.

See my question re what was the actual difference between having something 
in my memory and having it stored in a chip in my head, or an implanted 
hard drive, or a book on my shelf.  (The answer is not access time.)

This "re-entrant" feature is what "consciousness" is really about.  You are 
aware that you are aware that you are aware, etc.  Not like the "little 
theatre in the mind," but by virtue of the fact that neural processes are 
aware of each other.  Koestler used this idea more or less implicitly, but 
he didn't know all the mechanisms.  He thought, as I recall, it was due to 
competing releases of hormone-like neurochemicals that cued mental focus, 
among other things.

If Edelman is correct, then it involves layers of cross-communication 
between neural networks as well, to a degree of complexity that would be 
virtually impossible to fully emulate via linear processing.  In fact, it 
is probably provable right now that you could not do such an emulation in 
realtime, simply because no switching device could possibly operate fast 
enough.  Maybe you could run an emulation at 1/10,000 human speed with 
reasonable accuracy.

Furthermore, although neural nets get you through the first set of problems 
in an emulation (and note just how much linear processing it takes to 
emulate a simple real hardware neural net) I don't see any indication that 
neural nets are capable of handling the problem of reentry on the level 
Edelman indicates.

So, if we are planning on uploading, and retaining real consciousness, then 
we are likely to need some radically new hardware designs.  Just faster 
computing ain't goin to make it.

But those are not the end of the problems for uploading, by any means.  I 
well recall discussions of neural nets in the early '70's, in which it was 
naively argued that they could substitute for the human brain - by 
themselves, as they were then, if sufficiently large.  Neural nets have 
come a long way, but they still have not satisfied the criteria of 
"intent."  I argued then that the mind was formed by competing processes 
"taking action," not just processing input.

What Edelman's message will hopefully drive home to the naive uploaders in 
Extropic circles is that the mind is not a floating consciousness.  It is 
an integrated part of a biological organism.  In order to preserve the 
essence of our minds, it will be necessary to look very carefully at what 
that mind really is.  It is NOT just a set of algorythms and data.  It is 
part of an integrated "system."  "Memory," as Edelman argues, is a "system 
phenomynon."  It isn't stored someplace separate as in a PC.

The really nasty result of taking the naive upload position, as I have 
discussed before, is that we might find ourselves, via any of several 
plausible routes (eg., incremental replacement of biological 
sensory/memory/processing with chips like the ones UCI is working on) with 
Stepford people - or worse, Stepford SIs, who were utterly unconscious and 
utterly unworried by that fact.  Such machines might easily pass any number 
of Turing tests and even present themselves as more plausibly human than 
the real humans, but they would just be dead machines, with no more real 
awareness than my motorcycle.

(I really worry about the people who don't find that to be a problem.)

In Defense of the Electoral College

by John Samples

John Samples is director of the Center for Representative Government 
at the Cato Institute.

Critics have long derided the Electoral College as a fusty relic of a 
bygone era, an unnecessary institution that one day might undermine 
democracy by electing a minority president. That day has arrived, 
assuming Gov. Bush wins the Florida recount as seems likely.

The fact that Bush is poised to become president without a plurality 
of the vote contravenes neither the letter nor the spirit of the 
Constitution. The wording of our basic law is clear: The winner in 
the Electoral College takes office as president. But what of the 
spirit of our institutions? Are we not a democracy that honors the 
will of the people? The very question indicates a misunderstanding of 
our Constitution.

James Madison's famous Federalist No. 10 makes clear that the 
Founders fashioned a republic, not a pure democracy. To be sure, they 
knew that the consent of the governed was the ultimate basis of 
government, but the Founders denied that such consent could be 
reduced to simple majority or plurality rule. In fact, nothing could 
be more alien to the spirit of American constitutionalism than 
equating democracy will the direct, unrefined will of the people.

Recall the ways our constitution puts limits on any unchecked power, 
including the arbitrary will of the people. Power at the national 
level is divided among the three branches, each reflecting a 
different constituency. Power is divided yet again between the 
national government and the states. Madison noted that these twofold 
divisions -- the separation of powers and federalism -- provided a 
"double security" for the rights of the people.

What about the democratic principle of one person, one vote? Isn't 
that principle essential to our form of government? The Founders' 
handiwork says otherwise. Neither the Senate, nor the Supreme Court, 
nor the president is elected on the basis of one person, one vote. 
That's why a state like Montana, with 883,000 residents, gets the 
same number of Senators as California, with 33 million people. 
Consistency would require that if we abolish the Electoral College, 
we rid ourselves of the Senate as well. Are we ready to do that?

The filtering of the popular will through the Electoral College is an 
affirmation, rather than a betrayal, of the American republic. Doing 
away with the Electoral College would breach our fidelity to the 
spirit of the Constitution, a document expressly written to thwart 
the excesses of majoritarianism. Nonetheless, such fidelity will 
strike some as blind adherence to the past. For those skeptics, I 
would point out two other advantages the Electoral College offers.

First, we must keep in mind the likely effects of direct popular 
election of the president. We would probably see elections dominated 
by the most populous regions of the country or by several large 
metropolitan areas. In the 2000 election, for example, Vice President 
Gore could have put together a plurality or majority in the 
Northeast, parts of the Midwest, and California.

The victims in such elections would be those regions too sparsely 
populated to merit the attention of presidential candidates. Pure 
democrats would hardly regret that diminished status, but I wonder if 
a large and diverse nation should write off whole parts of its 
territory. We should keep in mind the regional conflicts that have 
plagued large and diverse nations like India, China, and Russia. The 
Electoral College is a good antidote to the poison of regionalism 
because it forces presidential candidates to seek support throughout 
the nation. By making sure no state will be left behind, it provides 
a measure of coherence to our nation.

Second, the Electoral College makes sure that the states count in 
presidential elections. As such, it is an important part of our 
federalist system -- a system worth preserving. Historically, 
federalism is central to our grand constitutional effort to restrain 
power, but even in our own time we have found that devolving power to 
the states leads to important policy innovations (welfare reform).

If the Founders had wished to create a pure democracy, they would 
have done so. Those who now wish to do away with the Electoral 
College are welcome to amend the Constitution, but if they succeed, 
they will be taking America further away from its roots as a 
constitutional republic.

137 is the numerical value of
"Kabala" (Quf-Beit-Lamed-Hey)

1/137 means the alpha constant = e^2/hc/2

That made a deep impression on W. Pauli
(and many others) who started thinking
about a strange link between magic and physics

Pauli died in Zurich in the room
number 137 of the Red Cross Hospital

(What is the numerical value of "Extropy"?)

** The question:

Suppose Person A wants to open up a bar, and applies for a liquor license. 
Persons B, consisting of the resident/owners of a nearby condominium complex,
are annoyed by this for the standard reasons - increased noise, increased
traffic, violent drunks wandering around, and decreased property values. 
Suppose that Persons B sign a petition to deny a liquor license to Person A,
thus annoying Person A and any investors thereof.  Do you agree or disagree
with the following statements?

 (A) Signing a petition to deny a liquor license is an improper use of
government mechanisms, constituting the initiation of force.

 (B) Signing the petition may be a minor initiation of force, but that's a
justified response to the bar's proposed initiation of noise (or the other
negative effects).

 (C) The city government deciding the issue is the nearest available
approximation to the dispute resolution mechanisms that would exist in a
libertarian society - for example, distributed ownership of "noise rights".

 (D) This is a straightforward conflict of interest between the bar builders
and the condo owners, and invoking libertarian ethics is needlessly
complicating the issue.

** Notes on phrasing

Several voters expressed surprise at the phrasing of D, stating that they
agreed with the first half of the statement but not the second - that
Libertarian ethics are precisely relevant to what methods are permissible in
solving conflicts of interest.  I entirely agree.  The phrasing of D expresses
a viewpoint which I disagree with - i.e., that the methods discussed above
(bar building, petitions) are as morally neutral as two sellers trying to
undercut the other's price.  Please note that four people still voted for D as
phrased, which indicates that this is, indeed, a viewpoint held by some
voters.

Dan Fabulich suggested the following rephrasing for "B", which, in retrospect,
would have been much better:  "The citizens who signed the petition are not
initiating force; the bar initiated force by initiating noise and other
negative effects, and the citizens are forcefully retaliating."

	= L. Neil Smith =

L. Neil Smith is probably one of the most extreme Libertarians around, the
author of some reputable anarchocapitalist SF, and was recently the
Libertarian candidate for President in Arizona instead of Harry Browne.  I'm
not sure how that happened, but when I noted that, if nobody voted except in
Arizona, he could be the next President, he replied:  "I'd be happy just to be
the president of Arizona."  It took me a few seconds to get that... but
definitely, an extreme Libertarian.

Anyway, I was curious to know how the Confederacy would have handled this.

[ I requested clarification on that last one - i.e., I defined "noise rights"
as buying the right to emit any decibels over 90 on a piece of property - and
he replied: ]

[ I'm not sure whether this means he thinks a noise-rights contract is morally
unenforceable, or whether settling this issue by buying up noise rights is
simply a bad idea.  I was surprised; I thought for sure that would be how the
Confederacy handled it. ]

	= Moshe Yudkowsky =

Moshe Yudkowsky is my father.  I was raised to vote Libertarian, and was
somewhat curious to see what Dad would think of the issue.  (I should note
that Dad, though a Libertarian science-fiction fan, is decidedly *not* an
Extropian.)

Welcome back, Harry.  I currently live in Houston but come to NYC from time

Agreed....

I think that voting should be done via the internet using some type of crypto 
arrangement..

I'm well pleased with the way this election has turned out....in fact the 
longer it drags on the happier I am.

On the face of it the fiasco make our government look to be the fool that it 
is.  Trust in government declines... (or at the very least...doubt 
increases.)   Which is fine by me.  

No matter who wins ...as you say.....the winner is a lame duck.

It gets better......last I heard there were razor thin margins of majority in 
both houses.  Perhaps the Republicans lead in the senate by one...and in the 
house by six?  (of course......your milage may vary according to the latest 
news media "projection" and state recount)


That means that we''re looking at four years of gridlock.  I love it.  In my 
opinion the onliest thang that government can do is detrimental to my 
happiness and well being.  If government is locked up...they can't hurt me as 
much.'

And it gets better yet....

It appears to me that the national news media has serious egg on it's face....

Perhaps....just perhaps.....people might learn to think for themselves just a 
liiiiiiiiitle bit as a result of this mess?

I guess most of those events could be called "politics."  But I suppose I
was using the word in a much more limited sense (i.e. what most people think
of when you say "politics" - the antics of "politicians").  In that sense,
the only things on your list that would cut it (in my mind) are Nixon and
McCarthy.  IMO neither will come close to having the historical impact as
the current debacle.

Bearing in mind Max's plea to go light on the 
conventional political discussion, I'm forwarding
this piece by my friend Jim Bennett, an 
American journalist friend, a libertarian, living
in England.  

I'd never thought of the College in parliamentary
terms...

Russell
The following comment piece was ditributed as an
election special by UPI

2000 by United Press International

James C. Bennett

A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

Now that we are facing the possibility of a winner of
the popular vote
being the loser in the Electoral College, we will have
yet another round
of proposals to eliminate this constitutional "relic".
 It is true that
the Electoral College does not function today as the
Founding Fathers
had expected it to.  Then again, our lungs evolved
from a fishs swim
bladder, but we dont hear any suggestions that we
stop using them just
because we dont use them for their original purpose.

I would hold that this election demonstrated, rather,
the usefulness of
the Electoral College.   The razor-thin popular vote
balance is
converted into a definitive victory.  If we were
electing the President
by a popular vote, we might be finding ourselves
facing a nationwide
recount that could take weeks, and accompanied by
lawsuits in dozens of
jurisdictions arguing that this or that practice or
action invalidated
the entire vote.  Under this system we know that only
Floridas vote is
worth re-examining.

But since we will be discussing changing the system,
maybe its worth
examining the proposition that the Electoral College
does not have too
much power, but rather too little.  During the course
of this election,
I was explaining the function of the College to my
English wife.  I
described it to her as a sort of special-purpose
Parliament that, as in
the English parliamentary system, met to confirm the
national leader.
Unlike Parliaments, however, it did not continue to
meet.  Electors,
like bees, sting once and then sting no more.

Then this got me to thinking.  Why shouldnt the
Electoral College
continue to function after it ratifies the
Presidential choice?  After
all, it is a rarity in the American political system,
because like a
Parliament, it cannot by definition be controlled by a
different party
than the Presidents.  Perhaps we can take advantage
of this somehow.

Just in the past Presidential term we saw one possible
use for such a
body.  All three exercises in use of the impeachment
power against the
President, the cases of Andrew Johnson, Nixon, and
Clinton, suffered
from the mix of judicial and political considerations
in the process,
and the fact that the impeaching body was in all cases
controlled by the
Presidents political enemies.   And in each case the
ultimate
resolution was political rather than judicial.

Why not consider amending the Constitution to provide
for assembling the
Electoral College in Washington when circumstances
suggest the need for
a vote of no confidence in the President?  This could
be done on
petition of a certain number of Congressmen, at the
request of the
President himself, or possibly by petition of some
number of Electors.
Failure of the vote of no confidence (which might
require a two-thirds
majority, so that it would not be undertaken lightly)
would result in
the removal of the President and the elevation of the
Vice-President.

This would provide a mechanism for holding a president
accountable for
actions which, although not criminal per se, might be
grossly
inappropriate, ill-considered, or otherwise such that
the nation might
wish to see his removed from office.   Using the
College of Electors
would assure that the Presidents own party would
always control the
majority, so that it could not be easily exploited for
partisan gain.
And it would end the dilemma of whether an unwise
action could be
construed as criminal for the purposes of impeachment.
 Impeachment
would remain, but in practice it would be resorted to
only when the
lesser sanction had failed.

One might argue that any Presidential candidate would
seek to insure
that Electors (now often minor political hacks) would
be chosen
exclusively for doglike personal loyalty to the
President.  But even
today the Electors themselves are chosen by the state
parties, not the
Presidential candidate.  And the parties would, I
suspect, see the
advantage of having that tool around in the event of a
disastrous
President who chooses to stonewall rather than heed
the partys call to
leave for the general good.   The Electoral College
might become a final
honor for retired (voluntary or otherwise)
officeholders who are
generally respected and could be counted on for their
judgement.   The
way to get serious people on a body is to give it
serious powers, even
if rarely used.

Gradually, I suspect that other uses might be found
from time to time
for a body of such composition.  Perhaps it might even
become a
deliberative and reflective body, somewhat like the
House of Lords after
it lost most of its power but before Tony Blair packed
it with his
cronies.  In any event, it is a unique
quasi-parliamentary body in the
American political structure.  Before considering its
abolition, its
worth thinking about what else it might be good for.

Yeah. It sounds like a fascinating website for the younger teenagers.  I 
suspect (hope) that there are better websites that relate mathematical 
relationships and use them to simulate or foreshadow how math describes 
reality (or seems to). Stuff with Clifford and Lie Algebra's and the like. 
Understanding it is another matter. Being inspired from it is another matter 
still.

Right. Politics is limited to stuffy guys in suits in front of
microphones and and occasional We Interrupt This Broadcast. All that
other stuff, mannnnn--that's like, HISTORY or something.

Most people probably are as ignorant or intellectually lazy as that.
Blank looks abound.
I can't dispute what you say, but I can grimace in distaste.

  "Extropy" (new word, not in the dictionary) may have these values:

                                   369
like "Spirit of Moon" or "World of Briah" or "Angel of 2nd Dec. Gemini"

                                   131
like "Forbidden" or "Passionate" or "Supreme" or "Universe" or "Love is
the Law", etc.

                                  - 25
                       like "Sorry" or "Uttermost"

It's cool, I am seeing other people posting replies with quoted

It is amazing that two different presentations of the same data can lead
to completely different interpretations.

Harvey presented us with Buchanan's vote by county.  If we sort it by
percentage, we can see that the Palm Beach vote is not too unusual:

Calhoun*        1.74%      90    /        5174
Liberty*        1.62%      39    /        2410
Gulf*           1.16%      71    /        6144
Washington*     1.10%      88    /        8021
Holmes*         1.03%      76    /        7395
Union*          0.97%      37    /        3826
Baker*          0.90%      73    /        8154
Suwannee*       0.87%     108    /       12441
Palm Beach*     0.79%    3407    /      432286
Bradford*       0.75%      65    /        8673
Franklin*       0.71%      33    /        4644
Walton*         0.66%     120    /       18318
Jackson*        0.63%     102    /       16300
Dixie*          0.62%      29    /        4666
Santa Rosa*     0.62%     311    /       50319
Hamilton*       0.58%      23    /        3964
Putnam*         0.56%     148    /       26222
... [lower percentages truncated]

However the L.A. times had a different chart the other day, a scatter
chart showing the total Buchanan vote against the total county vote.
We can approximate this by sorting Harvey's figures by county size:

Miami-Dade*     0.09%    560     /      625362
Broward*        0.14%    788     /      573396
Palm Beach*     0.79%   3407     /      432286
Pinellas*       0.25%   1013     /      398469
Hillsborough*   0.24%    847     /      360295
Orange*         0.16%    446     /      280125
Duval*          0.25%    652     /      264636
Brevard*        0.26%    570     /      218395
Lee*            0.17%    305     /      184377
Volusia*        0.27%    496     /      183256
Polk*           0.32%    532     /      168486
Sarasota*       0.19%    305     /      160942
Pasco*          0.40%    570     /      142731
Seminole*       0.14%    194     /      137634
Escambia*       0.43%    502     /      116648
Manatee*        0.25%    271     /      110221
Leon*           0.27%    282     /      103113
... [smaller counties truncated]

On the Times chart, the total Buchanan vote was an extreme outlier.
Most of his votes could have been fit pretty closely to a linear
regression (not necessarily passing through the origin).  On this
basis we would have expected about 800-1000 votes in Palm Beach county.
Instead we saw three to four times that number.  It was totally out of
line with the rest of the figures.

So, which analysis is correct?  Are the Buchanan votes reasonable, as
might be suspected if we look only at the percentage levels compared to
other counties?  Or are they unreasonable, as appears when we look at
them compared just to other populous counties?

The moral is that while the networks may have been guilty of simplistic
analysis by focusing solely on vote totals, it may also be wrong to
focus solely on percentages.

Yes, indeed. 

In Rev. 13-18: "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the
number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six
hundred threescore and six".

Then, is "666" the infamous number of "the" "beast"?

I do not think so because the numeric value of the name of the present pope
John Paul II (YVChNN PVLVS ShNI) is 666!

But George Hardin Brown wrote this, long time ago.

The real name of "the" Bill Gates is William Henry Gates III. Nowadays he is
known as Bill Gates (III), where "III" means the order of third. By
converting the letters of his current name to the ASCII-values and adding
his (III), you get the following:

B       66
I       73
L       76
L       76
G       71
A       65
T       84
E       69
S       83
I        1
I        1
I        1
--------------
     666 

Some might ask, "How did Bill Gates get so powerful?" Coincidence? Or just
the beginning of mankind's ultimate and total enslavement? Before you
decide, consider the following:
M  S  -  D  O  S     6  .  2  1
77+83+45+68+79+83+32+54+46+50+49 = 666
W  I  N  D  O  W  S  9  5
87+73+78+68+79+87+83+57+53+1 = 666
Coincidence? 

(Of course)

Hmmm. I had something in mind like Sir Martin Rees's Just Six Numbers, or 
better yet, Nobelist John Archibald Wheeler's It from Bit.  The mystical

Why?  Sorting either by total Buchanan votes or by
size of the county is sorting by an irrelevant statistic.  Why should
the size of the county be a factor?  If you arbitrarily drew two
lines to quadrisect Palm Beach county, the charts formed by
such sorting would change the picture significantly.  On the other
hand, all four quadrants of a chart sorted by percentage of Buchanan
votes should be unchanged by the arbitrary division, that is, all
four quadrants should still be a moderately Buchanan-favorable
0.79%.  So they like Buchanan down there in Palm Beach, that
should not be a shocker.  Some other counties like him even better.

Do we really wish to argue that high population *density* should
lead to a lower *percentage* of legitimate Buchanan votes?  Why?

Do allow me to put another spin on this that is relevant to extropians.
We know that the press can plant an idea in the minds of the masses.
What was done was to contact a telemarketing firm, which called a
bunch of people, thousands, and *planted in their brains* the idea
that they may have voted for the wrong guy, which they responded
to en-mass.  There were more people who signed petitions saying
they may have mistakenly voted for Buchanan than there were
Buchanan votes!

The scary part of this is that the press has such power to influence
the masses, and that this may someday be very destructive to what
extropians wish to accomplish.  For instance, suppose truly dramatic
breakthrus begin to be made in life extension.  Could not the press
jump all over this, and plant in the minds of the masses the idea that
a few wealthy technocratic elite have discovered the fountain of
youth, which you, the poor victimized downtrodden proletariat, will
never be able to afford, but which will result the overpopulation of
our delicate planet and in your grandchildren and their grandchildren
to being robbed of their future and ground into poverty for perpetuity, etc.

This display of power by the press is quite disturbing.  spike

False.  In a pure democracy the majority can violate any and all rights
of the individual when and if it wants to.  The "just" powers of
government are derived from the individual rights of the people.  If the
government includes the power to nullify those rights then it cannot be
just.  The founders most certainly did not have in mind to create a
simple democracy.  A "perfect" democracy is perfectly horrid.

Love, compassion and so on are also emotions.  It is questionable
whether an intelligence with no emotions whatsoever would ever really
care much or be motivated by much.  Your certainty is an interesting
opinion but it is not certain.  The Vulcans as I see them rigorously
control and channel emotional energy but I think it is technically
incorrect to say they actually have no emotions.  As I understood Star
Trek fantasy space the species actually had a super-abundance of emotion
that required such control to avoid mass destruction.

Whether the AI experiences the human equivalent emotion called hate or
not I am just as screwed if the AI logically concludes that I am a
danger to it or that the universe would be a nicer place (in some cooly
logic derived way of course) without me in it.

Well, the accepted word for the system you pillory is an ochlocracy - mob
rule. 

The implication is that people en masse are likely to abandon all decency
and history and respect for each other, a rather strange opinion in a list
where the market (a device for summing the expressed values of all players)
is held in highest regard. True, most markets are highly asymmetrical in
the purchasing power of different individuals, so if it's thought to lead
to a superior outcome than ochlocratic summations presumably the richer you
are the more moral, decent, thoughtful, prudent, insightful, just, kindly
and so on you are as well.

Look at it another way: If `In a pure democracy the majority can violate
any and all rights of the individual when and if it wants to', in any other
system some minority can violate any and all rights of the individual when
and if it wants to. I guess it depends on how much respect you have for the
other humans out there. My own opinion varies. (As I once put it, call me
Pelagius of Hippo.)

I think this misses an important point about the differences between 
markets and democracies. In a democracy, pure or not, the majority gets 
what it wants and the rest are out of luck. In a market, we all vote 
continually for all kinds of goods and services. Unlike a democracy, we do 
not all have to buy a Toyota Corolla if that is the most popular choice. 
People get a lot meaner when a voting system is win-lose.

I do think there are ways of improving a democracy to allow more winners 
(in terms of preferences). This was the kind of discussion I was hoping for 
here, rather than a blow by blow account of events. However, clearly the 
will of the people on this List has spoken, so I withdraw my request to 
hold back from chatting about the subject. Besides, some of the posts 
*have* added to what you'll find elsewhere.

Cheers,

Max

I don't wish to get into a Politics 101 argument (which I'd surely lose),
but that's certainly not how soi disant democratic politics works where I
live. 

Leaving aside that the majority actually get what they've mostly been led
by the nose to agree to, from a stunningly limited menu of options, you
usually find that representations by parliamentarians from the non-ruling
party still have some effect; that there are all kinds of effective levels
of feedback and consultation; that the press, despite being muzzled by its
immensely rich owners, does play some kind of role in allowing a diversity
of voices to be heard, etc. 

So let's say that the majority gets what it wants--but in times of
reasonable prosperity and comparative security, what the majority appears
to want (in Oz at least) is a `fair go' for everyone, according to their
lights, as long as their lights don't involve egregiously punching out the
lights of their neighbors.

Perzackly.  Current practice polarizes the voters in such a way that the
two-party system stays on top, and the closeness of this election will
lead to cries of "Nader split the liberal vote and caused this mess!" 
(By that logic, Slick Wille's ascendancy was H. Wingnut Perot's fault.)

Discover magazine has a *very* timely article on superior means of
voting
at http://www.discover.com/nov_00/gthere.html?article=featbestman.html

The current system is the plurality vote- each ballot may select only
one candidate, and the one with the most votes wins.  We can see how
poorly this has served.

Another method is approval voting, where you may select as many
candidates as you wish- say, Bush, Browne, and Hagelin.  The winner is
still the one that received the most votes, but the voters have more
choices- and can hedge their bets.  If you feel a particular candidate
is dangerous, you might vote for everyone *but* him, but also third
parties can be voted for without "throwing away" your vote. Think what
this would do for the LP (and also, alas, for the Greens).

More mathematically accurate is the Borda count, where the voter ranks
all the candidates in preferred order 1,2,3... n.  The first ranking
gives n points, second rank is n-1, etc.

The Borda count is better at resolving ties, but requires a bit more
effort (and numeracy!) on the voter's part than the approval vote. 
Either would be a vast improvement over the status quo, but are unlikely
to come about because they would open up the field to third parties, a
horror that the republicrats and democans will always unite to oppose.

All good, except you are a bit misinforming. Actually it was the Democrats
who paid for that Tues. Nov 7th afternoon telemarketing firm to go out and
call all those people in Palm Beach. Of course they have plausible deniability,
but it is pretty clear to me that they poured some serious gasoline on this
right from the beginning. I will be completed disgusted (as a FL voter!) if
the "only hand recount 4 counties and declare Gore the winner of FL" scenario
comes to pass.

What was the conclusion here: was this a bogus report or not?

If true, I wonder why frozen ovaries and frozen embryos are viable
with today's technology, but frozen eggs are not ??

I know I've mentioned the topic of freezing eggs on the list before.
I can't think of a single issue more important to a woman in her
20's and 30's who is very actively persuing her interests and
finding she's successful, but can't find the time to raise a child.

If you have not thought about this before, here are some
ramifications of freezing eggs as a way to postpone child-bearing.

Young 20ish-age couples who postponed starting a family now have
more money and more time to devote to their careers.  A large number
of women who have one goal in mind- their careers- will be flooding
the marketplace. Companies catering to egg donors start a thriving
industry (another niche for Alcor, perhaps?). Businesses will now
have to accomodate older, more established, employees in their 40's
as they begin their new families. These same companies will find
that their younger employees are now more educated than they were
before. Congresscritters will pass new laws to try to get their
hands on the money being made in the new markets that spring up.
Women wanting the old traditional role will create a backlash
against those who want to freeze their eggs.  I see the social
ramifications as greater than that caused by women's birth control
pill.

This is in error, the vote in a number of states was close enough
to warrant a recount. The reason it's only taking place in Florida
is because Florida has a law insisting on a recount if the vote is
within a certain percentage.

Look for other states to pass such laws.

The Gore camp didn't like the results of the recount (because they
still lost) hence the current situation.

It seems this election has brought up a number of things that might
require new solutions.

Since Extropians fix broken things, I thought I'd toss out a few
solutions.

PROBLEM: The ballot in Florida may have confused some voters.

SOLUTION: A national standard balloting system, open standard, so 
          all may participate equally.

PROBLEM: The media may have influenced the outcome of the vote.

SOLUTION: Ban all media from polling places, ban all media        
          discussion of election results till all polls have      
          closed.

Discuss.

He's right that looking at gerontology as a whole, progresses have been
minimal when compared, for instance, with cancer research. And his efforts
to bring more attention -- i.e. money -- into aging research should be
praised. (It's an interesting perspective that of claiming gerontology a
failure so far and therefore its need for more funding). Regarding his views
on aging, he has been a conservative scientist for a long time. But then
again, most gerontologists are like that (from personal experience).

This is an excellent article, and has a pointer to a mathmatical

Hello,

My name is Mathew and I just joined the list yesterday.  I was surprised to
read the thread about 137, 666, etc. emphasizing a connection between
physics and magic.  Personally, I feel that a lot of numerology is
essentially a mystic practice, which doesn't seem to fit in with the
Extropians principles that I read.

This is my perspective on the matter:  I agree that the structure of the
universe may be boiled down to mathematics and that it's possible to extract
that math from all things, including language.  However, I think that the
practice of mystic numerology only scratches the surface, maybe, and thusly
is highly inaccurate for understanding anything.  It's an intuitive
inkiling, not a science.

Would someone please explain what the Extropians interest is in practicing
this sort of numerology?

Isn't the notion of the "media" becoming obsolete in this day of user to
user communications?  I don't think we can usefully distinguish between
the media and ordinary people, when anyone can publish and share his
observations via the Internet.

I would not support banning discussion of elections by individuals.  In
the first place such a limitation would be almost impossible to enforce.
In the second place it sets a precedent for further erosion of freedom
of speech, one of the most important principles in guaranteeing freedom.

Ultimately the question is whether to try to limit the flow of
information.  It's true that people's behavior may change if they know
more about what is going on, including how people are voting during the
course of election day.  But IMO we have to accept this kind of change.

Giving people more information will make many changes in society.
Many of them are good, some of them are potentially bad (at least for
some groups).  We have to learn to live with a highly informed society,
rather than fighting this change.

Sure, but how long is the average duration of a marriage? How has this duration
changed? What about the quality? Prior to women's lib, it seems the prevailing
wisdom was that 'quantity has a quality all its own', and screw it if some of
the women didn't enjoy being brood mares, or if too many kids died from abuse
and neglect. While I agree that some states make it TOO easy for couples to
divorce, because marriage is WORK, and kids should be the primary priority of
concern for both parents, not jobs, careers, personal development, politics,
etc. I don't mind homosexual domestic partnerships at all, but I think that the
bar for both marriage and child bearing is too low. Marriage laws in most states
are essentially permitting two illiterates to incorporate as a partnership
without any business experience or training, no assets, and allows them to
assume major 18 year debts (children) every nine months with no credit record or
proof of ability to pay, and the ability to declare bankruptcy on those debts
while retaining ownership of the assets. If that's not a recipe for disaster, I
don't know what is.

My understanding of our aging goes about like this:  
1.  We are doubling our knowledge about once in three and a half years.
2.  We are not able so far to make great improvements in the maximum age for 
a human being.
3.  We have made and are making significant improvements in the quality of 
life for the people over say sixty five years of age.
4.  We are making increases in the average lifespan due to more people living 
longer although less than the maximum age for a human.

Is the above approximately correct?

I seriously doubt most extropians care about it at all, except as
intellectual amusement. 

Personally I have always regarded numerology as bunk since it is
usually not invariant when you change numbering systems. Hence
believers have to claim that there is something very special with a
positional decimal system if they want to claim some relevance - not
to mention the arbitrariness of alphabets and languages if you start
doing gematria.

There is of course *real* numerology: mathematical physics. Or number
theory - this morning I listened to a wonderful lecture by John Conway
about Fractran, a surprisingly simple and powerful programming
language composed of fractions. He showed how you could re-write any
arithmetic computer program into a set of fractions that can be "run"
by multiplication - that is the real wonder and power of "numerology".

Galileo, AFAIKR, found his primary relationship with is daughter, who was a nun
in a convent, and who was as well educated in astronomy as he was. Whether there
was anything between them beyond the father daughter thing (as some snarkily
surmise) I don't know.

Women were illiterate for the most part in Greek society, little more than
chattel. Most all significant social and personal relationships among Greek
intelligentsia were between males, and I presume that since such intelligent
males had such difficulty finding 'intelligent' educated women to have true
relationships with that the homosexual relationship was resorted to.

Yes, except that maximum age isn't a very precise model for organisms like
people.  A more precise model is that we have a base health (base 
chance of dying per year) and an aging rate (doubling time for the
death rate).  Maximum lifespan is an epiphenomenon; for any given
set of parameters and finite population size you will eventually see
everyone from a given cohort dead.  Some organisms like salmon
do have a genuine maximum lifespans arising from direct biological
processes and not as a statistical epiphenomenom.

So far we have improved our base rate of dying but not our aging rate.
This increases both our life expectancy and maximum lifespan, at a 
rate of 1 to 2 years per decade (depending on whose data and 
statistical models you use).  This corresponds with changes we've
had from other apes; their aging rates are very similar to ours but
their base health is orders of magnitude less.  These differences
may be due to culture rather than biology; rather than being 
healthier than other apes we just take care of ourselves better.

I'm with you there. I know I'm a law abiding citizen. I also typically am armed.
I have nothing to fear legally from cops, so any action they take against me is
by definition illegal action, and I am legally able (and justified) to defend
myself against such *felonious* criminal actions by police. Any jurisdiction
which would treat me any differently is, by definition, a tyranny. Insisting on
living under tyranny implies the acceptance of that tyranny, if the means and
ability to leave that tyranny exist. If you fear such tyranny, vote with your
feet. If you don't, its like not voting: you don't get to complain.

Sure, but thats because they view a cellphone as a daily essential. Really, the
FDA has no legal jurisdiction. This should be either an EPA, CDCP, or Consumer
Safety (under Commerce) issue.

I wouldn't say that Kennedy was a lame duck, and he won by a similarly slim
margin (even allegedly stole the election from Nixon, if stories about Daley's
dad's actions in Chicago are true). However, your point has merit, even though
it seems that people will take the wrong idea from it and assume that we must
change things to a mobocracy.

It's mostly just a curiousity and a form of amusement- a reminder of the

the same superstitious barbarians that we've been since the beginning.

I think the solution is twofold:  First, Internet voting; second, Internet
revoting.  Let any Internet voter change their vote as often as they like,
over the course of a week, after the initial results start coming in.  That
way, everyone can vote their conscience for Browne or Nader first, then switch
their vote to Bush or Gore when it becomes clear that the third parties are
not going to win... *if* third parties don't actually start winning, under
such a system.  It would maximize voter turnout... I think... especially in
closely disputed elections.  How many Floridans would turn out for a revote? 
80%?  90%?  Of course, there's also the possibility that people won't bother
to vote unless it looks like the election is close or that their
favorite/unfavorite candidate is losing/winning.

There's also the possibility of most voters holding their vote till the last
minute, like auctions on eBay.  I'm not quite sure how to handle that.

The problem with the market analogy is that it is not a Bayesian market. Not
only are most people incapable of accurately determining the true 'value' of
their own opinions, but they are systematically lied to by both candidates and
the media as to the 'value' of the candidate's opinions, and are under constant
attack by 'opinion theives' in the media, special interest groups, and political
parties who try to manipulate people's thinking. So a democratic system is a
good example of an anti-Bayesian market.

There is a difference between respecting most of your fellow citizens, and
respecting that small minority of incorrigibly corrupt power mongers who will do
and say anthing to attain power.

I thought I'd create a simple version of the electoral problem as
I see it.

Okay we have two candidates X and Y.

They live in a country with 3 states (A,B,C) each has 100 voters.

Each state has 1 electoral vote, winner take all.

Whoever gets 2 electoral votes wins.

X is Anti-gun
Y is Pro-gun

Okay state A is pretty normal, but Joe Dees lives there so
Candidate X wins 51/49.

Candidate  Votes  Electoral
X           51        1
Y           49        0

Now we go to state B which is also pretty normal, But Zero lives
there so once again X wins 51/49.

Candidate  Votes  Electoral
X          102        2
Y           98        0

Now we are in state C. Now candidate X has never even gone to visit
C. Why? Brian, Mike, Chuck, Ron, and all the others who believe in
the right to defend themselves live there, it's a big NRA
stronghold, so the vote goes 99/1 for Y.

Candidate  Votes  Electoral
X          103       2
Y          197       1


So X wins with barely 1/3rd of the vote.

State C decides to secede. ;)

I've seen the ballots used, the butterfly ballots used are the SAME type used in
Bill Daley's home turf of Cook County, Illinois. The dems have complained about
the arrows on them being 'confusing', when it is the arrows that are the LEAST
confusing thing about that ballot, and are likely its saving grace.

Media, parties, and special interest groups should be banned from announcing
results until officially announced (which should be after all polls are closed).
Our right to vote uninflenced and unfettered is more important than their right
to free speech. How could this be accomplished? Simple: Declare that any media
announcing a state is for one candidate prior to the polls closing is to be
treated as campaign contributions to that candidate (and any contribution over
the corporate limit is, by definition an illegal donation). Candidates that
accept illegal donations and do not return them prior to the election are to be
invalidated as legal candidates. Any media or group can be exempted from these
rules if they can certify that neither they, their parent or subsidiary
corporations, or any employees, employees spouses,  employees dependents, or
stockholders/trustees/directors/members have contributed to the campaigns.

Yes.  This is an example of how a truth can be so absurd that

PROBLEM: Primaries staged over several months may eliminate the   
         overall most popular candidate. (I.E. McCain)

SOLUTION: Hold all primaries on the same day.

Okay, I'm zeroing in on another big problem here, the primary
system.

The big problem here is not only when the primaries are held, but
the fact that individual states have different rules. John McCain
got knocked out by the "Super Tuesday"  winner-take-all vote in
California.

Another problem is people cross-voting in the primary, trying to
knock out the other parties most important candidate.

This is a good example, and if your three states have a federal constitution
that says it may be amended by only a simple majority of congress and 2/3 of the
states, you would have problems (assuming you have more than one congressman
from each state, or that the party of the presidential winner also wins that
congressional seat.) Fortunately things are more complex than that, although if
its up to the president to appoint supreme court judges, and those judges have
the ability to redefine what words in the constitution actually mean, then you
would then be in trouble.

I'm not talking about banning discussion of elections by
individuals, just the broadcast media, and only for the duration of
voting. Enforcing should be easy.

It's trying to limit the negative effect of information during
voting hours only. Can you suggest a positive use for this flow?
During the voting hours only?

There a difference between information being used to inform, and
used to influence an outcome.

The fact that broadcast media is biased is a problem.

This would be a violation of free speech. "The media", however it is 
defined, can discuss anything they want with or without the intention of 
influencing the outcome of the election.

It's just a short time delay. Considerably less an infringement
then the three day waiting period for handguns. Hey that's an idea!
Let's make all infringements equal....

The media, as corporations, are de facto government entities. Unobjective news
media are thus biased government entities campaigning for a candidate.
Announcing a candidate winning a state before polls close and official winners
are announced is campaigning for that candidate, because it discourages opposing
voters from going to the polls, and is thus a violation of free speech limits.
Media reporters, editors, and executives tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat,
whose typical idea of 'objectivity' is to spout the moderate liberal agenda and
claiming that is middle of the road. (Middle of the Democrat road, maybe).

Holding all primaries on the same day gives the advantage to the incumbent
and/or whoever has the most money. Holding early primaries in small states
allows a less affluent candidate to gain exposure and credibility (and thus the
increased ability to raise funds for more expensive large states). McCain did
well here in NH, and gave him enough exposure for the people to learn why he is
more than what his handlers and the media said he was: he has a mean streak,
holds grudges, has few friends among his co-workers, and is willing to spout the
accepted government line on the 2nd amendment in order to get 'soccer mom'
votes, contrary to his claims. If there had not been a long period of exposure
for McCain between NH/Iowa and Super Tuesday, most people would not have found
this out. Additionally, if the primaries were not open primaries (i.e. people
could cross party lines to vote in a primary), then 3rd party candidates would
have better showing. Primaries are not to select popular candidates among the
population, but popular candidates among party membership. If you insist on
being an independent, then you shouldn't get to select which nominated candidate
you get from each party. Thats what the write-in candidate is for.

Excuse me, but the en*tire* human race was illiterate for, what, 40,000,
90,000 years?  Marriage existed long before written language... perhaps before
spoken language.  Who are you to decide what standards people should be held
to before being allowed to marry?  Maybe it's the people who are least
fortunate who most need to find someone, so that they can be less fortunate
together.

Impressive that he could get this out so fast.  I note in 
http://elections.fas.harvard.edu/node3.html
that this isn't the only really outrageous Buchanan outlier, just the only
only one that would make a difference.  (Actually Richmond, NH, might
make a difference too).  Makes me wonder how much hanky-panky,
intentional or otherwise, is going on.  Do they use these kinds of

be investigated for possible irregularities.  This would be particularly
useful where irregularities are unintentional, as in Palm Beach.

PROBLEM: how to increase the number of people who vote.

SOLUTION: retain a portion of lottery winnings, on election day
          everyone who votes gets a quick pick for a shot at a 
          million bucks.

I've never seriuosly suggested this because it would attract the
very people I would prefer to just stay home. Also why I hope for
bad weather on election day.

Actually that NH hotspot is the ground zero of the new england Buchananites,
which won NH for Buchanan against the elder Bush in 1992.

Eli, zero plus zero still equals zero, and adding a negative to that (a
dependent) equals a negative. Extropy is about promoting positive sum games, not
perpetrating zero or negative sum games. Extropy demands personal responsibility
and individual enhancement. Getting a big L tatooed on your forehead isn't an
extropic body modification, and forcing one on someone else prior to birth is
worse. I never said that I should decide other people's standards, I was merely
pointing out the idiocy of those pre-existing standards. Changing those
standards is, in fact, a goal IMHO extropians should strive for convincing the
rest of humanity to support.

you see, or you dream, a

coffin empty = 66
coffin and dead woman = 3
coffin and dead man = 84
coffin & vampire = 72
coffin (wooden) = 14
coffin (metal) = 24
coffin in the church = 19
coffin in the grave = 47
etc. etc.

Posit an electronic poll with cumulative vote tallies posted
instantaneously to the net and other media. In a dispersed time zone nation
like the USA (or Oz, although our least populous states are over on the
west), this will presumably see enormous chaotic fluctuations among
undecided voters, increasingly feverish efforts to get out the vote as the
long day wears on, etc. Naively, this is surely a good thing (assuming that
voting is not intrinsically wicked); in practice, maybe it would provide
information giving some moeities more advantage than others and more
incentive for targeted bribes/dirty tricks etc.

This did seem to be a good analysis from what I could tell.  It found
that you could pretty well predict the Buchanan vote in a county based
on the Bush and Nader vote percentages, and West Palm Beach was an
extreme anomaly.

I was trying to think of a way to apply fair-division theory to these
kinds of disputes.  You know, the old "I cut and you choose" method
of dividing a birthday cake.  You have this sort of strategic space
in which the two sides can make moves, and each wants to maximize his
chances of winning, just like with the cake each wants to maximize the
size of his piece.

Unfortunately it doesn't work because at some point you need to say
something like, Bush, would you be satisfied with the outcome if we
assigned all the Gore votes to you, and all of your votes to Gore?
That way you could get each guy to agree to a policy which gave each
side a fair shot.

But this is obviously ludicrous in the context of an election where
people are expressing their preferences.  Fairness is not the same as
equal division, it's just that in this case, with the vote so close,
it looks somewhat similar.

They don't deserve a say in their own future? Even as a jest, this is a
creepy implication, and one I have sometimes detected lurking beneath the
surface of many posts on this list (not to say brandished with big flashing
lights). [pre-emptive apologies to Brian; I do not mean that *he* is
creepy, just that the suggestion is]

In reality, all sort of outcomes could follow. The bored or incompetent
could find it easiest to spoil their votes, thereby voiding their allegedly
worthless or malign opinions anyway. Or you might find an enhanced `donkey
vote' as it's called in Australia, where voters start at the top and number
down (in the silly non-preferential US system I assume that means the
candidate at the top of the ballot picks up the donkeys). But consider: in
Oz, where voting is compulsory and failure to turn out (even in bad
weather) attracts a fine, we tend to elect middle of the road standard
Western-style representatives. In the last election, all those thumb
sucking lottery besotted dolts voted in (by a small margin) a conservative
party, one that promised to reduce many social security benefits.

Well, one use of the Internet is for publishing web pages, which is
akin to broadcasting.  Presumably your ban would need to apply to web
publishers in addition to TV, right?

An interesting example in the recent election was Matt Drudge,
whose site drudgereport.com published the early exit poll results,
contravening the stated policy of the consortium which conducted the
polls, Voter News Service.  He may still get sued for this, we'll see.
Would you muzzle Matt Drudge?  Is he merely an influential individual,
or does he count as a broadcaster?  How to decide?  What happens as
others become successful publishing their own opinions?

I don't see how you can draw a meaningful line between individuals and
the media, given that there are a number of influential individuals
(and you can bet that more such personal sites would spring up if you
did succeed in quashing media discussion).  Then there are discussion
groups like alt.politics (which is actually where I found Drudge's
reports, his site was overloaded all day), chat rooms and a host of
other communication options.

Face it, the future is moving towards increased information flow.
Any proposal to limit political discussion is a non-starter, IMO.

I don't think the burden of proof ought to be on someone justifying
a positive use for people being able to communicate with each other.
Rather, you need to show that there is very significant harm in allowing
them to do so, in order to justify muzzling their natural ability to
communicate.

Why should we restrict people from learning how others are voting?
What is the harm?

If it really were so harmful, shouldn't we disallow pre-election polling?
That gives people an idea about how others should vote.  Granted it is
not as accurate, but as we have seen, same-day reports are not always
100% accurate either (Drudge had Florida going overwhelmingly for Gore,
which is why the networks called it 15 minutes after most but not all
of the polls closed).

Even if such information influences votes, don't people have the right
to use whatever information they choose in making decisions?  What gives
us the omniscience to say that the world would be a better place if each
person were to decide without any information about what others are doing?

There is plenty of experimental and theoretical reason to think that
giving people the maximum of information will help them.  Take the famous
Delphi system, in which experts are polled, and then given feedback about
what other experts said in order to revise their estimates.  The feedback
is said to greatly improve accuracy.  Or look at the theoretical results
in which social information institutions evolve to be trustworthy so that
average individuals don't have to be experts on everything in order to
still make decent decisions.  People implicitly rely on the judgement
of their fellows being roughly accurate most of the time.

It seems to me to be contrary to the principle of respect for individual
autonomy to try to put a ban like this into place.  Better to let people
decide for themselves what information they want to use.

I like this.  Combine it with Eliezer's idea to let people vote more
than once (each vote superceding their earlier ones) and you might
see some interesting effects.

Now eliminate the fixed time limit, and let the vote be settled once
there is a consensus, that is, one candidate has had the highest score,
stably, for some extended period of time.

This might give you some of the effects of Borda count type systems,
where you'd end up with a candidate who was acceptable to all even if
not the first choice of most.

Or do you think you'd see constant fluctuation?  Like A beats B, B
beats C, and C beats A, so we constantly cycle through them?  I wonder.
It would seem kind of stupid for people to get stuck in a cycle like that.

Curt, this is not intended as a criticism of you in any way,
but this anaysis is in my opinion completely bogus and
irrelevant.  They calculated the predictor of expected
Buchanan votes by the number of Nader votes!  The
reasoning there is quite fautly, and there is no reason
whatsoever the number of Nader fans should be used to
calculate the probability of a Buchanan vote in Florida.

Recall that Nader was one of those promoting the idea
of spending billlllions and billlllions of dollars to convert
the Everglades reclaimed farmland back into a god-forsaken
swamp, and also recall that Pam Beach county is not so
far from the Everglades.  Where are the other handful of
Florida counties that were more Pro_Buchanan than
Palm Beach?  spike

And what of those, typically poor and/or with non-easily-mobile assets

No; Buchanan and Nader voters are two very distinct groups
of people and I would expect a strong negative covariance.
Buchanan's supporters are mostly conservative and rural
while Nader's are liberal and urban.  The Palm Beach outlier
graph I've seen several times shows that Buchanan's vote
percentage decreases with the size of the county, presumably
due to the rural effect.

By percentage, there are a few: very small, very rural, 
very conservative, and very few votes for Nader.

One reform I hope to see come out of this situation is some kind of standard
balloting system. Computers could be used to make most of these
irregularities impossible. They could make it impossible to submit an
illegal ballot. They could display the names of candidates the voter has
tentatively chosen for his confirmation. They could warn him if he has left
any office unvoted. To maintain a paper trail as a safeguard, for each
office voted a ballot slip could be printed: 10 offices, 10 slips. That
would allow the machine to pre-sort them by the voter's choices. If, to
reasonable tolerances, they had a standard weight, the machine count could
be verified by weighing each stack of ballot slips. The voter could be given
the chance to review the ballot slips for errors. He could abort and start
over, or confirm and allow the ballot slips to fall on the stacks. The
tallies could be kept essentially in real time as the voting progressed, and
the winner of a state would be known with certainty when the poll closed.
This seems like a reasonable standard to me.

As far as other voting systems I think you want to keep things as simple as
possible. That seems to be a weakness of the Borda system if there are many
choices. How about just giving the voter a chance to make a second choice?.
As a first stage elimination determine the two highest vote-getters from
first choices. If the voter's first choice is not among the two highest, but
his second choice is, then count his second choice in a second-stage
supplemental count. Of course this could be generalized from 2 choices and 2
counts to n choices and n counts if you wanted. Having two choices would
make it more appealing to vote for an 'unelectable candidate'. The second
choice could be kept for the mainstream candidate you least dislike. This
system would make it much easier for a "fringe" party to gain substantial
support. And for precisely that reason, I don't think there is a snowball's
chance in hell that the Dems and Reps would allow it to come into existence.
But it's interesting to think about.

That "stunningly limited menu of options" as you nicely put it, surely adds 
to my point. Democratic systems (currently) are not well geared to offering 
multiple options. One way of possibly improving on this might be Kosko's 
fuzzy tax form, though I can see problems with implementing it.

Point taken. Yet these avenues of influence, while allowing in more voices, 
may actually move the final decision (in the form of legislation) *further* 
away from the "will of the people". As you said, there's no need to get 
into Politics 101. We're surely all familiar with the problem arising from 
the concentrated incentives of pressure groups to impose costs on others 
where those costs are so diffused as not to be worth organizing against by 
the much larger number of losers.

Come to think of it, they *don't* generally teach that in Politics 101, but 
they should. A good dose of Frederic Bastiat's classic essay Ce qu'on voit 
et ce qu'on ne voit pas (or Henry Hazlitt's extended version in Economics 
in One Lesson  would help clarify many discussions on political economy.

I just realized, if it gets to the point where we can vote online, then what 
is to prevent the elimination of congress altogether, and simply have people 
vote directly for each bill (besides the time it would take)? Or at least 
replace one of the arms of the legislature with them. Or this, or that.. 
etc.. there's a lot of ways to do it. At minimum, a public vote of 66% 
should be able to veto or override the president's veto of any bill.

Actually, Gore doesn't have anything to do with this situation.  Florida law
mandates or authorizes SIX counts of votes to occur.  Everything that has
happened in Florida is specifically prescribed by law.  Even the recounts,
hand-counts, voter lawsuits and judicial review of the vote is all going
according to the plan described by our lawmakers.  Only Bush's lawsuit tried
to deviate from Florida law, and it was denied.  This is how the election is
supposed to occur under Florida law when the vote is this close.

COUNT ONE:  EXIT POLLING
Our state law allows news media to conduct exit polling and to announce the
results of the exit polling when the majority of counties have closed their
polls.  We have two time zones.  After the majority of our polls were closed
in the eastern timezone, the exit polls clearly showed Gore ahead by 20,000
or so votes.  The exit polls projected Gore to be the clear winner, and this
is what was reported by all the new media.

COUNT TWO:  MACHINE COUNT
Our state law requires all votes to be counted and reported.  This produced
the first indication that the computers were not recording the vote the same
way as the exit polls.  The news media moved Florida back into the
too-close-to-call column.

COUNT THREE:  MACHINE RECOUNT
Our state law requires that all votes be recounted if the initial count
shows the top two candidates to be within one-half of one percent of each
other.  This triggered the first round of recounts.  This also forbids the
original count from being certified as official.

COUNT FOUR:  SAMPLE HAND COUNT
Our state law allows any candidate to call for a recount if the final count
is close or if the accuracy of the machine counts is questioned.  Gore
requested this recount on both grounds in four counties.  It is not only
possible, but is specifically allowed by law.  In the case of questioning
the accuracy of the machine counts, the law specifically authorizes hand
counts to check the machines.  To save work, the county is allowed to
perform an initial hand-count of a small sample to test the machines.  This
is the first hand-count.

COUNT FIVE:  COMPLETE HAND COUNT
If the above hand count shows a dramatic difference between what the
machines report and what the humans count, the election officials have the
authority to call for a total hand count.  This occurred in Palm Beach
county.  They said that they found so many votes that were not counted by
the machines, that a hand count was warranted.  Broward county had the
opposite result.  They hand counted two-thirds of one percent of their
votes.  They found four votes that were not counted by the machines.  They
decided that this was not enough of an error to warrant a hand count of all
the votes.

COUNT SIX:  ABSENTEE BALLOT COUNT
The final count occurs on Friday when the absentee ballots come in.  These
votes must be counted at that time, and the votes must be added to the
totals.  The final total for the whole state cannot be certified until then.
The initial certification on Tuesday can be used to lock in existing votes,
but cannot prevent new votes from being added as they get counted.  This
will be the final count authorized by Florida law.  Any numbers reported
before this sixth count cannot be certified as official under Florida law.

All of these counts have and will occur because of Florida law.  Gore had
not interfered with our normal election process yet.  Bush is tried to
overturn our local laws, but failed.  The Palm Beach lawsuits are
specifically allowed by law which even goes so far as to allow the judge to
reallocate the vote if it does not accurately reflect the intent of the
voters.  Everything down here is going according to plan.  The country
should just be patient and wait.  We are not the only state that is
recounting.

I acknowledge the perception and I disagree that this is a
legitimate means of comparing candidates.  I calculate thus:
if a county were to have some *special reason* to have
strong negative feelings towards one of the non-mainstream
candidates, then the other non-mainstream candidates, to
whom the county had no special antipathy, would appear
to be anomalously favored.  Palm Beach had a special reason
to have heartburn with Nader: his green stance doesnt play
well in those parts.

The URL gives the formulas used to determine the 15 sigma
result, and it basically looks at the ratio of non-mainstream
candidate votes.  This approach does not take into account the
anti-Nader fervor in the county, which I would expect to be
very strong, with so large a retired population.  I expect that
generation will not look favorably on a candidate that
wishes to spend buttloads of money to create habitats for
mosquitos.

Note that I am not arguing that some voters mistakenly
cast the wrong vote, I imagine a few did that.  But looking
at the Nader votes is the wrong way to determine it.  spike

Well, yes, of course Alcor could diversify. But why stop at the
cryopreservation of eggs?

Amara, you could go through one IVF cycle and perhaps retrieve 9 eggs. Have
three eggs frozen. Have the other six fertilized in vitro with sperm donated
from six different Extropians. Freeze three of these resulting embryos and
implant the other three. Carry all three to term. However prior to natural
delivery have Alcor "extract" and cryopreserve two fetuses. Later, when
you're ready for another child, ring up Alcor.

If Nader's observed vote is low for the area, then Buchanan's 
predicted vote would be *higher* and so the observed discrepancy
is too low.  You're claiming the author *underestimated* the
accidental Gore --> Buchanan shifts.

Well, based on the results elsewhere, the Nader vote is a good
way to estimate.  The author tried several other methods to 
estimate the excess goof rates, and all showed Gore lost thousands
of votes.  That's normally irrelevant, which is why it happened.
If you've got a better estimator, I'm sure you could find an poly sci
academic who's open to suggestions; quite possible the author of 
the paper would look at other estimators as it would improve the
quality of the paper.

Not that I believe in numerology, but the connection of numbers to words was
more obvious to the ancient Hebrews than it is to us today.  The Hebrew
letters were also used as numbers.  They did not have separate digits like
we do.  Unlike roman numerals, in which some letters can represent numbers,
in Hebrew all letters can be numbers.

Unlike English words which have to be converted to numbers via a
correspondence code, in Hebrew every word is literally identical to some
number.  Every word had a numeric value.  If you see a fragment of Hebrew
symbols, there is no way to know whether they were letters or numbers in
their original context.  The concept that words and numbers were related was
an obvious artifact of their language system.

The other complicating factor in this belief is the fact that Hebrew was
written without vowels.  Every two-symbol combination of Hebrew glyphs could
be read as a Hebrew noun or a two-digit number.  Every three-symbol
combination of Hebrew glyphs could be read as a verb or a three-digit
number.  Every five-digit combination of Hebrew glyphs could be read as a
simple noun-verb sentence as well as a five digit number.

Unlike English where a random series of letters produces gibberish, in
Hebrew any random series of numbers can be read into words and sentence.  By
rolling dice, dealing cards, or casting lots, the Hebrews could read words
and sentences.  Imagine a lottery drawing where every winning combination
spells out a phrase.  Imagine if every arithmetic problems results in an
object or an idea.  In Hebrew, the first letter is Aleph.  The first number
is Aleph.  The cow in the field is Aleph.  They are all the same word or
concept used in different contexts.  The concept that words equal numbers
equal abstract concepts seemed obvious to the ancient Hebrews.

This lead to the evolution of a lot of divination techniques.  It was easy
to ask a question, roll dice and read an answer.  Any roll of the dice would
give structured and intelligible answers that would put any magic 8-ball to
shame.  This also lead to superstition and fear of omens everywhere.  It was
hard to ignore daily omens when every day occurrences or groupings would
spell out words or phrases.  Imagine that the grouping of cattle in the
field, say a pair here, three there, and a dozen over there, spelled out
messages.  Consider if every flock of birds could spell out an idea.
Imagine that blades of grass could form words and sentences.  Imagine if
"meanings" would be automatically apparent in every grouping of objects, in
every scene or in every name.

It would be easy to see these obvious signs being noticed, interpreted and
often believed to be hidden messages from some underlying force that exists
invisibly behind all reality.  This would be a form of subliminal messaging
that would be hard to avoid.  Subtle ideas and concepts would creep in
thoroughly mundane life everywhere.  Names would be instantly associated
with objects or actions.  Locations would automatically be interpreted with
meaning.

You know, even in my own parents' Orthodox Jewish household, Gematria was
regarded as being incredibly pointless.  My father once gave a lecture in
which he proved that "children of Israel" was equivalent to "pizza with
mushrooms".  (I may be remembering the exact words wrong, but...)  There's
also a frequently circulated humorous Gematria on the Internet which starts
out with the usual tricks and then descends into the sordid depths of integral
calculus.  Anyone who's ever played with Gematria and has the least vestige of
skeptical intelligence - this includes my father, a major fan of the
_Skeptical Inquirer_ - knows that you can prove absolutely anything with
Gematria, and thus all such proofs have zero relation to reality.

Michael S. Lorrey,
> I've seen the ballots used, the butterfly ballots used are the
> SAME type used in Bill Daley's home turf of Cook County, Illinois.

The ones I saw on TV from Cook County seemed to have two columns of bubbles
in the center.  The left column was for the names on the left, and the right
column was for the names on the right.

The Palm Beach ballot was worse then I realized.  It's hard to see in the
pictures, but the arrows also have numbers in them.  Unfortunately, these
numbers do not match the candidate's position number or the voting machine's
hole number.  This number actually corresponds to the computer card hole
number which is behind the hold punch.

Al Gore's name was #2 on the ballot, #5 on the arrow, and #3 hole to punch.
The directions said to punch the hole next to the name.  The arrow seemed to
say to punch the hole next to the arrow.  The number seemed to say to punch
hole #5.  This is further confused if the voter tried to pull the ballot
down so that arrow #5 actually lined up with hole #5.

This is not as easy as it sounds.

Firstly, this would skew voting toward computer-literate voters.  Not
everyone has a computer.  We would have instant access in our homes, while
noncomputer users would have to go and vote at a polling place as usual.

Secondly, computers are not secure enough to do voting.  Real computer
security is hard to achieve.  There have been too many errors with
commercial sites for me to trust all voting precincts to get it right.

Thirdly, computers are not reliable.  There have been too many outages and
lost data to trust this.  Imagine if all ISPs in all counties had to be up
and working on the same night, and that all network pipes had to have enough
bandwidth to not lose any connections or packets.

A more direct and reliable system would actually be postal mail, cable TV,
or telephone voting.  Or maybe a combination of all, so if any system was
down another could be used.

These methods also prevent the media from monitoring the results.  I know
people blame the media for our current mess.  But I'm glad they alerted the
nation to the fact that the reported numbers in Florida didn't match what
people claimed they were voting.

Sources please?  I live down here, and I have not heard this.  There is a
switchboard, but it is not a telemarketing firm and voters have to call
them.

None of these statistics really matter.  The real clue is that exit polls
don't match the recorded votes.  The exit polls sampled/extrapolated Gore as
being way ahead of Bush and Buchanan getting very few votes.

Sure. You just have to either simulate it by solving the Schroedinger
equation for around ~10^25 particles, or do a semiclassical
approximation using molecular simulation software. Since we are doing
a model rather than an emulation, we can simplify things a bit by
replacing the pair with two particles. So we learn that the stability
of relationships depends on the energy level, angular momentum and
spin of the participants. The amount of work is proportional to
Planck's constant, showing that in a Newtonian universe no work to
maintain relationships would be required. Did I miss something?

I would point out that you do get lots of options if you have a parliamentary
system like in Israel and Italy; the net effect being its' hard to get together
a government that can stay in power long enough to do anything.

Notice that some apparently democratic systems also have their biases

When one works with Gematria, they're sure to come up with quite a pile of

life that, frankly, are too weird for the mere words I was trying to

None taken ;) I think it's a good thing to get creepy feeling about
such things.

I've been heavily influenced in such matters by Robert Heinleins
"Starship Troopers". I guess the question I'm asking is "at what
price citizenship". It pains me that people who have never lifted
their little finger to actually do anything for this country, or
bothered to study the issues actually get to vote. I'm not
suggesting they have their votes taken away, but it's nice to see
them earn it, even if it only means going out in the rain.

Heinlein answered it in Starship troopers by only having Veterans
vote.

Something to think about. The sad part is that I really do think
the lottery bit would dramatically increase turnout.

I'm not muzzling anyone, I'm talking about delaying talking about
an on going process till it's completed. As I've already pointed
out we have reasonable time delays on the Second Amendment already,
why not the first?

At some point individuals become "common carriers" and subject to
regulation.

Make a law, punish people who break the law, simple.

I do this for a living (I'm reading Gilders Telecosm now), and as
I've already said, I'm not out to limit any discussion, just impose
a delay for the duration of the polling.

I went to bed when I heard that Gore had won Florida, people
standing in line in California went home thinking they were wasting
there time.

There has already been testimony from people who heard this and

As I've said before, I'm not out to limit the discussion, just
impose a timedelay during the polling, nothing more.

People follow trends, if everyone thinks everyone else is voting
for someone they will too. Everyone likes to be on the winning
side.

It's not a ban, just a delay, you can talk about anything you like
up to the moment the polls open, you can talk about anything you
like during, EXCEPT what is going on at the polls.

As I've already pointed out the media is biased, they were clearly
out to elect a specific candidate.

Sometimes things move fast. This morning on the news, David Orr the
cook county registrar of voters was demonstrating a new idea.

We've started using a desktop computer based machine that tabulates
the votes. Instead of dropping a ballot into a ballot box to be
counted later, Orr is suggesting placing the ballot directly into
the machine. The machine will reject it if there is a double vote,
so the person can vote over.

This has to be voted on, and may be approved by the end of the
week.

I like the idea of a Borda system for the primary.

On the day of the primary all states would vote.

The first part of the ballot would give you the opportunity to list
a party affiliation, Democratic, Republician, Green, Libertarian,
Extropian, what have you.

Then you would vote for the candidates, all candidates, in your
order of preference. This would allow for a number of different
types of analysis based on location, party affiliation, what have
you. This primary could be preceded by debates in which all
candidates could participate.

The results of this primary would be good fodder for the individual
parties conventions.

In the current system it's a matter of semeiotics.

The reason New Hampshire matters is because New Hampshire is FIRST.
The amount of money spent per inhabitant is huge compared to later
on. As you correctly pointed out establishing an early lead means
a candidate can more easily gather additional funds.

The problem is that for the rest of us it eliminates choice. By the
time the primaries get to us in Illinois the only decision was
whether or not to bother going to the polls to vote for the only
guy still left in. I voted for Keyes, because he was still in the
running, (and I liked him) McCain dropped out the week before the
primary.

There is no reason to belong to a political party if your
membership has no affect on your ability to choose.

The primary system is badly flawed and needs to be
modified/replaced. I've already suggested an alternative in another
post.

I would require that anyone who presumes to vote instead of congress would have

A community is not an asset that belongs to you, and if its tyrannical, it must
not be worth much, or else you must enjoy tyrannical communities. Make up your
mind. I personally find that more poor people move around far more frequently
than more affluent people, so your argument does not hold. Welfare people seem
to find it quite easy to move from city to city and state to state to follow the
best benefits, according to the data. U-HAUL and KOA are wonderful things. I
could move my own household for $500-$1000 from coast to coast with little
trouble. People seem to excel at finding reasons to not do things far more than
finding reasons to do things.

I don't believe in exit polls. They claim to pick a 'random' sample of voters to
question, but its impossible for individual humans to pick other people
randomly. They will always bias their selection to those who seem similar to
them. If its liberal soccer moms running the exit polls, more liberal soccer
moms will get questioned, and more people in similar socio-economic strata will
be selected.

WOW. Talk about a supersaturated memetic solution. No wonder there were so many
prophets and other religious madmen running around all the time there (not that
that has changed much). They were literally being programmed by their language
acting as a memetic compiler, creating executable memes based on the gibberish
of nature, like reading the random typing of monkeys and finding Shakespeare in
every sentence.

I would say not. Web page publishing is publishing, while mass email is a
broadcast medium. The two are different. One depends on push, the other on pull.
It might be argued that because web publishing can be so up to the minute, it
might legalistically be considered more like broadcasting. I do like the idea of
waiting periods. If the 2nd amendment can have a 3 day waiting muzzle on it, the
same thing should apply to speech.

I would say that the standard for that should be set at interstate communication
and more than what? In terms of audience, if there is no associative enclosure
on audience membership (i.e. if you are not members of the same group, if you
have no registration and/or subscription process, your content is freely
available to all) then it might be more practically considered a broadcast, as
spam is for similar reasons.

Actually I saw a woman from the VNS (the organization that does the exit
polls) last Wednesday night I believe explaining why the exit polls were
wrong. Apparently there was some human error somewhere in their org that
mis-entered one or more of the numbers. Even if we assume some mixup in
palm beach it still woulda been too close for the VNS to call in FL... I
believe their own errors internally guided them to call it for Gore. I
do not have a source for this as it was on TV (CNN).

However, because NH's population is only 1.2 million, in a relatively small but
variable geographic area (~80 miles wide by ~250 tall), with only a handful of
TV stations, any candidate with a few hundred thousand bucks can gain
significant exposure early on (and because many other areas of the country are
watching via TV news, those candidates get lots of free exposure nationwide,
rather than having to pay for it). Failing to do this limits your choices in
Illinois as well as ours, because having primaries all the same day guarrantees
that only one or two candidates could cough up the funds to compete at that
level, at most. If that system had been in place last year, there would have
been no need of a primary, as only Bush would have had the funds to get exposure
in every state. Starting in smaller states first allows candidates that are not
bought and paid for by the multinationals to gain exposure and gives people real
choice.

I think it would have been interesting if the individual candidates
had produced their own videotapes. (DVD?)

They needn't have been long, maybe a half hour or so, just to
explain the issues. They could have given them out on request, or
even charged a small contribution.

People could exchange them to get a general idea of all the
candidates "Hey have you seen the Keyes tape yet? The best one yet
in my opinion!"

How about a movie theatre option, you go to the theatre, watch a
half hour of a candidate and get the movie for free...

Ideas.....

Max,
I'm glad you thought to pass this on, I didn't even think of this list (I mostly
thought of people at schools in my area)
If anyone is interested in any of these fellowships, please send for
information.
     I was a '93 Koch Summer Fellow, and attended 1 IHS seminar in Baltimore. It
is very well worthwhile, academically, socially and generally. You meet with a
lot of people involved in libertarian-related endeavors, and you get a chance to
learn how to put what you've got to use. I think it goes along with the
extropian philosophy very well. These awards are only part of the possibilities.
     If you're not a student, pass this on, even to schools in your areas.
Mike

The problem is where to move to. There is no book I know which list
extropian/libertarian, low tax, good climate, good medical care, and an
intellectual climate areas of the world. 

Amsterdam perhaps but the tax rate would kill me.

Also, since I am gay, homophobia in many areas of the world (and the US) is
a problem.

As I already pointed out, here in Illinois we did NOT get a choice,
or at least a very poor one.

There is no reason that all the candidates can't be allowed to
participate in a debate or question or answer type session under
Universal access requirements.

Then the Borda style primary, followed by the conventions, then
whatever.

The current system is okay for New Hampshire, it seriously degrades
every day after that. In other words it sucks for the rest of us.

Thanks for the quick source reference!  This does look pretty bogus.
There's no way to tell how many complaints were original and how many were
solicited.

Ralph, I believe that it's the Cato Institute that annually publishes a 
"freedom index" (or something to that effect) rating countries on degree of 
freedom from a libertarian perspective. However, I don't think they include 
sensible attitudes towards homosexuality. Can someone provide a pointer to 
the index?

We used to believe that a million monkeys typing on a million typewriters
would produce great works of literature.  Now with the Internet, we know
that's not true.  (I don't know where I stole this from.)

Yes, the Hebrew glyphs are fascinating.  I wrote an article on the evolution
of the alphabet many years back.  The original writings evolved from little
clay figures of cattle that were used to track inventory of real herds in
Persia.  After a couple of thousand years, someone figured out that you
could depress these figures on a wet clay tablet to make a record of them.
Later, they stopped pressing the little figurines into clay and drew the
impressions by hand.  Original had drawings were pictographic, like Chinese
and Egyptian.  Eventually they became more stylized for easier writing.
Concepts evolved from real-world objects, to effigy figures, to pictography
drawings to abstract cuneiform sigils.  The old form Semitic alphabet that
the Old Testament was written in (which looks like cuneiform, not the curly
Aramaic letters of modern Hebrew) were the earliest alphabet that was
phonetically used to spell out other words and not just what the pictures
represented.  Each letter has a real-world object name.  The symbols in the
Phoenician-Semitic alphabet look similar to the Egyptian hieroglyphs for
those same objects.  It now is believed that the Hebrews learned writing
from the Egyptians, but were the first ones to extrapolate to and phonetic
alphabet to spell out words instead of showing little pictures of things.
The Egyptians seem to have developed their phonetic symbology later.  This
makes Hebrew the earliest alphabet in the world.

I forgot to mention that since letters have real world objects associated
with the, the mere spelling of a name contained objects.  If an ancient name
was said to mean "God provides for his people", it literally meant that the
person's name was spelled something like
[Male][High][Spirit][Provision][Tribe].  Also, names and words were not
separated.  In English, certain names are just names.  In Biblical Hebrew,
all names are real words.  It is the reader's interpretation whether they
are people, deities or what.  The words might say "High Mightiness demands
vengeance", and it could be read as "Vengeance is mine sayeth the Most
High."  While other words that said, "Wisdom dictates that a fool and his
money are soon parted" might be read without invoking a deity.  It is up to
the reader to decide if this is Sophia, the Goddess of Wisdom (Sophia is the
Hebrew word for wisdom), or if this is just a proverb.  Male catholic clergy
translated male personifications as God, whereas female personifications
were ignored.  Gnostic mystics translating the exact same Hebrew symbols
read their Goddess Sophia all over the Bible, being more of a major
character than the God of Moses.  Simple sentences could be read by one
person to describe Deities and Persons, while another person reads it as
abstract concepts with no individual involved.

I also forgot to mention the mystical concept of writing in general.  When
most people are illiterate and may not know about writing, the little
squiggly marks written by Priests and Shamans look like mystic art.  Imagine
that a priest can take a clay pot and make all sorts of mystical artwork on
it while chanting words of his intent.  Now take that pot to another priest
and he can concentrate on it closely and sense what the first priest had
enchanted (meaning to chant) into the object.  Obviously, the first priest's
mental thoughts were somehow projected onto the pot and could be gleaned by
the second priest just by examining the pot.  The initial beginnings of
writing obviously appeared to give magical abilities to those who could use
these special sigils.

I am an Extropian Mystic.
Mysticism is at the root of extropy.
We seek to uncover the mysteries of the universe.
We seek to explore our potential with magick: amazing powers of will.
Any Extropian embraces the supernatural, the superhuman.
To deny the mysticism of Extropy is to deny it's power.
Theoretical science is magick.
We peer into the future and advance technology
beyond anything that has ever been.
How much more mystical can you get?
I know valuable things that no one else knows,
unless they discovered it too.
That alone makes me both extropian and mystical.
They words become one and the same.
If you don't understand something it does not mean it does not work,
it means you have much to learn.

How about this, all the campaign promises are collated and delivered to
the winner on inauguration.  Then, if they're not in place at the end of
the year, the other guy gets the office, or we just put in a notary.

I was just thinking that in most states more than %5 over every sales
transaction is an appended tax.  That must be quite a chunk of change.
It is a very regressive tax, as are taxes on gasoline, alcohol, and
tobacco.  I believe the other descriptions of taxes in those terms are
proportional and progressive.

The federal government makes most of its money off of income taxes.
Both candidates have offered income tax cuts, yet the executive doesn't
have the power to make tax cuts.  Programs that are costing large
amounts of money could probably be streamlined in terms of efficiency
and thrift, if we knew where the money went.  The budget is on the CBO
web page or something, but it doesn't say where the money goes.

The government should take a one time balance sheet charge to pay off
the debt, although that might slam its stock.

After that, then, we can start charging all the other countries that use
our military.  Also, international intellectual property that belongs to
the people of the U.S. should be heartily protected, although technology
transfer is a good thing overall, what with R&D being the predictor of
growth.  Defense spending can still be quite high after being cut by a
third, which would be a third of twenty-five percent of the government
budget.  Growth is about R & D, which means bigs planes, lasers,
supercolliders, and space, as well as small science, even very small
science.

(Ramble.)

Have a nice day,

Hi Matthew

I haven't read ahead in my inbox to see if anyone has attempted to answer
this question yet.  But you will find that "extropians" are just about as
diverse in opinion as "humans" are.  About the only thing you will get any
group of extropians to agree on is that they want to improve on the human
condition.  In fact some may not even agree to that, preferring instead to
"transcend" the human condition.

So the extropians interest in numerology is likely to be as varied as you
can imagine.  However, most all forward-thinking-type people are pretty well
convinced of the value of the empirical method.  So with there not having
been a great deal of empirical research on the subject, my guess is that,
like me, most on this list would shrug and say "insufficient data to
conclusively resolve."

Having been dirt poor once or twice in my long life I can assure you
that moving is no picnic when you haven't hardly (if at all) the money
for this month's rent plus groceries much less for first, last and
moving costs.  The costs you list above is far beyond what can be
afforded when you are really poor.  Welfare?  I was never eligible for
one bureaucratic reason or another, not even when I was literally down
and out enough to be eating out of soup kitchens.  I was pretty dumb and
down and out in those long ago days but I wasn't a simple parasite
following the crumbs of welfare to the easiest pickings.

Congress does more than just vote on bills.  They actually *write* the
bills.  This, I believe, would not be feasible for the nation as a whole to
do online, or offline for that matter.  I'm sure you've heard that two
things you don't want to see are (a) sausage being made and (b) laws being
written.  The laws that Congress writes are not simple things like "it shall
be illegal to run a red light."  They are usually long, drawn-out, very
detailed pieces of legislation that would take hours to even read, much less
write.  The important pieces of legislation are most often the result of
excruciatingly negotiated compromises between many competing special
interests.

Also, in order to create a statutory scheme is not self-contradictory, the
people writing the new laws need at least a workable understanding of the
existing laws.  I'm not saying Congress is efficient, or even the best way
to get legislation enacted.  But *I* can't imagine a way to do it in a truly
democratic manner where all 200 million of us each get to have our say.

Okay, I'm sorry, but Gematria is not Extropic, it is drooling, empty-headed
rationalization.  Gematria is on the same level of sheer blank-minded
stupidity as astrology.  If you start trying to be tolerant of it, it
indicates that you have become too open-minded and your brains are now
starting to fall out.

There is a place for mysticism in embryo Extropians.  I myself dabbled in
mysticism up until the age of fourteen or fifteen or so.  However, I expect
mysticism in Those For Whom There Is Still Hope to take the form of
fascination with psychic powers, the teleology of the Universe, exotic
physical theories, mystical interpretations of qualia, reconciliation of
ultratech futures in terms of religious prophecies, and so on.  Taking
astrology or Gematria seriously indicates that you are a flat-out idiot.

Respecting people who take astrology seriously does not impress others with
your tolerance.  It simply indicates that you do not understand what tolerance
is *for*, and that you are trying to impress others by adherence to the letter
of an ethic whose spirit you do not understand.

Furthermore, please note that the Committee on Un-Extropian Activities will be
investigating all participants in this thread for possible connections to the
Green Party.

Only because candidates pull out of the race. If they don't even begin at all
due to an overwhelmingly huge financial barrier to entry, everyone gets screwed,
and you never hear about possible alternatives. Here's my ideas:

a) Similar to as you suggested, I'd say that network television and radio have
to carry all candidates ads/videos as public service ads. To qualify all one has
to do is get 100,000 signatures on a petition.

b) have a half dozen small states and or selected large counties in different
regions that generally reflect a composite of the country as a whole. Hold these
early primaries in sequence several days apart, or all at once. Have the rest as
a Super Tuesday a month or two later.

Frankly, I don't have much sympathy for large population states. They typically
hold excessive power in congress to bring pork spending to their states at the
expense of small states who don't have as large state caucuses. They
consequently receive disporportionately more back in federal grants and spending
than they contribute in taxes. Its just too damn bad if the one place where they
don't have an advantage is in primaries.

Only if you are not decisive and do not know what is important to you. I could
probably make lots of money living in Silicon Valley. You couldn't get me to
live anywhere in California for a million bucks.

Having been dirt poor myself once or twice, I realize the price I quoted is
higher than some could afford, it is what *I* could move coast to coast for
without selling off furniture or other posessions in my current household, but
those that would be that poor would likely find a bus ticket and/or just gas
money for their stuffed car to be more than sufficient.

Currently we are seeing people whose Massachusetts welfare benefits have expired
are being told to move to NH, which has a limit of 5 years, though the benefits
are lower. These people would rather move to get lower benefits than go to work,
and they seem to be able to afford the move as well. If they put as much effort
into working as they do into not working, they could make a decent wage.

If I met someone who based important life decisions on it, I would give them
the swift kick in an unnamed place that they deserve.  But I do find that it
can be a fun and interesting diversion during those times in which I just
want to throw reason to the dogs (gods?) and dine with the wizards.

I'd disagree with that- to what end does the individual in question take
astrology seriously?  For what purpose?  What practice?  What do they do
with it?  I would never trust a doctor who made treatment assumptions based
upon my sun sign, but an artist who uses it for inspiration is another
matter entirely.

As a Liberal Democrat who is going to see Ralph Nader speak this evening, I
fall awfully close to the line ;)

(I tried, for six months, to embrace Libertarianism.  I just couldn't do it-
I'm far too compassionate (and I have too little faith in human nature) for
it)

137, just one smart property, this one.......

Tous les nombres en xyztxyzt sont divisibles par 137.
12341234 = 137 x 90082
10011001 = 137 x 73073
99999999 = 137 x 729927
Ce dernier nombre tant un palindrome.

Excellent point, Mike.  I support the scientific method of doing
double-blind studies.  Why?  Because unconscious biases work.  Even if we
can't figure out how the results could be influenced, they somehow are.
Unless the humans don't know which way they want to skew the results, they
always skew the results.

In fact, the recount would be a lot more objective if they had a method of
covering the names so they couldn't tell who the vote was for.  Then the
committee would decide if the hole is punched or not, without knowing which
candidate would benefit from each decision.  I bet there would be a lot more
agreement in that case.

Reading The Illuminatus Trilogy while smoking a bowl does not make you extropic.
Understanding how 99.9% of the stuff in it is merely memetic Drain-O for your

Well, sure, but you can get the same inspiration by pouring different color
paint in your toilet bowl and pulling the lever. Such is not a matter of
believing it as valid fact.

Anyone who claims to be a green in any sense ought to be taken out in the
wilderness and dropped there naked. If they walk out after 6 months, I may begin
to take them seriously. 99% of them I doubt would make it. When you are freezin
your butt off, the motto no longer is 'you pack it in, you pack it out', it
becomes 'fuck it, burn it'. When your processed grain trailmix with exotic dried
fruits from four different continents runs out and you are reduced to eating
wild onions, asparagus, and acorns, you'll track down, jump, strangle, gut, cook
and eat any animal you come across, no questions asked.

Oddly, the worst atrocities on mankind were committed by people who had too
little faith in human nature. Trusting someone beyond reason is the only way to
achieve results beyond hope. Most people tend to live up to the standards you
expect of them. Think about it.

The fact that our constitution currently allows every eligible citizen a
say in our laws (convicts, illegal aliens... being ineligible).  The
televised media, being frightened of this would spew claims of the power
going to the technocracy and away from the people, and that system would
be banned.  There's enough rural areas in the midwest and south, plus poor
inner city areas that the majority would not want to have to vote on every
bill.  Is it really fair that if one didn't have a computer they can't
vote?  Or if they can't put aside time each week to worry about such?

Besides, do you really see this as a good idea?  Having every zealot vote
on something that doesn't affect them?  Why should a priest have a say in
whether abortions are legal or not?  Why should a well protected
New-England resident have a say on whether a worker out west can have guns
in his/her home to protect his/her family?  I unfortunately don't believe
that the average person has an intelligent view on most topics.  Once you
make it as easy to vote as sitting at home on your computer, and
sacrificing a little of your time web-surfing to decide wheteher or not we
should have a law?  Make it tougher.  Maybe people will spend to time to
think before they vote then.  Obviously atleast 97% of the citizens didn't
do that in this presidential election.

As a recently engaged extropian, I feel I can offer some insight into this
discussion.

One will always find the best relationships with their intellectual peers.
Due to the lingering effects of our patriarchy, today's women are still
mostly airheads.  I have long since discovered that true love with such an
airhead is impossible.

However, there are a good number of intellectually gifted women nowadays,
they're just hard to find.  And for them, it is likewise hard to find
intellectually compatible men, for most men are airheads, too, despite their
advantages.

Then there's the geek factor.  Let's face it.  Most people that have the
brains to be extropian are lacking in looks, social skills, or both.  It
takes a lot of deprogramming for those who are both intelligent AND good
looking to realize that the intelligence is the most important factor and go
for the nerd instead of the babe or jock.

There is also the fact that high intelligence (and the money that it often
brings) gives you the ability to seduce the more beautiful members of the
opposite sex that would be otherwise inaccessible to you.  Many social
extropians will choose this path and never discover the joys of dating an
intellectual equal.

Then there's the typically extropian tendency to sit on the computer all day
writing code or posting to the usenet.  This rarely leads to marriage.

Plus, there is the implication of monogamy that exists in traditional
marriage that anyone with half a brain realizes is a pile of dog-doo (or at
least acts accordingly).  Marriage is often shunned by extropians seeking to
abandon the chains of the past and build an exciting new high-tech future.
Many long-term couplings amongst extropians might not take on the form of
marriage as a result.

All in all, there is a very low probability of any two extropians of
opposite sexes meeting each other, much less falling in love and choosing to
commit to marrige.

However, none of this is grounds to abandon the idea of a life-long
committed relationship with a member of the same or opposite sex.  Nobody
said you have to conform to all the rules implied by marriage in our
culture, and one's brain is greatly enhanced by the physical and mental
stimulation of a steady partner.  So here's what we've done.

Lauren and I decided to get married while having breakfast at Shoney's
following an all-nighter working on our Internet business (I found that
quite romantic, in an extropian sort of way).  Since we already live
together, have a joint checking account, and are partners in a business, we
have viewed marriage as a formality.  And our decision to get married was a
decision to go through the legal formality of marriage in order to derive
the benefits our legal system and culture give to married couples.

We're going to sign the papers at the courthouse and take care of the legal
formality now.  When we've got enough money to throw a decent party, we'll
take care of the ceremonial aspect of marriage--which can be cool if done
right.

We practice an open relationship, which gives us the freedom to creatively
explore our sexuality and love with other people without divorce, jealousy,
regret or any other negatives (except herpes which a good extropian would
cure).  I think that open relationships would save most marriages, or at
least make them more fun.  Most extropians don't get married due to aversion
to monogamy, gayness or social withdrawal.  Open relationships make marriage
compatible with all but the latter.

Good luck to you all in finding true extropic love--it's very much worth it.

The part where you implied that "of the people..." meant "in other words,
democracy".  That is clearly not what the founders had in mind by that
phrasing.  They meant that government could only derive *just* powers by the
consent of the governed as an extension to the inalienable rights of the
governed.  This limitation on government is not simply democracy.

Michael Lorrey:

I'm with you there. I know I'm a law abiding citizen. I also typically am
armed.
I have nothing to fear legally from cops, so any action they take against me
is
by definition illegal action, and I am legally able (and justified) to
defend
myself against such *felonious* criminal actions by police. Any jurisdiction
which would treat me any differently is, by definition, a tyranny. Insisting
on
living under tyranny implies the acceptance of that tyranny, if the means
and
ability to leave that tyranny exist. If you fear such tyranny, vote with
your
feet. If you don't, its like not voting: you don't get to complain.

samantha:
So what state do you live in?  Presumably one where concealed carry licenses
aren't nearly impossible to get as they are in California.  Vermont is the
only state that seems to have reasonable respect for 2nd amendment.  Even
then a lot of cops are so trigger happy they would probably shoot you if you
had a gun at all on you.  It is getting that stupidly violent out there.
When the Feds can pull things like Waco, Ruby Ridge, decades of IRS
bullying, DEA and other confiscations, no-knock laws and so on the citizenry
has every reason to fear and distrust their government.

But you always get to complain for the simple reason that you have rights
that are being violated.  There is no country on the face of this earth that
fully respects individual rights.  There is no where to go to.  So you
either complain or go into full armed revolt and get shot in nothing flat.
You can go underground or as free as you can within the best context you
can.   Beyond that complain like hell and try to educate as many people as
possible.

Neo only ever hears the cover story (and reference to "copper top") from
Morpheus and his band of merry mass murderers. Perhaps it isn't an AI cover
story at all, but some misinformation being propogated by the
revolutionaries.

As has been speculated elsewhere, perhaps most people voluntarily entered
the Matrix and chose to forget the real world (as the traitor tried to do),
but Morpheus's crowd can't abide that. So the Agents are the caretakers,
rather than the bad guys.

Currently we are seeing people whose Massachusetts welfare benefits have

are being told to move to NH, which has a limit of 5 years, though the
benefits
are lower. These people would rather move to get lower benefits than go to
work,
and they seem to be able to afford the move as well. If they put as much
effort
into working as they do into not working, they could make a decent wage.

samantha:
The assertion that all who want work can find it and at a decent wage needs
some support.  It is actually quite unlikely that especially the unskilled
will find work at a better wage than they can make on welfare.

This (as Max knows but did not explicitly mention) is the
domain of a fascinating branch of economics known as
"Public Choice" founded by James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock.

Here's a reference to a primer on public choice theory
which I've heard recommended, though I've not read (having
read some of the original work published in the early
60's when the discipline was founded):

AKA "What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen".  A great essay which
uses the allegory of a broken window to demolish a popular

There was a very nice episode of StarGate week before last, in which a
society that had supposedly evolved from pre-Aztec Mexican Indian was
encountered.  The nasties had forced them from their Earth homes and they
had recently gotten on that slippery slope to the Singularity, as evidenced
by the fact that they were all infested with nanites.  Furthermore, they had
progressed technologically in a few decades as much as Earth culture had in
several hundred years.

As to how, certain individuals were chosen at an early age to receive a huge
load of unprogrammed nanites in addition to the usual programmed array.
They then specialized in some area of research, typically making as much
progress before their teens as several generations of normal humans.  At the
point when they had peaked out in what they had to offer, they then
volunteered to be sacrificed - the Aztec connection, of course.

The child victims, however, unlike most of the actual Aztec sacrifices, who
were taken from subject tribes and probably would have distinctly preferred
another life path, volunteered eagerly to have their brains wiped.  Their
nanites were removed en masse and then distributed throughout the
population, giving everyone the knowledge they had gained.

Unfortunately, this left the children with a virtual tabula rosa.  Just to
make the moral dillemna interesting, they could never again receive or
benefit from a nanite knowledge implant.

The scenario is rather implausible, to say the least, but it was very
cleverly arranged and the solutions that various parties arrived at were
both clever and non-obvious.

Many questions were left hanging at the end.  Is a person who has lost most
of their abstract memory still that same person?  Where would you draw the
lines?  If most of your working consciousness is actually handled by a host
of nanites, then are giving something up or are you gaining by spreading
them all over creation, such that your experience of who you are is shared
by a million other consciousnesses?

While the plot and its handling was somewhat juvenile by EXTROPIAN
standards, this was definitely an episode that will make the viewers think,
and an excellent example of how to bring serious abstract
techno/philosophical issues in public consciousness and debate without
trivializing them.

The future of science and technology are not mystical, not magick, not
mysterious.
A transhuman is not supernatural.
Capital 'P' Powers are not amazing or incredible, they are merely currently
inscrutable.
Mystics read fantasy, extropians read science fiction.
Get it?

That's the difference between a hermetic qabalist and a chaos mage... of
course, many among the latter believe that truth is a matter of who creates
it (which just brings us back to the Berkeley Refutation...)

What does that have to do with the Green Party platform?  Absolutely
nothing.

Let's see... the Greens support equal redistribution of wealth, an increase
in localization and community self-reliance, fighting for equal civil
rights, better regulated international trade, the development of clean and
sustainable sources of energy, the promotion of mass transit and
neighborhoods constructed for pedestrians instead of cars, a woman's right
to reproductive choice, the promotion of small scale organic agriculture
over industrialized, chemical agriculture, Native American sovereignty, and
waste reduction programs.

In other words, the future that I think most Greens envision is not one of
wilderness survivalism, but one of a technological ecotopia reminiscent of
the Earth seen on Star Trek... in other words, a progressive, holistic view
in which we begin to focus on what is really important in life, instead of
what corporations tell us, and where advanced technology intermingles with a
clean, healthy planetary ecosystem.

Since my home state has become an unwilling subject of
media scrutiny, I suggest extropians take a vacation down
there some time.  If you do, you may find that Palm Beach
County is an anomaly in itself.  It is a huuuuge retirement
community.  I dont have statistics handy but I suspect the
average age in Palm Beach County is probably
the highest in the state, perhaps among the highest in the
nation.  Anyone have the numbers?

If you do vacation in Florida, go do the Disney World/
EPCOT thing if you must, then drive across the BeeLine
and hit Interstate 95.  Drive south.  You will pass thru
countless acres of "wetlands", which is a greeny euphemism
for vermin infested swamp.  At one time, most of Florida
consisted of these vermin infested swamps, but in the last
century, much of that land was drained, much to the
harm of the wetlands creatures, such as disease-carrying
mosquitoes and venomous snakes.  Many of these vile pests
have now been identified as endangered species.  If you happen
to own a vermin infested swamp and you try to drain it,
good chance you will be thrown into prison, and for your
trouble you will be forced to spend untold money to defeat
the drainage and restore the habitat for the disease carrying
vermin.  Then of course if trespassers on your swamp fall
victim to one of these wretched menaces, you are liable.

Nowthen, this has become a blank check for the greens.
As far as I can tell, there is no real limit to how far the
litigants can carry the endangered species act.  It has
already been successfully used to protect insects.  Bugs,
fer cryin out loud!  Dont we have enough of these?

Political campaigns are often reduced to sound bytes.
Algore manged to get Bush's sound byte to be:
Bush = end of social security checks and subsequent
starvation for seniors, etc.

Perhaps in Palm Beach County the sound byte was
Nader = fewer golf courses, more vermin infested swamp.
Consequently he got few votes, making the Buchanan
vote {sound byte: Buchanan = standing up for god and
country} seem anomalously high by comparison.  My
conclusion is that Nader and Buchanan should not be
legitimately compared, and that doing so in a county
where there is strong anti-Naderism will make Buchanan
appear anomalously favored.  Better to simply compare
the Buchanan vote in each county, compare the Nader
vote in each county, etc.  Please forgive my lengthy
epistle.  {8-]  spike

The Democratic National Committee fabricated the Palm Beach
Controversy prior to the polls even closing in Florida. Here
are three links those interested in the Palm Beach, Florida,
ballot controversy should follow up on:

http://wire.ap.org/APnews/center_story.html?FRONTID=ELECTION&STORYID=APIS786
FCOO0

http://www.independent.org/tii/news/001110release.html

http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/10/palmbeach.ballot/index.html

The first link above is an Associated Press wire story about
how the Democratic National Committee paid the telemarketing
firm TeleQuest to call 5,000 Palm Beach voters to incite their
paranoia with the following message:

Some voters have encountered a problem today with punch card
ballots in Palm Beach County. These voters have said that they
believe that they accidentally punched the wrong hole for the
incorrect candidate. If you have already voted and think you
may have punched the wrong hole for the incorrect candidate,
you should return to the polls and request that the election
officials write down your name so that this problem can be
fixed.

The TeleQuest callers then took the names and phone numbers of
voters who said they may have cast an errant ballot and gave
these names to the Democratic Party.

Look at the above message very carefully! There is no
indication that anything was considered wrong with the ballot.
Further, note that the message explicitly contains the
blatantly false and misleading statement that one can fix an
incorrect ballot after the ballot has been cast.

Had the vote in Florida not been close, we would never have
heard anything about these bizarre telephone calls. But the
vote was close and now in hindsight their purpose is all too
clear.

Only after the votes were tabulated, did the Democratic
National Committee then construct and pass out the fabricated
story that the media parroted, concerning the alleged Palm
Beach ballot being faulty as supposedly reflected in a
abnormally large number of Buchanan votes. The media should be
horsewhipped for spreading this pack of lies. In fact:

Yes- there are more Buchanan votes in Palm Beach County than
any other Florida County for the simple reason that Palm Beach
County is, by population, one of the largest counties in
Florida.

No- there emphatically is nothing unusual about the Buchanan
votes in Palm Beach County. Less than 1% of Palm Beach County
voters voted for Buchanan while there were many other Florida
counties where more than 1% of the voters did.

The second link above illustrates how the Democratic National
Committee, with the assistance of the media, has successfully
misled almost the entire nation with its unethical use and
misinterpretation of statistical charts.

Finally in the third link above the Florida Secretary of State
makes a clear and unequivocal statement that the Palm Beach
ballots conformed to the law of the State of Florida. There
never was anything wrong with the Palm Beach ballots!

All of us who have ever voted have experienced a natural
paranoia of wondering if we marked the ballot incorrectly. The
Democratic National Committee has, in the most cold-hearted,
dishonest and disgusting way, attempted to prey on this common
fear and use it as a means of overturning an election result.
The media needs to be very severely reprimanded for going
along with this brazen attempt to tamper with an election and
circumvent the Voice of the People.

I can respect this point of view, but I don't agree with it.

I was going through life with the opinion that I'll never find the right
person for marriage. But this was because I was looking in the wrong
places (night clubs, work, travel etc). When I found the Extropy
Institute mailinglist, I saw that this could be the right place for
finding the man I could marry. I don't mean that this was the only
reason I subscribed the mailinglist for, though :-) I just saw the
possibility. And it turned out that I had really found the right place:
After a long time of loneliness, I found the right person there.

I don't think that an open relationship makes a marriage more
progressive in an extropian kind of way. I admit, I could be biased here
but I never got the notion from open relationship marriages that they
really worked. I always got the impression that at least one person in
those relationships was having a "looking for an emergency exit" in
mind.
In my opinion, open relationships are the easy way of being married.
It's easy and distracting from the things an Extropian should (in my
opinion) really focus on: Being a catalyst for new ideas, finding
solutions for life-threatening problems, exploring the universe in a
scientific kind of way. Two Extropians who "join forces" have a much
greater impact here. And this impact is even more increased if the two
people who are involved really know each other, which often allows
balancing out one person's weaknesses with the other person's strengths.

Of course, it was much easier for me, a female Extropian, to find a man
I could marry as it is for extropian men.

> The future of science and technology are not mystical, not magick, not

Arthur C. Clarke would disagree with that statement...

Anyway, since when is our destiny of a mundane nature?  This notion has only
been commonly believed for a very short duration of humanity's existence-
I'd also argue that this notion is purely transitionary, a kind of
collective "dark night of the soul" (as a mystic would put it) before our
initiation into the Transhuman existence...

> A transhuman is not supernatural.

We don't know this.  I, for one, think that it must be... if this wasn't the
case, we would certainly be awash in signals from alien civilizations and
others that still live tied to their mundane existence, eternally expanding,
conquering, warring... remember, there were numerous second-generation stars
that matured billions of years before our own Sun, and odds are that in a
self-organizing universe many intelligent races could have developed and
eventually reached their own singularity, in which, through technological
means, they advanced to a state that is beyond our comprehension, and could
only be seen as divine.  The only way we could even hope to perceive a
slight bit of the nature of such beings is through mystical means.  Even the
ever hard-nosed Carl Sagan proposed something to this effect in "Contact",
when he mentioned the idea of a species that had reached a state beyond our
imagination designing patterns in the physical universe that could only be
read through mathematical codes... maybe the Kabbalists are on to
something...

If they're inscrutable, they very well could be amazing and incredible.  You

I read both.  My favorite genera, in fact, is Science Fantasy- Star Wars,
Shadowrun, the more recent Final Fantasy games, and several of my own
strange concoctions.

I'm one of those strange people who sees no contradiction between being
mystical and being scientific (and I don't even need some arcane
interpretation of quantum physics or feel the need to bend the rules of
probability to back me up).

The time it would take - for citizens to thoroughly read the bills being
voted on, debate every bill that comes up (not just the ones that
attract much press), et cetera and so forth - is enough of a cost.
Legislative processes, like most processes, seem to flow naturally
towards the most efficient if not constrained (say, by a dictator's
wish to retain power).

Community != government.  Membership in a community is an asset that
belongs to a person, where the value of the asset is rather strongly
linked to the value of the community - even if there is the perception
that the community is, to some extent, under siege by a tyrannical
government controlled by those outside the community.

True.  But that still does not resolve the problem of people living in
an area for the benefits that it gives, and yet fearful of the
enforcers of law in that area even though they are not criminals
(perhaps out of fear that the police see them as the leeches they
believe themselves to be, if they think that the benefits were "meant"
to help unfortunates who were in the community before people moved in
to take advantage of the benefits).

Do they rate areas within large countries?  I suspect that, for example,
Little Rock and San Francisco would not rate equally, even though both
are within the USA.

Okay, I worded that one wrong.  I'll quote this directly from their own
material-

"The Greens stand for a society in which wealth and power are distributed
broadly among all the people rather than concentrated in the hands of a
few."

No, they do not believe in equal redistribution of wealth.  I hope this
corrects that notion.  I'd also argue that with the way our economic system
is set up, many people attain wealth and power through means that do not
require talent or devotion, do not have the requisite ability (George W.
Bush, anyone?), or attain power through means that are far less than
ethical, means that result in the opression of others and the destruction of
the environment.  Sure, I like the thought of "enlightened capitalism"- I
was raised by an ethical, socially aware businessman father- but it is
frequently more of an exception than a rule.  Am I in support of communism
or a government-controlled economy? No.  Do I think that the corporate
structure needs a definite overhaul?  Yes.

I think the problem here is that people mix up mysticism,
spirituality, magick and the supernatural.

Mysticism is the epistemological position that some truths can or must
be grasped by direct insight, not empirical thought.  Spirituality is
about meaning, the core values that we have. It doesn't have to
involve any spirits.  Magick, as defined by Crowley, is merely the art
and science of causing change according to will - i.e. it encompasses
both technology, ordinary skills and magic.  Supernatural denotes
stuff that behaves according to rules outside not just current
understanding of the universe but apparently against it.

(These are quick-and-dirty definitions with no warranty, if people
want to go on debating using them they better look up better versions
of them)

Now, how do these fit together with transhumanism and extropianism?

Mysticism claims that mystic insight delivers important truths. It has
a bad track record of delivering useful practical information like
physical laws or natural constants (it should not be mixed up with
creativity, where a random insight is then tested against reality and
possibly adapted, such as the Kekule benzene structure idea). A lot of
"mystical science" is just analogical thinking, a happy chant of "look
how elegant and neat it all fits together!" that doesn't lead
anywhere. What mysticism seems good at is delivering a sense of
meaning and emotional significance to stuff (be it the universe or a
single leaf).

Transhumanism is out to improve the human condition using efficient
means. This implies that mysticism does not provide much help in
building the devices or techniques we need or want. Where it may be
helpful is on the emotional level, in getting a feel for how wonderful
the universe is or how we ourselves fit in with it. Extropian-wise,
Practical Optimism and Rational Thinking implies that we should not
place blind faith in any revelation, but rather test it against
reality. Maybe it turns out that mysticism can be physically useful,
but it better prove itself.

Transhumanism and extropianism are often spiritual in the sense I
defined it above. Our drive towards progress, self-transformation,
optimism, self-direction etc. have a spiritual component - they are
meaningful and important to us. Here spirituality in a transhumanist
context would be the cherishing and development of these values, our
increased understanding of what we want and believe and how this fits
in with the rest.

Magick in the Crowley sense is trivially transhumanist - we want to
cause change, and we want to use the best available means to do so. In
the stronger sense of involving something supernatural, then we get a
collision with the rational views embodied in the extropian principles
and transhumanist declarations. Being rational we seek to minimize the
discrepancies between our reality models and observed reality, and
this means that in the long run all supernatural stuff will either
become natural (we figure out how it fits with a better reality model
- either as an unusual effect of the earlier models or by being
included as an irreducible part of the new model) or vanish (it did
not exist in the first place or was just misinterpreted). Clarke's
law, you know.

In the short run time, money, attention and intelligence are of course
limited and we should spend them in an efficient manner - not every
claim warrants great expenditures to be understood (here the benefits
of a distributed and individual approach seems to work well, let
people spend their own resources on whatever research they think will
be profitable). 

To sum up, transhumanism has spiritual values, but these are not based
on any supernatural assumptions. Mysticism may reinforce or refine
them, but it is not regarded as the sole way to truth. Transhumanism
seeks efficient means of causing change fitting these values, and does
this from a practical empirical approach. Merely assuming that
something works is not transhumanist, but testing that something works
and then investing in it depending on how reliable the effect appears
to be, is.

That would be interesting, but I don't believe they go to that level of 
detail. Their focus is on international comparisons. I would very much like 
to see comparisons of the various states of the U.S. for a start. One 
problem with any of these indices, of course, is that you may not agree 
with all of the criteria. Perhaps eventually several credible sources will 
publish competing freedom indices. The more perspectives, the more clearer 
the view achievable by us.

To really get a feel for differences in economic freedom just read the 
short piece on Havana in the new Business Week: "A Nation of 
Entrepreneurs?". The laws regulating the number of tables allowed in 
restaurants are hilarious though infuriating. (The piece is on p.22E2 of 
the November 20, 2000 issue. (Oddly, I don't see this in the on-line 
version of the issue.)

I found a site which was apparently the source of the graph I
saw in the L.A. Times on Friday, showing Buchanan's vote against
the total vote, by Florida county.  Look down to the bottom of:

http://madison.hss.cmu.edu/

This site also graphs Buchanan against Bush votes, against Reform party
membership, and against Buchanan votes in the 1996 primary.  In each
case the West Palm Beach county is an extreme outlier.  The site also
has links to other papers analyzing the Palm Beach vote.  It's amazing
how quickly all this data has been made available via the internet,
and the number of reports which are already available.

Simple - we are now all in Hell.

Just ask anyone who bought hi-tech stocks when they were running Windows 95,
and who is now running 98 or 2000. Presumably they are running pirated
versions, as they would not be able to afford the originals.

There's a massive difference, which is all about rigorousness versus

Many, many, many stereotypes about "extropians" in your message .....
(too many stereotypes listed for me to give a balanced analysis).

It's not wise to paint a group of people with such broad brushstrokes,
unless you've truly met and personally gotten to know the whole group.

It is the inverse fine structure constant: hbar c/e^2 = 1/alpha ~= 137
Although according to the NIST reference
(http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?alphinv|search_for=fine+structure)
it is currently measured to be 137.035 999 76 +- 0.000 000 50 - so it
is likely not an integer. Still, physicists like it, and I used it as
the code on my old suitcase.

See http://www.treasure-troves.com/physics/FineStructureConstant.html
for more.

No.  It does not.  I'm _not_ complaining, but this is only parody -- i.e.,
fiction.  So, those who are complaining probably have real gripes.  Imagined
worse situations often do not impinge on real problems.  I mean, if you had
terminal cancer, would reading a story in _The Onion_ make your cancer go
away or put it into perspective?

Subject: REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
after last Tuesdays disaster................

NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE

To the citizens of the United States of America, In the light of
your  failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to
govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your
independence, effective today Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will
resume monarchial
duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except Utah,
which
she does not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP
for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there
is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America
without the need for further elections.  Congress and the Senate will be
disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether
any of you noticed.
To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules
are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.
Then look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be
amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.
Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up
"vocabulary".
Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises
such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of
communication.  Look up "interspersed".

2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft know on
your behalf.


3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australasian accents.
It really isn't that hard.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the
good guys.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The
Queen",but only after fully carrying out task 1.
We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American "football".  There is only one
kind of football.  What you refer to as American "football" is not a very
good game.  The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside
your borders may have noticed that no one else plays "American" football.
You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play
proper football.  Initially, it would be best if you played with the
girls.  It a difficult game.
Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is
similar to American "football", but does not involvestopping for a rest
every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar
body armour like nancies).  We are hoping to get together at least a US
rugby sevens side by 2005.

7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons
if they give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were not aware
that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.
The
Russians have never been the bad guys.  "Merde" is French for "shit".

8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new
national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called "Indecisive Day".

9. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for
your own good.  When we show you German cars, you will understand
what we mean.

10. Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us crazy.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Mentioning tech at a green meeting will get you keel-hauled. I

ridiculous politics.

It does not. Since wealth (or talent, ambition, work ethic, or
whatever) is not currently equally distributed just how exactly is
this to be achieved? (Don't even waste the time).

Yes, people have realy complaint, but the point that I think Eliezer is

would not be a parody, but real life.

And that *does* give a little perspective.

Which ones would they take away, other than the right to destroy your fellow

I have no beef with this one (of course, I'm a college student who relies on
public transportation, and for the three months out of the year that I do
drive, I have a car that gets 36 MPG).  I think that a 10-20 cent gas tax
would be a very good idea.

With a constitution that cannot be altered or overturned by a simple majority, a
court system that can tell the people they are dead flat WRONG, a presidential
electoral system that is not directly determined by popular vote, and a
tripartate structure with checks and balances. Assuming participants actually
obey the laws of the government, it is technically impossible to easily let a
dictator come to power, unless a large majority of the population has gone quite
insane. If the system is subverted from within, and nobody is brave enough to do
anything about it, it becomes a little easier.

It would be a nicely eye opening experience for the majority of alleged Greens,
who are little but disillusioned boyscouts and girlscouts who still think
Disney's Bambi is a true reflection of real nature, and still think that Marx
has any relevance whatsoever to today's world.

- equal distribution of wealth: i.e. confiscation of property by government
gunpower.
- localization and community self-reliance: communities can do whatever they
want so long as it complies with the Great Green Way.
- fighting for equal civil rights: i.e. 'OUR' minorities and special interest
groups (even women, who are a majority) get preferences in everything, and evil
while males have to pay for it all.
- the development of clean and sustainable sources of energy: except for solar
power satellites in orbit (where they would be most effective), hydropower
(cause its bad for the fishies), woodpower (cause it hurts the holy forest trees
and cute and fuzzy animals), windpower (when they are in sight of the homes of
our High Ranking Holy Green Warriors, or when there is the remotest chance a
cute and fuzzy bird will get caught in one), and nuclear power (fission, we
don't want any breeder reactors that would eliminate the waste problem, and
fusion is just encouraging those damn technologists).
- promotion of mass transit: which funnels taxpayer money into our Union allies
pockets and construction companies that donate to our Party coffers, never mind
that mass transit systems only work with communities above a given population
density, and that the average subway and/or rail system costs enough to provide
each new mass transit rider a new BMW every other year for 40 years.
- a woman's right to reproductive choice: i.e. a) heterosexual sex is rape b) a
man has choice for only 4-5 seconds during intercourse, but a woman has a choice
to kill a human being for 9 months, and c) a man has no right to demand either a
woman end a pregnancy or absolve the male of future financial responsibility.
Ergo: Equal protection under the law is dead.
- promotion of organic agriculture: We want to reduce productivity in
agriculture so the evil imperialist American phallocracy can no longer feed the
poor masses in the 3rd world who truly want a socialist revolution, only they
don't know it yet.
- waste reduction: I don't want a dump built in my back yard, and she doesn't
want one in her back yard, so instead of two dumps, we are going to cut our
trash per capita by half, and build only one dump, in her back yard, at the
point of a government gun, just so long as it isn't in my back yard.

Sagan was showboating buffoon who was doing memetic programming. 

Supernatural, adj. 1. Existing outside of, or exhibiting properties
contradictory to the laws of, the natural universe.

No, transhumans are NOT supernatural. Inhabitants of a Universe Prime, running
our universe as a quantum simulation, would be supernatural deities, but they
cannot interfere with the simulation.

incredible: lacking credibility. Sorry, any Power I ever meet would likely be
very credible in its existence. Overwhelmingly so. It might be amazing, but it
would not be mystical or supernatural.

Subject: 137: Sheer blank-minded stupidity

Okay, I'm sorry, but Gematria is not Extropic, it is drooling, empty-headed
rationalization.  Gematria is on the same level of sheer blank-minded
stupidity as astrology.

____
I find being blank-minded very refreshing sometimes.
Have you ever been to Nirvana?

Redefine astrology into something you can comprehend.
Time affects life.
Solar flares come every 11 years and you can bet people will be cranky.
Day and night and their amounts of light
have effects on neurotransmitter production.
Gravity affects life.
Low tide makes me lazy as it requires more strength.
People of different races
are more likely to be born at different times of year.
I was concieved during the winter and have many biological traits
associated with winter survivablity: thin lips, light skin, etc.
Bio traits affect mental traits: Neurotransmitter sensitivity, etc.
Astrology is real.

Gematria teaches people to think on many levels.
It connects neurons that may otherwise never come into contact
thus allowing for novel thought.
It is also a method of encoding secrets.
Jibberish is not jibberish if you know what it means.
Anything can be extropic if you know how to use it.
____

If you start trying to be tolerant of it, it
indicates that you have become too open-minded and your brains are now
starting to fall out.

There is a place for mysticism in embryo Extropians.  I myself dabbled in
mysticism up until the age of fourteen or fifteen or so.  However, I expect
mysticism in Those For Whom There Is Still Hope to take the form of
fascination with psychic powers, the teleology of the Universe, exotic
physical theories, mystical interpretations of qualia, reconciliation of
ultratech futures in terms of religious prophecies, and so on.  Taking
astrology or Gematria seriously indicates that you are a flat-out idiot.

___
I take everything with a grain of salt.
Most people are idiots and so are most astrologers,
but please, don't throw insults.
___



Respecting people who take astrology seriously does not impress others with
your tolerance.  It simply indicates that you do not understand what 
tolerance
is *for*, and that you are trying to impress others by adherence to the 
letter
of an ethic whose spirit you do not understand.

Furthermore, please note that the Committee on Un-Extropian Activities will 
be
investigating all participants in this thread for possible connections to 
the
Green Party.

___
I quit and became republican before the election,
but continued to supply intelligence.
I support all parties.


PS: Thanks Eliezer.

Supernatural interpretations of phenomena are, IMHO, the result of the human 
mind's drive to find patterns in nature (even when they aren't real) combined 
with ignorance. They tend to fall apart whenever they are looked at with a 
critical eye backed with experimental evidence.

Where? If it's the line (to paraphrase)about a sufficiently advanced

it more closely. A more primitive civilization would mistake the advanced 
technology for magic, just like a Bronze Age warrior would think a gun is

During that "short duration," more human progress has been achieved than in 
all of previous human history. Apparently, this "dark night" really produces 
results! I fervently pray (to a non-existent God) that this never ends. 
Before we started stripping the world from its mystical-religious trappings, 
we lived huddled in the dark, utterly helpless before the forces of nature. 
No thanks.

that matured billions of years before our own Sun, and odds are that in a 
self-organizing universe many intelligent races could have developed and 
eventually reached their own singularity, in which, through technological 
means, they advanced to a state that is beyond our comprehension, and could 
only be seen as divine.  The only way we could even hope to perceive aslight 
bit of the nature of such beings is through mystical means.  Even the
ever hard-nosed Carl Sagan proposed something to this effect in "Contact",

something...<<

Please. The only way for us to get to understand such a species is for us to 
*raise ourselves to that level.* If we have to approach them (assuming the 
exist) as ignorant, trembling supplicants, we deserve whatever we get. When 
Commodore Perry sailed into Japan with a mighty warship, the Japanese could 
have just fallen to their knees and worshipped him. Instead, in a few 
generations they had warships of their own. Mystics simply believe their 
powers of reasoning are incapable of understanding the universe, and that 
only some esoteric means will do it. So far, science keeps kicking them out 
of more and more realms of nature, as our observation tools and methods, and 
our understanding of the universe, continues to grow. The track record of the 
mystics and religionists, to put it kindly, sucks. None of their predictions 
has ever come true.

If they're inscrutable, they very well could be amazing and incredible.  You 
don't know this- nor do I.<<

Having, in the past, found that events and phenomena that were previously 
inscrutable (how did the sun burn, for example) have been logically and 
falsifiably explained, one can logically infer that what is now inscrutable 
will also, eventually, be logically and falsifiably explained. To believe 
otherwise is to deny four centuries of human progress. Now, it is possible 
that at some point we might run into a wall that science and reason cannot 
knock down -- but if one must have faith in something, I thing faith in 
science and reason is more sensible -- they have delivered a great deal more 
than the alternatives.

> Mystics read fantasy, extropians read science fiction.

I read both.  My favorite genera, in fact, is Science Fantasy- Star Wars, 
Shadowrun, the more recent Final Fantasy games, and several of my own strange 
concoctions.<<

Fantasy, in other words. Star Wars is a particular villain of that stripe 
(nothing wrong with it for entertainment purposes, although I love the 
deconstructionist articles David Brin wrote about it).

Human beings have the amazing ability of believing dozens of contradictory 
things at the same time, and yet remain functionally sane (in fact, that 
might be a defining aspect of human intelligence -- AI designers take note). 
Doesn't make them right.

I find this often repeated complaint puzzling.
What are you talking about?
I and you live on the same planet. I don't recall a single time in my life 
where I was forced against my will to do something by a corporation - except 
for those which have been granted regional monopolies by the government 
(like utility companies: USWest double billed me once and took 6 months to 
take care of it).
Let me know how you feel "oppressed by corporate interests" and I'll tell 
you how to fix it within the current system.

I agree with all that you mentioned, but no one has yet explained why we
have not already been overrun by other transsentient cultures or see no
evidence of their existence- I see only three possible explanations-

1. We're the only planet in the universe that has developed sentient life.
(Highly unlikely)
2. All sentient cultures are doomed to destroy themselves- there is no
singularity, no offworld colonization, no transsentience- so your entire
extropian movement is moot, and we should best look elsewhere for our
answers.
3. By gaining cognition of the universe at a level beyond our comprehension,
they have gained an understanding that has allowed them to transcend the
objective universe and become, essentially, gods.

Hah!  You're forgetting something- our knowledge of the so-called "laws" of
the "natural universe" are, in fact, the most likely interpretations that
our senses and our limited brains are able to give us.  A transhuman would
be supernatural, in the fact that through the knowledge and manipulation of
forces beyond the comprehension of "mere mortals", they could essentially
alter realities in ways that could only be seen as going beyond the "laws"
of the universe.  Which, again, brings us back to Arthur C. Clarke's
statement...

This cannot be known until it has been experienced.

First, let me say that after 3 days, I'm really digging this list serve.  I
haven't been part of one for a long while and I'm throughly enjoying the
depth of thought and intelligence exhibited in the various threads.

Anders, thanks for a good quick overview about mysticism, sprituality and
magick.  Yes, I think most of Crowleyian magick is rather archaic and he did
get too caught up in supernatural experiences or states of consciousness.
However, I think that magick is a legtimate tool for focusing the will an
producing change.  By practicing magick, you are able to focus your
consicousness in ritual so reinforce new thought connections.  NLP and
cognitive therapy may be better tools than most magick.  But it seems that
most people practicing magick are riding the regress express back to the
archaic.  Could magick be re-invented.  I think yes.

As for mysticism, I agree with your statement:

>Where it may be
>helpful is on the emotional level, in getting a feel for how wonderful
>the universe is or how we ourselves fit in with it.

That is why mysticism has power to generate insight.  It centers you in the
universe so you can connect with you deep will.  I think that mystical
practices are necessary to strengthen that part.  Once you have the insight,
than yes, follow it and test it rationally.  But when I go to my rational
thought for insight, all I get is a bunch of weighing pros and cons and feel
de-centered.

After reading the extropian principles, I understand the need to put
emotions and insight in their proper place.  However, it seems to me that
there's too much minimization of those too qualities of human life.  Yes,
much of human experience and history has been plagued by unchecked emotion.
But let's not reverse the swing in the opposite direction.  I would prefer
to see an understanding put forth that expresses a relationship between
insight, emotion, and rational as though they were equals, each with their
own realm of action.  Do any extropians view it this way?

I love that perspective, with my original training in engineering and my

wonder I love science fiction. I guess with my natural computer ability it
even predicts my love of cyberpunk.

Then you are blind.  Every day, we are bombarded with advertising, messages,
and memetic influences that keep us enslaved to materialism.  Why do I live
such a self-destructive life that I can't seem to find a way to escape?
Mainly because I'm a powerless, corporate pawn.  I don't want the life that
I have- but I know no way out, at least none that looks very appealing the
minute I step out into the cold Minnesota air.

It seems that most want to explain it away or marginalize it... which, for
those of us whose talents don't lie in the realm of the applied or
theoretical sciences, is rather akin to being assigned a second-class
status, IMHO.

I think the problem here is that people mix up mysticism,
spirituality, magick and the supernatural.


(Hej Anders,
Yea, sorry, everything's the same to me.
I write pages, but summarize and generalize them into single words.)
Mysticism, spirituality, magick, and the supernatural
all represent the same crap.
It's all weird stuff that really effects you deeply.
It's weird and deep stuff.
Deep stuff is weird, and everything effects you somehow,
so I guess it's all just stuff isn't it?
I went from 4 distinct subsets into their superset and related their 
superset to all sets and the point of all this is...
WHAT'S THE POINT!
IT'S ALL STUFF!
I'm sick of people saying this or that is or is not extropian!
USE IT!
SEE IF IT HELPS!
SHUT UP AND DO SOMETHING!
WORDS ARE CHEAP!
We are talking here again.
I've been here for years.
This list has not done much for me but waste my time.
WHY ARE WE HERE?
There are so many geniuses here...
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY!?!
SAY IT!!
I am losing all hope.
I've been a transhumanist for years
and all I've learned how to do is alienate myself
by doing things that nobody else does.
All my friends smoke and drink and race towards the grave while getting 
blowjobs in fast cars on their way to stuff their faces with fast food and I 
have to sit and watch them all die one by one.
In my mind I already think of them as walking corpses.
Nobody trys to live to be 150.

How am I going to survive that long?
I can make it to 150 if I don't starve to death.
As it is I can't even afford to feed myself.
I'm seriously thinking about moving to Antarctica to hunt seals
because I have no place to live, I'm homeless, poor, anti-social

I hate everything about everything

Everything should be better.
There is no place in society for me because I am trying to make a better 
society and society doesn't want to help me change it.
I boycott and I strike because I see evil everywhere.
It's killing me.
I'm going to die and I'm furious.
Do any of you think the world wants to change,
to be changed,
by you?
I can't do this by myself and neither can you,
but I don't see anybody helping me.
People have underground cities that I would love to live in,
but would they let me...
NO!
I want to take a ride in the shuttle...
HAH!
I want to be a nice guy,

it seems like I'll have to do alot of killing and stealing

I'll have to destroy democracy to protect us from the idiots who make the

Nobody will help me with that.
The world has the technology to achieve great things,
but since it's not our stuff then it won't be used for our ideas
and even if it is used for our ideas "they" are not going to let us use it.)



Mysticism is the epistemological position that some truths can or must
be grasped by direct insight, not empirical thought.  Spirituality is
about meaning, the core values that we have. It doesn't have to
involve any spirits.  Magick,

Transhumanism is out to improve the human condition using efficient
means.

Scott Painter's rant brings up a good point, precisely the point that I've
been trying to get across- what in the heck does it all mean?  What is it
that makes us want to reduce and deconstruct anything, until we are
ultimately left with a faded, grey noosphere that is anything but fufilling
and enlightening?  As I've said before, perhaps your singularity won't
come... what then?

To me, Extropianism is something of a postmodernist apocalypse cult.  "Yes,
everything will be good when the singularity comes.  We'll all live forever
under the aegis of some super-AI, we'll have infinite speed and infinite
consciousness, etc, etc... and everyone who opposes this vision is EVIL.
Yes, deep ecologists, mystics, anarchists, communists, liberals, stuffy
conservatives- all of these are the DEVIL.  But we won't worry about them,
all we need to do is live our ultra-healthy, regimented, disciplined lives
long enough for the Singularity to come, and we will be delivered into the
garden of paradise."

It's so Gnostic it almost makes me ill.

PS- This is just one side of me talking.  There are few things that I enjoy
more than playing Devil's Advocate.

Hey, I'll bite. Kindly point me to any relevant web page, and I'll check it 
out.
I spent a good deal of my youth looking at the supernatural angle (the whole 
bit -- UFOs, Wicca, ESP). I've grown as disenchanted with it as I did with 
organized religion, and then religion in general. If I could believe in the 
afterlife, I'd go for reincarnation, myself, since I'd rather live in this 
world than in any Heaven. 

Reality -- where the action is.

I have exactly the same view. Long-time readers of this list may
remember that I actually did study magick fairly seriously once upon a
dark age :-) but abandoned it for psychology and cognitive
neuroscience - they seem to work much better, have empirical support
and you avoid getting those colds after chanting at a crossroad all
night :-) There are some valid and interesting phenomena there to
investigate and use, but re-inventing magick is a huge task.

As Damasio pointed out, rational acting requires us to have an intect
link between our biological decision systems ("thinking") and our
value systems ("emotion"). People who have damage to this interaction
think rationally but when they act in practice their bad evaluation of
what is good or bad make them do completely stupid things. This is
likely true to a lesser degree about most of us: we need to re-tune
our values and link them with our thinking in order to live
productive, rewarding lives.

I think Max expressed it quite well in his talk at Extro 3, where he
spoke about the need for civilized emotions. The goal is not to become
an emotionless robot, but rather like Spock of Star Trek, who did have
emotions but mainly positive, useful ones like loyalty, curiosity and
humor.

Our brain structures must be vastly different. I'm "bombarded" with the same 
messages, but don't seem to be wearing anything with a brand name on it. I 
don't have cable and don't even turn the tv on except for when watching 
something from the VCR, and I buy my clothes at thrift stores. I have never 
heard a commercial that made me stand up in a zombie-like manner and begin 
walking to the mall saying "MUST.. BUY.. BIG MAC.. AND NIKES". If you do, 
then just stop doing it. It's not blindness, it's free will.

Give some specifics, this is to vague for me to suggest any remedy for you.
But I'll reiterate that I am subject to the same advertising messages that 
you are, but am in no way "enslaved to materialism". Everything I purchase 
is useful to me and purchased voluntarily.

If something is indistinguishable, than what is the difference?  (Which

Think harder. It is indistinguishable for a primitive observer, but not for 
the *wielder.* I don't think a gun is magic (come to think of it, some 
gun-control advocates seem to think guns are --evil-- magic, but that's 
another subject altogether); just because some primitive spear chucker thinks 
it is doesn't *make it magical.*

I agree with all that you mentioned, but no one has yet explained why we have 
not already been overrun by other transsentient cultures or see no evidence 
of their existence- I see only three possible explanations-

1. We're the only planet in the universe that has developed sentient life. 
(Highly unlikely)
2. All sentient cultures are doomed to destroy themselves- there is no 
singularity, no offworld colonization, no transsentience- so your entire
extropian movement is moot, and we should best look elsewhere for our answers.
3. By gaining cognition of the universe at a level beyond our comprehension, 
they have gained an understanding that has allowed them to transcend the
objective universe and become, essentially, gods.<<

Here's a few more:

4. Sentient life is far more common than *technological* sentient life. We 
might be the only species in this galaxy that has gone from simple tool use 
to an actual technology-wielding civilization. If you look at the history of 
humankind, you can see that our leap to technology was a rather unlikely 
event, due to a fortuituous juxtaposition of circumstances. Otherwise, our 
technological development would have remained slow and incremental (i.e., 
compare technological progress between 10,000 B.C.E. and 1500 C.E. to 
technological progress between 1500 and 2000 C.E.).

5. FTL is impossible, and technological societies eventually become content 
with settling down comfortably in their own solar system (why bother seeding 
other worlds when there is no conceivable return?). 

6. An advanced society doesn't necessarily expand to fill every available 
niche in the universe. Even if FTL is possible, an ultra-tech society may 
reach zero population growth, and may expand beyond its boundaries very 
slowly, if at all (in fact, it might be that the ability to control 
demographic pressures is a prerequiste for developing an interstellar 
civilzation).

7. Once they advance high enough, advanced species migrate to the core of 
their galaxies, where more plentiful energy sources are available, leaving 
the relatively cool fringes to us primitives. Note that this is different 
from #3 because a race that may decide black holes make for excellent 
batteries does not necessarily have to "transcend the objective universe."

And that's off the top of my head. None of which buy any yams, btw. We ain't 
gonna achieve Transcendence (or even build a better mousetrap) by looking 
breathlessly toward the skies waiting for some Savior.

Hah!  You're forgetting something- our knowledge of the so-called "laws" of 
the "natural universe" are, in fact, the most likely interpretations that our 
senses and our limited brains are able to give us.  A transhuman would
be supernatural, in the fact that through the knowledge and manipulation of 
forces beyond the comprehension of "mere mortals", they could essentially 
alter realities in ways that could only be seen as going beyond the "laws" of 
the universe.  Which, again, brings us back to Arthur C. Clarke's 
statement...<<

Maybe. Then again, maybe not. A Transhuman's greater understanding of the 
forces of nature might be able to manipulate said forces in ways we cannot 
currently comprehend, without going beyond those laws (and they most likely 
will have their own unrealized goals and aspirations, and probably somebody 
whispering to them that something greater and beyond their ken lies somewhere 
ahead).

This cannot be known until it has been experienced.<<

One can make a reasoned guess. I don't *know* that an Angel of the Lord is 
going to suddenly appear in front of me and tell me I am the clone of the 
Messiah, but I can make a guess it's not going to happen.

Open minds, but not so open your brain falls out.

Heh... I skipped UFO's, Wicca, and ESP, and jumped straight into
Transpersonal Psychology, Chaos Magick, and Gaia Theory.  As for afterlife,
that's not really what concerns me (all conceptions that I've created in my
mind of the afterlife are in a realm beyond words or labels... they're too
incomprehensible for such structures)- I'm more concerned with the nature of
human experience, the idea of myth, and theoretical levels of post-rational
cognition.  In the year that has passed since I became involved with such
studies, I've had more than a few twists, turns, and strange experiences.

I'm not going to quote it here - but let me being with a hearty "me too!".

Now, to try and clarify some of those questions, let me try to repose them, and
add a few of my own.

(a) What are we doing to extend both the quantity and quality of our lives?
     In this I mean - there's a lot of diet information out there, exercise,
     nutrition, supplements, etc.  What of it works, and what's bunk?  What
     are we all doing, colelctively and as individuals, to try and extend
     and enhance our own biological lives so that we are well enough to 
     take advantage of the better life extension technology down the line?

     Where are the threads on nutrition, etc.?  I don't see them much, but
     I would imagine this is one of the core things we can do, as individuals
     today, to assure we live to see more of the future, instead of waiting 
     for some technological savior to come and uplift us from our unhealthy
     lives.  

     Ironically, some of th ebest advice I've gotten on health, nutrition,
     exercise, etc. comes from one of those mystic, green types that seem to
     be generally denigrated around here.  Maybe if we listened with open
     minds instead of closed ears to some of what they had to say, we could
     learn something.

(b) What are we and can we do to benefit the movement out of the gravity
  well and into space?
     Of all the transhuman technologies, space habitation is the one closest
     to realization.  Why then do we sit and debate nanotech, uploading, 
     AS, and other things that may be tens if not hundreds of years away, when
     the biggest barrier to space exploration and settlement, other than
     NASA/ESA/Energiya/etc., is the cost of getting out of the gravity well?
     Satellite launches are a multi-billion dollar business; there HAS to be 
     someone out there with enough marketing savvy to begin mining venture 
     capital - and aren't at least SOME of us genuine rocket scientists?  If
     we can mine the satellite launch process as a source ofincome, we could
     suddenly have what ever non-mainstream political and social group wishes
     it had - a power base, economically.

     It would be a simple matter from an inexpensive launch mechanism to full-
     scale private habitation in space, to manufacturing and community 
     formation.  Keep the company private - or at least majority-privately
     held, and construct a business plan that runs in the 50-100 year span.
     I've been constructing a near-future sceince fiction universe on almost
     this premise, and it's incredibly feasable; the more research I do, the
     more feasable it seems.  Where are the people working for this?

(c) People who are not economic libertarians have significant greivances; why
   aren't we addressing these?
     Things such as overseas labor conditions, personal sovereignty, artificial
     scarcity in key needs (such as housing), environmental degredation, and
     the oft-proven link between agrochemicals and cancer are concerns raised
     again and again by those across the political spectrum.  These are not
     political concerns, but social ones.  

     Are these things dismissed because they're the hard questions, and we want
     to only answer the easy ones?  Or are they simply inconvenient for the 
     political and personal philosophies of some of the speakers here?  We
     are intelligent; we should all be capable of rising above cheap rhetorical
     devices and knee-jerk dismissals to consider issues at the fundamental 
     level.  I vote Browne in the election, not because I beleive in economic 
     libertarianism, but SOCIAL libertarianism - an increasing number of 
     people who were formerly of the Liberal(/)Democrat mold are looking for
     an alternative to the Mommy/Daddy state especially in terms of direct.
     discreet personal sovereignty, and LIbertarianism has all the right 
     things; but it seems it's too busy trying to be a splinter off the 
     Republican Right, rather than along a different poltical axis entirely.

     So what about these social issues, the ones that transcend simple 
     political pigeonholing, despite our attempts to do so.  Let's consider
     how to take some of these issues from the statists, and turn this to 
     our advantage.  No one wants to see people starving in the street - 
     how do you manage to feed people or enable them to feed themselves 
     without turning to handouts and massive government subsidies?  How do
     you assure a stable food supply with fewer and fewer externally added
     chemicals, while addressing the fears of "outbreaks" and possible
     negative reactions in those whom eat these new foods?  It's all about
     tradeoffs in the real world - if you fear the Greens so much, find 
     what their issues are and present solutions to the issues that fit
     with your mode of thinking, instead of simply dismissing them as non-
     issues.

But now I've started to rant, which is a signal for this to end.  But in 
closing, I'm going to steal a series of questions from J. Michael Strazynski
(sp?):

Who are we?
What do we want?
Why are we here?

The answers aren't as easy as you might at first thing.

The origins of science are shared with (natural) magick ..... and I feel
that the very best scientists (Newton, Descartes &c) are those who manage to
combine all aspects of their personality, even using alchemical techniques
and magickal disciplines, rather than just conventionalist automatons.

> A transhuman is not supernatural.

No, but Gematria, Cryptology & alchemy are not necessarily "supernaturalist"
either. Druidic and shamanic systems are nature-based, not supernatural.
Drug experience and hypnotic/trance experience is "scientifically"
verifiable .... mystical but not supernatural.

As a POSTHUMAN I follow theGolden Dawn maxim to be "more than human" ...
which formula also seems to embrace the transhuman/extropian stance?

I quite happily combine my Bodhisattva vows, posthuman (MVT) philosophy with
my work as an (Enochian) Magus ..... but don't have recourse to any
supernaturalist beliefs.

Level Up!

Some specifics from this side:  

I have attained a fairly reasonable level in my career (sysadmin/CM) and I'm
fairly well-paid.  However, the work does very little for me other than 
bringing in money to pay for the things that I need, but can't provide for 
myself without the media for exchange.  

I've got some money in savings, and I've been working on investing it slowly
to try and get a good nestegg going.  However, it seems my savings are growing
slower than the cost of living.

I gre up rural - I know how to take care of things like animals and plants, and
I wouldnt' mind returning to that sort of a life partially - not a Luddite
hermit like the Unabomber, but a techno-hermit, with satellite uplink, 
computers, generating my own power, taking care of most of my needs without
reliance on the outside.  

But in the end it comes down to the tyrany of money.  There is no place I 
can live without either the fear of imminent confiscation by the latest 
banana republic despot in the name of "land reform", or the need to have some
sort of steady income to pay the various property taxes.  

So here is the conundrum.  The land that is inexpensive enough to afford is
too far from the places I am capable of finding work (did I mention I'm a
widely-read, hopefully well-spoken high school grad?  No college diploma
here, unfortunately - and that cuts my options down even more), and the land
close enough to be able to work reasonably is very expensive now, especially 
for what would be needed for this sort of subsistence, and at the same time 
it's also prone to the "divide and conquer" property tax progression - one 
farmer sells out to a developer for 50 units, and they agree to add $5000
per acre in property taxes for new schools - after all, they're only paying
$500-$1250 at best for their share, but the farmer next door just got tagged 
for $500,000 more per year, and is forced to sell to a developer, and it
goes on and on.

And my work does very little toward allowing me to pursue the things I hold
most dear - because I have to spend so much o my time dealing with traffic, 
and working most of my waking hours to pay for the house I don't really want
and the gas I would like to not have to use to get to and from a job that
doesn't really line up with my personal interests.  But it's the trap of the 
moneyed system.

Yes, I understand a true libertarian society would have a different set of 
problems, and I could find a place where I wouldn't have to pay property
taxes - but if you can show me a true libertarian nation I could move to...

There.  Specific enough?

What nonsense?  Being trained to death in logic still leaves rooms full of
philosophers arguing to no apparent end... that which is rational often ends
up being more a matter of opinion than truth, even if the beast "truth" does
exist.

How do we know that God hasn't already been manufactured billions of times,

Onward, Brother!

As an IOT Novice and an ADF Dedicant, I also explore magickal ideas without
supernaturalism- yes, from one end it's all hypnosis, brain waves, and
fantasies, but from another perspective, it's magick and mysticism.  Is the
gun in my hand or is it in Tyler's?  Doesn't change a thing.

BTW, Enochian is an interesting system... even though I prefer Ouranian.
Both are great examples of what I like to call Cosmos++, the celestial
programming language. ;)

If you want to discuss mysticism, numerology, astrology, magick, or Crowley:

DO IT ELSEWHERE!

It doesn't matter whether mysticism is the true underlying reality or utter
horse hockey.  This is the Extropians list.  This is the place for science and
edgy high-tech future shock.

Thanks for the links.  This does look bad.

Be careful interpreting this official source.  The Florida Secretary of
State is a Republican and also the co-chair of Bush's election campaign in
Florida.  The Attorney General of Florida (Democrat) has stated that the
ballot is clearly illegal.  Quoting officials doesn't seem to help, because
they all are following party lines.

Forida law clearly says that the name must be printed on the left and the
vote indicator box must appear to the right of the name.  Most legal
analysts agree that there is no question here.  The question of whether this
technicality affected the vote is an entirely different matter.

Threads on these subjects come up all the time, most of the time
you don't see them because they've been discussed already. Just
recently I posted about a book by CBS medical man Dr Bob Arnot for
example. In fact I've dropped 10 hard-to-lose pounds so far
following this strategy.

If you have something usefull to contribute, go ahead and do so.
But remember you've a list of intelligent people here, many of them
scientists, and we've all seen every diet fad/nutritional quackery
to come along.

Go back and re-read the Extropians principals and see if this time
you can figure out what this list is for.

I'm not being harsh or sarcastic, I'm trying to point out that what
you want to do is outside the purpose of this list.

As an example, the comment about the greens, with the exception of
yet another redistribute-somebody-elses-wealth scheme, everything
they're advocating can be accomplished under the present system if
people are willing to do it. The fact is most people don't want to,
they want someone to force everyone do it.

Not interested.

If you are willing then go out, do it, and report back on your
success.

A classic ectomorph problem ;)

Weight lifting is the answer, along with getting sufficient
protein. You don't have to get crazy, just lift enough so that 10-
15 reps is about all you can manage. Perfect form is the key. Maybe
Max will add more/better info.

Never really cared for Rand, but I do think good ole American
Capitalism (it deserves a capital) is the best economic system yet
developed. Notice I said yet, we're Extropians after all. ;)

Put 10% of everything you make into long term growth, pay yourself
first! For now, that means a money-market type account. They do
considerably better than the inflation rate (which is around 3%).
When you have 3-6 months of living expenses sacked away it's time
for the next step. Today go to the Motley fool website www.fool.com
and take their free "Fool School course".

Be more afraid of the greens, once you start building equity you'll

Well, you didn't say where your from, somehow I get the impression
you're out on the great plains.

Take a piece of advice from someone who would do things differently
if he could. In this country, at this time, college is practically
essential, and make sure part of that education is business
training.

Bite the bullet.

Remember the saying by Arthur C. Clarke?  Any science/technology
sufficiently advanced is indistinquishable from magic.  Want to be immortal,
fly through the air, have food materialize out of thin air, ... ? Through
science/technology we know we can do these things.  We deliver on what
religions claim.  

Truly this isn't supernatural but imho supernatural is simply a
misunderstanding of where transcendent abilities come from and how they can
exist.  "Transcendent" being a relative term here rather than being some
woozy transcending of reality.  It looks like transcending reality to minds
that have a more limited understanding of what is and is not possible in
reality.  

In my opinion we should gather up religious folks and some types of what is
called "mystical" folks and point out that they don't need pie in the sky.
They can have real pie.  

There are many different things that are called "mystical".  Some of them
are more philosophical/state of mind/experiental states rather than being
some claims of transcending reality.  But I would point out that quantum
mechanics defines reality at its most fundamental level as being quite
different and even spooky compared to most people's common-sense notion of
reality.  This doesn't mean it should be used to excuse all kinds of
weak-minded nonsense as has become trendy among some of the new-age set.

Then you are blind.  Every day, we are bombarded with advertising, messages,
and memetic influences that keep us enslaved to materialism.  Why do I live
such a self-destructive life that I can't seem to find a way to escape?
Mainly because I'm a powerless, corporate pawn.  I don't want the life that
I have- but I know no way out, at least none that looks very appealing the
minute I step out into the cold Minnesota air.

samantha:
You claim you have no power and are a pawn so you have no power.  Take
responsibility for your own life rather than blaming some nebulous corporate
evil.  Are you claiming that advertising, messages and "memetic influences"
are more powerful than your own will and choices?  Really?  

Do you equate advertising and memetics with physical force?  I hope you
never have a blunt lesson in the actual and extremely large difference.  Do
you equate the power of the dollar with the power of a gun threatening your
very life if you do not conform to the wielders orders?

The only way to escape memetics totally is to run off to a deserted island.
Memetics are a natural part of any communicating species existence. Clearly,
living outside of all society and interaction with others is not reasonable.

It sounds to me you are seeking an escape from reality itself.  There is
only one escape from that.  I don't think you want to go there.

Of course, extropy has been called a cult before, usually by trolls,
much like yourself.  As there is no particular OTHER reason to call
extropianism a cult, (as I'll attempt to show), usually they fall back
on calling us dogmatists, which, I have to presume, is what you were
driving at in your parody of an extropian calling deep-ecologists "the
DEVIL."

As I've said before, no extropian is my leader.  None of them tell me
what to do, or what to believe.  I've disagreed with Max More, for
example, time and again.  I'm sure I will in the future.

I think he and I agree that there is not only a non-trivial chance of
apocalyptic disaster in the next century, (a possibility which
everyone became aware of around the time of the cold war,) but also a
chance of unprecedented wealth, longevity, and, dare I say it,
happiness.  Neither of these possibilities is inevitable, though I
think they're quite likely outcomes of the next century or two.

But it is in holding these beliefs *tentatively*, and in not allowing
our beliefs to be determined by a leader or any other person, that we
demonstrate our rationality (in particular, our rejection of dogma).
We are not cultists or dogmatists of any other kind.

I don't know much about Gnosticism.  I do know that typical Gnostics
have tended to prioritize the "spiritual" realm over the "physical"
realm.  I rather doubt most extropians would agree with that.

Being "apocalyptic" is in the spirit of Gnosticism (along with many
other religions), but there are plenty of obvious reasons why you
might expect *something* big to happen in the next century.  For one
thing, our weapons have gotten drastically bigger.  The potential for
doom at our own hands is so obvious that it's hardly worth mentioning.
For another, our population is still growing exponentially, with all
of the benefits and drawbacks that entails.  Finally, Moore's law,
along with what we already know about physics and computer science,
seem to suggest that our creations will begin to get very interesting
as we learn more and more about how to make our computers faster.

However, most Gnostics also hold that gnosis, a special kind of arcane
knowledge, is what you need to survive apocalypse.  While I think most
of us agree that you can make yourself more powerful if you know more,
knowledge by itself won't make you better off.  I rather doubt that
there will be a mystic quiz at the end of time; if anybody here DOES
think that, I rather doubt they believe that this is view is
particularly relevant to extropy.

So, we are neither cultists, nor Gnostic.  Make of that what you will.

I don't think this is actually true or realistic, Eli. I love
science, but it's certainly not the main draw. If so, it would
become a homogenous same-same-voice that thinks it has a leg
up on intriguing notions. Too much emphasis on science is like
communicating with a single processing power.

Edgy high-tech future shock?  Hey, relax and olfac-flex.  Extropic
thinking in its finest produces a well organized system of knowledgeable
behaviors performing in a synergistic capacity, and not run on
any single slice of science.

Alluring and mind-spanking ideas about SI are created by multi-task
mental architects, not dogmatized profession mongers.

I agree.  I learned ways of centering and seeing more holistically from
various forms of meditation and mysticism.  The unscientific and
anti-rational parts of most mystical systems are definitely a problem.  But
it is not an all or nothing package deal.  There are things in some of these
systems very much needed and useful in life.

Oh yes.  Thank you for bringing it up.  IMHO many extropians get too
reductionistic in their thinking as the supposed price for rationality and
scientific objectivity.  I find a lot of assumptions based on the state of
knowledge today and especially how we came to be through natural selection
and so on that is mapped forward onto a future where the basis for many of
those assumptions does not necessarily hold.  In the future selection is
quite un-natural in that it is to some fairly large degree redefinable by us
as we redefine ourselves.  We are standing in a place of tremendous
opportunity to remake ourselves and most of our everyday reality.  It
requires a lot of suppleness and ability to step outside the box in order to
take maximum advantage of that opportunity.  The choices are much vaster
than just a supercharged version of the same basic attitudes and concerns as
we have now. Design the reality you wish to inhabit and then see how close
you can come using science and technology.

Also, as I have mentioned before, I believe changes like going from scarcity
based economics to abundance and the vastly increased intellectual abilities
and intercommunication will  change the very bedrock of much of human
sociology and psychology.  Much of the current ego structure and some of the
innate drives we have evolved with will need remapping and even in part
require removal or replacing with more useful tendencies.  Guess what parts
of humanity has for centuries dealt with stepping outside normal ego
boundaries and looking at things quite differently?  There is quite a bit to
be learned from some parts of mysticism.  We would be idiots not to mine it
where we can.  That we mine it does not mean we step into its quicksands
cluelessly.

How about if we wish to discuss people telling their fellow extropians and
transhumanists what to discuss or what is and is not part of being
extropian?  If you want to be a control freak then do that elsewhere. Stop
yelling.  You might learn something. 

Edgy high-tech future shock leads straight into spaces where cosciousness
itself changes and where we better deal with the soft and somtimes rather
wierd seeming aspects of our being.  The separation is not so clean or
simple as you might wish.

The consensus of the experts, according to my reading over the last 20 
years or so, is that 8-10 reps per set maximizes muscle growth. 4-6 reps 
will maximize strength, while 15 or more reps (with short rest breaks) will 
improve aerobic conditioning and muscle tone with less muscle growth. Some 
simple steps to maximize muscle gain:

-- 8-10 reps per set.

-- Take a good break between sets (in heavy training mode I take a 
two-minute break) so that you can use heavy weights on every set.

-- Use the heaviest weight you can possibly manage for 8-10 reps.

-- To protect your body, especially when lifting heavy weights, use strict 
form. (I see a lot of sloppy execution at the gym.)

-- Don't overtrain. That means working each muscle group as hard as 
possible (after a month or two of building up), then letting it rest for 
*at least* 3 or 4 days, preferably a week. Big muscle groups (like quads) 
take longer to recover than smaller ones (like biceps).

-- Cut down on carbs that have no real nutrition and replace with lean 
protein sources, especially fish.

-- An hour or so before working out, drink a protein shake containing whey 
protein, creatine (which will immediately produce a weight gain due to 
water retention but will help you push your muscles harder), and glutamine.

-- Get plenty of sleep (let that growth hormone be released).

That should cover most of the important basics. For a good reference on a 
wide range of exercises from which to choose, buy Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding.

This program works for me. (I'm also doing a fair amount of aerobic 
exercise, but that will not add to your muscle growth and too much may 
actually reduce it.) At 36, I'm stronger than I've ever been, weighing 193 
lbs and (according to my Kronos Clinc tests) with a bodyfat that is well 
below average for a 20 year old. A similar program is also working well for 
Natasha, whose physique blows away practically all women half her age 
whatever that might be ;-) .

Boundless expansion!

I'd heard that Ken Macleod's recent SF novel "The
Cassini Division" had been discussed on this list,
but can't find mention of it either at http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/
or via Google search.

At the risk of rehashing an old thread (someone
let me know please), I'd like to recommend the
book.  

I was particularly amused at the treatment of the
meeting of representatives of anarchosocialist and
anarchocapitalist (my camp) societies.  The viewpoint
character comes from the former, and is not badly
fleshed out in her strengths and unquestioned 
weaknesses.

It's not your usual libertarian SF.  It won't confirm
existing prejudices and dispositions.  It's systematically
less-than-perfectly predictable.

The ending has a bit of Eric Frank Russell, if you look
for it carefully...

Except that I have in fact created many alluring and mind-spanking ideas about
SI, and the people droning on about mysticism did not.  Ergo, I am a
multi-task mental architect, and the mystics are dogmatized profession
mongers.   In fact, I cannot recall a single mystic appearing on the slate
that extends from Egan to Vinge.

We may further deduce that intolerance of stupidity does not lead to dogma,
but it must be coupled with two other rare abilities: the ability to apply
this intolerance equally to oneself and the ideas one values, plus the ability
to distinguish stupidity from intelligence.  But tolerance of stupidity,
especially if it leads to tolerance of one's own stupidity, or if it is caused
by an inability to tell the difference, leads only to ideas chosen on the
basis of how nice they sound.  And those ideas do not have the raw,
shock-edged, mind-bending power that the mystics claim to seek.  I can shock
the living daylights out of anyone except an actual transhumanist or an
Extropian, and some of those as well.

The Cosmic Consciousness folks can't shock anyone except the people
deliberately trying to be shocked.  They can't leave themselves because they
have nowhere to go.  And above all, I have the power to change the world, and
they don't.

I'll stick with my intolerance of stupidity, thank you.

I wasn't calling it a cult- I was just referring to the attitude many
extropians have regarding "The Singularity".  We're running out of
resources, destroying our environment- yet you seem to think that we'll be
saved by this occurence.  I think otherwise.

By apocalypse, I was not referring to disaster, but to rapture.  Where is
all this wealth going to come from, with our resources destroyed by the
wasteful behavior of the 20th century?  Where is this longevity going to
come from, with our veins filled with carcinogens and our bodies bombarded
by radiation?  Where is this happiness going to come from, with our
spirituality destroyed by "flatlander" philosophers, our arts smashed by a
media concerned only with profits, living in a world where we work from
sunup until sundown with no hope for another world hereafter?

Rationalism is a dogma in of itself.

Yes, but they were working from an ascending paradigm.  Extropianism is
Gnosticism reversed, the exact same stand within a descending paradigm.

Ah, this is where you are incorrect.  Gnosticism isn't just about posessing
the knowledge- it's about using it.  Extropianism is about knowledge as
well, and the gaining of a form of arcane knowledge- Artificial
intelligence, nanotech, etc.

A Pill to Extend Life? Don't Dismiss the Notion Too Quickly
By NICHOLAS WADE


- The Extropian PR Dept.



>From the article:

Dr. Tomas A. Prolla, a geneticist who studies aging at the University of
Wisconsin, said Dr. Guarente's report was the first to link the life
extension effects of caloric restriction to a single gene.

"If the find can be translated to animals, it will be very important," Dr.
Prolla said, because it would provide "a starting point in the design of
drugs which would have a broad effect on human health, including cancer."

if there is an optimum amount of muscle use, food-energy conversion,
neural activity for an individual (based on the individual's current
genetic structure and averaged environment). and that this activity is
regulated and "matched" via homeostasis (and other support mechanism)
via the average environment, what is the purpose of exercise?  is it
an overextension?  a bank/buffer?  a counteraction?  what would be the
advantage of producing an individual with excessive muscle (or quality
1001), where, the individual does not require muscle in the normal
environment.  is energy being wasted through investment and
maintenance?  (perhaps i am modeling this after cerebral ectomorphs).

Well, the easy answer is that we may put the finishing touches on a
Friendly seed AI which will set nanites to work for us.  But I'll do a
little more work, since I doubt that will satisfy you.

I'll start with resources, because that's the easiest.  While there's
lots of great things here on Earth, things that, as far as we know, we
can't find or make anywhere else, raw energy is not one of them.
Neither is raw stuff.

Now, in case you weren't aware of it, Earth's resources can't be saved
forever, or even anything like forever.  The Earth will be swallowed
up by our dying sun billions of years from now; some large rock will
almost certainly come flying at us out of the Oort cloud MUCH sooner
than that.

If this happens at a technological stage in which we can evacuate the
earth, getting hit or swallowed up will, indeed, be a great loss.  But
we'll be losing lots of plant and animal life, millions of years of
evolution, diversity and mystery.  Resources would be the least of our
concerns; indeed, I argue that resources, as such, wouldn't be a
concern at all.  Stars, black holes, other weirder forms of energy,
all of these await civilization if it doesn't kill itself.

> Where is this longevity going to come from, with our veins filled
> with carcinogens and our bodies bombarded by radiation?

As for longevity in the face of widespread carcinogens, the answer to
your question is medicine.  100 years of medicine, assuming we
survive, will almost certainly bring with it a heck of a lot of
development.  While the immortality that most of us seek is certainly
impossible barring something like the AI/nanotech one-two punch that
seems to dissatisfy you, there are easier ways to live longer.  Many
poisons have antidotes.  Many diseases have cures or vaccines.  There
will be many more antidotes, cures and vaccines developed over the
next 100 years (presuming, again, that we don't blow ourselves up in
the meantime).  These medicines will become increasingly affordable,
thanks to the wealth we expect from a century of economic growth.
Medicines are cheaper now in real terms than they were 100 years
ago.  This trend will continue, if we survive.

> Where is this happiness going to come from, with our spirituality

I'm sure I can never convince you that technological progress can make
us happier.  I will point out that we tend to be happier the wealthier
we are, but this tendency is weak.  Granted, crime tends to be lower,
and, more generally, rich civilizations tend to be freer (on anybody's
terms) than poor civilizations. * We also enjoy living longer, so long
as we don't run out of resources.  But happiness, while it can
correlate with these things, is not captured in any of the above.

* [The noble savage is not a myth, but he's hardly the norm.  Spare me
your hamlet of paradise story; *most* hamlets are hellholes.]

You mention "flatlander" philosophers, but flatland philosophy finds
more of a home in places and people focused on pragmatism for its own
sake (cf Soviet atheism) than in leisurely societies with time and
money to spare.  There's a reason that the postmodern notion of
"discourse" wasn't discovered until the late 20th century by
capitalists yearning for benevolent anarchy.  Indeed, I posit that
"discourse," especially in the sense of "free play" will characterize
philosophy in the years to come, for this very reason.  We will still
be analytic, but will will understand our analysis in terms of a
discussion, rather than as a grand proof.

As for our arts, there the correlation to wealthier and more leisurely
societies is far more obvious.  So, for those who WANT challenging and
engaging art, a high-technology society will be in the best way to get
it.  If you want high art, you look to where there's the MOST art,
namely rich time periods and cultures like the Renaissance, like the
musings of the idle priesthood in the East and in the West, like the
20th century (more than all of these put together).

But, even if art is available to those who want it, perhaps our media
and our culture seems geared not to desire it.  You're right to be
worried about the increasing solidarity our culture is developing; we
should be more open to art (and entertainment generally) that isn't
the same thing we've always had.  But if anything will ameliorate THAT
problem, other than the proliferation of art itself, it is longevity.
You can't watch TV sitcoms and hope to watch the same old thing
forever.  Even the best prime time dramas capture too much of the old,
and not enough of the challengingly different.  But the older we get,
I assert, the duller that will be; or, if not, the more depth we will
find when we return to the classics.

By the way, try to be open minded to those working for profit.  They
are, in fact, working for the masses.  They're the ones finding the
common bonds between their peers, sharing in their solidarity.  The
people prize them most of all.  That's why they keep paying.

> living in a world where we work from sunup until sundown with no

Leisure is easier when you're richer.  Breaks come more naturally when
you have time to spare.  The "world" of death looks less appealing
when the future has never looked so good, and you can be sure you'll
be there to see it.

Assuming we make it, of course.

> Rationalism is a dogma in of itself.

If my *only* dogma is in being rational, then I think I'm doing pretty
well, frankly.

I'm not sure the analogy makes sense.  Most extropians doubt the
existence of a spiritual world as such.  So, I GUESS you could say
that's a kind of villification of the spiritual world, but it's a
rather forced comparison, if you ask me.

Well, as I said, I know hardly a thing about Gnosticism.  Will arcane
knowledge "save" us?  Sort of.  I'd say that if SOMEBODY has arcane
knowledge and uses it in the right way, then our chances of surviving
the destruction of the Earth look much better.  But I, personally,
don't need to know how an AI works or how to program a nanite to
receive that kind of "salvation."  Rather, I need to be able to afford
the medicine of immorality, when it's developed.  I need to be
powerful; if knowledge gives me that power, well, great, but if I
manage to get there by investment banking, so be it.

Again, the analogy seems forced.

Has anyone looked at this yet?

www.stardrive.org

Physicist Jack Sarfatti, Ph.D. is a wild character. And he seems quite
interested in life extension, space exploration, and other Extropianistic
concerns. I think it's rumored that he was the model for the mad scientist
in the movie Back To The Future. 

Would anyone with knowledge of physics offer a comment on this?

Do you think we will be saved by anything else?  Do you think switching to
all solar, geothermal, wind and so on will save us?  Do you think (SI help
us) that redistributing all the wealth equally will save us?  Better tech is
essential to solving most of our resource issues.  Better personal and
collective intelligence (largely but not totally via technology) and better
psychology are essential to finding and applying solutions.  

Did you ever read Julian Simon?  We create new resources using our
intelligence and a (relatively) free market.  Given enough technology we can
heal the environment to better than mythological Garden of Eden standards.
But most Greens tend to ignore such inconvenient facts.

Wealth comes from where it always does, from applied intelligence.  Increase
the intelligence and the efficacy of its application and you increase
wealth.  Wealth is not a matter of static resources.  Resources themselves
are not static in a fundamental sense.   In case you haven't noticed our
lifetimes are increasing already even without the coming nanomedical (and
other) medical advances.  Your portrayal of the amount of carcinogens and
pollutants and their effect on human longevity is grossly out-of-date.   

Spiritualities, as much as I think of some aspects of some of them, have not
produced very much happiness historically.  They have excused and
strengthened many utter atrocities along with what comfort some gained.  The
worse flatlanders have been religious throughout western history.  

I don't see fine arts being smashed by the media any time soon.  

Who needs a world hereafter when this very world we live in (and the near
universe in the bargain) can be turned into as much and more of a paradise
than even most mystics dared dream of?  What is you hurry to leave when the
curtain is just beginning to rise?

How so?  My paradigm and that of many other Extropians is quite ascending.

But where the danger is, grows
The saving power also
    (Holderlin)

    
    Because the essence of technology is nothing technological, 
essential reflection upon technology and decisive confrontation with
it must happen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin to the
essence of technology and, on the other, fundamentally different
from it.
    Such a realm is art. But certainly only if reflection upon art, for
its part, does not shut its eyes to the constellation of truth, concerning 
which we are "questioning".
    Thus questioning, we bear witness to the crisis that in our sheer
preoccupation with technology we do not yet experience the essence
of technology, and that in our sheer aesthetic-mindedness we no longer 
guard and preserve the essence of art. Yet the more questioningly we 
ponder the essence of technology, the more mysterious the essence 
of art becomes.
    The closer we come to the danger, the more brightly do the ways
into the saving power begin to shine, and the more questioning we
become. For questioning is the compassion (Frommigkeit) of thought.
    (Martin Heidegger)

I definitely want to say this:  This is EXACTLY the type of thing I was 
asking about - descriptions of what people have been doing nutritionally
and health wise that have shown results.  Exactly the kind of thing I was 
looking for.

I like hearing these ideas on exercise and nutrition - now, to get talking 
about that space thing....

As I recall from MIT's Technology Review (about a year ago?) article on
wearable computers, (I'm not sure if it was Mann) the viewfinder directly
located in front of one's eye, could be set to eliminate all advertising,
from buildings, billboards etc. while wandering around town. Apparently the
result was astounding. A sense of realization must occur in this state of
desolation, considering that we have grown accustom to these images floating
around us. I'd like to see it.

The brain, in Dr Robert Park's phrase (adopted from James Alcock) is a
belief engine. Everyone here should enjoy the analysis in his very fine
recent book VOODOO SCIENCE. Extropes will bridle a tad at his equal dislike
for `those who love technology too much', and I personally find some of his
objections to certain ideas glib and journalistic/coffee-table. But the
book's a fun and informative read, as enjoyable as Richard Dawkins (who
praises it expansively on the cover of the British Oxford University Press
edition).

I see parallels between your situation and what mine is (and probably most 
other people as well). One thing might be that you haven't made enough 
preparations for life. My "day job" (QA software tester) is not very 
fullfilling either, and it's a 45 minute commute one way. I don't expect it 
to be fullfilling. I've never thought that selling my labour to someone for 
them to achieve their goals would be fullfilling. It's not as bad as it 
could be. It's rarely over 40 hours, and by skipping lunch and working a 
heavy Monday-Thursday, I can work just half a Friday. Having to work for 
someone else is not fun, but I don't expect people to just give me money 
they have earned so that I can do what I want.
Having some sort of fullfilling work is, I think, a requirement to be happy, 
and I have that, it's just not my day job. I've decided that I wanted to 
direct a movie so I bought the neccessary equipment and did it. I'm 
currently editing, and this goal occupies much more of my creative thought 
time then anything relating to testing of software. I don't expect to make a 
profit on this one. If luck is on my side, I could break even, or make half 
my money back. I will consider it successful if it becomes publicly 
available in some way and I am contacted by people who enthusiastically 
enjoyed it.
I'd recommend that you stop expecting your day job to bring you anything 
expect money. Put all your energy at work into that which will bring you 
more money. If it's not bringing you enough money, start looking for a new 
job. You can set a very high salary requirement right now since you have 
something secure already, then lower it to more reasonable levels over a 
period of six months or so. In the meantime, find some "fullfilling work", 
some project which is important to you. It sounds like living as a "techno 
hermit" might be such a thing, if that's it then you could start researching 
what you'll need to do to reach that goal. Get books on solar/wind power, or 
whatever. My parents at one time were thinking of generating their own 
power, so I know it's a thing that will take years of study. As for taxes, 
you could find some way to make the land generate income for you and pay 
them with that. I can't think of any off the top of my head, maybe grow 
Christmas trees.
As for savings, just cut back on your living expenses. When you need to, 
it's easy. Spend a month keeping track of every purchase you make, and then 
at the end of the month look at your list and ask yourself how you could 
trim 15% from it.
And why do you have a house you don't really want? Sell it and get an 
apartment.

I'm afraid of two possibilities-

1. John Horgan's predictions regarding the end of scientific progress will
come true- and we will be unable to develop a Transhuman AI that may save us
and we will end up destroying our planet through war and environmental
damage.

2. All these precautions and ideas for programming an ethical AI fail, and
we end up enslaved to a superconsious, survivalist computer that sees us as
little more than tools or servants.

My father is a multimillionaire, I attend a private college, I own an
expensive computer, expensive clothing, etc. etc.  Yet for some reason, I
feel incomplete.  I'm frequently depressed (I've been to two
psychotherapists- both say I'm fine and that I don't need medication), and
no matter how much I study, my life just feels more insignificant and
pointless.  Yet, at the same time, I see many people with far less material
wealth than I that seem far more satisfied, happy, and purposeful.

I've never been a believer in the idea of the "Noble Savage".  I believe
that any utopian political philosophy, whether it's that of Rousseau, Marx,
or Rand, can only lead to disaster.

True enough.  But tell me, what is art?  If you deny spirituality, you've
pretty much dissolved any meaning of the artistic experience.

90% of the benefits come from the first 10% of effort. Eat a balanced diet,
get sufficient exercise, see doctors/dentists as needed, avoid unnecessary
high-risk activities, don't smoke, drink in moderation, etc. The benefits of
one vitamin regime over another or one new antioxidant over another are
really insignificant.

Apparently on Nov 12th Ralph Merkle was interviewed for the Dixon Report
Radio show, I can't seem to get it running from windows media player, but if
someone else knows how, please let me know.

11:15 The Coming World of Nanotechnology: A revolution is in the works, one
you may not have heard about yet, and it's called nanotechnology. Join me as
I talk with one of the world's leading nanotechnology experts, Dr. Ralph
Merkle. Nanotechnology, also known as molecular manufacturing, is the
science of making electronics components microscopically small -- in fact,
nanotechnologists can arrange atoms to suit their fancy. Take this rare
opportunity to ramp up to speed in one of the most important emerging areas
of technology. Some of the ways nanotechnology is being used already will
floor you -- the military is using it in spy planes, (no surprise there) and
doctors are using it to cure the worst diseases. When it is adopted, it will
truly revolutionize manufacturing in this century. Dr. Merkle is the best
possible guest to talk with about this. In addition to his work with
nanotechnology, he co-invented public key cryptography and received the ACM
Kanellakis Award, the IEEE Kobayashi Award, and the 2000 RSA Award in

Is it the rising cost of living, or your rising standard of living that's
affecting your savings rate?

Money, as Joseph Campbell said, is congealed energy. The energy you expend
on the job comes back to you in the form of money, which can be traded for
pretty much anything--a property that's not true of your energy. So the
purpose of the day job is to provide you with sufficient money to procure
everything you need and want. Of course, some of that money goes to
"overhead", stuff you need in order to keep your job. I don't see what's so
tyrannical about that.

That's true today, but I don't think it has to be that way everywhere,
forever.

OK, so you have to find a new line of work (different job, part-time
student, etc.), a new way of working (e.g. telecommuting), or a new
location...or you can whine about how life isn't fair. :-)

In most places, agricultural land isn't taxed at the same rate as
residential. And some states are playing games with development rights to
preserve farmland. But it's inevitable that land near population centers
will be worth more for residential use than for agricultural use.

But it's a trap you have the power to get yourself out of--if not to avoid
in the first place, which is much easier.

Somehow I don't think that merely eliminating property taxes will solve all
your problems.

I really don't think you have a good handle on Extropianism. For one thing,
it's not the same as Singulatarianism. Extropy can increase dramatically
without a singularity, though, of course, best-case singularity scenarios
could peg the needle on the Extrop-O-Meter.

It's OK to do that sometimes, but try to avoid playing the Devil's Johnson.

Nicq man, we all feel that way sometimes.  Depression is our
list's lowest common denominator.  The sun will come out, if
you wait for it.  It always does.  If you are really in bad shape,
there are medications.  Ask the guys!

When you feel this way, just remember that the pawns dont
get pushed around any more than the other pieces.  Hell, the
bishops and knights get it a lot more than the pawns do.  And
pawns only get pushed five or six times before they get an
orgasm.

Ill tell ya a way out, bud: go to the airport, buy a ticket for Taxifornia,
come on out, join the party.  There are lotsa greenies out here.
The government here is just as bad if not worse than Minnesota,
but at least the air is warmer.  {8-]

Look around you, Nicq!  Living in the 21st century is just too cool!
So make like Tigger: woo hooo woo hooo!  If you're not having

In addition to my recent DigitalFLASH post on Transhumanist Extropic
Artists/Innovators in the news, I just received the following
announcements:



** David M. McLean (musician)  is producing an A/V project. "It is
improvisational in nature - the general theme of "human evolution" being
given to participants, who create their part, then pass it on to the next
contributor. Percussionist Mike Froedge (MCA recording artist) has
completed drum/percussion trax. Next, I will be layering additional
instrumentation (primarily utilizing the Kurzweil K-2000, by the way -
yes, the synth line created originally by Ray Kurzweil), adding vocals
performed by Ria Shear-Smith, and mixing/mastering the audio. Next in
line is artist Alex Kazhdan (W-6 Entertainment) who will lead the
animation team in visualizing the concept. The final version will then be
sent back to me, and I will have it posted via a streaming A/V site
(still negotiating this part). At that time, I would be happy to send you
the NetTV URL so that you might share this with any interested parties."

** Marshall Burns (author/designer) is happy to present his latest vision
of the future of digital manufacturing for the first time in my home
region of Southern California.

A note for newcomers: the extropian list policy disapproves of `Me too'
posts. (That is, any expression of simple endorsement for a prior post that

There are definite advantages to high heartrate aerobic exercise, say 5
times a week for 45 minutes or so. Keep ya from having one of those dreaded
heart attacks :-) As for going for the muscle-bound superman look I am not
so sure of any benefits from that unless you are a leader of some organization
and have to look good in public. I fear that all the extra calories burned
to keep that muscle mass happy may actually reduce your lifespan slightly.

The discussion on mysticism, spirituality, numerology, astrology, and so on 
has led to some differing views regarding what's appropriate discussion on 
this List. First, let me quote the start of the Welcome Message:

-----------------------------
Welcome to the Extropians List! This List has hosted innovative discussions 
on the Internet continuously since 1991. We welcome innovative discussions 
pertaining to scientific, technological, philosophical, artistic, economic, 
and social perspectives on the future.

If you are not familiar with extropian thinking, I suggest you read the 
posts for a while before you begin to post. You will gain an idea of how 
the list works, and see how the range of topics varies from week to week 
and month to month. If you read only one document to get an idea of the 
attitudes and values shared by extropians despite all their diversity, 
please read The Extropian Principles 3.0. You can find this at:

http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm

-----------------------------

While I agree with Eliezer that discussions of clear pseudoscience such as 
astrology and numerology are out of place here, I think his view of what's 
appropriate is overly narrow. Even some discussions of mysticism may be 
useful given that the term covers a lot of ground from utterly irrational 
wishful thinking to arguably useful practices such as meditation, yogic 
exercises, and non-rational (but *not* irrational) means of understanding. 
This list also is not limited to science. To re-quote, it welcomes 
"innovative discussions pertaining to scientific, technological, 
philosophical, artistic, economic, and social perspectives on the future."

Personally, while I enjoy the continued theoretical discussions, I would 
like to see more discussion of practical possibilities that we are actually 
working on now. That's one reason I jumped in with some exercise 
suggestions. The forthcoming Retreat will definitely have a practical 
orientation. You'll see what I mean when I post some information about the 
Retreat in the next few days.

Onward!

Hmmm.  That looks pretty bad, no doubt of that.  Of course, under
those circumstances, there's no WAY we're going to make it.

In that case, our only hope for our civilization to survive is to get
out into space; once we do that, we've done pretty much all we can.

> Resource depletion will occur in my lifetime- the Earth being swallowed by

You're wrong about that.  Dying in a large scale war?  Possible.
Wacky diseases?  Could be.  Other unpredictable causes of death?  It
happens.

But *resource depletion* will not happen during your lifetime.

Understand what it would require in order for total resource depletion
to take place.

Beforehand, all of our energy resources would gradually grow scarce.
Oil wells, for example, don't dry up all of a sudden.  They start
pumping less and less oil until eventually they run out.

This means that the price of oil will gradually rise.  (Even though,
for now, it's falling, in the long term.)

Now consider various energy alternatives, which are more expensive
than oil.  No one uses them right now.  They're too expensive.  But if
the price of oil were to rise above the price of those, we'd start
using those.  All of those would have to run out.

Consider, as well, various energy alternatives which we could develop
by throwing a lot of money at the problem, including more efficient
solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, safer nuclear energy,
and the energy we can access by mining off-planet, dropping things
into black holes, building large solar panels on the far side of the
sun (or other nearby stars), etc.  No one invests in these
technologies very much right now, because oil is so cheap.  If the
price of oil were to rise, however, the relative price of investing in
these technologies would fall.  That would lead the market to invest
in these more.  As energy became more scarce, we'd invest more and
more in these technologies until they began to pay off.

And, obviously, they *would* pay off (some of them, at least).
There's lots of energy out there in the galaxy, and if we have to pay
to get it, we will.  For this not to happen, capitalists, investment
bankers in particular, would have to pass up more profitable
alternatives, en masse.  This will NEVER happen.

Julian Simon has argued, (rightly, I think,) that we'll never run out
of oil, because the price of extracting the last however-many-billions
of gallons of oil from the earth's crust will remain too high,
relative to the cost of alternative forms of energy, for us to bother.

Not to mention the fact that our oil reserves may, in fact, be
refilling themselves, if you take Thomas Gold seriously.  Of course,
that would only mean that the Earth has hundreds of times more oil
potential than even the most optimistic geologists might guess, only
enough to last thousands of years; so, I suppose, we could still run
out eventually.

But, again, you'd be wrong to imagine that the earth will run out of
oil and that only THEN will we look for more energy, like you and I do
when we run out of laundry.  The process is gradual, as oil gradually
rises in price and alternative fuel sources gradually look more and
more profitable.

So, assuming we don't die by some other means (a big assumption),
resource depletion is NOT your problem.  We're much more likely to
ruin the earth in a hundred other ways than run out of resources.  We
have to focus on the REAL threats, including real threats to the
environment; let those wily capitalists figure out how to keep the
party going.  (They're the ones with the most to gain, and the most to
lose.)

Well, of course, I must point out that you're looking at a rich
depressed person, you, all the time, and that the happy poor, like
boxcar 6s, are more visible than the hopeless ones.  So you may not be
observing a representative sample.

At any rate, I agreed that the connection between happiness and wealth
is weak.  It still holds, by and large, [I've yet to hear anyone
assert that we ought to make the poor happier by making them poorer!]
but no one will doubt that you can show me some happy hamlets and
miserable millionaires.  They're just not the norm.

Wealth makes life better, but not perfect, or even good, necessarily.

> True enough.  But tell me, what is art?

Heh.  NO, I refuse.  ;)

> If you deny spirituality, you've pretty much dissolved any meaning
> of the artistic experience.

Well, of course, you'd be going too far if you said that nobody can
ever find meaning without spirituality.  I assert that, here at least,
you're surrounded by purposeful happy atheists.  Some of us even have
an appreciation for art.  Most of us have found (or made!) meaning in
our lives.  Make of that what you will.

Personally, I'm a pragmatist.  My answer to those who talk of
spirituality is the same Laplace gave to Emperor Napoleon, when His
Grace asked Laplace why his astronomy did not include any mention of
God.  "Sire," he supposedly replied, "I have no need of that
hypothesis."

Now, maybe I'm wrong about that.  Maybe I DO have a need of that
hypothesis that I've overlooked.  Or maybe I'm right about me, but
wrong in thinking that *most* people don't need that hypothesis.
(Maybe people like me are special.)  Or maybe I'm even right about
most people, but wrong about artists.  All this would surprise me, but
I've been deeply surprised like that before.

Still, one doesn't have to get spiritual to find some external
overrinding force to guide one's life.  Take Truth, for example,
and/or Beauty.  They don't require any formally spiritual entity.
Truth can just be all the true ideas, and Beauty can be all and only
the most beautiful things, without any need to call upon spiritual
entities.

Or you could commit yourself to the happiness of the people.  Or to
Democracy.  Or Freedom.  We all know how much high quality stuff has
come on the table in the name of Freedom.

Remember those postmodernists?  Post-Nietzschean existentialists,
mostly.  No spirituality, no god, just us, just you and I, engaging
with the art.  I find the picture heroic.  Maybe even Romantic.  Or
bathetic, which can be quixotically heroic, sort of. ;)

Alternately, you can make it your goal in life to figure out what the
real goal is.  (Call that your Interim Goal; see if it leads you
anywhere.)

But, if you can't stand any of those, you can always be a
spiritualist.  We extropians, along with many others, are committed to
your freedom to believe whatever you want (or, more sensibly, whatever
makes sense to you).  We *think* that we're right, but it might turn
out that there just have to be some people who think that we're wrong
in order for society to work right.

So, how can art survive Singularity?  I wouldn't worry about it.
Instead, worry about how it can survive the Earth, and what we're
doing to it (or just about to do to it).

It's doomed, after all.

I'm sure that loading up on protein and working out to the extent that you
would be considered a "muscle man/woman" is not a good idea if your goal is
maximum life span.  All that extra "work" is sure to cause additional wear
and tear.  Not to mention all the extra oxygenation that you will subject
your body to (oxygen is a killer).

But a diet low in fat, high in nutrients and a consistent program of
moderate exercise is sure to do a body good.  Being stronger makes life that
much easier.

I would say that 45 minutes of strongly aerobic exercise five times a week 
is excessive. I think you can get virtually the same health benefit from 
around 25 minutes four times a week, with far less free radical formation.

As for building muscle mass -- certainly excessive bodybuilding is not 
optimal for health, especially if the bodybuilder is using steroids in 
their current form to grow muscle tissue without regard to side-effects. 
But I've found that people are relatively unaware of the benefits of 
weight-training as compared to aerobic exercise. It is most definitely not 
all a matter of appearance.

Weight-training/bodybuilding when done sensibly improves glucose metabolism 
and insulin response, lowers blood sugar (=less glycosylation) and reduces 
risk of diseases (including diabetes), maintains or restores bone mass 
(very important as you age, *especially* for women reaching menopause), and 
improves the sense of well-being (more than aerobic exercise).

Beyond those benefits, others will be more relative to the individual. Here 
I would include how healthy, powerful, and vigorous you look. Some of us 
like to sculpt our bodies, others see them as mere vehicles of no aesthetic 
interest.

Improved physical strength may save your life in some circumstances and is 
useful in many more situations. Given that caloric restriction with good 
nutrition is life-extending, muscle building has the extremely important 
benefit of giving you tissue to burn in an emergency if you don't have the 
fat. I've seen friends lose 30-50 lbs very quickly in hospital. If you're 
calorically restricted and have neither body fat nor muscle tissue, a 
medical emergency could just kill you.

Remember that I'm not recommending two hour workouts daily. That would 
indeed mean unnecessary free radical formation. You can get tremendous 
health benefits from shorter, focused workouts. (Mine are 30-40 minutes, 
including plenty of rest between sets. But when I do a set, I'm working at 
peak capacity.)

Onward!

I'll be posting some information about the planned ExI Retreat to the List 
sometime in the next few days. In the meantime, in order to book the hotel, 
please tell me if the proposed dates conflict with any other meetings, 
conferences, etc.

The most likely dates for the Retreat are:

March 9-11 (arriving Friday 3/9, with sessions 3/10 and 3/11)
March 16-18 (same pattern)
March 23-25

I can say that the Retreat will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, at a quiet 
and tasteful resort hotel. We will have a relaxed environment while being 
close to the pleasure domes for those who want to visit them.

Thanks,

Max

Someone's just pointed out the HTML nature of my last post, for which I'm
going to quickly apologise before the standards fuehrers start to get on my
case. However, although this standards debate has been to death on many
lists, I do still think that communication should be maximised in any
debate. I would much prefer that this list was a multimedia experience. It
would be much more entertaining to see people expressing their opinions (and
probably revealing) as well as reading them. Excite already supports
videomail egroups. Transhumanists should be at the bleeding edge (where,
incidentally, they appeared to be when I first discovered them 5 years ago).

I think it's a Bad Idea. Nothing against chat rooms, irc, streaming
video or VR -- but it would be a major mistake trying to make email do
the tricks it wasn't designed to do. There are certain expectations on
the format, the content, the size and the resource demand implicit in
email use, which you just break if you make it jump through the wrong

I presume this means you volunteer for several project slots on ExI-projects?

By the sound of it, it's probably not useful to you.  But it is to some.
It can make you feel healthier, and more able to do other daily functions.
The medical reasons behind this would take to long to explain, and I'm
sure you can find them in any health book or url.  Also, some feel
uncomfortable with themselves as they normally are.  By appearing to be in
better physical shape, they can eliminate the constant stress of
unhappiness which will extend life.  A healthier specimen is more
attractive to the opposite sex as genetics have so kindly provided us, so
as to propogate healthier genes, and weed out unhealthier ones.  So once
in better shape, one would find themselves more often helped by strangers,
more likely to get better jobs, in fact in an overall better atmosphere.
Seems like a sad state of affairs to those outside the loop, but it's
really not...

Mine too. This is going to be a major factor in how new technologies
are going to affect societies. If technology diffusion is fast, then
new (useful) technology will not cause major rifts between haves and
have nots, while slower technology diffusion (compared to the rate of
emergence of new technology) would have a more disruptive
effect. Also, I guess fast technology diffusion both reflects the
adaptability of a society and how well the market can meet the demands
posed by the potential customers.

Are there any good datasets or books on the subject? I would like to
bite into it a bit.

Yes, here in Ericsson-land the numbers are definitely higher than 40%
of all adults, I guess at least 60%. 

(I am a national traitor with my Motorola phone :-)

When I lecture on the future of computing, I ask the audience how many
has mobile phones. Then I suggest that the same number will have
wearables if I gave the same talk in ten years or so.

Although lately I have begun to think that wearables may never take
off. If PDAs manage to continue improving their interfaces and
usability, then what is the use of a wearable?

It is a quite nice research result, and useful both practically
(bionics) and theoretically (how does the brain encode movement?). His
handler, Miguel Nicolelis, is quite extropian too. I met him a while
ago, and he seemed to be quite happy with the idea of bionics. Some of
his statements at CNN ought to make us cheer.

This is good to know, but I don't think it was the issue of my response, or

I thought that while we're on the subject I'd include my own
nutrition/exercise program to give anyone interested some ideas.
Comments, suggestion are welcome.

Statistics: 6'6", 285 pounds, 43 years young.

NUTRITION:

One of the tricks I learned recently from Dr Bob Arnot's book on
weight reduction was drinking a 10 ounce glass of skim milk about
15 minutes before each meal. In tests this initial protein boost
cut portions by 20% I've dropped 10 pounds in three weeks following
guidelines from this book. I'm rarely hungry.

Breakfast: Monday through Friday its that glass of milk followed by
a big bowl of oatmeal, 1 large tablespoon of brown sugar, followed
by 1/4 of a cantaloupe. Saturday and Sunday I get eggs and either
bacon or more usually ham, wheat toast and of course the skim milk.

Mid Morning: If I'm hungry at all an apple usually kills it,
sometimes a banana.

Lunch: Weekdays, Milk then I usually pack either a ham, tuna, or
PBJ (peanut butter/jelly) on extremely healthy bread, and a piece
of fruit. Once or twice a week, I have a very healthy grilled
chicken burrito (mostly black beans and rice) and hold the sour
cream (nonfat yogurt works even better!). Weekends, something
healthy, good time for beans/rice.

Mid afternoon: a piece of fruit (apple again) or a Clif bar if
anything (usually on workout days).

Supper: Milk, normally a salad and a bowl of soup, or a light
dinner, chicken (remove the tasty skin) or fish with sweet potatoes
or rice. On workout days since I workout after work I often have
cereal. My current favorite is 3/4 of a big bowl of cherrios mixed
with 1/4 of a bowl of honey-nut cherrios. All the taste and 1/4 the
sugar! Another great trick from Dr Bob's book, mix healthy cereal
with something you really like.

Things to eat more of: vegetables, fish, beans, and rice.

Things to avoid like the plague: fatty red meat, sugar, fast
carbos: bread, sugar, pastry, white potatoes.

Exercise:

3 times a week regular after work, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday,
other days I'll hit the pool if I get a chance.

30-40 minutes of mid lower body stretching, I do the upper part
during the regular workday. I use a technique called active
isolated stretching I learned initially from an earlier Dr Bob
Arnot book called "Turning back the clock." Then I bought the book
by the guys who invented it, the Warburtons.

Then it's crunch time usually 3-5 sets of 12.

Then it's 30 minutes on the treadmill. I usually set the speed and
let the treadmill determine the incline based on heartrate. While
I'm burning off some extra pounds, I've been using a fat-burn
program that keeps you at 65%-70% heartrate. I'll go more cardio
when I'm where I want to be weight wise. Most people guess me at
about 250, (and 35!) that'd be perfect.

On either Tuesday or Thursday or both I do some additional lower
body work, usually extensions of some kind on a cybex/nautilus
machine. Squats if someone's around in case I do something stupid
(never squat alone).

Saturdays my upper body day, I use a combination of weight
bench/barbells and machines.

I like a standard york barbell for bench pressing, then
barbells/machines (cybex,nautilus, HAMMER) for the rest. normally
3 sets 10-12 reps. I like to do supersets (quick sets of opposing
muscle groups) for variety. About 45 minutes.

Sometimes after a heavy workout I'll have a TwinLabs Mass-Fuel
shake instead of dinner, but not very often, I'm trying to stay
past the "more muscle the better" stage, sculpting is in. 

Make friends at the gym, keep things upbeat. After trying a number
of clubs, I'm at the local YMCA, It does alot for local kids and
families, and I like supporting that.

Supplements: I take a good vitamin/ antioxidant protocol. The Life
Extension Foundations standard recommended protocol is excellent.
I take additional E (1000 I.U) and selenium at lunch, and saw
palmetto, ginger, and licorice twice a day. The last two are for my
stomach, three months after I decide to quit my least extropian
habit (alcohol) I developed GERD, I take prilosec every morning.

Books: Dr Bob Arnots books on nutrition and "Turning back the
clock" are excellent, I second Max's recommendation on Arnold's
book, it's the bible. Add a subscription to "Men's Health" is a
good idea too.

Zazen, learning guitar, watching bad/good T.V for relaxing.

Get a physical before you start any serious program, your doctor is
your friend, get vaccinated. 

Plenty of water and rest.

Just some ideas..... Outward!

Rewording is irrelevant when it means the same thing. Telling people
what they can own and can't, what they can earn and can't, and
confiscating and redistributing the rest (evenly or unevenly) is nothing
but theft. You don't fool any of us by prettying up your words.

Ah, so you will be confiscating industrial assets from businesses and

As a captured Commissar confessed to a friend of mine who was in
military intelligence in Korea, "Once we got their guns, taking their
money was REAL easy."

Free market economics is not the zero sum game you socialists seem to
think it is. You're mindsets are stuck in the middle ages. Get with it.

I.E.: Protect overpaid union jobs here by forcing other countries to
price their labor to eliminate the competetiveness of products imported
into the US. Well, its funny how gunboat politics seems quite alright if
your intentions are in the right place.

Liar. Oil that is recoverable at today's market price we have in the
order of around 200 years worth. As the price escalates, more expensive
to recover reserves become commercially viable to recover. Stop thinking
with a stasist mindset.

How about a tax to recover the public medical costs of accidents
involving unsafe micro-vehicles that sacrifice safety features and solid
engineering in order to save energy.

over half of our current gas prices are already totally taxes. We don't
need more of your confiscation.

Neither of which you seem to understand a bit of. Government regulation

I'd have to disagree.. my understanding (feel free to prove me wrong) is that
you really have to do a minimum of 30 minutes of steady aerobic exercise
to really have any effect on your cardio system. Extending that a bit to 45
minutes will lead to even better shape. Combine this of course with some good
anti-oxidants daily. I think going for the extra cardio conditioning is worth
it since heart related problems are one of the top killers.

I definitely can agree that doing some serious weight training is practically
a requirement say once you hit your 40s. As for diabetes, etc. I believe (again
correct me if wrong) that regular aerobic exercise is probably even better
than weight training in terms of prevention. See a basic article here:

This is the part that I find a little off-putting.. like I said if it helps
you in your job or whatever that's a good thing. But other than that, I see
it as a waste of time to try to attain some kind of "look" and hold it. I
could understand it if you are planning to try to maintain a physical body
far into the future... some people dig that, but myself I prefer to just be
uploaded and modify my body image at will after that.

Right, I just worry about all the extra oxidization going on in all those
extra muscle cells. Have there been any studies done on this?

Overall I just don't see a good reason for the average person to do weight
training in addition to regular aerobic exercise, UNLESS they need it for
specific reasons such as their job, their age, desire to participate in
extreme sports, etc.

Every day since I moved about a year ago I've taken the elevator to the
lobby and then used the stairs to climb to the 31'th story, then I climb down
to my condominium on the 24'th. I really dislike exercise but figure
anything that unpleasant must be good for you, besides I want a way to
get home if the power goes off.

Short version: they're right.

Nonmobile phone service was and is better and cheaper in the US than in
Europe, or so I have heard.  That being the case, there is less need
for mobile phones, despite the benefits.  Which directly leads to there
being less mobile phones per capita.

Yes to all three. Maybe I'll hold a short exercise seminar. ;-)

I've conversed with him by email. He can be witty, but he is also rather 
arrogant and egotistical as well. I always thought my high school physics

I'm afraid I'll have to end this argument.  I don't believe in Libertarian
politics, so I can't support your side, and I don't believe in Green
politics, so I can't effectively argue for their side either.  I guess, when
it comes down to it, I'm just a centrist- I believe in whatever doesn't mess
things up, and I don't believe in right wing or left wing utopian scenarios.
I side with whoever offers me a little temporary meaning in my life, until I
grow disillusioned and sick of the idea (and promptly move on).  Sorry, the
only thing I'm a true believer in is relativism- I'm a skeptic that has
taken his skepticism to an absurd level for the sheer absurdity of it (and
I'm a philosophy student, no less!).

As someone who spent a number of years as an energy analyst, developing energy 
conservation technologies, you don't know what you are talking about. Every 
trend in resource cost is downward, and availability is upward. Stopy buying the

Oh, you really are a mess, aren't you? Resources do not get 'destroyed'. They 
just get reallocated. Every technological advancement allows the amount of 
resources needed to produce every dollar of economic activity to decrease all 
the time. Where do you think all the wealth of our economy comes from? It didn't 
just come from us trading iron and corn back and forth and paying a wage. 
Technology increases productivity, which decreases the amount of resources you 
need to live an ever higher standard of living. Get off the Malthusian BS, he 
was disproven long ago.

No, its an ascending paradigm based on factual data. I quite understand how you 
are so confused. Gnostics were living by the same sort of omen-ism as Harvey 
described was typical of ancient Hebrews, and other beleivers in gematria. If 
every group of sheep in a field stands for a number or prophesy as a concrete 
fact, it is easy to see how the gnostics would regard their 'knowledge' as being 
fact based rather than just theology.

This is quite so, but not dogmatically. If you know anything about the Gnostics, 
the main reason they were declared a heresy by Rome was their refusal to bow 
down to dogma. Refusal to accept dogma is not itself a dogma, something about 
which you seem to be confused.

I have to disagree with your disagreement. :-)  Aerobic conditioning 
certainly begins no later than 10 minutes after training range is attained. 
25 minutes gives you most of the preventive health benefits. I'll go look 
this up when I have more time. But I can say that I wouldn't have gotten 
such a high aerobic fitness rating in my Kronos Clinic testing if what you 
say is true. I never continue aerobic exercise past 25 minutes.

When I'm talking about aerobic exercise, I'm not referring to girly-man low 
heart rate exercise. ;-)  I'm talking about maintaining my heart rate at 
the upper end of the fitness training range. (Last night's 3 mile run 
quickly brought my heart rate up to 165, then it climbed to 170-180 for 
most of the workout. I use a Polar heart monitor--this is cool tech that 
lets you see your heart rate in real time on a watch or displayed on most 
treadmills.)

45 minutes several times a week might be needed to get most of the benefits 
if someone is training a lower level of intensity. According to Dr. Kenneth 
Cooper, running any more than 15 miles per week will not bring increased 
health benefits. If I were to run for 45 minutes five days a week at close 
to my current pace, I'd cover about 30 miles. At my pace, 25 minutes 
several times a week seems just about optimal.

When do you expect to be uploaded? I'm not willing to wait for a future 
technology to save my body, not knowing when it will happen. The clear 
health, strength, and mood-enhancing benefits of resistance exercise give 
me clear reasons to do it. The enhanced body image is an enjoyable plus. If 
uploading takes decades (which I think fairly likely but practically 
unknowable) then I will have decades to enjoy the results of my exercise, 
and I'll be a vigorous grey-haired guy while wait-for-uploading folks will 
be shuffling around and asking for    a hand with their luggage. :-)

Weight-training does have clear health benefits such as stronger, healthier 
bones, reduced LDL levels, and lowers total cholesterol, among other 
things. Some references:

Yes, but is it right that we use the amounts of energy and resources that we
do when billions of people live in poverty and strife?  Tell me, is it
right?

Yes, resources get reallocated into useless forms- landfills, atmospheric
pollutants, goods that we don't need, decaying cities, etc.  If we can't
break out of this gravity well (in all honesty, I really doubt that we
will), we're done for.

You seem to want to talk down to me.  Frankly, I don't appreciate it.  I'm
not an optimist, I love the Earth that I'm living on, and I'm tired of being
given no options other than positivism (which, if John Horgan's book is
correct, is running out of steam quickly).

Ascending paradigms are those which revolve around spirit and deny matter-
descending paradigms are those which revolve around matter and reject
spirit.  I'm borrowing this from Ken Wilber.

Sure it's a dogma. Even reason itself requires faith.

For heavens sake.  How is this supposed to convince somebody who's
actually worried about energy depletion?  You might actually *change
someone's mind* if you explained yourself!  :p

[Hint: Most Greens think that energy prices today don't tell you
anything; that reflecting on prices and price trends today is like
jumping off a building and saying "I'm not going to stop suddenly!
I'm going faster and faster!"  Answering this (wrong, but initially
plausible) intuition might actually do some GOOD.]

Truuue, but just saying so isn't enough.  Oil *looks* like it gets
destroyed when it's used.  How will your comment change someone's mind
about that intuition?

So instead of actually naming a technology or two, you just assert that
technology will continue to increase our productivity.  Do you see why
this doesn't help?

Who's THAT supposed to convince?  Just *claiming* that your beliefs
are based on facts is no argument!

Now, maybe you don't have time to give a reasonably complete list of
facts or supporting arguments or whatever.  But, if so, you didn't
actually have time to provide a good argument.  And a bad argument is
much worse than no argument at all.

KICK SOME ASS MAX!!!!!

No kidding, outstanding numbers!

For everybody else, we're talking about training based on maximum
heart rate formulas, the formula:
220-age=maximum heart rate
220-age X 65%= start of training range.
220-age X 85%= top end of normal training range

For me it looks like this:
220-43=177 (100%)
220-43 X 65% = 115.05
220-43 X 85% = 150.45

These are the recommended training ranges ( for mere mortals ;) )

If I remember Max's age right (33?)
220-33=187 (100%)
220-33 x 65% = 121.55
220-33 x 85% = 158.95

Anything above 85% is anaerobic territory, ultra athletic range.

I've been eyeing a Polar for awhile now, what model did you pick?

You may want to consider referring to your namesake,
Nicolaus von Koeln, who Had A Plan:

" They were asked by many people on whose 
  advice or at whose urging they had set 
  out upon this path. They were asked 
  especially since only a few years ago 
  many kings, a great many dukes, and 
  innumerable people in powerful companies 
  had gone there and had returned with 
  the business unfinished. The present 
  groups, morever, were still of tender 
  years and were neither strong enough 
  nor powerful enough to do anything."
"Everyone, therefore, accounted them 
  foolish and imprudent for trying to 
  do this. They briefly replied that 
  they were equal to the Divine will 
  in this matter and that, whatever 
  God might wish to do with them, they 
  would accept it willingly and with 
  humble spirit. They thus made some 
  little progress on their journey."

You're making a mistake if you identify all of rationalism with the 
practice of *some* of the followers of Ayn Rand (generally the devotees of 
the official Randians rather than the more open-system Kelly-style 
Objectivists). I agree that there are plenty of irrational rationalists. I 
see people preaching reason while being dogmatic and utterly blind to their 
own rationalizations and narrow perspectives. But that's certainly not true 
of all Objectivists, and certainly not true of all rationalists.

Ayn Rand did not invent rationalism. Rejecting rationalism as a dogma 
because of your views on Ayn Rand and some of her followers is unfair. Even 
hear of Karl Popper? Or David Hume? Or [insert one of hundreds of other 
rationalists here]?

>Ascending paradigms are those which revolve around spirit and deny matter-

>spirit.  I'm borrowing this from Ken Wilber.

That's a useless distinction then. If you see no reason to believe in the 
existence of "spirit" (in a supernatural sense) then the distinction cannot 
even be made. Most extropians do not believe in spirits, though they may be 
quite spiritual in the sense of having ideals, lofty goals, and a strong 
sense of meaning and purpose. Our views do not revolve around matter but 
around values and goals. (We inhabit material bodies but that doesn't mean 
our paradigm revolves around matter. It actually revolves around much 
higher-level abstractions.) Wilbur's distinction just cannot be made to 
apply to such views. It's like trying to fit most of our political views 
onto the silly one-dimensional left-right spectrum.

>Sure it's a dogma. Even reason itself requires faith.

Not correct. A thorough critical rationalism requires no faith whatsoever. See:

Onward!

Being, as I am, a philosophy student from a similar background to
yourself, I might suggest that relativism makes no sense to anyone.
So, an honest relativist can't help but notice that relativism is
false for some people.  But can it be true for YOU?  If relativism can
be false for some people, but true for others, I'm not sure what the
position amounts to, since that's not relativism any more.

(This problem extends from the fact that relativism has too much to
say about the truth of all belief everywhere.  It's an attempt to
reach an objective view about beliefs where, it must be admitted, no
objective view is possible.)

Anyway, I might reccomend instead an open-minded ethnocentrism.
(Where your group or ethnicity may include only you [though I rather,
rather doubt it.])  Sure, everyone has their own internally consistent
justifications for their own beliefs, but that doesn't make THEM right
about anything.  I believe what I believe, but I'll take you seriously
if you have something to tell me.

Alternately, take Wittgenstein seriously with his private language
argument.

When I say language, assume that this includes at least some minimal
apparatus for determining the truth and falsehood of statements.  So,
if we fully disagree about how to determine the truth and falsehood of
statements, we're not speaking the same language.  To see this,
suppose I told you: "I know what apples are.  They are large four
legged solid-hoofed mammals that are good for riding."  You might say
that I'm wrong about apples, but it would make just as much sense to
say that I'm speaking a different language in which "apple" means
"horse."  All of this turns on whether it is true in my language that
apples have the character I described above, that is, whether my claim
can be true by definition.  (Ever wonder why they call it "logic,"
after the greek term for "word"?  It's because modern logic was
designed by philosophers of language to analyze our language's truth
conditions.  Logic is a study of language truths.)

But, if relativism is true, then there's no possibility for us to have
the same conditions for evaluating truth/falsehood, because we can't
share truth/falsehood.  I'm evaluating truth-for-me, and you're
evaluating truth-for-you.  ("But those could be the same!"  No, they
can only be same-for-me, or same-for-you.)  That implies that
everything I say is true-for-me in my language (i.e. by definition),
and everything you say is true-for-you in your language.

But when we make a statement that's true by definition, we're not
making a claim about the world, we're just making a claim about what
our words mean.  But if we NEVER make a claim about a world, if we're
ALWAYS talking in definitions, then none of our words can ever
actually have a referent.  So we're never talking about anything in
particular.  So relativism REALLY makes no sense.

[Many will criticize my picture of reference, (I only picked it
because it's a natural one that requires little explication,) but I
can recriticize relativism from just about any theory of reference via
a similar argument.  For example, suppose words have no reference, but
only a use.  Nonetheless, if there's no such thing as right uses and
wrong uses, then words have no *particular* use, and, thus, no
meaning.]

All this can be avoided if we just fall back on ethnocentrism.  And,
again, so long as we're open-minded in our ethnocentrism, that's OK.

>Sagan was showboating buffoon who was doing memetic programming.

Pretty strong words, Mike.

I wonder if you've read his scientific papers, his popular
works, seen his old Cosmos TV series, or met or worked with
the fellow.

Yes indeed, he had a particular agenda, which he promoted in
various media.

He also was a well-respected scientist by his peers.
(try typing his name in NASA ADS to get an idea of the volume
and breadth of his research)

He ran a solid research department at Cornell.

His TV series inspired a whole generation of astronomers.

And believe it or not, he was a nice man too.

I certainly would not call him a showboating buffoon.

Max,

I hope you're actually serious about this: I would
join ExI and attend the Retreat for that alone.
Serious.

Would you also consider discussing your experiences
with Kronos?  I've been off-list for a few years,
and am catching up.  Glad to see Chris Heward and
Company are actually in business...

I've been suspicious of the validity of this guide for a while, even though 
it's very commonly cited. While I was at Kronos, I expressed my doubts to 
the exercise specialist, noting that I've measured my heart rate above the 
age-related theoretical maximum. She agreed, saying that it wasn't a 
reliable guide. I expect it's a reasonable first cut so that people have an 
idea of their training range, but if you've been exercising consistently I 
think you can go higher than those ranges.

I'm 36 (37 in two months), so my maximum would supposedly be 220 - 36 = 
184, but I *know* my maximum is significantly higher than that. I aim to 
keep my heart rate no higher than 175 (though I like to finish by pushing 
myself harder, moving it up into the 180 range). Since I can sustain that 
for my 23-35 minutes runs I must be in the aerobic zone, though at the 
upper range for much of the run. I'll probably stop pushing myself quite so 
hard once I improve to a 7.0 minute per mile pace -- still below what I did 
15 years ago.

>I've been eyeing a Polar for awhile now, what model did you pick?

I have the Polar Beat, though the Polar Pacer looks even better, especially 
if you're running outside and don't have a treadmill to tell you the 
elapsed time.

 Ken Wilber does not define "spirit" in a supernatural sense. You might get
something out of reading his writing. I'm just now doing so even though his
work has been recommended to me for years.

 I think you might be surprised if that's what you think Wilber is talking
about.

Some have a goal towards reducing generalized anxiety (panic attacks,
anticipatory anxiety towards phobic situations), and aerobic exercise
is the most effective for that (so I read).

And so for optimizing the anxiety-reducing effects of exercise, the
goals to aim for are:

aerobic exercise
optimal frequency 4-5 times/week
optimal duration 20-30 minutes (or _more_) per session
optimal intensity for aerobic exercise is a heart rate of
(220-your-age) * .75 for at least 10 minutes

Max, regarding your comment about less free radical formation:

Isn't the net effect of regular exercise an overall reduction in one's
body's tendency to accumulate junk (lactic acid, etc.) ? Regular exercise
increases the oxygen turnover in your body, that is, the capacity of your
body to oxidize substances that it doesn't need. I am puzzled what you
mean by "far less free radical formation".

For the original poster's question regarding the benefits of exercise:

Here are some physiological benefits of exercise:

- stimulation of the production of endorphins (natural substances
which resemble morphine both chemically and in their effects:
increasing one's sense of well-being)

- improved circulation

- improved digestion and utilization of food

- improved elimination

- lowered pH (increased acidity) of the blood (increases energy level)

- enhanced oxygenation of the blood and brain, which increases alertness and
concentration

- reduced skeletal muscle tension

- more rapid metabolism of excess adrenalin and thyroxin ni the bloodstream

- a discharge of pent-up frustration

(plus exercise is plain fun .. which is a good enough reason for me ...)

Whatever his faults, Sagan often wrote beautifully and
brilliantly.  While in Tokyo, wrapped up in the
details of living and working there, I stepped back
and
decided to start doing some English-language reading
for pleasure.  His "The Demon-Haunted World: Science
As a 
Candle in the Dark" was a brilliant highlight of that
time of my life, and personal inspiration for me to
revisit my larger-scale extropian interests (including
interacting more actively with you guys again).

There are two new articles of interest in the latest New Scientist. One is a 
short article about the use of home power gas turbines and the very rapid 
development of fuel cell technology and use in the next 2-50 years. The other 
(which I just saw the title of, had to do with using oil and natural gas and 
coal and 'sequestering' the carbon-not a new idea to the energy mavens, but

A previously unknown nuclear phenomenon has been 
observed by an international collaboration of physicists. 
They found that the energy released from a nucleus relaxing 
to a lower energy state can be used to excite an orbiting 
electron into a higher energy state. 
Carreyre and co-workers found that the new process is 
strongly "resonant". A small increase in the atomic excitation 
energy can produce a large variation in the half-life and in the 
rate of nuclear decay. Interestingly, the effect is exactly the 
reverse of a process recently observed, by Kishimoto et al., 
in which the nucleus is excited by a near-resonant electron transition. 
Then energy can pass "resonantly" between the nuclear and 
electrons by a process similar to that which operates between 
an inductor and a capacitor in an LC circuit.
The phenomenon may have important implications for astrophysics. 
Plasmas inside stars contain nuclear species whose lifetimes may 
be affected by the process. 

[It is possible to store high energies in the nucleus, 
between narrow levels? Then shoot a lot of high energy photons, 
of the same frequency? ... A powerful nuclear laser]

Yeah, I think that max rate number is the safety rate for your
average person.

I did the 3 mile run in Marine corp boot Camp at 19:30 in combat
boots on a sandy course (San Diego) but we can forget those kinds
of numbers (there were about 35 people ahead of me! a couple
finished under 18:00!). A bunch of years ago I had an ultrasound
done on my heart, that revealed a leaky valve. Nothing serious they
say but it could limit my efficiency by as much as 20%. All the
more reason to work out I say.

Learn anything else interesting at Kronos?

Amara, I met Carl Sagan some years ago at a SETI conference in
Mojave where he was the keynote speaker.  I was fortunate enough
to work with him (for a very short time) in an event which was
designed to encourage children to ask questions about science.
 I appreciated his enthusiasm and his sense of humor.  His book
_Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark_ remains
one of my favorite books and references.  In fact, my essay concerning
art and science is prefaced with an anecdotal passage about turning
the pages of a book by candlelight -- the candlelight he shined
on my own mind.

Subject: Salon on election futures

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Salon.com has an article on the Iowa Electronic Market's
(http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/) apparent failure to correctly predict
the popular vote winner in the recent election.  The IEM gave Bush a 70%
chance of victory the morning of the elction, but as we know Gore came
out slightly ahead.

http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/11/16/election_prediction/index.html

    Iowan economists gambled that they could predict the presidential
    election. They lost.

Salon is a liberal magazine and so any institution which is based
on markets is automatically suspect in their view.  The article
rehashes a number of the old critiques of idea futures, in a somewhat
contradictory way.  Bush supporters will bet on Bush, and they're richer
than Gore supporters.  But no, Bush supporters will bet on Gore, because
they want to hedge against a possible Democratic victory.  Not a very
clear critique.

The truth is that a single success or failure in any predictive system
is not very meaningful, and you have to look at the long term record to
judge its value.

Yes, the article was in the May/June 1999 issue (so it
was about a year and a half ago). It's by Steven Mann,
and is entitled "Cyborg Seeks Community". It can be

I didn't find it that odd... it seems to me that there are some interesting
possibilities that these wearable computers bring up.  I would have been
suprised if there was no one working on such interfaces.

Sarfatti is also mentioned in RAW's Cosmic Trigger Vol. 1 and claims to have
written major portions of Gray Zukav's "Dancing Wu Li Masters".  I contacted
him once and he blew me off.  He was only interested in obtaining some
article where I had read his name and didn't know that it was published.  He
is a close friend of Fred Alan Wolf and I think he hangs at Cafe Trieste
here in San Fran's North Beach.

I once heard Fred Alan Wolf speak.  He was a sham.  He had a cheesy
multimedia slideshow he used to tell us how he used physics to define the
soul.  The worst part was that he used quantum physics and four dimensions.
So I asked him what about the other six dimensions that super string theory
mentions and it threw him for a loop because it didn't fit into his theory.
So he made a joke.  I felt he was just in love with playing to an audience.

So, I'd ignore both of them for the most part.

I appreciated Scott's Rant.  I have felt some of that before as well.

Here's my feelings these days.  I'm human and I'll probably die human.  If I
can accept that, I'll probably be happier.  I will do what ever I can to
prolong my life, but there's no guarantee that I will make it long enough
for life-extension technologies to develop fully enough, let alone, have the
cash to pay for them when they initially emerge and only the rich can afford
them.

That doesn't mean that I won't work towards realizing the post-human future.
It just means that I should enjoy the work that I'm doing and let go of the
results.  If you're always living for the future, you'll never be happy.
Post-humans will be struggling to be post-post-human.

This is indeed the question... Doing heavy enough exercise will lead to
lactic acid formation, this is why sometimes your muscles get sore the
next day (weight training is a different story). To combat this, you should
not stop your exercise abrubtly; for instance if you are out running hard
then when you finish go walk around easily for 5 minutes. This will pump
most of the acid out of your cells.

I'm very glad to have heard Samantha and Anders feedback to my question
about mysticism, intuition and emotion.  From the Web materials that I have
read about Extropianism, it does often seem that rationality and engineering
solutions are often overemphasized.  But after participating in this
discussion, it seems that there is a more well-rounded concept.

I think that Extropianism would better present itself by elaborating in more
detail the need for advanced psychological integration.  I think that the
technological advancements will enable a better chance for the average
speciman of a new species to be able to self-actualize.  But unless the
psychological concerns are given equal weight to the technological concerns,
post-humanity could end up a nastier, more powerful version of ourselves.

In thinking about psychology, has anyone here read the work of Ken Wilber?
I have derived much understanding form his integral approach to psychology.
I would be very interested in hearing some Extropian views about his work.

BTW:  I'm on the digest list, so I may always be a little behind in my
responses or have missed subsequent posts that may be relevant.

There seems to be a wide variety of opinions. This does seem to verify my
claim that for any significant benefits you need a minimum of 30 minutes
4 times a week. More is better.

Ahh ok. I exercise a little easier than that, I use a machine that varies
its intensity (using a Polar monitor :-) to keep my heart rate between 130
and 163.. usually it ends up staying around 160 for most of the workout.
My goals are perhaps a bit different, I prefer the longer workouts since I
want to improve my endurance for sports like mountain biking where you have
to sustain a moderate to high level of exertion for an hour or longer.

I am not planning on any certain uploading date either; I just am questioning
the claimed life extending qualities of weight training in addition to good
aerobic exercise. Especially for younger people.

It doesn't provide sufficient information to verify any precise claim. I 
assume they are talking about fairly moderate aerobic exercise, in which 
case 30-45 minutes may be needed to gain full benefit. That doesn't 
conflict with my claim that 20-25 minutes of more intense aerobic exercise 
produces the same benefits. It's also more time efficient and results in 
higher performance capacity.

One thing that I don't think has been mentioned but which matters: If 
you're doing any form of regular exercise, you'll reduce the free radical 
by-products and reduce oxidative stress if you're taking daily supplements 
of anti-oxidants. The basics are good -- C, E, Selenium, and so on. I'm now 
taking twice a day doses of a personalized formula prepared by the Kronos 
Clinic. The tests there determined where oxidative damage was coming from 
and how to reduce it.

March on!

A possible solution to the problem of last-minute voting in an election
protocol which permits vote-switching:

Have a non-predetermined cutoff time.  That way, anyone who tries to vote at
the last minute is gambling with their vote.  If they switch their vote too
late, they lose their vote (or wind up voting for whomever they voted for
originally); if they switch their vote early, then others will have time to
react, which is a desirable property of the system.

So there are four days in which you can vote over the Internet; then three
days following, the Days of Uncertainty, in which your ability to vote could
be cut off at any moment - as determined by random-number generators or
lottery balls or (most preferable of all) Schrodinger's Cat or similar
non-tamperable non-predictable protocols.  The four original days should be
enough for all legitimate purposes, like switching your vote to a main party
if the third-party thing didn't work out, with the three days following enough
for honest folk to respond to genuine last-minute developments, while
discouraging maliciously last-minute voting.

Hey, maybe that protocol would work for Ebay... the last three hours are
Random Death time, producing a sustained frenzy of desperate bidding (each
moment might be the last!) while giving the other bidders time to respond
(probably!).  If anyone turns this into a new e-commerce site, I get 0.5% of
the stock.  (If anyone tries to patent it, I'll have your guts for prior art.)

(Hmmm... while I'm on the subject, another thing Ebay could try is a system
whereby each new bid extends the deadline to five minutes beyond the time of
that bid, with a final cutoff point of one hour after the original closing
time.  Those last-minute trumps are incredibly annoying.  And no, the "highest
bid you're willing to make" system isn't the same - not psychologically,
certainly.  Rarely does someone really know, down to the dollar, how much ve's
willing to pay...)

The below discussions of vitrification and its possible implications for
Alcor's membership services and funding are controversial. They do not as
yet reflect positions, resolutions or other decisions by the Alcor Life
Extension Foundation Board of Directors. When such decisions are reached,
Alcor's members will receive them promptly. Details of the technical
aspects, to the point of specific phraseology, are largely supplied by
researchers involved, yet their names do not appear here. This is not a
report of scientific findings; rather it is a statement of steps being taken
toward applications of new technologies by Alcor and BioTransport, Inc. With
those reservations, read on. For years, we have been waiting for the day
when ideas such as these could appear in Alcor's publications. That day is
here!

25% of the voters voted for Bush.
25% of the voters voted for Gore.
50% of the voters voted for none.

It appears as if the voters for "none" won.
Democracy in progress.

OK.  But "right-wing" and "left-wing" is a hopelessly dichotomy.  If all
is relative one must ask "relative to what" or what you use for scales
to measure this against that and the other to decide what you think
should be done.  Relativism without any principles or working theories
is simply chaos. 

You're a philosophy student?  No wonder you are confused!  :-)

I forget the ifs ands and buts of it but Objectivism is not a form of

Popper and Hume made even worse mistakes.  Rand did not do at all badly
in many respects.  This little mealy mouth creature who calls himself

Ken WIlber made some very interesting assertions and laid some
interesting theories here and there but he didn't go very far beyond
that.  And there are gaping holes in his writings that were badly
glossed over.  Matter vs. Spirit  is another silly dichotomy.  As Gilder
(who now and then says something quite good) pointed out quite some time
ago, you could see the transformation of our society to center on
information and the continual miniturization of the means of doing work
(micro->nano) and, with nanotech, everything being controlled by
consciousness right down to individual molecules and atoms - all of this
can be seen as very much (if you will) a "spiritualization" of matter. 
This has led me to the modern aphorism:

	"The ultimate spiritualization of Matter IS the ultimate
materialization of Spirit."

Think about it.  It is a quite interesting point of unification along
two major lines of human striving to transcend their limitations.

Substitute transcendent consciousnes (transcendent of current
limitations continuously) for spirit if you will.  Then tell me being
extropian is not profoundly spiritual.  It is the ultimate triumph of
spirit (consciousness) over limitations (all the way to the maximum
tinkering in the works that may someday be possible.  all the way to
Omega Point perhaps).

Great, if they can effectively deploy it. If done properly, it can
mean a very large difference for a (difficult to quantify) number of
best-case patients (good shape at demise, immediate switchover, timely
implementation of the techniques without major goofups).

Clearly the wave of the future.

What is truly weird is how long it takes the technology to catch
on. The microdisplay companies' pages haven't changed in
*years*. Wearables and augmented reality seem to have suffered the
fate of VR.

Clearly some of it is caught in the economies of scale bootstrap as
well as in lack of realtime high-accuracy positioning service
infrastructure augmented with built-in inertial tracking, but
sometimes I wonder.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                    November 16, 2000 

LOOK TO LEONIDS FOR STUNNING SKY 

     A cascade of meteors, which are the dust tracks of a 
comet's path, will be visible in the skies over the United 
States this weekend.

     On Friday, Nov. 17, and Saturday, Nov. 18, Earth will 
travel through the tail of dust from Comet Tempel-Tuttle. As 
the dust particles -- tiny meteoroids -- burn up in Earth's 
atmosphere, they give the appearance of  "shooting stars," 
called meteors.  This display, known as the Leonid meteor 
shower, may be most visible over North America's East Coast.  
That's because the constellation Leo, where the meteors seem 
to come from, will be in a dark part of the sky high above the 
eastern horizon. 

     The Leonids, however, may produce only a minor shower 
this year -- about one streak per minute. The Moon's 
brightness can also reduce the visibility of the meteors.

     "The third-quarter Moon will be in Leo, making the sky 
bright and the Leonids a bit difficult to see," said comet 
scientist Dr. Don Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
Pasadena, Calif.

     The best way to see the Leonids shower is to block the 
Moon's brightness with a hand or tree. On North America's West 
Coast this week, look in the general direction of the Moon on 
Friday night from 11:30 p.m. until after midnight.  Some 
meteor activity may be evident the night before at the same 
time. From the East Coast, look in the general direction of 
the Moon at about 2:50 a.m. on Saturday, when the showers 
should be strongest.

     Every 33 years, Comet Tempel-Tuttle travels through the 
inner solar system.  The comet, which is basically a ball of 
dust and ice, last passed close to the Sun and was visible 
from Earth in March 1998. Near the Sun, the comet's ices begin 
to vaporize and the embedded dust particles fall away and 
trail the comet in its orbit.  Every year, Earth passes 
through the trail of debris left behind by the comet, and the 
comet dust particles plunge into Earth's atmosphere at some 71 
kilometers (44 miles) per second -- fast enough to travel from 
Los Angeles to New York in about one minute.

So what?  I hope that members of this list are smart enough not to buy
the ridiculous lies of entities like the U.S. drug warriors and others
for whom mere marijuana consumption is some kind of moral taint.
Especially given that many on this list openly enjoy the far more
dangerous drug alcohol for conviviality.

So you're basically saying he wasn't macho enough for you?  Please
spare me.

I for one am no enthusiast of an imperial US power and support the
libertarian position of ending the income tax.  It's kind of hard to
do that while trying to establish imperial peace around the globe.  I
think a US that looks after the bare minimum of its self defense is
ultimately in the world's best interest, and immediately in its own
national interest, and I have no enthusiasm for my government's
playing world's policeman.  While this may not be official list
politics anymore, there are many similarly minded people here, still,
I hope.  I, too, would have counselled caution and parsimony in
experimental military expenditures, and allow me to ask this: what did
the SDI money buy us?  When did the benchmark for sensible policy on
science and technology become "how tough are you?" as opposed to
showing results?  I'd rather be right than tough every time.

ahhh extropians, a breath of fresh air.

I've been watching this list for a few weeks now and have read most 
of the writings on extropy.com and feel sufficiently knowledgable about 
this paradigm to engage in intelligent discourse with this list.

But oh, there is so much I wish to say, and get feedback on it simply 
would not be fitting to put it all in one post and expect you to read 
it all at once. And I feel that before getting started, I owe this list 
an introduction to myself, where I'm coming from and how I came 
to find the list.

Please bear with me on this somewhat lengthy and admittedly self 
absorbed tour of myself.

My childhood was one of poverty and constant struggle to simply 
survive, rather animalistic, if you will. I say this not in search 
of sympathy (ugh!) but simply as a description of where I am from.
I feel neither pride nor shame for this fact for it has in great part 
shaped who I am and given me an ability to find riches in the simplest 
of things and enjoy everything that life has to offer. I need no 
material to find happiness. I travel light and live as slave to noone, 
not money, for I know very well how to do without that, not authority, 
for I have no regard for authoritarians, and definately not to any 
paradigm, religion or group, for I am singular and believe nothing, 
except maybe possibility, for reality is rife with that.
I live my life by the tenet - 
A good person needs no laws to tell them to be good,
and a bad person will just break the laws anyway.
I think I fall well within the first half of that statement.

At the young age of fourteen, I discovered LSD and would not be 
satisfied to simply open the doors of perception, but rather promptly 
proceeded to kick down every door which stood in the way of my 
realizations and plunder the knowledge which awaited behind each one 
be it joyous, revalatory, or horrifying. Though I no longer feel the need 
to use hallucinogens in this manner as I have gained all that I can from 
them (for now) my intense interest in retrospection and lack of fear of 
what I find within, has led me to a knowledge of myself at a level which 
i believe (haha, already a contradiction, there will be many more in my 
writings) very few people achieve in a lifetime.

Around this same time, I became very immersed in the punk rock lifesyle 
and ideaology, finding myself to be contrary to everything I could find 
in society and full of anger for what I saw as an oppressive and 
repressive society, hell bent on forcing conformity and complacency 
through media manipulation of the mass conciusness, a machine which 
viewed me as raw material with which to construct another cog to do it's 
bidding. Nope, I wasn't biting. For a length of several years I saw it as 
my mission to disassemble this system the only way I could from my powerless
perspective - waste myself, if I could damage myself sufficiently that 
they would no longer see any use for me, and encourage other to do the same, 
then I was doing my part to take the system apart at the component level. 
So I dropped out after my third year in tenth grade and proceeded to 
cause mischief, mayhem and self destruction to an almost disgusting 
extreme.
I realize now that these attempts were greatly misconceived, but boy
what time it was.

Seven years ago, against all that I believed, I almost joined the Navy, 
for the all the wrong reasons - a fealing of nihilistic desperation, not 
knowing where my life was going or why, lost and powerless and hungry
and having no skill with which to trade for livelihood. My familiy surely 
would have disapproved of this decision, so I kept it a secret for as long 
as I could. The ASVAB tests concluded that I would be best suited to a 
military vocation of Intelligence, I was going to be a spy for the 
government which I detested so much. My secret was let out of the bag when 
the recuiting officer called my house to get me in the office and sign my 
life away. My older brother answered the phone (I was out), and when I 
returned home he sat me down and convinced me to try just one other path in 
life before joining the military, if that failed he would leave me to my 
decision. After a little searching, I decided to go to a vocationial school 
for  computer programming, and so began a fascinating career in computer
technology and my love of the internet. Even though, I was determined not 
to fall into some dull, dreary, workaday existence of flourescent lights, 
cubicles and capitalistic drive for material wealth. I was in it for the 
experiences and the knowledge. (Ok, i enjoy blowing wads of cash on 
indulgences such as good food and liquor, a fun night out with friends, but 
I hold those memmories in higher value than the money I spend on them. 
All of my material belongings are purely functional, I own nothing simply 
for the sake of owning it). And my quest for interesting experiences has 
led me through myriad contracts with companies such as Electronic Arts, 
Larry Flynt Publications and Virtuality to name a few.

Today, I would consider myself more of a contrarian than anything, as I 
find (unarmed) conflict to be one of the most creative forces in my 
experience and am always seeking a balance with the extremes.

Of course I can't express fully who I am in this email, but I think that
is sufficient.
Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, I hope to know all of you 
better in time, and may we have many a heated discussion.

Nate


Keep an eye out for my future posts:

P.S.
Something I thought you extropians might be interested in...
I'm sure many of you are aware of the new development from 
ICANN regarding the seven new domain name suffixes - 
.aero, .biz, .coop, .info, .musuem, .name and .pro
Well, it occurred to me that the mere existance of these
has a great potential to cause a bull market the likes of which
noone has ever dreamed possible as they will undoubtedly
result in a massive number of computer sales and new 
companies which is almost certain to cause growth in every
aspect of the market. This coupled with the current (but temporary)
bear market makes this possibly the best moment in history
to invest in the stock market. But don't take my word for it.
I'm just a market watcher, not a player.

Not to act too much like J.C.C. Smart, but that's not a problem- that's my
theory!

Realativism without any principles or working theories IS chaos, and that's
precisely why I'm trying to discover how to achieve absolute relativism, so
that I can tune my mind in to the nature of absolute chaos, and discover the
roots of all thought and existence.  It's a crazy idea, I know, but I've had
some strange results already, and I hope to continue...

Yes, except 1. You could say that the number of theories doubles every three
and a half years but I wouldn't classify it as knowledge. It's dubious
whether, say, 95% of what is written about aging is actually part of the
phenomenon in the first place. So it might even be the case that our
knowledge concerning the basic causes of aging is exactly the same as it was
30 years ago; unlikely but not impossible.

Hasta.

Michael, I don't think I agree with availability going upward.  I currently
work for a company developing enterprise management solutions for the energy
market.  There has been very little increase in the amount of new power
plants over the years.  With deregulation, there isn't the state guarantees
that once made it worth investing in energy plants.  So now, we are faced
with increasing energy usage and little increase availability.  There are
continual threats of brownouts, so utility companies are constantly buying
energy from other parts of the grid.  All we seem to be doing is figuring
out how to distribute what energy we have to where it is needed when it is
needed.  We aren't changing our energy habits or increasing availability.

Well, heck, I just ordered a Polar Pacer via the website at

To answer your queries, briefly:
I am guessing that a intellect fried on booze still produces more 
intellectual  property, then one fried on sweet sensamilla. However that is 
debatable. It also makes me think of a middle aged man still narfing down of 
maui wowee seem incongruent to me

SDI bought us little, but it helped collapse the Soviet economy. If one 
believes that their mentality was mired in Stalinism (as it was) then it was 
still worth it, by far.
One area under development was the free electron lasers used by TRW and some 
Israeli scientists to shoot down those short range katyuska rockets. We shall 
see if this research is as good as it has been pimped by the DoD.
Another more fertile area might be using star wars free-electron and eximer 
lasers to instantly to vaporize water into hydrogen and oxygen for fuel 
cells. Also fuel cell research has advanced a bit, with capacitors and  such.

Toughness matters only in the perception of people who desire to be your 
enemy. With some people (peoples) passivity has mean weakness, and weakness 
must be exploited. Its a values and perception mentality.

What you stated in your thread, reminded me of what the late Futurist, Herman 
Kahn, had to say. He said he was a social -democrat pacifist untill WW2. He 
noticed that the Germans had the best generals, the best trained troops, the 
most modern equipment, and until 1941, were winning all the battles. His 
point was that fear makes warriors of us all. One is forced to make choices.

 So what?  I hope that members of this list are smart enough not to buy
 the ridiculous lies of entities like the U.S. drug warriors and others
 for whom mere marijuana consumption is some kind of moral taint.
 Especially given that many on this list openly enjoy the far more
 dangerous drug alcohol for conviviality.

 So you're basically saying he wasn't macho enough for you?  Please
 spare me.
 
 I for one am no enthusiast of an imperial US power and support the
 libertarian position of ending the income tax.  It's kind of hard to
 do that while trying to establish imperial peace around the globe.  I
 think a US that looks after the bare minimum of its self defense is
 ultimately in the world's best interest, and immediately in its own
 national interest, and I have no enthusiasm for my government's
 playing world's policeman.  While this may not be official list
 politics anymore, there are many similarly minded people here, still,
 I hope.  I, too, would have counselled caution and parsimony in
 experimental military expenditures, and allow me to ask this: what did
 the SDI money buy us?  When did the benchmark for sensible policy on
 science and technology become "how tough are you?" as opposed to
 showing results?  I'd rather be right than tough every time.

You have to take his comments in context.  What Mike was responding to
was somebody who believed that we're running out of energy because the
Earth is running out of energy, (esp. running out of oil, which many
morons claim will happen w/in the next 20 years!) not because we're
building too few power plants.

Any power plant problem we're having doesn't have to be for the long
run.  But running out of oil, if it ever happened, would last forever.

   Medicine: Cardiac arrest can be less of a gamble

   TIM LINCOLN

   There is no good place to suffer cardiac arrest. But if you do, a
   hospital is obviously one location where quick treatment is likely
   to increase the chances of recovery. As described in two papers in
   The New England Journal of Medicine, certain casinos in Nevada and
   Mississippi, and some airlines, also make recovery a better bet.

   The type of cardiac arrest concerned is that caused by ventricular
   fibrillation, in which contraction of heart-muscle fibres becomes
   uncoordinated. The key to treatment is the use of defibrillating
   equipment, and swiftly: with each minute that passes, the possibility
   of recovery falls rapidly.

   T. D. Valenzuela et al. (N. Engl. J. Med. 343, 1206-1209; 2000) report
   the results of a programme in which defibrillators were installed
   in casinos and security staff were trained to use them. The overall
   success rate, judged by a patient's eventual discharge from hospital,
   was 53%. The national average is just 5%.

   The other study (R. L. Page et al. 343, 1210-1216; 2000) involved
   American Airlines.  Like some other aircraft operators, American
   Airlines has introduced defibrillators on its planes and trained
   flight attendants to use them. Here the rate of survival was 40%,
   which compares well even with the rates achieved by quick-response
   emergency services in other circumstances. The authors calculate that
   if all commercial aircraft carried the equipment, 93 people would
   survive who would otherwise have died each year.

   The authors also point to a study showing that age need not be
   a barrier to the effective use of defibrillators. Twelve-year-old
   children took only 27 seconds longer to carry out defibrillation than
   medical personnel, albeit in simulations.

   But perhaps a safer approach is to avoid flying or gambling
   altogether. Cardiac arrest is more common in these situations than
   in most other public places - although, in the case of casinos,
   it is not clear whether the

Many on the list will be already familiar with the famous bet between Julian

Julian Simon's Bet With Paul Ehrlich
By Brian Carnell
Thursday, May 18, 2000
In 1980, economist Julian Simon and biologist Paul Ehrlich decided to put 
their money where their predictions were. Ehrlich had been predicting 
massive shortages in various natural resources for decades, while Simon 
claimed natural resources were infinite.
Simon offered Ehrlich a bet centered on the market price of metals. Ehrlich 
would pick a quantity of any five metals he liked worth $1,000 in 1980. If 
the 1990 value of the metals, after adjusting for inflation, was more than 
$1,000 (i.e. the metals became more scarce), Ehrlich would win. If, however, 
the value of the metals after inflation was less than $1,000 (i.e. the 
metals became less scare), Simon would win. The loser would mail the winner 
a check for the change in price.
Ehrlich agreed to the bet and chose copper, chrome, nickel, tin and 
tungsten.
By 1990, all five metal were below their real price level in 1970. Ehrlich 
lost the bet and sent Simon a check for $576.07. Prices of the metals chosen 
fell so much that Simon would have won the bet even if the prices hadn't 
been adjusted for inflation (Bast 1994, p.124). Here's how each of the 
metals performed from 1980-1990.

Metal 	          1980 price (1980 $) 	1990 price (1980 $) 	%change

Copper (195.56 lbs.) 	$200 	           $163 	        -18.5%
Chrome (51.28 lbs.) 	$200 	           $120 	        -40%
Nickel (63.52 lbs.) 	$200 	           $193 	        -3.5%
Tin (229.1 lbs.) 	$200 	           $56 	                -72%
Tungsten (13.64 lbs.) 	$200 	           $86 	                -57%

Hmm, how is it weird? I think this is so far perhaps the most
convincing practical step towards exploring what it would be like to
be posthuman. The technology is clunky, but it is a forerunner in the
same way Douglas Englebart's demonstration of a primitive mouse
interface, cut-and-paste, hypertext and computer network in the 60's
was a forerunner of today's interfaces and networks. 

Of course, the big question is whetehr wearables will be the way to
go, or if PDAs will out-compete them. In the same way, good wearables
may block development of direct brain-computer interfaces beyond
medical use.

I think we need more of this more well-rounded thinking on the
web. Please write good essays everyone! We need more material to keep
the discourse growing.

I do not know much about integral psychology in Ken Wilber's form, but
I wonder how it does relate to cognitive neuroscience? I'm interested
in humanistic psychology, but I have always felt it was lacking in its
epistemology and did not take the physical, biological nature of the
brain into account. A transhumanistic psychology would do that, and
try to use our biological understanding to achieve humanistic goals.

I got a letter from Alcor yesterday (Thursday) about this.  They are
licensing vitrification technology from 21st Century Medicine.  This
will enable greatly improved suspensions and hopefully eliminate much
of the damage from ice crystal formation.

However, it is only for neurosuspensions.  (Those involve freezing only
the head.)  The technology requires very rapid cooling, and this is not
yet practical to achieve with whole body suspensions.  Even if it does
become practical, Alcor warns that it may be a much more difficult and
expensive procedure, and therefore they may have to raise the cost for
whole body suspensions.  Whole body suspension members like myself are
advised to consider converting to neurosuspensions in order to take
advantage of this new technology.

Personally, I will wait and see.  My health is good and so I can hope
that they are able to get it working for whole body members within a
few years.  If it costs more at the end, so be it.

(The reason I am a whole body member is because I believe there is
information in the muscles, spinal cord and other tissues which will not
be recoverable in a cloned body.  This includes both learned information
as well as basic issues of neural architecture which are not fully
determined by genetics.  Fitting an old head to a new body may not be
practical, I fear.)

One important point, probably one of the central in any philosophy or
psychology of self-enhancement, is that you can be happy with who you
are without having to give up self-improvement. Many seem to think
that if you accept who you are, then you will be happy and further
change is irrelevant: so either you should strive for acceptance
instead of personal change, or only unhappy people can become
great. This is of course bunk. 

If you can accept who you are and your current state, then you will
have a base of self-confidence to continue from. Even your bad sides
are worth acknowledging as parts of your current self - but that self
is not sacred or impossible to change. While being unhappy with one's
current self is a reason to change, I think a much more potent and
self-supporting reason is that one perceives improved forms of oneself
as more desirable. We go from perfection to more perfection, or as
David Zindell put it:

	"All rules and boundaries must someday be broken. How else can
	we go beyond ourselves? A thallow chick must break out of his
	egg, but this does not mean that the shell is without value.
	You must remember that an oak tree is not a crime against the
	acorn."

Transpersonalism has little to say on what happens after death- at least in
the voluminous material that I've read on the field (which I plan to go
into, BTW).  It's more or less about realizing that we aren't our bodies,
and that this revelation doesn't require the existence of any kind of
spiritual matter- just a recognition that our body is little more than a
nexus for all the outside influences controlling it (which are all part of
the actual I), and that your "I" is not the machine that percieves, but the
totality of the percieved existence.  It's basically a return to idealistic
monism through the dissolution of the ego-complex, at it's heart.

When you die, the machine is gone, and no ephemeral "soul" survives- yet
existence, the true I, continues.  The metaphysical implications of this are
pretty deep, and extremely hard to understand from a human perspective.

For the logically minded, contemplating the natural numbers led me to
this conclusion.

No number is the biggest.  Does that mean no number is big?  Obviously
not.  A billion dollars is a lot of money, even if it's not the most
money.

You're not perfect.  Does that mean that you're not good?

I agree, this is a fascinating concept and one which I would like to
explore as the technology becomes cheaper.  The article mentioned Doug
Platt, an Extropian who was active in this area.  Several years ago at
a party at Max's house I met Doug (I think it was Doug) who demonstrated
his wearable equipment, a PC with a chord keyboard he could wear on his
belt, and a head-mounted display (HMD).

With the Palm VII and WAP enabled Internet phones, wearables may
seem obsolete, but the display bandwidth provided by these devices is
so limited that it restricts their usefulness.  A wireless internet
connection feeding a HMD would be far more useful.

Then the whole idea of mediated reality is fascinating even without
wireless technolgy.  Some of Mann's claims seem exaggerated to me;
I don't see how you could remove ads with current technology, other
than putting a manually-controlled opaque window into the display.
However they give us a feel for the kinds of things that will be possible.

Mann's ideas about exploring other sensory modalities are fascinating
as well.  He uses sonar sensors with vibrating tactile stimulators to give
a "feel" for what is around and behind you.  I saw an article yesterday
about using smells to provide information.  While your portfolio is going
up you smell honeysuckle; when it drops there is an odor of burnt toast.
This would be processed unconsciously so you'd always be aware of your
financial status in the back of your mind.

Lots of cool stuff around the corner!

Whew, you're telling me. This kind of sounds like a Hinduism or Jainism where 
people get reincarnated into bugs, grass, cows, dung beetles; depending on 
their Karma. To an outsider like myself I suspect this was a way of dealing 
with the injustices of life (always a good goal) by thinking that a wicked 
Brahman may be reduced to a sub-existence, and justice will ultimately 
prevail--this is just a guess on my part. Getting back to your analysis of 
Wilbur's psychology, I am not confident in the notion that when we dissipate, 
our thoughts or energy become absorbed in a kind of bound energy state, or a 
Clarke-ian Overmind, or a Buddhist Over-Soul.

   PARIS, Nov 16 (AFP) - French researchers reported Thursday they  
had achieved a breakthrough in making carbon nanotubes, one of the 
most exciting inventions of the past decade, which could open the 
way to manufacturing them as fibres with a host of uses. 
   Nanotubes, first invented in 1991, are tubes with a diameter far  
smaller than a human hair, with a carbon structure that makes them 
chemically inert but light, extremely strong and resilient, as well 
as able to conduct heat and electricity. 
   They are conventionally created by vaporising graphite rods by  
electric arc in a chamber filled with a gas such as helium or 
hydrogen, and then allowed to cool slowly. 
   Scientists from the Paul Pascal Research Centre at the  
University of Bordeaux said they had devised a method to spin 
single-wall nanotubes into "indefinitely long" ribbons and fibres. 
   Unlike other carbon fibres, they are extremely flexible and can  
even be knotted without breaking, they reported. Their research is 
published in full in Friday's issue of Science, the US weekly 
journal. 
   Ultra-strong fibres of this kind have a wide variety of  
potential applications, from artificial muscles to hydrogen storage 
and flat-screen TVs, the researchers hope. 
   The ribbons were created by dispersing raw nanotube soot into a  
surfactant, or detergent, solution. 
   That solution was then injected into a flowing steam of polymer  
solution which caused the nanotube material to recondense into a 
mesh. The flow of the solution aligned the mesh into ribbon-like 
fibres. 
   On November 2, separate teams from Japan's NEC Corp. and the  
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology reported they had 
created the smallest nanotubes feasible, each narrower than a 
filament of DNA. 
   The tubes were just 0.4 nanometres (0.4 billionths of a metre)  
wide. 
   Scientists have previous created even smaller tubes, of 0.33  
nanometres. However, these are unstable because structural changes 
at this tiny scale can force carbon to become metallic.

This has been discussed on eBay - some of the other auction sites do
this (I think Yahoo auctions).  Sellers would generally prefer it, and
bidders who don't try to put in last-minute bids.  But there are some
vocal bidders who rely on the technique who oppose changes.

The idea of a probabilistic cutoff is also interesting but probably
not practical for voting.  It doesn't seem "fair", too unpredictable.
Randomness isn't a desirable quality in a voting protocol.

Something similar has been used a few times on the FX game, where there
were claims betting about FX parameters which might have been subject to
manipulation if the parameter was tested at a known time.  So the claims
were set up to test the parameter at random times chosen over a period of
weeks, with the claim value being based on the average of these samples.

I totally agree with that. My point of contention is that the road to that 
ultimate triumph will be walked by rationalists, by scientists and engineers 
who will methodically map the path and then pave the ground and build the 
bridges that will lead us to that point. No mystic sitting in a mountaintop 
will do it. I believe that we will transcend the human condition, but this 
transcendence will come from first understanding and then improving said 
condition, and the tools for both will be your basic obersvation, theorizing 
and experimentation -- the simple method that has allowed us to control our 
environment instead of being controlled by it, and which now may allow us to 
side-step evolution and dicate our own advancement.
All IMHO, of course.

Hal,

	Thanks for this information about the new vitrification
technique being offered by Alcor.  (I'm in the process of signing up
but haven't completed it yet.)

	My beliefs are different.  I think (or at least hope) all
information will eventually be recoverable.  I just think if a body is
provided, some of the information will be easer to recover and hence
be recovered sooner.

	My primary reason for wanting a full body is the extra level
of security.  If funds run low, they can always chuck the body and
save only the head.  But if you've only provided funds for a neural,
there is nothing lessor to back up to in case of an emergency.

	How about both?  Would this be possible?  Primarily do the
neural with the new technique, but preserve the rest of the body as
best as they can?  Putting them both in the dewer together (of course
the head still on the bottom)?  Then if there is some kind of
emergency requiring it, they can all the easer chuck the body and save
the separated head?  Does anyone know if Alcor could provide such an
option?

    Then if all of my points except possibly #1 is correct I am justified in:
1.  Doing all that I can to improve the quality of my health and life.
2. Expecting to a reward in the form of at least a slightly lengthened life 
span as well as more enjoyment of such life as I do live.
3.  Hoping to have additonal advancements in medicine bring further rewards 
to me.

    Let me pose you a practical question; if I am sixty five and healthy as 
the traditional horse what is the probability of a major life extension 
within my lifetime?

There might be a problem with perfusing a body that is absent a head.
I know they have always said that doing a neurosuspension they get
better cranial perfusion than when doing whole-body, because they
can get direct access to the cranial arteries.  It is not really
possible to do a whole body suspension with neurosuspension levels
of cranial support.

Cutting off the head would of course let them do a normal neuro-
suspension, but then I would worry that the massive tissue damage
to the body would make it hard to perfuse that.

I suppose you could just ask for a straight freeze on the body after
minimal perfusion, sort of an augmented neurosuspension.  The frozen body
would no doubt provide useful information for reconstructing a new one
(real or virtual) even if it was a rather bad suspension.

Since vitrification causes little (none at all?) structural damage, it 
should not neccesarily require an advanced nanotech for revival. This means 
they start doing animal research on developing an effective thawing and 
revival procedure.

Brain Signals Move Robotic Arm 
http://www.personalmd.com/news/a1999062110.shtml
(AP) - Researchers have wired the brains of monkeys to control
robotic arms - a feat that could one day allow paralyzed people to
move artificial arms and legs merely by thinking. The wires fed
electrical impulses from the brains of two monkeys into a computer
linked to robotic arms. When the monkeys reached for food or
manipulated a joystick, the robotic arms mimicked those motions. For
people who are paralyzed because of spinal cord injuries or diseases
of the central nervous system, such wiring could one day enable them
to bypass the damage and send impulses directly to their muscles. "It
is in the realm of reality. It is not science fiction any more," said
Duke University researcher Miguel Nicolelis. In the monkey
experiments, 96 wires, each half the thickness of a human hair, were
connected to six areas of one animal's brain, while 32 wires were
connected to two areas of the second monkey's brain. The robotic arms
performed simple to-and-fro movements similarly with each monkey. But
they performed three-dimensional movements better when directed by
the monkey with more implants. The Duke researchers' findings were
reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. They are now
working on a chip that could be implanted under the skin, replacing
the external computer.

Hi Max.

Do you find it challenging to put on/retain muscle mass under caloric
restriction?  I'm developing a work-out schedule right now and I would like
to add up to 10lbs, however my caloric intake is not high and I'm not
interested in increasing it.  Possible?

Are there ways that I can achieve these results by altering the type of
calories I'm consuming?

Thx.

Thank Brian, very useful.

I *love* practical stuff like this.


I find it a challenge to avoid bread-- I happen to love the stuff-- is there
a 'lesser evil' here?  I stick to the whole grains, can't stand the white
stuff.  Comments anyone?

I wouldn't say that's absurd Nicq.  I myself practice very fluid
philosophy-- I personally find it confers tremendous advantages, but keep in
mind I have a very high tolerance for ambiguity.

It -can- be frustrating at times (for myself, and others: much potential for
ideological conflict, dogmatism is ceaselessly annoying) but less so for the
nimble relativist: there are many paths and many truths.

I'm sure there are many advantages as well to having a concrete belief
structure, some of them (comfort in the universe) I'm not particularly
interested in, others (ideological structure bringing focus to real world
actions,) can be manufactured out of logical thin air.

Skepticism is actually quite interesting when taken to an absurd level-- it
must necessarily be applied to itself.

Challenge everything, wipe the canvass clean, and then create a functional
and optimal reality matrix for yourself.  If you don't have anything better
to do, here's what you should be doing:

1) Strip away limiting ideological garbage.
2) Understand your personal power.
3) Understand your environment.
4) Do.

(What works for me: "You are a human on planet Earth, and you kick ass.
There *is* a way.  Do it now.")


Others will disagree, but: reality is, after all, a game.  There are some
rules you have to follow, but -many- you don't: try to recognize all the
rules that you or your society have manufactured that arbitrarily restrict
your behavior and start erasing them to your advantage.

One pearl of wisdom: In the face of meaninglessness, and when in doubt,
employ compassion.  Other game players will come to your rescue.

Paris, Nov 17 (Reuters)

France's highest appeals court, in a landmark case with broad
legal and ethical implications, ruled on Friday that a youth born
with severe handicaps could be COMPENSATED SIMPLY
FOR BEING BORN rather than aborted.

The parents of a deaf, retarded and nearly blind boy, now 17,
won an appeal for compensation on grounds that doctors and
a medical laboratory should have prevented the birth after finding
out during the pregnancy that his mother had contracted rubella.
The disease, also known as German measles, can cause severe
disabilities to a foetus. Josette and Christian Perruche said they
would have aborted their son Nicolas if they had not been told
there was no danger.

``Since mistakes committed by the doctors and the laboratory while
carrying out their contract with Mrs Perruche prevented her from
exercising her choice to end the pregnancy to avoid the birth of a
handicapped child, THE LATTER CAN ASK for compensation for damages
resulting from this handicap,'' the Cour de Cassation said in its decision.
Doctors' groups, the Roman Catholic church and Unapeei, the largest
association defending mentally handicapped children, all declined to
comment on the pioneering decision until it had seen the full legal text.

The court upheld a lower court ruling to grant compensation, which the
Paris prosecutor's office had challenged arguing that would create
a ``RIGHT NOT TO BE BORN" and amount to deciding that some lives
were WORTH LIVING while others were not. The prosecution also argued
that upholding the appeal could set a precedent for children unhappy
with their lives for less serious reasons to also sue for compensation.
Critics warned this concept of ``wrongful birth'' could open the door to
countless lawsuits against doctors if parents were not satisfied with
their babies. Fearing litigation, doctors might pressure women to have
eugenic abortions rather than risk giving birth to less-than-perfect
infants,
or ask them to sign waivers before treating them throughout a difficult
pregnancy, they said. This could also upset the basis for France's abortion
law, said Claude Sureau, president of the National Medical Academy.
``If one grants a child the right to be compensated for a mistake committed
while it was an embryo, one recognises its legal rights at that point,''
he told the daily Le Monde. ``That can put a question mark over all our laws
allowing abortion,'' he said. If a handicapped child can sue a doctor for a
mistaken diagnosis, Sureau added, it could presumably also sue its parents
for not opting for an abortion.

But the Cour de Cassation, the highest appeals court in the country,
upheld the decision that Nicolas HAD THE RIGHT TO DAMAGES for his
condition.

The parents -- who had already won compensation for themselves in an
earlier trial -- fought the case on behalf of their son, who, with an

Interesting. This involves a kind of viewpoint that says there is a 
perspective somewhere (where an observer is) that can differentiate whether 
one wants to be born or not. An imaginary place?

I've heard that between chaos and order, complexity happens. Complex
adaptive systems have evolved and continue to emerge in greater
complexity. That's life (AKA extropy).
As complexity accelerates due to technological positive feedback and
autocatalytic network self-organization, it leads to what I've dubbed
"hyperplexity" -- a consilience of knowledge so immense that no ordinary
human can acquire a comprehensive understanding of the entire system. (It,
nevertheless, helps to discuss it in forums like this.)

Greens remain immured in Newtonian stasis. Reality contains more potential
for extropic evolution than is dreamt of by any ideology, especially one
as timid as that propounded by the Greens.

Unlike the extropians, however, the Greens offer excuses for rebellion.

I would dearly like to see "None of the Above" as one of

Yes. But where?

But right now I remember that

published the law december 1996, 23th,

There was a case in the Ohio Supreme Court not long ago along similar
lines, where parents sued doctors for not telling them that their
child had spina bifida so they could have aborted it.

I think these cases may pave the road for some interesting legal
developments. It seems we will need some better rules for the legal
interaction between unconceived, unborn and born children and their
parents when reproductive technology spreads and advances.  

For example, should parents be allowed to add any "enhancement genes"
to their children? One way of handling this would be to give the
children the ability to sue their parents for compensation if they
find their genes unbearable. In order to protect against this, the
parents would buy insurance while planning the child, and I guess the
insurance premiums would be proportional to the estimated risk of the
modifications. This would create a bias against making obviously bad
or risky choices even without adding much of a legal overhead to the
process. Of course, getting this kind of system off the ground might
be another matter.

Thoughts?

Increase the calories from protien and omega3 fats




Hi Max.

Do you find it challenging to put on/retain muscle mass under caloric
restriction?  I'm developing a work-out schedule right now and I would like
to add up to 10lbs, however my caloric intake is not high and I'm not
interested in increasing it.  Possible?

Are there ways that I can achieve these results by altering the type of
calories I'm consuming?

Thx.

Many extropians are libertarian.  Libertarians have all the "excuses for
rebellion" they need. Generally much better ones than the Greens can offer.

Oh, don't tempt us to answer that!  It probably ended because you knew too
little to fully appreciate it.  It appears the lack has not been corrected
subsequently.   Or do you just prefer infallible popery?   I know, I know,
you are actually a total relativist so you can't be pinned down on anything
you may say, do or think or in any wise be held accountable for any of your
uncountable opinions.  You prefer to be walking vapor-person.  Have fun.

Yes. Very interesting. We need better rules. 

Abortion: we already "kill" tissues, organs, bodies.
So we are already doing "something".

Cloning: if  I were a clone I'd be very depressed (knowing it).

Perhaps, the best theoretical tool is "potentiality".

Why not? In the US, parents (in this case, irresponsible dolts) are
allowed to bring children into the world even though they (the parents)
haven't the means to support or properly nourish the children.

Should they also be able to sue if their parents don't add certain
enhancements?

why would you be depressed if you knew that you were a clone, you
would have the same chance as anyone else for mutation.  and you would
have the same chance to define your environment.  one will assume that
you were cloned near an appropriate/'close' generative period.  it's

Oh, believe me, I had learned enough.  I'd learned enough to know that it
really doesn't matter a bit.  I began to look in the mirror and realize that
tomorrow, I will die.  It doesn't matter if tomorrow is tomorrow, if
tomorrow is sixty years, or if tomorrow is sixty million years- I will die.
In the end, the dream is over.  In the end, it's all just opinion.  There is
no truth unless it is created, and no laws except the ones we impose.
Fantasy is merely reality without inhibitions.  As for being a "walking
vapor-person", I seem to be more aware of the nature of life than the people
I seem to meet and work with every day, who actually think that they're
accomplishing something!  Or that, perhaps, they are right about something!
Yet, I'm afraid, everyone is wrong.  Everyone is, essentially, a walking
corpse, a doomed machine thinking that they actually have this fiction
called "free will".

Ah.  Mockery.  I don't have the freedom to spell my name the way I want to
now?

What motivates me to keep on living is my hope that I can generate enough
courage to truly live, that I can escape every boundary and discover true
freedom, liberation from existence itself through destroying the very
concept of belief, by simultaneously believing everything and believing
nothing, and seeing through the illusion therewith.  It's not too difficult
of an idea to postulate- I'm just finding it difficult to put into practice.

Yes, you've got it right that "free will" is a fiction; just like
phlogiston and vitalism (and "mind" and "consciousness"). Now that we're
grown up enough to recognize and acknowledge that fact, let's also admit
that "relativism" has nothing to do with reality and its adherents. A
strangely limited mechanical thinking imagines that a doomed corpse can
grok the truth beyond the relative. Transitional humans will need to get
over this. The sooner the better.

Dear Non-Absolute,

If all of that is true then why do you bother to post (or to do anything
else except seek the Void)?  Your opinion and this conversation is utterly
irrelevant.  Ah, you think it is all predestined that we spend some time
hashing out how illusory and pointless this all is, eh? OK.  I certainly
agree this conversation is pointless.

Enough solipsism.  I have more interesting illusions of purpose to attend
to.  After all I have no choice but to do so according to you.  In actuality
I choose and re-choose every day but you choose to believe that that is only
an illusion, that there is no actuality, that reality is infinitely fluid
and life infinitely spastic.  Fine.  Have fun with this pointless tangle of
endless second-guessing until you get tired of it.  Hopefully you will
before you've lost the chance.

Wearables should take off as soon as:
	(a) you don't look like a poorly designed borg wearing one;
	(b) really good HUDs are out (full resolution, non-occluding);
	(c) power requirements are so low or tiny batteries so good to make
it reasonable to have fuller functionality;
	(d) wireless internet is a LOT faster than today;
	(e) reasonable powered voice recognition and interfaces;
	(f) good key and selection input;
	(g) all of the above;
	(h) none of the above.

The difference between a wearable and a PDA is that the wearable is always
on, hopefully somewhat context aware (where you are, what you are trying to
do, what the local telecom/compute resources are), and doesn't require you
to pull it out or hold it in your hand.  The goal is to get to the point
where the computer is merely part of you and acts as additional associative
memory, compute resources, tie in to the e-community and so on.  Eventually
the PDA becomes a wearable becomes embedded hardware.  Another possible
solution (or another way of getting part of the goodies) is to embed compute
resources everywhere along with some means of recognizing the current user
and pulling in the corresponding context.  This is ubiquitous computing.
Personally I have too much of a drive to own my own hardware (and hack it
and its software) to want to go the ubiquitous invisible computing route
*instead*.

Why the vehemence, in the face of determinism? Have you magically attained

Have you seen the prototype HMD which is just an add-on to standard glasses,
in which the display is projected into what looks like a .5mm square on one
lens? Apparently the display appears to float in space about 2 feet away.
That kind of device plus wearcomp, plus possibly voice recognition, makes
PDAs look like the pieces of shite that they really are.

Really, I think that PDAs and mobiles are precursors to wearables. I assume
that we'll be looking at discrete, wearable devices which communicate
wirelessly, and keep you fully hooked-in. The PDA will move toward a full
personal computer in processing power, with display seperating into HMV,
discrete speaker in ear, guts of the thing on your belt (or in your pocket,
or whatever). Maybe you keep a handwriting tablet until voice recognition
gives better input capabilities. Certainly, those twiddlers have got to be
an intermediate phase!

And of course, the mobile integrates into the PDA (perhaps a modular add-on
for a while, still usable stand-alone), taking advantage of the ear-speaker
and voice pickup already added to the "PDA".

I don't think these little toys will block wearables. I think people love
their PDAs and Mobiles, but do struggle with their limitations. These
devices are the beginning of wearcomp.

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE NOVEMBER 17 2000

IN THIS ISSUE, NOVEMBER 17 2000:  LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  B

PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK: TMG Caplets, Folic Acid Plus Vitamin B12 Capsules;
BOOK:  The Homocysteine Revolution; BLOOD TESTING

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
B Vitamins improve vascular function

In this week's issue of Circulation, Journal of the American Heart
Association, it was reported that B vitamins folic acid and vitamin B12
improve vascular function, most likely through the mechanism of lowering
homocysteine.  Elevated homocysteine is a known risk factor in
cardiovascular disease yet it was unknown what effect lowering
homocysteine would have on endothelial function.  The endothelium is the
layer of cells that lines the blood vessels that is effected in coronary
artery patients. The study included eighty-nine men with coronary heart
disease who had no history of a coronary event for the preceding three
months.  The men were randomized into two groups, one who received 1 mg
vitamin B12 and 5 mg folic acid per day, the other, a placebo.  Vascular
endothelial function was measured before and eight weeks after treatment,
as well as serum folate and B12 levels, total plasma homocysteine and free
(unbound) plasma homocysteine.

While at the beginning of the study endothelial function as measured by
flow-mediated dilatation was the same in both groups, it was significantly
improved in the group receiving the vitamins after eight weeks.  This
group also experienced a drop in total plasma homocysteine as well as free
homocysteine along with the expected rise in serum levels of vitamins B12
and folic acid.  The authors suggest that improvement in endothelial
function is not due to a direct effect of the vitamins on the endothelium,
but to the increased availability of nitric oxide that occurs with lower
free homocysteine levels, as free homocysteine inactivates nitric oxide.
They state that the results of this study indicate that free homocysteine
is a more accurate index of the biological activity of homocysteine in the
body  than bound homocysteine.

The study's authors note that the doses used in the study were selected to
provide maximal homocysteine reduction, but doses as low as 400 mcg folic
acid per day have been shown to lower homocysteine.  They consclude that
these results provide direct evidence that supplementation with B vitamins
may reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with atherosclerosis.

PROTOCOL
Homocysteine

Cardiovascular disease causes 44% of all deaths in the United States.
Alzheimer's dementia affects 4 million Americans now, and is expected to
increase sharply as the population ages. Both cardiovascular and
Alzheimer's disease have now been linked to the accumulation of a toxic
amino acid called homocysteine. Vitamin supplement users have assumed they
are being protected against homocysteine overload, but this article will
expose that fallacy and recommend a scientific course of action to follow.

The medical establishment woke up to the dangers of homocysteine when the
New England Journal of Medicine (April 9, 1998) and the Journal of the
American Medical Association (JAMA, Dec 18, 1996) published articles
suggesting that vitamin supplements be used to lower homocysteine levels.
This same message was published by the Life Extension Foundation 18 years
earlier (Anti-Aging News, Nov. 1981, 85-86).

Some cardiologists suggest that coronary artery disease patients take a
multivitamin supplement to lower their homocysteine levels. Patients who
follow this advice, but fail to have their blood tested for homocysteine,
could be making a fatal mistake.

The Life Extension Foundation has uncovered a flaw in the theory that a
person can blindly take vitamin supplements to adequately reduce
homocysteine levels. While folic acid, vitamin B12, B6, and
trimethylglycine (TMG) all lower homocysteine levels, it is impossible for
any individual to know if he or she is taking the proper amount of
nutrients without a homocysteine blood test.

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK

TMG Caplets

TMG may be one of the most important nutrients to prevent heart disease,
stroke, liver disease and to slow aging.

TMG stands for trimethylglycine which means it has three methyl groups
attached to each molecule of glycine. In the body, TMG donates one of its
methyl groups to cellular DNA, which may help protect DNA against
premature aging.

When a TMG methyl group is donated to a molecule of toxic homocysteine, it
converts the homocysteine to methionine and s-adenosyl-methionine. A safe
level of homocysteine has not been established and this means that taking
nutrients like TMG could lower everyone's risk of heart attack and stroke,
in addition to protecting DNA. TMG should be taken with cofactors
vitamin-B12 and folic acid. If you take Life Extension Mix and Life
Extension Booster, you will get these cofactors.

html

Folic Acid Plus Vitamin B12 Capsules

Folic acid produces many health benefits. The Journal of the American
Medical Association says that folic acid can prevent atherosclerosis
caused by hyperhomocysteinemia.

Folic acid is a member of the B complex and is often deficient in the
diet. Folic acid helps protect the chromosomes, is needed for the
utilization of sugar and amino acids, promotes healthier skin and helps
protect against intestinal parasites and food poisoning. The United States
RDA of 400 mcgs is less than what is needed for optimal health. Studies
show that folic acid in high doses can protect from cardiovascular
disease. The nutritional claim that folic acid can prevent spida bifida
from developing in the fetus if taken by pregnant women has been approved
for use by dietary supplement companies by the FDA.

Folic acid should be taken with vitamin B12 to prevent the folic acid from
masking a B12 deficiency. The Life Extension Buyers Club offers only folic
acid capsules that contain vitamin B12. Many elderly people suffering from
neurological impairment find that B12 supplementation greatly improves
their cognitive function. Published studies show that vitamin B12 in
supplement form absorbs better in elderly people than vitamin B12 that is
bound to food.

BOOK
The Homocysteine Revolution by Kilmer McCully, MD

McCully, a pathologist at the VA Hospital in Providence, had been studying
the effects of homocysteine on arteries since the late 1960s, when he
unearthed old autopsy slides from an 8 year-old boy who died of a stroke.
Intrigued by a newly discovered disease called "homocystinuria", McCully
realized that the same mechanism that caused heart attacks and strokes in
its young victims was probably responsible for heart attacks in
middle-aged adults.

BLOOD TESTING

Members of The Life Extension Foundation, through their blood tests, can
detect abnormalities that can be corrected before a disease state
develops. These tests will also help to optimize a personal life extension
program. No prescription is required for members and you will be mailed
your test results along with normal ranges and a brochure to further
explain the meaning of the tests.

LEF Member tests other than those covered by insurance will be ordered by
the Life Extension Foundation Staff Physician, ie - a prescription will be
provided for you.

You will be sent, by Priority Mail, a requisition form and information
about the nearest locations where you can have your blood drawn. You are
not limited to the drawing stations on the list we send. The final test
results will be sent to you by mail.

You can obtain medical blood tests to measure your levels of DHEA, the
anti-stress, youth, immunity, longevity hormone; PSA for prostate, IGF-1
(growth hormone), fibrinogen, sex hormones, cancer tumor markers,
homocysteine, and the complete blood count and chemistry profile for
cholesterol, glucose, and other functions critical to your health - ALL AT
DISCOUNT PRICES!

How could you *possibly* know that?

Hazarded a guess, did you?  Good.  In my language, we call that
belief, and it is true by definition (in my language) that you believe
it to be true.

Speak in my language.  The flaws you see are artifacts of the
logos-logic in which you think.  Of all the realities, of all the
conceptual schemes, in all the gin joints in all the world, why'd you
pick THAT one?

Hey, whaddya know!  That's the same reason I picked mine.

That's solidarity.

>From now on, whenever somebody says the word "objectivity," you and I
will pretend they're saying "solidarity."  Whenever somebody says
"absolute truth," we'll pretend they're saying "beliefs we share."
Share your beliefs.

In an earlier post on relativism, I presented you with two arguments
against relativism.  One of them was traditional.  The other was a
newer Wittgensteinian argument.

Did those arguments make sense to you?  What's wrong with them on your
terms?

Heh.  Can of worms, but I don't think we have free will.  Doesn't
bother me.  Ever read any Nietzsche?  Any Sartre?  Any Kant?  These
people were thinking about how people can make a free choice in a
world fully determined by law and chance, where "free will" is not
present in the World-in-itself.  They had some interesting results.
Do you know what they are?

Or are you too self-absorbed to read even the most famous philosophers
nearest to your own beliefs?  Have you got it all figured out?  That's
no relativism.  That's ethnocentrism, like I was suggesting.  [I KNEW
you'd come around! ;)]  But where's the open-mindedness?

Relativism is nonsense; if it serves any use, it's theraputic.  But
you don't seem to have actually benefitted from the therapy.  The
outcome was supposed to be open-mindedness.  (In my language, being
rational is to be adequately open-minded, by definition.)  What
happened?

There IS a revolution to be had.  It's a revolution against
relativism.  You think you figured relativism out all by yourself?
You're wrong.  (No free will, remember?  There are no new ideas,
remember?)  It surrounds you.  It pervades.  It was forced on you.
You think you don't know anyone who believes like you?  All of your
liberal friends are like that, but they won't admit it.  (All of mine
are.  They've told me everything and exactly what you tell me about
yourself.)

To revolt is to take our beliefs into our own hands.  Relativism is
taking everyone else's beliefs at face value.  But the real revolution
is in holding beliefs of our own, by ourselves, and rejecting the
false beliefs of others.  We stand up for ourselves.  Now, dust
yourself off and let's get on with it.

No, that's not the case.  I haven't been able to fully put it into practice-
that doesn't mean that I don't already use part of it.  The content is
there- the will just hasn't caught up with it yet.

To me it sounds more like standard issue postmodern discourse theory:
`selves' are `traversed' and `interpellated'
(hailed-and-thereby-defined-as-hearer-by-speaker) by tides of discourse
flowing back and forth across and between individual bodies/brains. 

We are *constituted* in/by the fields of discourse we inhabit and
contribute, all of which are soaked in ideology, values, preconceptions:
the political unconscious. 

I have considerable reservations about this construct, but in some degree
it's obviously valid. The (Enlightenment?) notion that the
political/value-laden world is atomistic, bottom-up from sovereign
individual monadic nodes, is simply untenable. Each of us, however ornery
and skull-bounded, is constituted *within* and simultaneously *against* an
informing culture.

None of which means that when the node-machine dies, the personality
construct associated with its functioning could possibly continue somewhere
else, or `merge back into' the cosmic flow, or any other `holistic'
formulation. That's just as muddleheaded. Yes, those aspects of our
`selves' that echo or implement ordered structures circulating among
individuals (call those aspects, loosely, `memes' or `standing waves' or
`attractors', whatever) will persist, while slowly or swiftly morphing. Any
impress we as individuals have left upon the discursive fields will remain
for a time to impose chaotic influence on other living nodes, but we'll be
toast. Too bad. Keep the dewars chilled and prepare the nanos for node
revival in due course. Otherwise, the tide's gone out and there's only
drying kelp left on the beach.

Isn't that what the `write-in option' does? (We don't have that in Oz, and
from what I see the polling officials appear to ignore write-in votes in
the States anyway.) Can you enter your own name, e.g.?

Sure you do. Don't I have the freedom to express amusement at creative
spelling? So, is "Nicq" your complete first name or is it short for
something else? And how do you pronounce it?

Discovering boundaries and illusions is a worthy goal, very extropic, IMHO,
but I don't see how simultaneously believing everything and nothing will
help. It doesn't even make sense to me.

Prof. R. Murphy, "An Introduction to AI Robotics". This book provides all
the material needed to understand the principles behind the AI approach to
robotics and to program an artificial intelligent robot for applications
involving sensing, navigation, planning, and uncertainty. Many examples
are based on the Khepera.
Robin Murphy is extremely effective at combining theoretical and practical
rigor with a light narrative touch. In the overview, for example, she
touches upon anthropomorphic robots from classic films and science fiction
stories before delving into the nuts and bolts of organizing intelligence
in robots.
Following the overview, Murphy contrasts AI and engineering approaches and
discusses what she calls the three paradigms of AI robotics: hierarchical,
reactive, and hybrid deliberative/reactive. Later chapters explore
multiagent scenarios, navigation and path-planning for mobile robots, and
the basics of computer vision and range sensing. Each chapter includes
objectives, review questions, and exercises. Many chapters contain one or
more case studies showing how the concepts were implemented on real
robots. Murphy, who is well known for her classroom teaching, conveys the
intellectual adventure of mastering complex theoretical and technical
material.

I may have glossed over them.  Anyway, Wittgenstein is frequently used to
uphold relativism, especially by Feyerabend.

Yes, I've read Nietzsche.  I've read Thus Spoke Zarathustra three times.
I'm a Nietzsche addict.  I've never gotten around to Sartre (I will sooner
or later), and I tackled Kant's Critique of Pure Reason a few years ago,
only to give it up after getting hopelessly confused 80 pages into the text
(he's on the list for Ethics next semester, however, so I'll be returning to
him soon enough).

Okay, I'm not a relativist.  Relativism is a game that I play with e-lists
made up of members that support a given ideology.  Heck, last night on a
Neopagan Druid mailing list I was arguing hotly for an
objectivist-libertarian stance that supported gun rights and environmental
pollution- and this list is made up of some of the Greenest of the Greens!
I've debated in favor of physicalism and determinism on the Temple of Set (a
Satanic religious group which believes in the supremacy of the will and that
everyone can potentially become master of the universe) e-list, and I've
tried to push asceticism and abstinence on a TOPY list (The TOPY is a group
of hedonist-anarchist punks who practice magick and promote excessive drug
use and promiscuity).  The Extropians have been the first list to actually
put up a decent argument! (Well, with the exception of Michael Aquino of the
Temple of Set... of course, that guy is scary.  He managed to use Thomas
Aquinas as proof for the existence of the devil and the non-existence of
God, and wrote a series of proofs that would make the neo-Thomist professors
here at my university convert to Setianism if they saw them.  They got me to
join their church- for three months, before I was kicked out.)

You want my belief?  Here are two quotes that sum up my way of thinking
pretty well (the first from Zarathustra, the second from Hesse's "Demian"):

"A day shall come when you shall see your high things no more, and your low
things all too near, and you will fear your exaltation as if it were a
phantom.  In that day you will cry: All is false!"

"An enlightened man had but one duty- to seek the way to himself, to reach
inner certainty, to grope his way forward, no matter where it led.  I had
often speculated with images of the future, dreamed of roles that might be
assigned, perhaps as poet, or prophet, or painter, or something similar.
All that was futile.  I did not exist to write poems, to preach or to paint,
neither I nor anyone else.  All of that was incidental.  Each man had only
one genuine vocation- to find the way to himself.  He might end up as poet
or madman, as prophet or criminal- that was not his affair, ultimately it
was of no concern.  His task was to discover his own destiny- not an
arbitrary one- and live it out wholly and resolutely within himself."

My belief is very existential- frankly, do what you love, and do what thou
wilt.  In the end, we're all headed to the same place- so we should all try
to discover which side we are on, which faction we are in.  There is truth-
but it cannot be known for certain.  I think that there is a pretty good
chance that in the end, truth is defined by the state of the individual's
existence, and all we can do is play this beautiful game.

Well, in that case, what makes your beliefs true?  First off, I know nothing
about you, and little about your beliefs.  You could believe that I am a
purple elephant with a telepathic internet connection who has falsified all
the data that I have given about myself, but it would not make it true.
Yet, you could stand for and defend this belief, and even try to force me to
accept it as true.

So, in other words, I'm going to reject your false beliefs- and uphold my
true beliefs.  That's what it comes down to, doesn't it? ;)

It's short for Nicholas... I assumed that there were other "Nick MacDonald"s
in the world already, so three years ago I changed the spelling to a form
that would have the same pronunciation, yet I could be reasonably sure no
one in the world had taken yet. (After all, there is no "k" in Nicholas- why
not a q?)

Not quite.  You're still viewing your "self" as a self-contained entity, not
as the totality of existence.  So far, no one has explained why the "self"
exists- other than in a physicalist manner which really doesn't explain
anything, because it still doesn't explain the idea of self-in-experience
(in other words, why am I me and why am I not you... or why am I not aware
of everything, because I am part of everything).  The only reason we think
we are self contained is because of the limits of our nerve endings- as
Wilber pointed out, our consciousness extends much further.  The brain is
not a machine that exists outside the universe- it is constantly reacting to
the gravitational effects of countless bodies throughout the universe, and
ends up being something of a conveyance for thought that takes place as the
motions of innumerable bodies throughout the universe.

Will you be self-aware when you die?  No.
Is there a soul?  No.
Will we reincarnate? Not in totality- but to some extent, the patterns may
pass on.

However, the movements still take place.  The universe goes on, and life
continues.  The ego is the only thing that has vanished.

Inside the computer I'm writing this on, there's a book I'm currently
finishing. (There are also some identical copies on disks and other
machines, but let's pretend they don't exist because I was too stupid to
back the files up.)

Someone comes into my house and trashes the hard drive, folds, spindles and
mutilates it, fubars the fucker.

Why should I care? To some extent the patterns in the book can be found all
around us. The words are in the dictionary. Many of the phrases have been
uttered before, and who knows, might be uttered again. The universe goes
on, and life
continues, although mine is totally down the toilet for a while. The book
is the only thing that has vanished. And after all, who cares about a book
or the months of effort frozen into it?

it is.  Just don't mark anything.  My dad has been doing that for 20 years
now.  Do these statistics mean those who didn't vote, or those of whom
voted, but not for anyone?  If the latter, then it would mean that less
than 1/8 of the eligible voting population wanted any given
candidate...even worse statistics.

You're barking up the wrong tree.  I feel it safe to assume that most
people on a list like this came at least close to the realizations
you've pointed out, and ruled them out due to inefficiency.  They seem to
have put more effort towards making people happy, and making this world a
'better place'.  It may not seem this way, in fact some will probably
argue with me that this list seeks some mysterious truth...doesn't really
matter though.  Don't mind everyone here thinking I'm wrong.  Bottom line
is their thinking acomplishes much more than yours does (do I really need
to prove this?), and therefore it is better.

I suggest you put down Nietzsche, Fight Club, or whatever you're reading
until you've regained stability, in the sense that psycho-ologists refer
to it as.  Your current view is highly self-destructive, and trust me, not
worth the time and effort it takes to maintain.  You can argue all you'd
like, but the only one you're upsetting is yourself.  What you are
proposing are truths in and of themselves, so according to your own logic
unknowable.  (i.e., how can one be truly skeptic?  To be this way, you
must admit you know nothing, yet at the same time you're insisting that
you know nothing, and also claiming that other humans are of enough of a
likeness to you to know nothing as well).  If you insist on refusing this,
I propose that maybe a better list would be darkpoetry.org, (I think this
still exists), or whatever depressed-goth-freak.org there is out there.
Maybe I'm wrong...

Good luck

I'd better.  I've been toying with the notion of a minor in Physics (as well
as taking more Neuroscience courses), so I'd better find some motivation by
then...

One problem with that argument- you're not the book, and we have never
experienced dissolution (in our present forms, anyway), so we cannot take
this argument any further.  The most significant issues in life cannot be
resolved through objective, empirical arguments- they can only be resolved
through experiencing them from within.

I am not my brain.  I am not the data within it.  The I is the I that is not
I.  It makes sense when you start to meditate on it...

there's an aspect of pattern-identity theory that I have been interested in 
to see if there is any process that may be capable of auto-recording the data 
that t Kind of like Santa's book on which little kiddies have been naughty 
and which have been nice. (Groan) anyway, there was this SciAm article by a 
few years ago that provoked me into looking for any info on this weird 
conjecture. 

I am wondering if there was a possible info storage substrate already built 
into the universe? The article dealt with a mythological court case in which 
one physicist's recipe for Hungarian goulash was cruelly, tossed into a black 
hole. The judge in the case eventually ruled that the recipe was not lost 
eternally, but could be theoretically recovered by extraordinary, but 
"normal" means. Totally weird and bogus, I realize ,and yet it seems like 
something worth learning about. Pursuing mirages, I know, but maybe we'd find 
that missing book of yours, as well as my socks that go missing from the 
clothes dryer. Also are you going to get this book published, stateside?

I don't see any other Nicq MacDonald's, but there are plenty of Nicq's. It's
a pretty common French surname. Here are a couple first/only name Nicq's:

http://www.ets.uidaho.edu/athletics/track/m/pbios/Hale.html
http://www.ee.umd.edu/~dstewart/pinball/PAPA6/mWaf.html
http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~strobi/nicq2/nicq.html
 
There are other Dave Sill's, though. Maybe I should uniqify my name. I've
often wondered why e's and i's are the only vowels in English that are short
singly, but long when doubled. Lots of silly silent e's would be unnecessary
if we doubled a's and i's, too. Call me...

You can write in any name.  The bizarre thing I have learned is that they do
indeed ignore these votes.  A side-effect of not doing hand counts is that
no one even looks at the write-in votes.  Even if they say Gore or Bush,
they are not counted.  It is assumed that there is no chance that the
write-ins are going to amount to anything, that they are ignored by the
system.

Harsh, Mike.  Sagan's books are a lotta fun, especially Broca's Brain, and
The Cosmic Connection.  Sure he promoted some wacky lefty ideas,
but he redeemed himself a hundred times over with the Cosmos series.
Saw it in college.  The girl I was dating thought Sagan was the most
handsome thing on two feet.  {8-[  So I learned to immitate his style of
speaking.  {8^D  Then she threw me back for another guy who looked
more like Sagan.  {8-[

Then she got fat.  {8^D

But for me, Sagan was a turning point in life.

Nicq-shades of the Buddha. Let me speak for the dear old ego and say that the 
personality (traits and memory) are what makes you, you! If these are 
permanently washed away from the Universe, then what you suggest is a kind of 
"value-death" for the Universe--to quote Philosopher from Guelph University, 
John Leslie. The cosmos becomes utterly meaningless, because not only you, 
but all the people you cared about, all the people they cared about, all the 
beauty of nature is vanished permanently. This seems to give annihilation a 
permanent win. This is what Neitzsche's Ubermann was all about, knowing that 
life is crap and still keeping one's "nobility". Neitzsche also believed in 
palegenesia--that the same people would repeat the exact same events over and 
over again. This is also akin to the Stoics world view. Ultimately the 
universe dies, or life dies in it and it becomes an unaware commodity. My 
point is that one of the purposes of this list is to begin to tackle the 
problems of the human condition (there are many) and rectify them. No easy 
answers but from a cosmic time scale we may have a bit of time.

As I understand the Schwartzchild geometry, a little while after an object
has been tossed into a black hole, it is unrecoverable.  Attempts to swoop
down and retrieve it, or even to shine a light beam onto it, won't work.
The object will hit the singularity before even a light beam can reach it.

I know some people have postulated that the Hawking radiation which
will be eventually emitted when the black hole evaporates is not random.
It will somehow be subtly influenced by the contents of the black hole,
so that the information in the recipe will still be represented in the
details of the radiation that is emitted.  However this view is not very
widely accepted, as far as I know.

i didn't know we were talking about this.  (this = 'science' concept
and industrial [role] 'displeasure').  once, when i was younger (i am
20), science was mystical and reserved and my only friend
(fascination mode); now i find that it is everything, and that it is
the primary resource (which can be an overwhelming realization); this
model donates independence to the individual giving him/her
discretion on access.  also,

one does not need to necessarily align his/her academic \work\ with
his/her \interests\.  this can be saturating and deconstructive;  try
small shifts (think red).  i am taking a subbatical from pure science
next semester (metaphysics, neural basis of cognition, horror film,
photonics, vienna, world food economy (i want to know where
light-energy is going)).   essentially

Another version:
"One day you will no longer see what is exalted in you, and what is base
in you, you will see all too closely; your sublimity itself will make you
afraid, as if it were a phantom. One day you will cry: 'Everything is
false.'"

The reason for calling everything an illusion is not philosophical, the
basic reason is psychological. Living alone in your head requires a
certain kind of strength so that you keep yourself sane. The self-imposed
solitary confinement of solipsism can cause one to hallucinate, to start
talking to those hallucinations, and finally to answer from their side.
To live in solitude and to remain sane requires that one be creative, so
one creates an illusory world and then calls it false.

Zarathustra continues...
"There are emotions that seek to kill the solitary; if they do not
succeed, well, they must die themselves! But are you capable of being a
murderer?"

Can you be a murderer of your own illusions, murderer of your own
emotions? In your solitude you will desire friends, lovers, family, and
all kinds of things of which you've not yet thought. These desires will
kill you; these emotions will kill you, unless you are able to kill them.
Hence Zarathustra asks "are you capable of being a murderer of your own
emotions?"

Only choiceless awareness can directly experience reality.

I think most of us on this list think that germline modifications
should be allowed. But some modifications may not be particularly
desirable for the person one he/she/it grows up (like an outre skin
color, hardwired sexual preferences or a "natural" lifespan of 45
years). Clearly we are not in favor of *all* modifications, and the
question is what ethical and legal rules we would like to see in this
area. Most bioethics has been of the "just say no to germline
engineering!"-style so far, to my knowledge there has been less
studies of a transhumanist approach to what changes are good, bad and
should be allowed or disallowed.

One ethical principle I have been thinking of is reversibility:
genetic modifications that have reversible effects (e.g. controllable
using artificial hormones) should obviously be OK, since if you don't
like them you can always switch them off at a low cost.

Another is flexibility: changes that increase the available range of
potentially desirable options are preferable to changes or states with
more limited options.

I guess that under the current US system (+ such modifications) that
would be a possibility too. I guess that if parents had the
opportunity (and money) to fix a broken gene but didn't, then they are
responsible for the possible illness that could result.  Of course, if
you mix in religious freedom here things get iffy, I don't know what
supercedes what here. 

When you come to positive enhancements, it is not clear to me that it
makes sense to sue for (say) not getting the Adobe Biosystems
Creativity Gene 4.2 since it was just one option among many. If the
majority of people get intelligence upgrades for their children but
the person that sues didn't, then there might be more of a case - but
can you sue your parents for sending you to a bad school or college if
they could afford a better one? (a roughly equivalent situation) I
doubt that (but then again, the wonderful world of US litigation
appears to be as much as a wonderland where anything can happen as
mythical Hollywood from this side of the atlantic).

Here in Sweden the question is academic of course, since even if you
won you would not get much money at all.

When I said the argument was Wittgensteinian, I didn't mean that it
was actually Wittgenstein's.  (Though I think he would have approved.)
I believe I got it from Hilary Putnam, who got it while thinking about
Wittgenstein and relativism.

Kant is good, but if you're not already familiar with the turf, it's
usually good to have someone help you to read him.  The trouble is
that the structure of his prose is, ah, subtle, while it's clear that
his German translators have read so much of him that they've forgotten
the difference between clear prose and bad.

Let this be a lesson to the rest of you: you get more progress from

Now, in THIS, you'll definitely find friends here.

This depends on whether you mean "you" as in "not me" or "you" as in
"one of us" (eg "how do you [someone like me] bake a cake?").

As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing that "makes" my beliefs true.
There's nothing more to say about truth than Tarski's Convention T:
"Snow is white" is true iff snow is white.  That's all she wrote about
truth.

As for what makes YOUR beliefs true, well, I have to set up
T-sentences for you as well.  If you're speaking German, then one
T-sentence might be: "Schnee ist weiss" is true iff snow is white.  Of
course, you might not be speaking German, but might be speaking
differently from the way I speak.  To figure out which is which, I
have to interpret what you say using the interpretive principles of
charity (I have to assume that you are largely right about what you
say) and humanity (I have to assume that you tend to acquire beliefs
the same way I do).  But once I figure out those in a way which makes
sense to me, there's nothing more to say besides that.

Yup.  While charity dictates that, given extreme evidence, you doubt
that I hold purple elephant beliefs, ("no no no! by elephant, he must
mean 'great man!'"), charity and humanity can and do break
down... some people and beliefs are just wrong.  You know what to do
under those circumstances.

I'm not so sure people really love them. Lack of system resources and
a decent display (despite of what I said, there seems to be a slow but
steady grassroot progress in displays, as I found out by resubbing to
wear-hard@haven.org) makes them a real pain to use. I stopped using my
Newton 130 (which I've got for free) a long time ago.

Apropos the view of the brain as a Darwininan machine, as
espoused by Gerald M. Edelman and others, I thought I'd
mention a book with a similar theme which I ran across
recently: _Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge_ by
Henry C. Plotkin, 1993, Harvard University Press (paperback
edition, 269 pages; see
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674192818/qid=974465462/sr=1-2/107-6292930-3771726
The author is described on the book jacket as a professor of
psychobiology at University College in London.

I found that this book complemented my earlier reading of
Edelman (see
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465013767/o/qid=974464826/sr=2-1/107-6292930-3771726
and
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465007643/qid%3D974464955/107-6292930-3771726
and see also my earlier remarks about Edelman at
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/date56.html
[search down the page for "A Spring-Powered Theory of
Consciousness"]).  Whereas Edelman concentrates mainly on
neuronanatomy and the embryogenesis, development, and
architecture of the brain as the physical substrate of what
he calls "primary consciousness", the details of which he
describes in selectionist terms, Plotkin is concerned more
with theoretical considerations of Darwininan evolution as a
mechanism for matching biological organisms to a world which
manifests fluctuations and stabilities on many different
time scales -- in other words, a mechanism of adaptation.

Plotkin describes the efforts which have been made to
generalize "classical" Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, as it
became when fused in the 20th century with Mendelian
genetics), whose proper domain is the change over time of
biological species (driven by a two-stage process "with
genetics as the principal engine of variation and selection
acting mainly upon the phenotype" [p. 46]) to a more
abstract, encompassing theory which can be used to account
for variation over time **within** individual organisms as
well as that **between** individuals.  As does Edelman,
Plotkin points to the immune system as a solidly
uncontroversial example of intra-organismic change which is
universally acknowledged (the author claims) to occur by a
process analogous to that of classical Darwinian selection
among individuals.

To eliminate the analogical or metaphorical aspects of this
characterization, Plotkin calls upon what he names
"universal Darwinism" (see Chapter 3), a term which Richard
Dawkins originated, and which was intended by him to
indicate that "such processes are not bound to life on Earth
but are the same wherever adaptation and/or speciation are
occurring or have occurred anywhere in the universe"
(p. 60).  Plotkin, however, alters the sense of this phrase
to indicate that "it isn't only adaptation and speciation as
conventionally understood that are driven by these
processes, but that here on Earth certain other forms of
transformation of living systems are also caused by these
same processes" (p. 60).

Plotkin describes several different approaches to a
generalized Darwinian theory, one of which he calls the
"g-t-r heuristic" (g-t-r standing for
"generate-test-regenerate"), which the author derives from
the work of American biologist Richard C. Lewontin and
American psychologist Donald T. Campbell, and another of
which is the RIL ("replicator-interactor-lineage")
formulation of universal Darwinism, which Plotkin derives
from the work of Richard Dawkins and American philosopher of
biology David L.  Hull.  In addition to these scholars,
Plotkin credits a number of others who have produced work
along these lines, including philosopher of science Karl
Popper, sociologist Georg Simmel, physicist Ernst Mach,
ethologist Konrad Lorenz, psychologist B. F. Skinner, and
economist H. A. Simon (see p. 70).  I suggest that anybody
who is interested in this subject also perform a Google
search on the phrase "evolutionary epistemology".

The primary thrust of the book, of course, is to explore the
applicability of some form of generalized Darwinian theory
to the characterization learning and intelligence in humans
and other animals with nervous systems as a "secondary
heuristic" of adaptation, working within the lifetime of the
individual and subsidiary to the "primary heuristic" which
has shaped the individual's phenotype.  The following
quotes, which I have selected to give the flavor of the
author's arguments, are from the central chapter of the book
-- Chapter 5 "The Evolution of Intelligence":

p. 137

        [The] period of time between receiving a set of
        genetic instructions and their implementation
        through development to the point where those
        selfsame instructions might be returned, via
        reproduction, to the gene pool, has been given a
        variety of names...  Konrad Lorenz... called it
        generational deadtime.  It is a lag-time that is an
        invariant feature of any system whose construction
        takes time and which is based on a set of
        instructions that cannot be continually updated.  In
        the case of sexually reproducing organisms, each
        organism is cast off and cut off from the gene pool
        with a fixed set of instructions that cannot be
        altered.  It cannot "dip" back into the gene pool to
        augment these instructions if it finds they are not
        good enough.  In this sense, genetically, it is on
        its own.

p. 144

        The uncertain futures problem concerns an organism
        going through life, equipped only with instructions
        given at conception (and hence perhaps only correct
        at that time) on how to survive, and having to
        interact with a world that may be different from
        that in which its life began.  There are, of course,
        two possible outcomes -- the problem is solved or it
        is not...  Extinction is always caused by an
        inability to cope with the uncertain futures
        problem, and given the estimates that well in excess
        of 98 per cent of all species that have ever existed
        are now extinct, it is clear that, in the end, all
        life succumbs to its uncertain future...  None the
        less, [the] struggle to delay the inevitable
        succumbing can be relatively successful.  There are,
        after all, species that have existed for millions of
        years.

p. 145

        [One way] for an organism to reduce the amount of
        significant change it has to deal with... is to
        reduce the period of time between conception and
        reproductive competence...  This means that the
        ratio of life-span length to numbers of offspring is
        low...  This is a characteristic 'life-style' of
        animals known to ecologists as r-strategists...
        These r-strategists usually live less than one
        year...; they develop rapidly; they are usually of
        small body size; and they normally reproduce over
        just a single period.  This is the life-history
        strategy common to most invertebrate animals and
        clearly one that is... relatively successful...

p. 146

        [A] second very general way of dealing with
        change... [is to] change the phenotypes so they can
        change with and match the changing features of the
        world.  This, in turn, comprises two general
        strategies.  The one results in changes between
        phenotypes, and relies on the chance or radical
        component of the primary heuristic [the mechanism of
        classical Darwinian evolution, involving genetic
        variation and selection among competing
        phenotypes]...  [Large] numbers of offspring are
        produced,... each...  different from the others...
        r-strategists... often do combine a short life-span
        with a quite prominent radical component of the
        primary heuristic...

p. 147

        Another... strategy is to match change with
        change... by giving rise to change **within**
        phenotypes...  I will call this the tracking option.

p. 149

        How can such changes be tracked?  The only way to do
        it is to evolve tracking devices whose own states
        can be altered and held in that altered condition
        for the same period of time as the features of the
        world which they are tracking...  Such tracking
        devices would be set in place by the usual
        evolutionary processes of the primary heuristic and
        hence would operate within certain limits...  These
        additional knowledge-gaining devices comprise a...
        secondary... heuristic.

        ...[T]here are two such classes of semi-autonomous
        knowledge-gaining devices or secondary heuristics
        that can track change in this way.  The immune
        system is one; the intelligence mechanisms of the
        brain are the other.

        ...Think of the world as comprising sets of
        features, some unchanging and others changing at
        different rates and with different degrees of
        regularity...  [I]f the frequency of change is less
        than that set by generational deadtime for
        extracting genetic instructions from the gene pool
        and then returning them to it, then the conservative
        component of the primary heuristic will be able to
        'see' these changes and will furnish adaptatons to
        match them.  But if the frequency of change is
        faster than the frequency set by generational
        deadtime, then though the primary heuristic will be
        able to see the long-term stabilities upon which
        these changes are superimposed and will be able to
        detect the margin within which these more rapid
        changes occur, in order to track the precise values
        of these changes the primary heuristic will have to
        evolve devices that operate at a much higher
        frequency -- at a frequency high enough to be able
        to track these values.  If the high-frequency
        changes are unstable,...  the tracking
        device... need [only] command an immediate
        compensatory response...  However, if these
        changes... [are] short-term stabilities, then these
        tracking devices must comprise a secondary heuristic
        that is able to change and maintain new states that
        match those features of the world that are being
        tracked.  Such brain mechanisms...  are what we
        know... as rationality or intelligence.

p. 151

        In general, the kinds of animals that would evolve
        intelligent adaptations are relatively long-lived
        and produce relatively few offspring in their
        lifetime; that is, the ratio between the length of
        life and number of offspring is high.  Such animals
        usually develop quite slowly and have a relatively
        large body size.  They are what ecologists refer to
        as k-strategists...

p. 166

        What might [the] process be by which the secondary
        heuristic of intelligence gains knowledge?  There
        are only two candidates...  selection and
        instruction, corresponding to Darwinian and
        Lamarckian theories of evolution respectively.  The
        principal difference between them is that
        selectionism involves an over-proliferation of
        entities, the generation of which is unconnected
        with the organism's need at the time (which is why
        the process is sometimes referred to as blind); a
        small number of them are conserved after they have
        been tested against the organism's requirements...
        Instructionalism, on the other hand, involves the
        production of an entity, a product of intelligence,
        after the need for it has arisen (which is why the
        process is considered to be directed); this process
        requires a malleable substrate that is moulded into
        an adaptive state by the environmental feature that
        forms the external end of the relationship.  Put
        crudely, in the case of instruction the environment
        rules; in the case of selection, internal or
        organismic states lead.

p. 169

        [R]ight now we do not know how the brain
        [works]... in... sufficient detail...  to be able to
        say... whether it works in a selectional or an
        instructional manner.  Traditionally, the technical
        neuroscience literature has been based primarily
        upon instructionalist theory.  However, in the last
        twenty years or so, elegant and powerful theorizing
        by the likes of Jean-Pierre Changeux in France and
        Gerald Edelman in the United States has shown that
        selectionist models of brain development and
        function are both plausible... and interesting...

        What, in terms of... brain states, might correspond
        to the replicators, interactors, and lineages of the
        secondary heuristic?...  A replicator is a pattern
        of activity in a nerve sheet... and corresponds to a
        memory...  [T]he pattern of activity that
        constitutes [a] memory... is not always present --
        it is usually a potential pattern rather than one
        that is actually present.  This is just another way
        of saying what we all know to be the case, that we
        do not live with all of our memories activated all
        of the time.  But they can be re-constituted,
        re-membered, re-plicated...  Memories **are**
        replicators.  They are the secondary brain heuristic
        analogues of genes...  in the sense that memories
        are produced again and again as copies each time
        that the brain state in question is reconstituted --
        that is, each time we conjure up some specific
        memory.

p. 171

        [W]hy should the brain be seen as a Darwinian kind
        of machine rather than as a Lamarckian machine?...
        Forced to take sides,... there are two... reasons
        for choosing the selectionist camp.  One is the
        problem of creativity...
        Intelligence... involves... the production of novel
        solutions to the problems posed by change --
        solutions that are not directly given in the
        experienced world...  Such creativity cannot occur
        if change is slavishly tracked by instructionalist
        devices.  So what we see here is that while
        selection can mimic instruction, the reverse is
        never true...  Instructional intelligence comprises
        only what has been actually experienced...  Indeed,
        according to D. T. Campbell, the father of modern
        evolutionary epistemology, selectional processes are
        required for the acquisition of any truly new
        knowledge about the world: 'In going beyond what is
        already known, one cannot but go blindly.  If one
        goes wisely, this indicates already achieved wisdom
        of some general sort.'  Instruction is never blind.
        Selection always has an element...  of blindness in
        it.  At the heart of all creative intelligence is a
        selectional process, no matter how many
        instructional processes are built on top of it.

        The [other] reason for choosing selection over
        instruction is one of parsimony and simplicity.  If
        the primary heuristic works by selectional
        processes, which it most certainly does,... and if
        that other embodiment of the secondary heuristic
        that deals with our uncertain chemical futures,
        namely the immune system, works by selectional
        processes, which is now universally agreed, then why
        should one be so perverse as to back a different
        horse when it comes to intelligence?

        A nested hierarchy of selectional processes is a
        simple and elegant conception of the nature of
        knowledge.  There will have to be good empirical
        reasons for abandoning it.

The article "Ghost in the Machine: What Neuroscientists and
Computer Scientists Can Learn from Each Other" at
http://www.doubletwist.com/news/columns/article.jhtml;$sessionid$WLUGKNIAAA5EBWBCHIVSFEQ?section=weekly01&name=weekly0130
(which Max More provided the link to in his earlier
message), suggests that interpreting the mechanisms of
learning and intelligence in the brain in Darwinian terms is
a "metaphor", and quotes to that effect Dr. Terrence
Sejnowski, director of the Computational Neurobiology
Laboratory at the Salk Institute: "But the Darwin metaphor
for the brain is limited, he adds. While Sejnowski doesn't
deny the scientific support for synaptic plasticity and
neurogenesis, he thinks the parallel to Darwinism is
inexact. 'If you want to be strict--if you don't just want
it to be a literary metaphor--there needs to be a process of
duplication. You need to take something that is successful,
make many copies, and mutate it. There's nothing that
corresponds to that in the brain.'"

Plotkin's book and other writings on evolutionary
epistemology are, in effect, an attempt to address
Sejnowski's dismissal as a mere metaphor the application of
the adjective "Darwinian" to the operation of the brain.
The attempt to create a theory of universal Darwinism, as
Plotkin defines the term, is precisely the attempt to put a
Darwinian characterization of the brain on a firm
theoretical foundation.  One gets the impression, however,
that not all philosophers and scientists are convinced of
the respectability of this enterprise.  Nevertheless, the
following remarks in Plotkin's text apply to Sejnowski's
objections: "[T]he way that evolutionary processes actually
do occur in the immune system, in the brain or at the level
of the species is still largely unknown.  But there is no
reason not to expect considerable differences of detail.
**The actual mechanisms in each case**, of course -- and one
cannot repeat this point often enough -- **are entirely
different**" (Chapter 3 "Universal Darwinism", p. 100).
"[A] brain state can be reconstituted when such a state was
not actually present all the time in the past.  This
characteristic of neural replication, of making a copy, is
different from the replication of genes.  In the latter
case, a specific chemical structure is constantly present
and, at certain points in the cycle of the interactors
carrying those genes, copies, literal copies, are made of
the 'original'.  Clearly neural replication is different.
Here copies of brain states present some time in the past
are reconstituted, such structures being only potentially
present, not actually so, in the intervening time.  How such
actual brain states are re-established from potential brain
states is, for the present, a process whose details are
entirely unknown by brain scientists.  We simply do not know
how it works" (Chapter 6 "Aspects of Human Knowledge",
p. 219).

In other chapters, Plotkin acknowledges Dawkins' invention
of the term "meme", and describes attempts to apply
universal Darwinism to cultural evolution.  Plotkin admits
that such attempts are even less precise and more
speculative than the attempt to characterize learning and
intelligence as the subsidiary, secondary heuristic in a
hierarchy of Darwinian evolutionary processes whose primary
heuristic is the alteration of the phenotype through
successive generations.  Nevertheless, Plotkin asserts that
it may someday be theoretically justifiable to characterize
cultural evolution as a "tertiary heuristic" operating
subsidiarily to the other two (see p. 225).  Plotkin also
mentions Karl Popper's characterization of the evolution of
scientific knowledge in Darwinian terms, and remarks "As
Popper himself stresses, his view is not meant merely to be
understood metaphorically.  He means it literally: 'All this
may be expressed by saying that the growth of our knowledge
is the result of a process closely resembling what Darwin
called "natural selection"; that is, **the natural selection
of hypotheses**...  From the amoeba to Einstein, the growth
of knowledge is always the same: we try to solve our
problems, and to obtain, by a process of elimination,
something approaching adequacy to our tentative solutions.'"
(pp. 69-70).

In the final chapter of the book, the author applies the
evolutionary view of the human capacity for knowledge
developed in earlier chapters to illuminate the arguments of
philosophers Immanuel Kant and David Hume.  Kant wrote that
some knowledge, such as the understanding of mathematical
relationships and of causality, derives both from
observation of the world and from built-in intuitions or
propensities to take advantage of the relevant observations
-- the so-called a priori synthetic.  Plotkin interprets
this by bringing to bear the conclusion drawn earlier in the
book that the human mind is not a tabula rasa, but is
prepared by the "primary heuristic" of evolution in ways
that give the "secondary heuristic" a head start, so to
speak.  People seem to be born into the world knowing, in
some sense, what it is they need to learn.  Several lines of
evidence for this priming are presented from experimental
psychology; linguists, of course, have acknowledged since
Chomsky that humans are predisposed from birth to learn
speech with astonishing ease and rapidity.  While Kant
interpreted this a priori knowledge as a barrier between the
human intellect and the real world, an evolutionary
perspective interprets this a priori knowledge as the result
of human minds having been adapted by evolution to learn
about the world: the secondary heuristic of intelligence,
which makes philosophical contemplation and discourse
possible, owes its existence in the first place to aeons of
adaptive sculpting by the operation of the primary
heuristic.

Scottish philosopher David Hume shocked his contemporaries
by denying the possibility of certainty; again, in an
evolutionary interpretation, this is simply a statement of
the "uncertain futures" problem, a fact about the world
which makes intellect adaptive in the first place.  In the
following passage (from Chapter 7 "The Philosophical
Problems in Perspective", p. 243), Plotkin alludes to the
arguments of Hume, who criticized inductive inference
because the "principal of the uniformity of nature" on which
it is based is not a logical truth.  This passage also
contains a capsule summary of Plotkin's view of the
relationship between inter-organismic and intra-organismic
evolutionary processes (what are called throughout the book
the primary and secondary heuristics):

        In the face of this Humean uncertainty -- Humean
        because modern science can now interpret what the
        philosopher was pointing to as a factual condition
        of the universe and not merely a logical point --
        nature has come up with an elegant and effective
        response.  Unable to rely upon just one level of
        evolution and one unit of selection as the means of
        gaining knowledge about just one range of
        frequencies of change (that range being limited at
        one end by the change becoming undetectably slow to
        the point that survival is not threatened by a
        failure to respond to it, and at the other by the
        generational deadtime of each species), subsidiary
        evolutionary processes have evolved, each with its
        own units of selection, and each able to gain
        knowledge about changes that are occurring at
        ever-higher frequencies.  So in the real world the
        Humean uncertainty is converted into a pragmatic
        issue of dividing the world into band widths of
        frequencies of change and fluctuation, and emplying
        knowledge-gaining mechanisms that are able to match
        the rates of perturbation of the world with organic
        structures able to alter their own states at
        equivalent rates.

        Three and a half billion years of life on Earth tell
        us that though individuals, individual species, and
        whole larger groupings of living forms may come and
        go precisely because Humean uncertainty can be
        literally fatal, the biotic system as a whole
        endures, being rather adept at solving the problem.
        Life really is quite good at the knowledge game.

Since Plotkin mentions Gerald M. Edelman and Jean-Pierre
Changeux in the same breath, I ordered a book by the
latter: _L'Homme Neuronal_ (Fayard, 1983).  I have never
before attempted to read a serious book in French
(never having gotten much beyond _Le Petit Prince_, and that
was a long time ago), so I may have bitten off more than I
can chew.  Nevertheless, I still get a thrill from being
able to use the Web for international shopping -- I ordered
the book from a Paris on-line bookstore,

Well, he did say something that was extremely controversial in certain circles, he said that
the global extinction of the human race would be worse than the personal embarrassment
of a political leader, sometimes called preserving the nation's honor and glory.

    >Carl Sagan  was chicken ala Carl on the money for SDI,

He said 20 years ago that an effective missile defense can not be made with 1980 technology
and in retrospect there is not the slightest doubt that he was absolutely correct, we can't do it
with year 2000 technology either. He also said that a star wars system that didn't work
and technologically illiterate leaders who thought it would is a prescription for disaster.

I have had some very transformative experiences via psychedelics that have
greatly assisted me in widening my perspective, integrating my personality,
and increasing my understanding.

I have not found anything in the Extropian materials regarding psychedelics.
Do any of you think that psychedelics can play a role in transhumanism?

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 512 November 15, 2000 by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
Stein
STRANGELETS ARE STRANGE BUT NOT DANGEROUS.
Strangelets are hypothetical stable or semi-stable particles which
contain strange quarks. Theorists have predicted that such entities
could survive for long periods inside neutron stars and might be
produced in the type of heavy ion collisions going on at the RHIC
machine at Brookhaven. Fears that the production of strangelets
would lead to some runaway reaction in which more and more
ordinary matter would be turned into strange matter, with
catastrophic effects for our planet, have been largely dispelled (Dar et
al., Physics Letters B, 16 December 1999; and Jaffe et al., Review of
Modern Physics, Oct 2000; Select Articles) partly by pointing to the
fact that nature has always been producing heavy-ion collisions in
amid cosmic ray interactions. Any remaining doubts over the
strangelet danger have now been put to rest by Jes Madsen (45-8942-
3670, jesm@ifa.au.dk) of the University of Aarhus in Denmark.
Madsen shows that light strangelets are highly unstable, heavy
strangelets are difficult to make in the fireball environment of the
collision, and medium-sized strangelets must have a positive charge,
which precludes (through electrostatic repulsion) their assimilating
any nearby (similarly positively charged) nuclear matter into a larger
agglomeration. (Physical Review Letters, 27 November 2000; Select

Big Deal versus Bigtime: When Billy or Gore bogarted, and W'ya snorted; they 
were YOUNG MEN. Then needs to be a sort of largesse' when one is young and 
foolish.

Regards defeating a Soviet Missile attack using 1980 technology, you jump to 
conclusion, I feel. Let us define the goal and then define the technology. 
The main avenue of attack was to defeat the Communist Party CCCP--that is the 
"unacceptable damage" that military experts have judged. 

Now there were a few methods we might have tried and did not, to defeat an 
attack--even given the technology of the time. It's probably better to have 
had no successful missile defense system, as things happened, but to say it 
was unworkable because Sagan demurred or Kostia Tsipis, found it 
disagreeable; is no reason to propagandize against it. Hence, one could find 
such democratic-socialist like Dyson, give a different spin on things.  

For a variety of reasons, 90% because the Politics changed we do not have a 
Balistic Missile Defense system. Not because the technology was inherently 
wrong. Will you also now say that we do not drive around on fuel cells or 
have a lunar colony "because the technology didn't work"? No, these are 
decisions, wise or unwise; and its all the road not taken. Sagan had his 
biases, as do I, as do you.

When
   Commodore Perry sailed into Japan with a mighty warship, the Japanese

samantha:
People that know very little about mysticism (and knowing only the
dictionary definition is VERY little) really should not presume to say what
mystics "simply believe".  Some types of mystics believe that reason is
supreme and transcends its own seeming limits if applied rigorously and
honestly enough.  Check out Jnana Yoga.  Science for all of its acheivments
is so far up against the wall on value and "meaning of it all" type
questions and issues.  Some go so far as to say that if science cannot
address these things then they do not exist!  This is as blind as a
medievalist claiming that what is not in the bible is either false or not
important anyway.  Mysticism/religion sucks at describing physical reality.
But then, that was not its stated intent.  Foretelling the future is also
not its purpose all though some mystical/religous groups lower themselves to
acting as if it is.

   Having, in the past, found that events and phenomena that were previously

   falsifiably explained, one can logically infer that what is now
inscrutable
   will also, eventually, be logically and falsifiably explained. To believe
   otherwise is to deny four centuries of human progress. Now, it is
possible
   that at some point we might run into a wall that science and reason
cannot
   knock down -- but if one must have faith in something, I thing faith in
   science and reason is more sensible -- they have delivered a great deal
more
   than the alternatives.

Actually not all things believed to be true in science are falsfiable today.

it is.  Just don't mark anything.  My dad has been doing that for 20 years
now.  Do these statistics mean those who didn't vote, or those of whom
voted, but not for anyone?  If the latter, then it would mean that less
than 1/8 of the eligible voting population wanted any given
candidate...even worse statistics.

Some other points to keep in mind:

1) Initially, only neuro patients can/will be vitrified. Whole body
suspension will not lend itself to the vitrification technology for some
as yet undetermined time.

2) Initially, these neuro patients will be stored at LN2 boiling point
with little or no annealing. This will mean that these subjects will
develop gross cracks that will need something like strong nt to
resuscitate.

3) Nobody knows for sure what the "right" temperature is for long-term
storage of a vitrified patient. Over a long enough run, it is
conceivable that icing or cracks might occur. 

Still, very cool.

You're barking up the wrong tree.  I feel it safe to assume that most
people on a list like this came at least close to the realizations
you've pointed out, and ruled them out due to inefficiency.  They seem to
have put more effort towards making people happy, and making this world a
'better place'.  It may not seem this way, in fact some will probably
argue with me that this list seeks some mysterious truth...doesn't really
matter though.  Don't mind everyone here thinking I'm wrong.  Bottom line
is their thinking acomplishes much more than yours does (do I really need
to prove this?), and therefore it is better.

I suggest you put down Nietzsche, Fight Club, or whatever you're reading
until you've regained stability, in the sense that psycho-ologists refer
to it as.  Your current view is highly self-destructive, and trust me, not
worth the time and effort it takes to maintain.  You can argue all you'd
like, but the only one you're upsetting is yourself.  What you are
proposing are truths in and of themselves, so according to your own logic
unknowable.  (i.e., how can one be truly skeptic?  To be this way, you
must admit you know nothing, yet at the same time you're insisting that
you know nothing, and also claiming that other humans are of enough of a
likeness to you to know nothing as well).  If you insist on refusing this,
I propose that maybe a better list would be darkpoetry.org, (I think this
still exists), or whatever depressed-goth-freak.org there is out there.
Maybe I'm wrong...

Good luck

Well, I simply don't know of scientific studies of the moment of
intoxication, but about the long-term effects I do know that THC and
cannabis have far less chance of ruining the life of the user through
their physiological effects than alcohol.  Indeed alcohol has a known
deleterious effect on the brain and marijuana has no similar proven
effects.  Moreover, the consumption of marijuana in a society
enforcing a prohibition on it is a qualitatively different action from
consuming alcohol.

This assumes that it was the job or the duty of the U.S. to cause the
collapse of the Soviet system.  Though I agree that the result was
beneficial, I question the obligation of U.S. citizens to pay whatever
cost was required to get that result.  I'll still be paying down that
debt with my income taxes for years.

As to the other experimental benefits, if we were interested in
producing good science why not directly subsidize it?

I think the government owes it to its citizens to restrict its defense
expenditures to defense, and leave behind the imperial pretensions.

I agree here.  I know many Boomers now who look at my generation and the one
after it as irresponsible because of high drug use -- even when their teen
drug use was much higher and probably much less well-informed.:)

True.  One reason the Soviets fell appears to be their inability to compete
in the high tech realm.  In 1980s, does anyone here think the Soviets had
better predictive capabilities?  Does anyone think that one thing that might
have been eating at their minds was the possibility that the SDI program
might work and basically annull their nuclear threat?  If I had been one of
their strategists, I definitely would've thought hard on the possibility --
instead of just ignoring it.

The lack of a missle defense system worked most likely because the two
sides -- Soviets and Americans -- did not want a nuclear war on any scale.
If it had been the Americans versus the Red Chinese, history might have been
different, since on many accounts, the latter have limited nuclear war as
part of their doctrine.  (Whether this is to scare other nations is a matter
we can debate, but current intelligence seems to support my claim.)

Good point!  History -- heck, life! -- is full of contigencies.  One can't
argue that what happened had to necessarily happen.  Plus to grab one
prediction that came true -- evne if only provisionally so -- and use it as
if the predictor is [nearly] always right is a fallacy often made in these
areas.  If I make enough predictions, especially if they aren't all off the
wall, one is eventually going to come true...

My two cents!

On the Templeton list where I also lurk, people are, of course, less 
dedicated to rationalism and the Ayn Rand view as the paramount ethical 
value. Rationalism is an superb guidepost, as long as it doesn't become a 
'hitching-post' to quote an associate of mine.

So where does that leave people like me (not that anyone need care!)?  To 
paraphrase the great philosopher on the American Beer coomercial for Miller 
Beer; "Where is the Love, man?" To which the antagonist replied, "You're not 
getting my beer Bob". My concern here is not love, but a less agreeable 
attribute to desire..pity.
Someone like the icon of this group, Ayn Rand would no doubt see pity in as a 
grave weakness and a mental dysfunction, as well as a character flaw of 
Richtorian scale.
Maybe she would have been correct. However, I look at the human condition, 
nature red in tooth and claw, and such as a fact of life. But like disease 
and death, a fact which needs to be mitigated. 

Now if mysticism can do the job, excellent! If pure technological prowess can 
achieve this, mondo-bondo! If someone comes up with philosophy or drugs or a 
new branch of science that can push back the pain, let me join in.

Ignoring the ganja issue for the nonce. I was in favor of getting the Soviets 
to back-off. In Backing-off they realized there was no big bad outsider to 
unite them so they collpased. An oversimplification I agree. If because of 
your libertarian principles, you find this un-useful, so be it. It's one of 
those things that are purely ideological, and I am not geared for those

ideological garbage.

Yes, I could have just as easily agreed with all your above points ...
but even so, reality almost by definition is what "isn't" a game ...
games are microcosmical realities where the rules are agreed amongst the
players.

Do you mean "Laws" here rather than rules .... yes we take a gamble
breaking Laws and must carefully weigh the consequences, penalties ...
in the broadest sense vs. rewards. I agree with Diogenes (the cynic)
who would occasionally masturbate in public to remind everyone of our basic
nature.

I advise that whatever you do it tries to improve upon the "human condition"
..
although maybe the biggest game of all is that we are "humans," ha! I gave
up
pretending to be human a long time ago.

unfortunately most of the stuff I've read is by social scientists who take a
very hostile posistion on technologiacal determinism. I've tried to argue
that as we approach an era when we truly will have a technology that can
determine it's own future surely some elements of technological determinism
must already have been at work in human history. George Dyson's "Darwin
among the machines" is quite good on how technologies and human societies
interact.

outcome fails, British scientists would just be able to go to the US to do
the research. Is this not the case?

You are wrong, it's 100% due to politics. If politicians insisted we have star wars then we'd have

missile defense is 100% due to technology.

Yes. The technology has not advanced enough for them to make economic sense.

It seems to me there are two ways to look at it.  One is to be
conservative (for an Extropian) and to say that germ line engineering
is new, it is unpredictable in its consequences, and so we should only
allow or support changes which are clearly safe, along the lines Anders
proposes.

Another approach is more aggressive.  Throughout history parents have
had the right and power to force their children to grow up in difficult
circumstances.  Parents who leave a safe and comfortable village and
strike out on a migration across the Asiatic land bridge, or get into
a boat and travel for weeks and months to reach a new world, inherently
force their children born and unborn to take the same risks.

How much worse is germ line engineering than moving to a land where you
don't even know if your children will be able to survive?  And where,
in many historical cases, children did not survive?  Should we condemn
those who took chances in the past?  Or don't we applaud their courage
and daring?

Of course, we live in a different era today.  Our world is one which
minimizes risk, which builds a safety net to support those who fail.

But this is a cultural choice, not something which we should accept
unthinkingly.  Do we want to play it safe?  Or do we want to support
those who take risks, yes, even risks with their children's lives, in
the hopes of giving them advantages in the world to come?

Hal

P.S. Much of the current protectiveness towards children can be seen as
part of the cycle identified by Strauss & Howe, discussed at their web
site www.fourthturning.com.  If they are right we may see a change away
from modern day overprotectiveness in the next few decades.  I wonder if
our views on germ line engineering and other technologies will change once
"we're doing it for the children" starts to sound old-fashioned.

I guess we can play with the definition of mysticism in all kinds of ways. 
Actually, religion has tried its hand describing physicial reality; it got 
shifted to the "spiritual" realm only when it was shown its descriptions were 
valueless. Value and "meaning of it all" issues aren't the province of 
science. They can certainly have weight, since they influence our behavior, 
but they are less "real" than, say, gravity.

I'm not really saying that -- science is just a tool, not an end unto itself. 
I think religion is largely a waste of time, but that's a personal 
preference. What is great about science is that it's self-correcting; when 
observations contradict scientific "dogma," the dogma will be modified 
accordingly. For all we know relativity could be proven dead wrong in a 
hundred years (or more likely, merely shown to be an incomplete model of 
reality) and our descendants (or maybe us, courtesy of some good biotech) 
will look upon things like the concept of unchanging speed of light with the 
same amusement as we look at Ptolemy's model of the universe.

Ahh... then it's time to wake up the child in you!

Have you ever imagined looking at the world through a child's eyes,
when everything is fresh and new and interesting, and you can't
help being curious about what it all is?

Hmmm ...

(Still having trouble waking up that inner child?)

Then perhaps seeing some words from some children can help.

Here are questions that I was asked by some children when I was
working at my previous job, during which some of that time,
I spent teaching kids about the Sun.

-----begin children's questions-----------------------------------

Can a space man go to the sun at night so it will not be too hot?

How come the sky looks blue from earth and black from a rocket ship?

How much bigger is the sun than Germany?

Does sun turn like the earth turns?

Because the sun is so bad for your skin, I don't usually stay out
in the sun very much anymore, but I like looking healthy.  Is there a
safe way I  can get a tan like that actor, George Hamilton?

In the movie Lost In Space, the ship they were in flew through the sun.
Could this ever be possible?  Wouldn't the ship melt?

How is the Solar System related to math??

How can you cook marshmallows by solar heat?

If the sun is a star why can't we see it at night?

If there were two suns in one solar system, would they pull one another apart
because of the gravitational pull?

How did atoms form?

Planets in the solar system have moons that orbit them.  Do moons have
any objects that orbit them?

I was told by Joe Phoenix that if i went up in outer space
in a rocketship i would not be able to see the sun as we see it on earth.
In other words he is saying you cannot see the light of the sun from space.
Please say it ain't so!

How was the Sun born?

The planets currently use names that are based on Greek or
Roman gods.  At one time our sun was called Helios or Sol.
Why do we not call the sun by those names?  When did we start
calling the sun "Sun"?

Why doesn't the hurricane on Jupiter ever stop?

Why is the Oort Cloud so far from the sun?

What is the tornado on Neptune made of?

Is human life possible on any other planet?

What causes a harvest moon?

What is it like to fly in a spaceship?

Do blackholes really suck things?

What happens to a burned out star?

Are there other planets besides the 10 in the milky way?

For a class asiment we were asked the question HOW DOSE THE
TEMPERATURE CHANGE BASED ON LOCATION?  I saw yuor site and
decided to ask of your knowlage.  See when I grow up I want
to be a Physicist.  I haven't chosen what feild yet.  Please
help me with this answer.

(BTW, this last was from a little girl.. Yahoo!)

-----end children's questions-----------------------------------

I don't know about you, but seeing questions like these can't help
but make me think that the Universe is a remarkable place, and help
me feel that it's all worthwhile.

I've been in my scientific field for about 20 years, and I've
"rediscovered" it again and again. Even though there were times when
my enthusiasm for it faded, I could/can trust that some triggering event
will jar my knot of dissatisfaction loose, and I'm bouncing away
with it once again.

Here I show one rediscovery of my love of science, when I wrote the
article about Fiorella Terenzi about 5 years ago for Extropy mag:

http://www.amara.com/fio/fio_epilog.html

And here is something that I wrote more recently -- A kind of
"stream of consciousness poetry"

------------------------------------------

I am alive.

I press the dust on my canvas with my finger and examine the print.
My print of unique cracks through which my ageless eyes observed the
events of my life.

The dust wakes out of its slumber and I follow its passage.
As the dust marks my past, I laugh, despair, risk, care, learn, bleed,
love, dance, scream, change, and give, striving to be more.

My fingers close around my memories and I fall into a waking dream.

The dust glides through the universe from moons to planets and up to
... oops ...and around, into disks of new stars and through comet breezes.
The dust is a piece of me, or am I a piece of dust?

We fly from the ecliptic brightness, feel comforted by the local fluff,
and have a ceylon tea at the cosmic tea table with our friends from
beta Pic. They don't laugh at my jokes but I smile anyway.

I am alive.

"Green-bashing" seems to have become something of a sport on the list lately 
(and one in which I engage on a regular basis).  But I think it's important 
to reiterate that extropianism is NOT a "develop-to-death" value system.  In 
fact, I'm an avid and active conservationist (I won't use the word 
"environmentalist" to describe myself any more, for the same reason I've 
reluctantly abandoned "liberal" in favor of "libertarian" -- the word has 
been co-opted by a political movement with which I take deep exception.)  In 
fact, I concluded early on that the extropian principles are thoroughly 
consistent with a vigorous conservation of wilderness.  Five years ago I 
posted the following to the list:

     - - - - - - -

Toward an extropian environmentalist ethic. The ideas and values expressed 
within the extropian community are vigorously individualistic, find the 
workings of the freest possible market systems as the best current 
environment for incubating a positive future for humanity and challenge the 
sacred cows of the fundamentalist "environmental movement." But the core of 
extropian ideas also values compassion, generosity and a reverence for the 
beauty and power of the natural living environment of the earth. This last 
set of values is less well understood outside the extropian community and 
there is apparently a common caricature of extropians as "selfish, greedy 
despoilers of the environment". 

By and large, extropians find that an "absolutist" evaluation of "nature" is 
as evil as is a thoughtless destruction of the beauty that nature offers. The 
hard questions come in deriving the right balance. 

No "bright line" can or should be drawn between "nature" and "man". Humans, 
their technology and their effect on their environment are "natural" because 
consciousness and its products developed as part of the spontaneous order of 
the terran biosphere. Thus the concept of a "natural" environment distinct 
from humanity (or posthumanity), per se, is untenable. Furthermore, such a 
concept of nature distinct from humanity is not helpful because, unless we 
advocate human genocide, it is hopelessly vague and confused. But this 
realization does not justify any human action. 

For now, at least, Earth is the only planet of which we are aware that has 
spontaneously generated a rich biosphere. This phenomenon is scarce. Raw 
materials for an industrial society that can be found elsewhere than on/in 
this planet, on the other hand, are not. Earth constitutes a tiny fraction of 
the mass of the solar system. Even with the primitive survey of the solar 
system we have already made, we know we can find and exploit elsewhere the 
resources that an expanding industrial civilization needs. 

Extropian environmentalism places a high value on the living wilderness 
simply because it is rare and options exist and more will exist for the 
continued technological development of consciousness other than consuming 
those living wilderness zones. This does not place an unreasonably absolute 
value on living wilderness, but simply makes preserving it as much as 
possible one value among many, albeit a great value. Preserving living terran 
wilderness zones is consistent with the value of spontaneous order simply 
because life on this planet is, so far, the most complex example of this 
phenomenon of which we are aware. If for no other reason, mere curiosity 
about spontaneous order should lead us to interact with at least some of 
these zones as little as possible, at least until we better understand the 
processes that gave rise to them and by which they continue to operate. 

Post-human beings will have the power to allow the planet that was their 
cradle to continue to harbor biological life at least similar to that which 
originally gave rise to them. We don't tear down the Louvre to build 
apartment blocks, we build housing elsewhere. No one is significantly poorer 
because of it and at least some people are much richer because of it. Thus, 
along with buying wilderness zones for their value as such, a privatist 
environmental ethic also looks to develop technological alternatives to 
consuming these areas, as much as possible, so that the relative market value 
of other options will spontaneously support maximal preservation of living 
wilderness. This is not an absolutist ethic of "sustainable development", but 
rather simply the economic value free people put on technological and 
economic developmental pathways that impact the terran biosphere less rather 
than more.

Um, I don't care how high you want to climb up the rope of tautology here
Steve, the point remains.  Do you think that the act of stripping away
limiting ideological garbage is itself, a limiting ideology?  If so, please
explain your position in detail so the slow kids can keep up.

Certainly.

That too.  We humans are industrious little critters.  You can get

concrete.

Hmm... you'd like a specific directive?  Well, I was kinda hoping to keep it
opened ended... oh, you know, follow your bliss, blah bibbty blah, that sort
o' thing, but in your case I'll see if I can come up with something
concrete-- um... oh, I dunno... ah, okay, Steve, I'd like you to create a
popular sit-com based on the wacky on-screen antics of a cheeky pocket
calculator who mysteriously comes to life when accidentally dropped into a
jar of incredibly old peanut butter.  Wise-cracking technological relic,
with a real heart of gold, he undertakes to fight crime (and teach the
little ones their numbers!) living out of a basement flat in Manhattan with
a crochety (yet endearingly likeable) aged Jewish pawnbroker and a young
female cab driver with remarkable spunk.

Yes, actually, you're right.  By its very definition, by "game" we usually
mean, "that which -isn't- reality."  However, is there some value to be
found in treating reality as "if it were" a game?  I guess that depends on
how you play games, but in my case the answer is a definitive yes.  By
looking at reality as a complex rule set and attaching (necessarily)
arbitrary goals to it, and further, by seeking to optimize your success at
achieving those goals in the context of situational and environmental
modifiers, and by de-sentimentalizing your approach, and clearly weighing
costs and benefits we begin to hold reality a little bit at arms length.

I kick ass at Monopoly by the way.

I once lost 2 Gigs of (unbacked-up) original audio to a twitchy Jaz disc.  I
found that screaming a lone expletive at high noon, at the top of my lungs
in the middle of a packed film school to be remarkably therapeutic.

Right, so parents who add enhancement genes to their children might want
to add an enhancement gene that enables the children to see the folly of
suing the parents for a paltry settlement instead of using their
enhancements intelligently.

Currently we use liquid nitrogen, I think it's about 76 degrees Kelvin, the
boiling point. It's the cheapest and most convenient way to reach a fairly
low temperature. You can freeze and thaw individual mammalian cells, but
larger tissue is difficult, because of tissue destruction, freezing,
cracking. (as was mentioned) Vitrfication, sounds like a good idea, more
expensive, not sure if it would be less problematic or not.

I think "smart" psychedelics would be a good thing.  By smart, I mean
psychoactives whose effects would be known prior to ingestion.  I once
dropped acid and had a very good "trip."  I can understand why people would
describe it as a mind-expanding experience (although I don't necessarily
think that's what *I* would call it).  The experience seemed
earth-shatteringly life-changing at the time, but that effect passed not
long after the drug wore off.  I do believe however that I did gain some
insights into my own personality which have stayed with me to this day
(close to 20 years later).

The problem IMO with psychedelics as we have them today is their
unpredictability.  I had a good trip.  Lot's of folks don't.  And from what
I understand, a bad trip on acid can be *really* bad.  Worse, I've read that
long-lasting neuroses or psychoses have been triggered in a small percentage
of users.  So, all in all, I don't think our presently known psychoactives
are very "extropic."  But designer "smart" psychoactives which would have
predictable effects on the user would be.

It's not deja vu.
It's like I'm reading your posts 30 minutes before I do.
I think about something to talk about and find someone already wrote it.
Even posts as personal and individual as introductions
seem as if I was the one that wrote it.
Maybe it has something to do with the fact
that I have neither slept nor eaten much at all for the past two days.
It's like the world is a mirror.
Everything I think gets spat back at me.
Maybe I respect you all so much as my peers
that my mind registers the words I read as if I were writing them.
The downside is I don't learn much
from our highly intellectual conversations
I just keep getting the same old interesting subjects I've heard before.
Anybody want to tackle this psychological puzzle?

Maybe we should talk about something more practical?
...like how a fatty gel headed sack of seawater can avoid a pinebox?
Half the "food" in the world is a product of dietary warfare.
Can you imagine the death toll of a single McDonalds?
Wheat, Corn = Osteoporosis + Insulin Resistance/Diabetes
Potato, Squash, Tomato = the same family as DEADLY NIGHTSHADE!?!
Meat = Antibiotics, pestisides, herbicides (thats anti-bio/pest/herb)
How many years did you not even know what the real purpose of food was?
What did you put in your mouth?!?

I say we burn some poisonous crops to starve the rodents.
Hunta, Bubonic, and how many more plagues could be fought?
Hit 2 birds with one stone.
Pets are, what, a billion dollar burdon on our economy?
They will not save us.
They contribute nothing but disease.
Send all dogs and cats to Austrailia,
the dogs to kill the frogs

The snakes will take them both out afterwards.
Burn the fields.
Kills the animals.
The plague is not coming; the plagues are here already.

As a seeker of truths, and curious about the 'ism
in the subject, I have a question I wonder if someone 
would be kind enough to address.

As far as politics, Libertarianism is as close as it 
gets to my views. Even though, I have my reservations
as I do with any paradigm. The most prominent concern
on my mind is: What safeguards are there to keep 
society from rapidly degenerating into a corporate
facism. The freedoms of corporations to run the 
show seems almost uncountered under this particular
scheme. Rather Darwinian.

Not to say that politics currently isn't just an ad 
campaign run by the megacorporate (whatever).

>> I think that a 10-20 cent gas tax would be a very good idea.

>So do I. That would drop the price of gas 50-70 cents/gallon.

Taxing gas to help the enviroment is nonsense. It doesn't slow down the
consumption at all. Here in Denmark gas costs about $1.1 / litre. About $2.5
a gallon. And people don't drive less. They just have less cash.

Also the money doesn't go to help the enviroment at all. It just goes into
that big pile of money called tax-income and is then redistributed at will
by  government.

If government really wanted to help the enviroment, they should pass a law
where the gas companies should clean the air of the CO2 that their gas
produces.

It would not be hard to calculate the ratio gas/biomass needed to convert
the CO2 to Oxygen etc. The free market would then take care of cleaning the
air.

That way the gas companies would have to grow lots of forrests or pay
somebody to do it. Or they could change to Hydrogen if that was cheaper.

That would also give forresters money for a service they currently do for
free... cleaning the air.

Hmm, so if neobioconservatives hardwire their children for a "natural"
lifespan and add in some genetic diseases to give them a taste of the
human condition, we should applaud it? After all, things like that
will increase the range of human variation, and it may turn out that
it is actually a good idea as suggested by one of the futures
sf-stories in Nature, where a massive epidemic wiped out everybody
without Tay Sachs-genes). 

Taking risks is necessary, but taking unnecessary risks is
irrational. The same goes for genetic modifications; I really doubt
many parents would select highly risky treatments for their
children-to-be. That is not really the issue here, but how to handle
the fact that if parents select genes they might create initial
conditions that are adverse to the person that later develops. Should
there exist some form of feedback or compensation system so that
children can express their rights once they have become persons? It is
not an issue of banning certain forms of radical changes, but rather
making parents aware of the different potential costs of different
changes.

WRONG.  She saw pity as a sad and not very desirable emotion that it
would be better not to have cause to feel.  But she did not see it as
weakness or dysfunction or character flaw.   It is not desirable to
experience pity.  It is more desriable to be able to do something
positive to improve that which has illicited pity.  Pity by itself, or
any particular emotion, is not a good guide to decision and action in
objectivist thought.

Then change the nature of that reality by creating societies of
abundance.  Let any pity simply serve as a goad to move on to something
not so pitiful.

Someone once said something like "Pain is the whip of God" - meaning
that pain is the impetus to find something better, to movement.  We have
tried many things and helped in some ways and harmed in others.  So we
adjust and do something slightly different.  I don't believe that any
one thing whether science or mysticism or something else will solve
all.  We need all the science we can get welded with a really compelling
vision of where we wish to go (rather than souped up replays of where
we've been) and deep dedication to the Work.  For it is a Work in the
most time-honored sense, a work of rebuilding self and world and of
transcending all limitation possible of being transcended.  Science by
itself will not give you and sustain the sense of mission that is needed
or the sacred dream meme that will join enough people together to make a
difference.

How about this, a drug whose effects can be immediately turned off if the 
effects become unpleasant. An immediately-acting antidote to the 
psychedelic.
I know that such an antidote already exists for alcohol, and it's easy to 
see how useful it could be (like if an emergency occurs and you need to 
drive). It's kept off the market for a very good reason though. If you take 
it, you are no longer drunk, but the alcohol is still in your system, having 
damaging physiological effects. If you start drinking again you're adding to 
those physiological effects but you aren't drunk enough to know it. Someone 
could overdose on alcohol and only be feeling the mental effects of one or 
two drinks.

In some states I am the thinker, thought, that thought about, that not
thought about, that which questions what I think I am, that which you
may think is you "instead of" me.  So?  And no, I didn't put
psychotropics in the wheaties.

Sure, when so used.  I used them a fair bid in the end of the hippie
years.  At the time they were great psychological dynamite for
unraveling old structures and building new ones.  It introduced me to
the "I" within but distinct from belief, thought and personality
structure overlays.  But they are not for everyone and few know how to
use them well and most have other negativities (besides backwards laws)
against them.  At some point many, many years ago I got it that I had
gained all I could from their use and needed to integrate what I had
learned. That will probably keep me busy for many more  years.  I also
found that meditation produced much more integrated and focused effects
(though generally without the fireworks) than the psychedelics did. 
Meditation sneaks up on you differently.

The non-initiation of physical force and a well armed populace make the
rise of any fascism unlikely.  Nobody "runs the show".  Utter free

Franklin, the bacteria of life ARE bacteria, and yes, they do thrive on and in me as they
do on and in you.  They have wonderful genetic pattern integrity that has done them well
for about three billion years.  We will have to live quite long to see if any of the

Anything with a long "i" sound, e.g.:

mind -> miind
bite -> biit
live -> liiv, not to be confused with "liv", now spelled the same

Unfortunately, there are lots of words spelled with doubled vowels that
don't use the long sound (book, hoot), so completely regular spelling
wouldn't be easy to achieve. Wouldn't it be worth it, though? How much
effort and memory is wasted on memorizing the spelling of irregular words?

Yes, so what? Whole body should out of question, anyway, because
neuros offer a better brain preservation quality. I'm not interested
in keeping my reflexes alive (why, I don't expect to ever use them) if
this correlates with brain damage.

1) Annealing doesn't work. You still crack.

2) You're worried about macroscopic cracks? Dude, you're a) real old
   and/or sick b) frozen c) loaded with high-molarity cryoprotectant
   toxic crap d) dead to start with. You really should not be worrying
   about cracks.

Strong NT is not strictly necessary if you consider the uploader
route (freeze, slice, scan). But, yeah, sure, it would make things
much easier.

Why, below -130 but above -150, I would presume. Icing, that's that
thing on the cake. Don't get riled up on cracks, just because they're
nasty and visible. You should focus your worries on damage on nano and
microscale instead, which are far worse.

I don't believe that "I" am anything, as such- it's
pretty useful for not looking crazy and for talking to
other people to use the term, though.  There are
things that are "mine"... my body, my thoughts, my
room, my clothing, my stuff-in-general.

Very well put, Nicq.  The desire for continuance is one of those self fulfilling
prophecies I like to throw in the creative tautology bag.  The illusion that
some point in time is a preferred frame is very strong, and gives us the
impression that existence in the "past" is devalued.  Yet, there is no means to
break symmetry and produce a preferred frame.  If someone argues that "now" is
that frame, just wait a few minutes and ask them if they still agree with the
person they were those few minutes ago making that statement.

The separation or localization of identity is the other strong illusion.  I may
be one place/time where the Universe "sticks out" and you another, but I get the
impression you have also had a peek past the illusion.

While it might be hard to achieve genetically (overdeveloped familial
bonding systems and enhanced conflict aversiveness?) it is certainly a
emotional and memetic factor. Just look at how much people put up with
their parents (and vice versa!) today, even when there would be ample
reason to go away or even sue them. Clearly, people would not sue
their parents to the same extent as they would sue non-related people.

As I see it, we want to set up a system that supports the germline
engineering of traits that people later find useful but minimises the
engineering of traits experienced as confining without having to rely
on somebody setting global rules (which will not fit all people and
may impose bad values). The insurance-litigation system might be a
first approximation to this, but as this shows the idea needs some
development in order to work. I guess that if the main "regulating"
feature would be the pre-conception genetic insurance parents took
against future litigation from their offspring rather than the
litigation itself, then the bias against suing parents would become
less relevant and the differentiation between different changes could
still be retained.

Like an antidote (niacin works well to counteract LSD).
Or a drug could possibly be designed to antidote itself 
if the users adrenalin or pulse got too high, as often the 
cause of a "bad trip" is excessive anxiety. Much of the 
experience during the trip is directly affected by the 
users mindset and environment.

If you're truly smart, you'll only do these drugs in the right 
circumstances or not at all.

I didn't see much support for this in Medline, could it be that this
is more of a "folk remedy" that works by placebo?

Interesting idea. Suppose we add a simple receptor structure to one
end of the molecule, so that high levels of (say) adrenaline would
make it change conformation and hence not fit the receptor... I see
some problems in this, 1) getting the larger molecule past the blood
brain barrier, 2) avoiding having the receptor block the active
binding with the synaptic receptor and 3) finding useful signals of
distress that are "visible" to the molecule even when it is in an area
of the brain that does not receive (for example) adrenaline (blocked
by the BBB) or other clear signals. Sounds like rather advanced
molecular engineering, still a few years away. On the other hand, this
kind of design is definitely what pharmaceutical research is aiming
for, so the above ideal drug would be a spin-off from other research.

One possible problem with vitrification:
If we are stored at -130C, then the time in storage before our brains start 
to rot is much much less than at -196C. I think it might be only 500 years. 
That sounds like a long time, but as they time sure do slip away.

I don't see that as a problem. What interests me is the general
behavior of how technologies spread, not the exact whys and wherefores
of why technology A was adopted rather than tech B and if the reverse
could have been true (although that is interesting too).

I would say there is a difference between technological determinism
and the existence of autonomous devices. There is a difference between
technology (the knowledge and practice base) and the agents that use
technology - even if they are a product of it.  The determinist
position essentially says technology will develop with no or little
influence from other aspects of society, economics, luck, individual
agents etc. If machines can self-develop, I would say they definitely
should be viewed as individual agents (and quite likely parts of
society, economy and politics, regardless of their formal status as
machines). 

As an example, Eliezers self-transcending AI is not deterministic in
the technological determinism sense, what it does and what it becomes
is highly uncertain and likely quite sensitive to initial conditions
such as programmed core values. A technological determinist position
would be that once (say) AI has been developed certain other things
will by necessity be developed beyond that, regardless of the
circumstances of how AI came about. I don't buy that position - each
new technology enables many others, but which ones are implemented and
grow large depends on many other factors than just capability.

All environments are mental constructs .. sense data isn't direct.
"The world is located in consciousness" (Kuhlenbeck).
Our (E-1) brain generates a phantom median eye out of the same
action potential/ neural information that carries generic sense-data ...
this is the ONLY explanation of consciousness that squares Leibnitz' Law.

You sound like a conventionalist, human-been philosophy student now ...
"game" is just a metaphor. Perhaps you should qualify by saying "reality is
LIKE a game" ..
but I would still disagree. Sure, a playful attitude is often a good thing
though.

1) Post-human
2) Bodhisattva (fully-enlightened being)
3) Grandmaster Hodos Sphenodon (magus, games programmer)
4) Steve Nichols (when have to visit the shops and pay my taxes)

By rehearsal and constant practice, we become more like the think
we pretend to be, but they are all "thought-constructs" still.
It is just a case of finding our most accurate/ comfortable option.
All these roles are subject to change ... the point is we should aim
to become "more than human." Immortality is earnt, not given.

Easy answer: I don't know. Difficult answer: it's hard to say, but assuming
you live on average 20 years (i.e. you live until 85) I would say that might
be enough time (say a 50% chance) for us to know what causes aging and
develop a few products to significantly delay it. Of course that there is
the additional problem of you being too old -- i.e. 85 -- to be treated (the
first anti-aging treatments might be much more effective if started earlier
in life than later, there are arguments on both sides), but this is
speculatory.

Best wishes.

Lynn Allen-Hoffmann of the University of Wisconsin in Madison noticed something
strange in a petri dish containing a very old line of human keratinocyte cells, that is,
skin cells. The cells had divided so often that all should be dead by now and most
were but a very few had by pure chance undergone a spontaneous mutation of
some sort and appeared perfectly healthy and immortal, at least there is no sign
of them dying or turning cancerous so far, and that's far more cell divisions than
most thought possible. Allen-Hoffmann has started a company called "Stratatech"
to commercialize this lucky mutation.

I just submitted the following letter to the Salon editor, responding to:
http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/11/16/election_prediction/index.html


Not Every Error is a Failure

If the newspaper forecasts sun, but it rains on your parade, does that mean 
you should never again read their forecast?  Of course not.  If you can 
find a more reliable source of forecasts, you should switch.  But if not, 
you should make do with the best source you can find, even if it is 
sometimes in error.

Recently the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) only assigned a 30% chance to 
Gore winning the popular vote.  Dalton Conley thus suggests that economists 
to go back to the drawing board, and retract their claim that such markets 
consistently predict elections better than opinion polls and other 
forecasting institutions.   But this is no better than rejecting the 
weatherman because it rained once on your forecasted-sunny parade.

Can Conley indentify a source of forecasts he thinks will more reliably 
predict the next presidential election results?  If so, I'll bet him $100 
that the IEM forecast will do at least as well.   If not, he's just 
complaining about the rain.

<<WRONG.  She saw pity as a sad and not very desirable emotion that it

weakness or dysfunction or character flaw.   It is not desirable to
experience pity.  It is more desriable to be able to do something
positive to improve that which has illicited pity.  Pity by itself, or
any particular emotion, is not a good guide to decision and action in

The funny thing I see about this view of Pity is that it appears

No disagreement here. But people who are pitiless, frequently contribute 
nothing to the commanality of the human experience. That state is also 
non-scientific, but it sure is experiential. My experiences anyway.

Max More said:

"I would say that 45 minutes of strongly aerobic exercise five times a week is excessive. I think you can get virtually the same health benefit from 
around 25 minutes four times a week, with far less free radical formation."

There are an incredible number of supplements that claim to reduce the negative side effects of hard exercise.  Are there any that you can specifically recommend, or any sources of really good info?

"Weight-training/bodybuilding when done sensibly improves glucose metabolism and insulin response, lowers blood sugar (=less glycosylation) and reduces 
risk of diseases (including diabetes), maintains or restores bone mass (very important as you age, *especially* for women reaching menopause), and 
improves the sense of well-being (more than aerobic exercise)."

I do maximum output nautilus instead of weights - partially because I have a literal host of old joint injuries in virtually every part of my body, with accompanying osteoarthritus.  Nautilus allows me to better control exactly how I'm exerting myself.  

On the other hand, your better aerobics classes force you to learn new systems of coordination and motion patterns, which have the effect of telling your body that it needs to grow to match demand in those areas.  I had a doctor tell me in the late '60's that I should switch from swimming to basketball because swimming didn't stress or shock my joints enough to induce growth of cartilege, ect. 

That kind of stress placed on the body - shocks to joints, for example - can be either negative or positive, or both.  Again, the body responds to stress by growth when possible.  As the body ages, however, it becomes a fine line between matching stress-induced growth against damage, immediate or cumulative.  I've managed to create several long-term skeletal/musculature problems through overstraining.  Also, I've noticed that I can fairly quickly build up tremendous strength in a particular muscle set, reach a peak, and then plateau, and finally I will start losing strength.  So I try to switch around every few months.

"Improved physical strength may save your life in some circumstances and is useful in many more situations. Given that caloric restriction with good nutrition is life-extending, muscle building has the extremely important benefit of giving you tissue to burn in an emergency if you don't have the fat. I've seen friends lose 30-50 lbs very quickly in hospital. If you're 
calorically restricted and have neither body fat nor muscle tissue, a medical emergency could just kill you."

I recently watched a friend who appeared to be the picture of good middle-aged health, muscular, active, energetic, a real bear of a man, who had been taking all the supplements, etc., age 20 years in a couple of weeks when the high-dose aspirin he had been taking to deal with chronic pain from a serious accident (he was run over) ate a massive hole in his stomache.  (He is a professional chemist, BTW, who could quote from the literature as to the exact chemical pathways involved with various supplements, so it was not a matter of ignorance, but perceived necessity that got him in trouble.)

I believe he had to have the equivalent of a couple of total transfusions just to deal with blood loss.  If you saw him before and after, you would have assumed that at least 20 years had intervened.  It was really scary.  Fortunately, he did have the extra 40 pounds or so of mass to draw upon, or I really doubt he could have survived.  

"(Mine are 30-40 minutes, including plenty of rest between sets. But when I do a set, I'm working at 
peak capacity.)"

I switch to either stretching, yoga, or my own version of dancercize between sets of sets.  I use various objects, currently a couple of bean bags and a soft rubber ball, and practice coordination, speed and flexibility exercises as my warmup or between-sets break.  I can now throw three objects into the air and fairly reliably catch all three with one hand - with my eyes closed the whole time.  

It's taken me about three years to get to that point, but as I've worked out these kind of exercises I notice that I don't drop things very often any more, and when something falls, I tend to snatch it out of the air, whereas before I would just let it fall, as I knew from sad experience that if I tried to catch it, I would probably just knock two other things down.

This illustrates one of the real weaknesses in the state of exercise as practiced in the typical health spas.  The spa personnel tend to look at me like I'm crazy as I'm dancing around with my eyes shut, snatching multiple objects out of mid air, but they don't have a single class that really develops coordination on that level.  

Worse yet, they don't have ANY interactive exercises that require development of reflexes.  I know that my exercises, as demanding of my coordination as they are, are still a deterministic system.  I'm learning how to predict trajectories at best, but since I'm doing the throwing, it comes down to really learning cues from my own muscles more than really dealing with the actual trajectories of the flying objects.  If I had a partner to throw stuff back and forth, then I could go to another level, but everyone else seems locked into their own solipsistic world with their weights or machine.

On the other hand, people are always looking for the next thing in exercise, and several very successful local spas have become hot by introducing new fads (all of which I orginally suggested a decade or two ago) such as dancercise, Indian dancercise, "kick-boxing" (but non-interactive, and often taught by people who are actually clueless about real martial arts), water exercises, or internet exercise bikes.  If anyone out there is interested, I would love to be involved in setting up and/or managing a spa that went beyond the hype and actually provided an optimized physical training experience.  I think it could make a lot of money as well.

One other thing that I've really noticed is that if I get into a positive interaction with a female while I'm exercising (and if it doesn't seg into an endless talk session), then my energy level goes up immediatly by about 100%.  I'm curious if that also applies to women?  Do they also get a hormonal rush, and a boost to their routine?  If so, how could that be worked into a spa experience in a non-threatening manner?  

I.e., how to get around the fact that women almost universally treat any interaction with them as a special privilege which should be paid for?  Sometimes I wish that I lived in one the more natural cultures, like I've occasionally run into in rural Mexico, where women didn't craftilly measure every gram of emotion they allowed a man to see.  

Our neo-puritanical, ultra-competitive culture with its amazing corollary commodification of sex has its costs, I suspect, in the general health and well-being of all the participants.  Both men and women are built with hormonal feedback loops that are largely blocked or channeled into rigid and stultifying paths by our culture.

That alone might work, if packaged properly, to sell a new health-spa idea.  After all, there has been recent research showing a positive link between sex and longevity.  Dr. Phil's Sex Spa and Nautilus Experience....  ?

New information... exercise program modified accordingly.

What I want, actually, is to *now* build a reasonably healthy physique
that will *later* be easily maintainable (30 minutes 3 times per week, or
whatever) and that won't vanish in a flash if I stop exercising for a
week.  I'm guessing that means maximize muscle growth now with 8-10 reps
per set (which is what I have now started doing), then switch to 15 reps
per set when I think it's time to start getting ready for the transition
to "maintenance".  Right?

Actually, I'm currently trying to keep in the range of about 1250 calories
per day, and have already gone from over 220 pounds to 190.  Is it
reasonable to try and build muscle and lose fat at the same time, or is it
just outright impossible?  I got the impression it was reasonable.

What worries me, at the moment, is that whenever I miss two days of
exercise, I seem to drop two pounds.  Does this have something to do with
water retention or is it "easy come, easy go" muscle mass?

(Incidentally, no, I'm not taking any anti-oxidants.  While ordinarily a
fan of not setting yourself up for a catastrophe if the Singularity
happens later than expected, a 21-year-old taking anti-oxidants would be
going much too far.  Unless my impressions are mistaken and anti-oxidants
have immediate health benefits?)

Again, you're simply abstracting the issue one level.  Fine: the retention
of the notion of limitation IS the limitation.  THAT'S what we need to strip
away.  You wanna crawl up to the -next- level?  (No, no Jason, it's the
retention of the -belief- in the -notion- of limitation that is the
limitation, etc.)

In any case, observationally your belief is clearly wrong-- or do you not
see millions of ongoing examples of individual humans falling prey to
limiting belief structures?

I agree.  You're going to make me do this again, ain'tcha?  Okay...
Environments have decreased relevancy to our existence is we don't actually
get to "mentally interface" with them.

I don't think you're getting what I'm getting at, but that's probably
because I haven't expended enough effort.  If you're persistent enough, you
might coax a moderate rant out of me on the subject.  There is a Lost Tribe
track called Gamemaster (used more famously by Mr. Paul Oakenfold,) that
points at the concept, but is (somewhat unfortunately) shrouded in some
mystical-druid-earth-goddess mumbo jumbo.

I'm not directly referrencing some core truth of reality, but rather
remarking on an empowering means by which we might consider interfacing with
it.  I'm not talking Rocket Science (tm) here either-- simply: a) be aware
of how we are capable of interacting with reality, and b) take advantage of
it to optimise our existence.

If "pretending" to be those things adds observable value to your existence,
and aids in achieving certain goals, then I say go for it.  (Premises which
are, perhaps, debatable.)

If, however, this entity we call "me" or "I" is in the category of
phenomena which are real but not material (like the vacuum of space), then
we have an amazing condition of something physical (a genetic pattern,
etc.) living under overall control of an entity which is not physical. So
I guess the agar jelly analogy breaks down.

"I" am of the same opinion. "I" also think that if we spend too much time
trying to find out what this "I" really is, we could go crazy. In his
book, "Miracle in the Void", Astronaut/Physicist Brian O'Leary identifies
consciousness with the void of space. I suppose that is what "cosmic
consciousness" philosophers have said for thousands of years. If we accept
that theory then what are we to make of a project I came across the other
day? NASA funded; half a dozen PHD physicists trying to develop the
prototype of an engine which will "squeeze" energy (something) out of the
void of space (nothing). But it does start to sound really crazy if you
say you are trying to squeeze energy out of the void of consciousness. 
Not that I would say this about O'Leary. I admire his work and the book is
a good read. You could purchase it via <oleary@maui.net>.

Charter of Fundamental Rights of EU
[Adopted by EU Parliament, november 2000, the 14th]

                        *Please read article 3 (and 13)*

PREAMBLE

The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union among them, are
resolved to share a peaceful future based on common values. Conscious of its
spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible,
universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is
based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. It places the
individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship
of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.

The Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these
common values while respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions
of the peoples of Europe as well as the national identities of the Member
States and the organisation of their public authorities at national,
regional and local levels; it seeks to promote balanced and sustainable
development and ensures free movement of persons, goods, services and
capital, and the freedom of establishment. To this end, it is necessary to
strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes in
society, social progress and scientific and technological developments by
making those rights more visible in a Charter.

This Charter reaffirms, with due regard for the powers and tasks of the
Community and the Union and the principle of subsidiarity, the rights as
they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and
international obligations common to the Member States, the Treaty on
European Union, the Community Treaties, the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters
adopted by the Community and by the Council of Europe and the case law of
the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the European Court
of Human Rights.

Enjoyment of these rights entails responsibilities and duties with regard to
other persons, to the human community and to future generations.

The Union therefore recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out
hereafter.

or the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties.


Article 52
Scope of guaranteed rights
1.  Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by
this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those
rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality,
limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet
objectives of general interest recognized by the Union or the need to
protect the rights and freedoms of others.
2.  Rights recognised by this Charter which are based on the Community
Treaties or the Treaty on European Union shall be exercised under the
conditions and within the limits defined by those Treaties.

guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the
same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not
prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.


Article 53
Level of protection
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as restricting or adversely
affecting human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognised, in their

international agreements to which the Union, the Community or all the Member

Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and by the Member States'
constitutions.

Article 54

some might argue that the effect of psychoactives, as they exist today, would be more predictable if there were some standards used in the manufacturing or marketing of them. for example, when one buys a supplement at a nutrition store, the contents of the product are on the packaging in terms of type and weight. 

informed use of psychedelics, in terms of knowledge of actual substances to be ingested, the amounts, and the date of manufacture, would clear up much of the ambiguity that can surround the ingestion of psychedelics. furthermore, this ambiguity, itself, negatively contributes to a user's mindset going in to a trip. 

leary noted, and i support his hypothesis, that a trip is influenced by one's set and setting (when all other variables are controlled for). set refers to mindset and setting refers to environmental settings. if one can control for things like adulteration of the supposed substance and potency, then all that has to be worked on before a trip is one's set and setting. of course, i would not disagree with the statement that individuals experiencing or predisposed to psychosis or severe neurosis should avoid psychedelics unless they are tripping with an experienced guide or therapist (similar to the experiments done with lsd-25 in treating alcoholics in baltimore, maryland 40 years ago). 

i can confidently say that i have not had a bad trip, or known people who have had a bad trip, when taking into account set and setting and when the psychedelic ingested has been locally researched and judged for it's potency prior to ingestion. (it could really suck to be the first local to make such a judgment on a new batch of a psychedelic; however, if the source/manufacturer is consistent between batches this can and should be minimized.)

the closest i have come to a system that provides such needed information to psychedelic users is in holland where i purchased psilocybin mushrooms at a smart drug/drink store by weight, knowing how long the product had been in storage since being harvested, knowing subjectively how potent the "batch" was, and knowing that the product had been refrigerated since being harvested. this made for a rather predictable trip since i was able to choose an appropriate setting and went into the trip with an appropriate mindset.

lastly, my observations and research of mdma have led me to conclude that 1)it can have psychedelic effects and 2)the effects are predictable in a diverse population. the only variables that probably need to be controlled for are dosage by weight and, again, mindset. while it is harder to have a negative experience on mdma because of mindset than lsd-25, i have been with individuals who have not had an empathic, ecstatic experience while on mdma. the experience was by no means negative, but it wasn't similar to the experiences of others who ingested mdma from the same batch. of course, maybe they received an improper dosage.

the bottom line(s): psychedelic trips may only be as predictible as we make them, and psychedelics can immensely increase extropic thought and open-mindedness!

Hello everyone,

I have been away from the net for the last week and it feels so good to be back and reading the many excellent posts which expand my horizons.  

To my shock I read on cryonet how Alcor now has a solid grasp of vitrification technology!  This has been seen almost as the "holy grail" of cryonics for a long time, though I have read the problem has always been with minimizing toxicity levels which can be as threatening as the other nemesis of cryonics- fracturing damage from conventional freezing.

I wonder what the views are here regarding just how impressive this upgrade in cryonics technology is?  Is this the perfected vitrification that has been so sought after?  With only reversible suspended animation being for now beyond our reach...

One concern on cryonet is that a vitrified brain would fracture if stored in conventional liquid nitrogen dewars due to the extremely cold temperatures maintained.  They have wondered if this could be as bad in it's own way as microfracturing which occurs with conventional methods used now.

Perhaps a "dewar within a dewar" could help to protect a vitrified head or body.  I realize this would create a challenge to Alcor designers and also raise storage costs.

Still, the news from Alcor is extremely exciting.  Despite the monetary limitations faced by the cryonics community it is clear the work has been moving forward very impressively.

best wishes to all,

John Grigg

Max and other weight trainers,

What would you recommend for someone who wants to start light weight
training in terms of equipment, frequency of workouts, duration of workouts,
supplements, etc?

I'm 40, about 220 lbs at 6'--so bulking isn't much of a concern. I'm in
decent shape because I do karate regularly. I live in the sticks, so working
out at a gym isn't an option.

Is it safe to work out with free weights without a partner, or do I need to
stretch rubber bands or something?

-Dave

navisad is a real BAD worm!!!! I received it from another list.

This was not an easy worm to get rid of. The happy99 was a piece of cake by
comparison. Even with the symantec info I could not get it off my system
with out a lot of telephone help from an expert on campus this afternoon who
walked me through the manual process that differed from the symantec info in
key ways.

Can the listserver be set NOT to forward attachments. A lot are set up that
way just to prevent these problems. If someone has a info to be included it
could be pasted in the message or put on a web site for safer access. I have
the auto launch feature turned off and use an earlier mail program and still
got hit.

The average computer user will most likely have to resort to expensive
computer consultants. I was lucky that we have these experts on our campus.

Best Ralph

If anyone is in the Los Angeles valley area I can recommend an excellent
personal trainer that has done wonders for me in three years. My doctor
insisted I start an exercise program three years ago and I knew from several
previous abortive attempts I could not do it on my own. Bryan is a great
trainer and I have gotten great results as his client. If you are not in Los
Angeles he can also be consulted on building a home gym etc. 

His WEB page is:

http://www.ultimatefitness.net/

Dave, I don't know where you live but, I think there are Gold's or World's
gyms in most places in the US at least. 

>From my own experience i would highly recommend starting with a personal
trainer  to get form correct.

Dear Fellow Extropians,

I think we are all symbiotically linked... I was so fed up with work today, I 
wrote a LOOOONG email to myself ranting about so many things just mentioned 
in some of these e-mailsl! Just for kicks, I am sending you the unedited, 
highly tangled, stream of conciousness version (please excuse the format, I 
hope it is at least interesting and resonant)! Once I sort everything I was 
talking about into logical sections, maybe I will write a book or 
something... I don't want to look like any more of a lunatic than I already 
am!

Peace and forward movement,

Brian Shores
---------------------------------
RAGE AGAINST BIOLOGY - PART 1

WHY?!? EVERYTHING we do revolves around supporting this shell! I am not
saying that the human body is not an amazing and wonderful machine, but
GEEZ! The maintenance! Why do we work? To make money to support the
maintenance of our bodies so we don't DIE. Imagine how much more we could
accomplish if we did not have to sleep, (INSOMNIA IS A BLESSING to me) feed
ourselves, keep ourselves warm and dry, and generally maintain our bodily
health. Look at all the money that is there that can be used in so many
better ways! Housing, food, cosmetics, healthcare, and CRIPES! INSURANCE!
Nanotech is the solution. I wish my mind was able to consciously function
24/7. That is not to say that dreams are not important to me, because they
certainly are, but I just wish I could have them any time I wanted. Sure,
the advances we make in healthcare are going to enable us to live longer,
but I am waiting for the total solution. Maybe it will never come. Given the
way things are right now that will be a likely case. I am an optimist, but
the majority of people in the world are bound up by tradition, religious
dogma, stupidity, and lack of knowledge that is a MAJOR obstacle for the
really intelligent people to get the work they need to do done for the good
of humanity. How many wars are fought over property, religion, ideals that
cannot be justified using logic? Maybe it has to do with what is our purpose
here on earth? To me, what makes me is my thoughts and my mind, whatever
that might be definition-wise I leave that up to the experts. I want to work
on things that will directly help humanity get past this shell of biology,
but I am mired in the mundane every day. My mind cannot function fast enough
to absorb all the knowledge I want, and my fingers can't type fast enough to
get the ideas in my head out. There has got to be a faster way. I will be
first in line for a chip implant right into my brain. The more thinking
power I have at my disposal, the more interactions I can have with others,
the richer my life experience becomes. Sharing thoughts, ideas, experiences,
and the creative process are what I crave constantly. Sleep only impedes
that desire. Communications have come a long way but they are still
primative and open to many faults such as misinterpretation and interference
of all kinds. If the data was passed directly there would be far less
interpretation problems, let alone the increase in speed. You dont have to
worry about answering the phone or email being down because the
communication is in the very air we breathe moving the speed of light.
Taking the visions in my head and actually producing them in front of me,
without having to worry about the nuances of the interface to hinder me. A
thought processor/interpreter that can instantly produce the mind's vision
to the last detail, and modifying it at the speed of thought, with all the
corresponding technical details filled in just through the INTENT of the
user's thoughts. Hopefully, life does not get boring enough that we WANT to
die. Always serving the lowest common denominator. People like to feel
good. Drugs, food, sex. Its all a measure of how happy we are with our
lives. Time forces us to do things with a sense of urgency. It is our
biggest enemy versus biology. If we had unlimited time to do things, we could
experience everything... even experiencing multiple things at once. So one
can be lazy and also do computational physics at the same time, sort of like
a computer multitasking. That is assuming that the machines don't do the
hard thinking for us, which in that case I dont think that we will ever make
them powerful enough that human brains become "obsolete" in one sense of the
word (intuition, creative process, true creativity and ingenuity).
Development in paralell of human/machine interfaces will happen. New ways of 
interacting will become available. Biology is a prison. If we
weren't concerned with SURVIVAL any more, what would we do? Most humans
today would probably sit around and become couch potatoes, VR Junkies,
druggies, whatever. But what if we could channel all that extra energy into
something truly useful and great? Make our mark on the universe, so to
speak. Idle talk never gets anyone anywhere. Where are all the movers and
shakers? The really good stuff is yet to come, and it is going to take a
looong time for it to get realized. Maybe I am just impatient. All that
capital sitting out there in the hands of professional atheletes and
eccentric millionaires... why don't these people do something that will
directly affect their fellow human being's condition? Hell, someone like
Bill Gates could EASILY build and ship pre-fab housing to areas where
needed, and greenhouses, hydroponics, what4ever is needed, but NOOO he would
rather shell out 42 million for a custom built home. That makes me sick when
I hear about human suffering. If I had the money, you couldn't STOP me from
doing something! Show the friggin aborigenes and rain forest tribes what the
rest of the world is up to... break everyone out of this mystical belief
that "god" will make everything ok. That is such an irrational way of
looking at the world it makes me sick. Instead of taking your family to
church, how about doing something meaningful with them? Irrational fear of
death and hell has hampered FAR too many people in this world. It is time
for a real change. We do not live in the middle ages anymore. Instead of
having faith in something you can't see, have faith in people... the here
and now... hope... no... BELIEVE that the future will be bright and the
motivation to help make it that way. We need to embrace our knowledge and
discard the petty. Racisim, bigotry, hatred... we are all soooo far above
that. What is the point in it except to waste valueable and useful resources
(minds). We will never get there if we continue this self-destructive,
ignorant, stupid, childish behavior. The time for humanity to grow up is way
overdue. Our governments have as much to do with this as do each of us
individually. Look at the difference in military spending versus say,
humanitarian programs or space exploration. We are focussing on the WRONG
things! Why the hell can't McDonald's be part of the solutiion instead of
being one of the leaders in our nation's health problems! Once again, human
greed takes over. People prefer convenience over health. People live very
shortsighted lives. Most of us only focus on the here and now, our immediate
situation and environment. We are killing our own environment on the outside
and ouselves from the inside. Is it really so hard to use alternative energy
sources? AGAIN, the almighty buck rules. Oil companies and nations, auto
manufacturers, and others who rely heavily on petrochemicals have the world
in a self-destructive pattern. WHY IS THIS? WHY should we have to stand by
and watch us destroy ourselves? The human race needs an "intervention", just
like a drug addict. We need a wake-up call before it is too late and we
can't go back. Fighting biology, destroying what we are is not the solution.
Finding the keys to how things work is part of the solution, but its
people's attitudes that are the hardest part to change. If everyone had a
bright view of what the future will be, a common vision, maybe it wouldn't
be so hard. But like I said before, people are self-centered. There is no
global human view. War is usually something we read about in the paper.
Everything is trivialized by the media. No wonder we can't agree on
anything! The truth about ourselves is too painful to face or too difficult
to see through all the spin. People don't listen to eachother. Moreover,
they can't filter out the real facts from their own feelings and individual
perceptions. How do we get to that common vision? I don't know. Maybe
science and philosophy has some good ideas about it. The closest I have seen
so far is the Transhumanists and Extropians. We need to switch from passive
to active mode. We need our voices heard and we need people to see the truth
about ourselves. We need to come together and drop all the bullshit and
actually DO something! At the very least, let's take care of our fellow
human beings by combining our resources and making a direct change of things
we see wrong in the world every day. I am all for free speech and
expression, but "god dammit!" enough is enough! Maybe we should just go
around and exterminate all the people we find repulsive (yeah right!). It's 
an extreme
view, and I do not condone it at all, but if there was a way to get rid of
the troublemakers, a way to show them the light of humanity and it's
potential, well then what are we waiting for? Stupid people shouldn't breed.
Don't have kids you can't afford just to get a welfare check. It brings us
all down. For most people everything I am saying is stating the obvious. But
then WHY are we so stuck? Sure technology is moving along at a blinding
pace. But what are we going to do with it all besides count our stacks of
greenbacks and fight over who has the patent on the human genome? Is the
human race doomed to bicker forever among itself? Hey, a little bit of
tension is a good thing of course, it helps stimulate ideas. But hell, let's
all at least get on the same page here! Do we REALLY need all those shades of

REALLY need a 50,000 dollar SUV that only gets 15 miles per gallon when there 
are cars that will get 300? The worlds most basic and simple problems we 
STILL can't fix! WHY??? "Feed the people... who don't have enough to eat,

That's funny. I always pictured you to be around 5'7, 130 pounds. Sort of a

Dear Extropes,


In the January 2001 Sky and Telescope magazine, pg 56-63, you will
find the following article:

"Dusty Phenomena in the Solar System"
by Amara Graps and Antal Juhasz

It should be appearing in the magazine stands in the U.S. in the next
days or week. (non-U.S., approximately one month later).

Quick Summary:

This article gives a description of dust phenomena in the solar
system: what is detected, where it comes from, where it goes, and what
physics govern the dust particles' behavior. Some interesting
phenomena such as dust levitation, Saturn's B ring spokes, Jupiter's
ring halo, and comet dust tails are described (words, pictures).

I include some charming dust poetry written by our own Tanya Jones
(Foresight Institute).

I was told by the magazine senior editor that it's the first time he's
seen this topic so thoroughly treated in the popular press.  This is
my first venture into the "big" popular science magazine arena.  I
hope that you like it.


Amara

P.S. One item I discuss in my article is a piece of news for many: 

A meteor radar station in New Zealand, the Advanced Meteor Orbit Radar
station, has been collecting data of about 1000 radar meteors per day,
of which 2 per day are interstellar in origin (not bound to the
Sun). After some years of collecting data, there is enough data
(thousands of detections) to show that one clear source of the
interstellar dust particles (about 40 microns in size) is the nearby
star beta Pictoris.

My $.25 Dave.

Buy yourself a good bench, one that also allows for inclines is
nice, you can probably find a used one in the newspaper. Then all
you need is some weights. Since your alone, I'd buy individual
(hand) barbells. Pick a pair that you can just curl about 8-10
times to start. These will suit for a variety of exercises. You can
buy adjustables, but you'll find you use them less.

Arnold's book on bodybuilding is updated and re-released in
softcover, it should be readily available. It's THE bible and is
full of good advise on all aspects of weightlifting including
nutrition. A must have.

Skip rubberbands and other gimicks, working out with hand barbells
alone is safe, do not use a standard (York) benchpress alone.

>Right?

Lifting heavy weights with 4-6 reps will build size quickly,
lifting light weights with 12 or more reps will build more
endurance. Note that you are exercising different muscle fibers
with each of these (slow/fast twitch). I find moderate to heavy
weights, 10-12 reps, is a good compromise. To build mass you'll
need at least three workouts a week. Once you get to the size you
want you can maintain with as little as one workout (weights) a
week. You should of course continue with cardiovascular work at
least 30 minutes 3 times a week. Note that if you break up the
cardio into 3 ten minutes sessions you still get 95% of the effect
according to recent tests.

If you eat too few calories (you are) your body will start
consuming its own hard won nuscle tissue. You especially want to
get enough protein. The trick is to continue to eat healthy, but
cut out the junk, especially fast carbo's (basically anything with
white sugar/flour).

You're eating too few calories to be building mass. It's probably
partly water, but it is possibly also your body consuming extra
calories. There is an order to which the body consumes calories,
alcohol is first, carbos, then protein, fat is last. :(

Anti-oxidants have immediate benefits. You want to prevent damage
to already healthy systems. You don't have to get crazy with
supplements. Take a very good multivitamin, augment it with some
extra C (1000mg a day, I take 2000) 400 I.U of E, and make sure you
get at least 400mcg of folate (especially female extropians).

The Life Extension Foundations basic supplement (with the booster)
is an excellent protocol.


By the way, thanks for the file (navidad.exe).

Ah! Brian, you have just experienced the awareness of the human and natural 
condition. The hope is that Intelligence will fix the problems that occur and 
perhaps, even repair those that have already happended.
This change is the nature of nature may take a very, very, long time. Or it 
may be merely a view centuries if the Singularitians have their way.

The mending of the world is a task that will take many lifetimes, but that 
does not remove the responsibility from you. -Talmud

---------------------------------
RAGE AGAINST BIOLOGY - PART 1

WHY?!? EVERYTHING we do revolves around supporting this shell! I am not
saying that the human body is not an amazing and wonderful machine, but
GEEZ! The maintenance! Why do we work? To make money to support the
maintenance of our bodies so we don't DIE. Imagine how much more we could
accomplish if we did not have to sleep, (INSOMNIA IS A BLESSING to me) feed
ourselves, keep ourselves warm and dry, and generally maintain our bodily
health. Look at all the money that is there that can be used in so many
better ways! Housing, food, cosmetics, healthcare, and CRIPES! INSURANCE!
Nanotech is the solution. I wish my mind was able to consciously function
24/7. That is not to say that dreams are not important to me, because they
certainly are, but I just wish I could have them any time I wanted. Sure,
the advances we make in healthcare are going to enable us to live longer,
but I am waiting for the total solution. Maybe it will never come. Given the
way things are right now that will be a likely case. I am an optimist, but
the majority of people in the world are bound up by tradition, religious
dogma, stupidity, and lack of knowledge that is a MAJOR obstacle for the
really intelligent people to get the work they need to do done for the good
of humanity. How many wars are fought over property, religion, ideals that
cannot be justified using logic? Maybe it has to do with what is our purpose
here on earth? To me, what makes me is my thoughts and my mind, whatever
that might be definition-wise I leave that up to the experts. I want to work
on things that will directly help humanity get past this shell of biology,
but I am mired in the mundane every day. My mind cannot function fast enough
to absorb all the knowledge I want, and my fingers can't type fast enough to
get the ideas in my head out. There has got to be a faster way. I will be
first in line for a chip implant right into my brain. The more thinking
power I have at my disposal, the more interactions I can have with others,
the richer my life experience becomes. Sharing thoughts, ideas, experiences,
and the creative process are what I crave constantly. Sleep only impedes
that desire. Communications have come a long way but they are still
primative and open to many faults such as misinterpretation and interference
of all kinds. If the data was passed directly there would be far less
interpretation problems, let alone the increase in speed. You dont have to
worry about answering the phone or email being down because the
communication is in the very air we breathe moving the speed of light.
Taking the visions in my head and actually producing them in front of me,
without having to worry about the nuances of the interface to hinder me. A
thought processor/interpreter that can instantly produce the mind's vision
to the last detail, and modifying it at the speed of thought, with all the
corresponding technical details filled in just through the INTENT of the
user's thoughts. Hopefully, life does not get boring enough that we WANT to
die. Always serving the lowest common denominator. People like to feel
good. Drugs, food, sex. Its all a measure of how happy we are with our
lives. Time forces us to do things with a sense of urgency. It is our
biggest enemy versus biology. If we had unlimited time to do things, we could
experience everything... even experiencing multiple things at once. So one
can be lazy and also do computational physics at the same time, sort of like
a computer multitasking. That is assuming that the machines don't do the
hard thinking for us, which in that case I dont think that we will ever make
them powerful enough that human brains become "obsolete" in one sense of the
word (intuition, creative process, true creativity and ingenuity).
Development in paralell of human/machine interfaces will happen. New ways of 
interacting will become available. Biology is a prison. If we
weren't concerned with SURVIVAL any more, what would we do? Most humans
today would probably sit around and become couch potatoes, VR Junkies,
druggies, whatever. But what if we could channel all that extra energy into
something truly useful and great? Make our mark on the universe, so to
speak. Idle talk never gets anyone anywhere. Where are all the movers and
shakers? The really good stuff is yet to come, and it is going to take a
looong time for it to get realized. Maybe I am just impatient. All that
capital sitting out there in the hands of professional atheletes and
eccentric millionaires... why don't these people do something that will
directly affect their fellow human being's condition? Hell, someone like
Bill Gates could EASILY build and ship pre-fab housing to areas where
needed, and greenhouses, hydroponics, what4ever is needed, but NOOO he would
rather shell out 42 million for a custom built home. That makes me sick when
I hear about human suffering. If I had the money, you couldn't STOP me from
doing something! Show the friggin aborigenes and rain forest tribes what the
rest of the world is up to... break everyone out of this mystical belief
that "god" will make everything ok. That is such an irrational way of
looking at the world it makes me sick. Instead of taking your family to
church, how about doing something meaningful with them? Irrational fear of
death and hell has hampered FAR too many people in this world. It is time
for a real change. We do not live in the middle ages anymore. Instead of
having faith in something you can't see, have faith in people... the here
and now... hope... no... BELIEVE that the future will be bright and the
motivation to help make it that way. We need to embrace our knowledge and
discard the petty. Racisim, bigotry, hatred... we are all soooo far above
that. What is the point in it except to waste valueable and useful resources
(minds). We will never get there if we continue this self-destructive,
ignorant, stupid, childish behavior. The time for humanity to grow up is way
overdue. Our governments have as much to do with this as do each of us
individually. Look at the difference in military spending versus say,
humanitarian programs or space exploration. We are focussing on the WRONG
things! Why the hell can't McDonald's be part of the solutiion instead of
being one of the leaders in our nation's health problems! Once again, human
greed takes over. People prefer convenience over health. People live very
shortsighted lives. Most of us only focus on the here and now, our immediate
situation and environment. We are killing our own environment on the outside
and ouselves from the inside. Is it really so hard to use alternative energy
sources? AGAIN, the almighty buck rules. Oil companies and nations, auto
manufacturers, and others who rely heavily on petrochemicals have the world
in a self-destructive pattern. WHY IS THIS? WHY should we have to stand by
and watch us destroy ourselves? The human race needs an "intervention", just
like a drug addict. We need a wake-up call before it is too late and we
can't go back. Fighting biology, destroying what we are is not the solution.
Finding the keys to how things work is part of the solution, but its
people's attitudes that are the hardest part to change. If everyone had a
bright view of what the future will be, a common vision, maybe it wouldn't
be so hard. But like I said before, people are self-centered. There is no
global human view. War is usually something we read about in the paper.
Everything is trivialized by the media. No wonder we can't agree on
anything! The truth about ourselves is too painful to face or too difficult
to see through all the spin. People don't listen to eachother. Moreover,
they can't filter out the real facts from their own feelings and individual
perceptions. How do we get to that common vision? I don't know. Maybe
science and philosophy has some good ideas about it. The closest I have seen
so far is the Transhumanists and Extropians. We need to switch from passive
to active mode. We need our voices heard and we need people to see the truth
about ourselves. We need to come together and drop all the bullshit and
actually DO something! At the very least, let's take care of our fellow
human beings by combining our resources and making a direct change of things
we see wrong in the world every day. I am all for free speech and
expression, but "god dammit!" enough is enough! Maybe we should just go
around and exterminate all the people we find repulsive (yeah right!). It's 
an extreme
view, and I do not condone it at all, but if there was a way to get rid of
the troublemakers, a way to show them the light of humanity and it's
potential, well then what are we waiting for? Stupid people shouldn't breed.
Don't have kids you can't afford just to get a welfare check. It brings us
all down. For most people everything I am saying is stating the obvious. But
then WHY are we so stuck? Sure technology is moving along at a blinding
pace. But what are we going to do with it all besides count our stacks of
greenbacks and fight over who has the patent on the human genome? Is the
human race doomed to bicker forever among itself? Hey, a little bit of
tension is a good thing of course, it helps stimulate ideas. But hell, let's
all at least get on the same page here! Do we REALLY need all those shades of
makeup? Do we REALLY need 2 million dollar SuperBowl commercials? Do we
REALLY need a 50,000 dollar SUV that only gets 15 miles per gallon when there 
are cars that will get 300? The worlds most basic and simple problems we 
STILL can't fix! WHY??? "Feed the people... who don't have enough to eat, 
shoe the children... with no shoes on their feet, house the people living in 
the street, ohh there's a

My $.25 Dave.

Buy yourself a good bench, one that also allows for inclines is
nice, you can probably find a used one in the newspaper. Then all
you need is some weights. Since your alone, I'd buy individual
(hand) barbells. Pick a pair that you can just curl about 8-10
times to start. These will suit for a variety of exercises. You can
buy adjustables, but you'll find you use them less.

Arnold's book on bodybuilding is updated and re-released in
softcover, it should be readily available. It's THE bible and is
full of good advise on all aspects of weightlifting including
nutrition. A must have.

Skip rubberbands and other gimicks, working out with hand barbells
alone is safe, do not use a standard (York) benchpress alone.

Discussion (academic) is not illegal at least so far in the United States.
Neither is publication. The New World Order is really the Fourth Reich but
we still have most of our free speech rights. Half of the TIHKAL book on on
the political and legal issues. 


Now in Australia it is different. Check out Chapter 23 "Who is John Jones?"
in TIHKAL for an absurd example of censorship in a free society. Not that
the CDA in the US isn't just as absurd.

http://www.natasha.cc/bodybuilder.htm

This URL is several years old and my workout schedule has changed
somewhat.  Best advice is work on your form, lift the weights
visualizing yourself in excellent form and think of the muscle
group you are working. Watch it flex. Also nutrition is essential
to benefit from weight lifting.

The problem with public "reinterpretation" of scientific data and/or
progress is that it loses so much in the translation that it ends up
creating grossly distorted impressions.  This is an attempt to inject
some "reality" into the discussion

Regarding:

>If quantum theories develop into practical computing, machines may begin to
>emulate and then surpass human intelligence. 

Poppycock!!  Everyone loves to invoke "quantum computing" as a requirement
for computers surpassing human intelligence.  There are *two* problems
with this.

First it isn't necessary.  Existing trends in microelectronics will get
us petaflops (10^15 Ops) computing with IBM's Blue Gene within a few years.
Estimates of human brain calculation equivalence range from 10^13 Ops
(Moravec, 1987) to 10^17 Ops (McEachern, 1993), so a petaflops is in
the ballpark.  Special purpose hardware (Pact GmBH's multiply & accumulate
chips or Hugo de Garis's neural network machines) will put us at desktop
equivalence of the human brain by 2005 and 2010.  However as work by de Garis
and Doug Lenat (@ Cyccorp) have shown, the problem is *not* hardware equivalence.
Its figuring out good ways of programming the net.  You have to bear in
mind that it takes 2-6 *years* of full time learning for a human brain
"net" to program itself so it is interesting to interact with.  Even if you
had lots of human equivalent desktop machines by 2010, it is a very open
question at this point how long it would take them to "learn" enough to
be considered "intelligent".  Now, the interesting thing about resident
computer intelligence is that you can copy it from machine to machine
much faster than you can propagate it among humans.

The second thing about quantum computing that people MUST remember is
that I have seen nothing that says it can be used for "general purpose"
computing.  Charles H. Bennet from IBM Research who is one of the world's
leading experts on the physics of computation, wrote a paper in 1994
entitled "Strengths and Weaknesses of Quantum Computing".  People should
listen to the *experts* in a field such as leading physicists, not the
popularizers such as Kurzweil (a programmer), or worse yet newspaper reporters.

The bottom line is that different computer architectures will be useful
for very different problems.  Multiply&accumulate or neural-net based
computers may be useful for "fuzzy" intelligence.  Cellular automata like
machines (e.g. Blue Gene) may be best for simulations.  Quantum or DNA
computers may be best for factoring or solving traveling salesman problems.

It requires discipline not to use buzz terms like "quantum computers"
in an area where they may be inappropriate.

>The question is whether the enormous power of quantum computers will allow

>have what in humans we call a mind?

Love, hate & compassion are hard-wired into humans at the genetic,
neurological and biochemical levels.  I believe the leading candidate
for the "love" drug currently may be oxytocin but other factors are
probably involved.  If we "program in" or "select for" traits that
create human or "mind" like characteristics in our computers, cyborgs
or robots, the answer is *yes* they will have minds.

>Ray Kurzweil, another eminent American technologist, is more gloomy. He
>predicts that human identity will be called into question by the massive
>computers of the future. 

Human "minds" can evolve and adapt.  Human bodies will become irrelevant
in the long term.  Because human bodies cannot avoid local hazards
(earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, etc.) bodies will eventually be
irreparably damaged.  The interim period, which could well last
thousands of years depending on how "attached" we remain to our
bodies, will be one of gradual uploading as human minds expand
within computer hardware (perhaps not unlike how the developing
brain of a fetus or young baby expands within its growing head).

>By 2020, a mere two decades from now, technology will be producing
>computers faster and more powerful than the human brain.

As pointed out above, we will get this by 2005-2010.  There is no
guarantee however that we will be able to program or teach them to
have human like intelligence by 2020 or even 2030.

>But computing power is only part of the story. It is the networks that
>really give computers their potent and omnipotent future.

This is critical -- in the brain it is *not* the raw processing power
that creates much of the capacity, it is the communications bandwidth
between all of the computational nodes (neurons).  It is a very open
question when we will be able to build computing logic elements that
have the number of raw inputs and outputs that the brain has.  Matching
the communications throughput of the brain is probably a much more
significant barrier for some aspects of intelligence than matching
its processing power.

>About 2050 or so, says Mr Kurzweil, the computers, by then capable of
>reasoning for themselves, could decide we humans are too slow, too
>ignorant, too petty and too argumentative to be tolerated. 

Poppycock again.  If you link the humans to the computers using the
technologies discussed (neural implants and high bandwidth radio
or fiber connections), then you can't create such a simple dividing
line between artificial minds and human minds.

>Why would a computer wish to associate with us?

Why would a human want a frail human body if it could do away with it?

> Just as we have allowed the information age to create increasingly

Self-replicating systems based on biotechnology will solve much of the
"have-not" problem.  Full blown molecular nanotechnology is not required.

>Mr Kurzweil quotes Daniel Hillis, a noted computer engineer: "I'm as fond
>of my body as anyone else, but if I can be 200 with a body of silicon, I'll
>take it." 

If the problem of aging is resolved through the clever application
of first biotechnology and then nanotechnology, then the average
lifespan determined by the U.S. present day accident rate would
be ~2000 years.  Who would want to live 2000 years without being
able to grow and evolve beyond the limitations of a standard-issue
human brain?

>Then, are you a human or a computer, and who's side are you on?

Its always easy to cast as "us" vs. "them".  Instead we merge as the
humans who are not too afraid to evolve, do so, perhaps in the
end choosing to leave the planet to those who choose not to do so.

I find walking slow, 3.6 mph, 1 to 4 degrees on a treadmill works best for me.

They are apparently lobbying Russian President Putin to override the
cabinet vote to dispose of Mir. Russian Space Agency officials claim Mir
needs expensive repairs before it can be safe for continued use, though
this is following extensive pressure from NASA to dump Mir, since NASA
sees commercial competition in the space station market as a threat to
its authority and continued American domination of space.

http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/space/11/21/space.series.ap/index.html

Personally I'd like to either dig up that MOL prototype and launch it,
or get the engineering drawings and build a new one. With a $20 million
injection from NBC for such a project (and possibly more, what would
they pay for having a permanent TV studio in orbit? Science, news, and
weather from orbit.... Beat THAT CBS/ABC/CNN) it should not be hard to
get such a project off the ground. Get a free Titan launch from the Air
Force in exchange for hosting observation modules on the station with
the occasional manned USAF mission. The thing with off the shelf
technology is its cheap and proven.

As an after thought, California voters just passed Proposition 36 which
requires probation and treatment, not incarceration, for posession, use,
transportation of controled substances. 

Sale, manfacture is not covered and still results in incarceration.

I don't think thats a real concern. I think the concern is becoming

Depends on whether the Chicago mob retirees are able to steal this one
too. Considering how most military ballots are being rejected in over a
dozen Florida counties, typically due to lack of postmarks (which are
not used by the military mail systems in many locations like Bosnia,
Kosovo, and on board ships) or voter information (like how many of us
have our Voter ID numbers memorized?), as well as the number of felons
(90%+ of whom are democrats) who illegally voted (one of whom is a poll
worker!), and the number of Bush votes that have been found in Gore
stacks, I would not be surprised if Gore pulled it off, even though Bush
has won every recount so far. Despite an overwhelming majority of
Americans saying Gore should concede, I don't think he's man enough to.
They know this administration will be a key one for the future of the
republic, and are pulling out all the stops to win it one way or
another. Gore also knows if he loses he is likely to come under
investigation from a GOP appointed Attorney General for fundraising
abuses. Being President and picking your own AG is the best kind of
immunity.

The problem is that most of human behavior, maybe almost all of it, is 
actually, for the lack of a better phrase/word, "unconscious." I mean that 
most behavior is really about gaining social status in order to better pass 
along one's DNA. So it seems irrational (because we prefer to think of 
ourselves as "in control"), but I think one can make a case for saying that 
we are for the most part, tools of our DNA, meat puppets, if you will.

<rest of world-class rant snipped>

I agree with most of what you say -- they are unconscious, I think you said. 
In fact, I  don't know why the rest of the world isn't on a lifelong 
drug-induced pleasure binge. They don't seem to care for radical life 
extension. As far as I can tell, they have nothing to live for (oh, yeah, 
their kids...see "meat puppets" above). They have, ultimately, only the void 
at the end. At least we have a chance. That is my motivation.

So we must take control of our future. We must bend them to our will. Yeah, 
big fat chance there, huh?

Perhaps, our views agree in that we feel that pure libertarianism is not 
really our best tool to implement our views, our path to the future. You 
mentioned killing all rest of them. Well, there goes that old social 
contract, etc. But yes, they not only do not share our views, but are 
inimical to them, in many ways. Ultimately, public relations -- propaganda 
-- is our best tool, IMO.

Apparently the reporter read a very different version of The Age of 
Spiritual Machines than the one I read. Several of Robert's criticisms 
should be aimed at the reporter, not at Ray Kurzweil. The one quoted above 
in particular. Quite unlike Hans Moravec, Kurzweil goes to considerable 
lengths to show how humans and machine intelligence will merge. His is 
*not* a picture of us vs. them.

Absolutely.  I can't understand why this "us vs them" approach is still
acceptable in this day and age.  In any other context it would be seen
as shocking.  Imagine "us vs them" as whites vs blacks and think of
how people would respond.  But give the "them" metal skin and suddenly
it's OK.

Hi Jason (have changed thread, since this seems more to do with
psychology & identity than it does to "greens").

I don't want to waste time on semantical arguments here ... but we have
may differing concepts of "belief" ... which I think of as being
emotional/subconscious to a greater degree than they are explitic
and articulated. The notion of stripping away belief structures is
less valid than notions of excorcising psychological imbalance
(through hypnosis and psychotherapy).

For example, I happen to think all the main world religions are
intellectually "wrong" in making their various supernatural claims. But
those who follow these religions do so for social and emotional reasons, and
are
not open to persuasion out of their faiths by intellectual argument alone.

>In any case, observationally your belief is clearly wrong-- or do you not
>see millions of ongoing examples of individual humans falling prey to

You are inserting a value judgement "falling prey" to "limiting" beliefs.
But
fairy stories &c. can be very comforting for individuals, and the
psychological
benefits may outweigh the intellectual doubts.

There are valid differences in beliefs also ... I only agree in part with
the Extropian principles ... since Extropianism is just one brand of
after-humanity, and I represent a different brand (direct posthuman). It
isn't fair to say one or the other is "limiting" or "clearly wrong."
There is a tendency to generalise and over-simplifying ... especially
amongst
those steeped in the failed human-era Philosophical quagmire.


>Huh?  I -do- have an ego (it's true) but in what fashion have you seen it
>reflected unflatteringly in my previous post?

Simply the over-concern with and drive for personal power .... I suffer from
this trait also on occasions. As a therapist, sometimes I find it good to
boost the self-esteem and sense of worth of a client (ego-strengthening, the
Western way) and sometimes it might be useful to deflate the ego and stand
back (ego-dissolution, the Eastern way).

With MVT, or with the Idealist proposition? MVT is the key to all of this.

No, aeons ago our ancestors' behaviour was governed by sunlight
& the primal eye, whereas nowadays our E-1 brains have infinite-state
capability (self-organising) since they are no longer governed by the
organic
(primal eye) external clock.

We can't "interface" with reality directly .. merely model it and make
abstract mental
representations ... as well as painting it/ writing music/ explore it thru
science &c.

If "pretending" to be those things adds observable value to your existence,
and aids in achieving certain goals, then I say go for it.  (Premises which
are, perhaps, debatable.)

It seems to me that most roles & beviour are "learnt" at some stage on some
level, and thus all our behaviour is "pretence" or acting" even if we often
successfully disguise this pretence from ourselves! The best liars are those
who
can convince themselves of their lies.

All I am saying is (1) understand this, and (2) use it to your advantage by
writing and editing your own script, don't pretend to be a character that
others have scripted for you. There are better things to be than "human" ..
this is just a tired old legacy label ... but then presumably we are all
after/trans-human
and agree with this statement?

> I don't want to waste time on semantical arguments here ...

Pursuant to this I'd like to strip away some of the limiting ideological
garbage found in this conversation.


I think you're reading too much into what I'm saying Steve.  Let's try to
keep this simple.

By definition, "limiting belief structures" are -limiting.-  In some way.
Now, in many cases we can objectively determine the general impact of these
limitations and assign a general consequence to the persistence of such.

For instance:

The Jehovah's Witness' are averse to blood transfusions.  JW Betty requires
a blood transfusion to live.  Facilities exist to undertake the procedure in
a timely fashion.  In the absence of her ability to remove and/or
"hack-around" (oh, just this one time,) her ideology, she will die.


Or:

Joe is a talented, intelligent introvert, and, like most humans, has an
unfortified self-esteem.  Joe holds the belief that "doing nothing" is
better than publicly failing in the attempt.  Joe procrastinates his goals.
Joe puts off that book he wants to write until "he has a firmer grasp on
it."  Joe doesn't talk to the nice girl in the checkout line.


Or:

Theo believes that a passing comet is an alien space-ship, which he can
board by means of destroying his earth-bound material existence...



Now, we can debate whether a particular belief structure is limiting or
advantageous, but if we -agree- that a particular belief structure is
limiting, wouldn't you also hold that striping away such an ideology is of
benefit?



but we have

Well, it sounds like your saying that the notion of "stripping away" is
unfeasible, rather than undesirable.  I am not a therapist, nor am I a
psychologist or neuro-scientist.  So, I can't really speak with intelligence
on this topic.  I defer expertise of "the means" to those in the know.  You
can consider my arguments as addressing "the ends."

Desirable ends:  Removal of limiting belief structures.

Again, I have never addressed the means in this discussion.  Who says that
we need to use 'intellectual argument'?

However, I would be interested in attempting a reverse-conversion (if I
thought it would have a pleasant outcome.)  Rational people can often
respond to rational arguments, despite powerful beliefs if the arguments are
given with patience and in a spirit of compassion.  This I know.

I agree that we should engage in a cost benefit analysis in making these
decisions.  I probably disagree with the value of a large number of people
holding fairy tale beliefs for the sake of comfort.

Curious, when I abandoned my religion, I found I was quickly able to take
equal (or greater) comfort in my own capabilities as a human being as I ever
received from the impression that my life was being watched over by a
benevolent care-taker.  (I appreciate, however, that people are different.)

Uh-oh... rant coming up...

Tut-tut!  Steve!  Please don't be one of -those- people!

I refer you to Nelson Mandela's 1994 Inaugural Speech:
http://www.wildghost.com/mandela.htm
(For the relgiosity averse: replace "God" with "Life")

Also, uh, I hate to say it, but your comments above are an example of what
I'm talking about.  We have a fear of empowering ourselves-- perhaps we fear
that we are not responsible enough to deal with it?  (Then we need to
empower our responsibility!)

Remember, personal power is not a bad thing.  You -are- looking to re-invent
yourself as a posthuman entity, aren't you?  Aren't you trying to defeat
death, liberate your existence from poverty, war, hate and hunger?  Isn't
Transhumanism the ultimate manifestation of the empowerment of the human?

I'm talking about -increasing- one's drive for personal power.  Not
deflating it (like so many societal factors seem to do.)  I think we should
undertake that goal in a spirit of compassion, as I've stated, but do not
shrink away from the brass ring!  Do not believe yourself unworthy.

 As a therapist, sometimes I find it good to

The ability to dissolve one's ego is -also- an expression of personal power.
This is a paradox/truth.

Ugh.  Whatever.  Again, again.  Fine ---> "a) be aware of how we are capable
of *indirectly* interfacing with reality."

You're aware, I hope, that your persistence in adding additional levels of
abstraction does not invalidate my statements.

Again, I say: "whatever."  If all behavior is "pretense," then -that's- what
behavior is.  We live in a state of pretense-- that doesn't bother me.  But
is it useful pretense?  Behavioral 'truth' is a pretty darn grey subject,
wouldn't you agree?

My lifestyle has been so active over the years living in a ski

started doing the stairs (due to supplements for ligaments and
joints) again which helps gluts, guads and hamstrings and the
heart.  I still prefer to dance but I'm not very good at it anymore,
although I'd like to do some Madonna/Jackson/Martin routines
:-)

Some people seem to think that 40g/day of protein isn't enough to build
muscles on 1250/day of calories.  It seems likely that if I want to keep
losing fat and building muscle on my current diet, I need to add some
protein supplements or amino acid supplements... or something, anyway. 
"Health" is "in", these days, so it's totally impossible to find out
anything from the 'Net.

What do I need - what supplements, in particular - to simultaneously lose
fat weight and build muscle mass?  Can I just get an extra 75g/day of
amino-acid-balanced protein from some tablet (or do I take the amino acids
directly, or what?) and go on dieting and exercising, or will my body just
consume the extra protein as ordinary calories?

And if so, could someone please recommend a particular brand of
protein/amino tablet?  Because the Net of a Million Lies appears to have
around three million varieties for sale.

The first part of this is true (a fact I'm quite proud of as a Houstonian), 
but I don't think the second part is true under any interpretation.  Real 
property in the city exists within a web of interlocking covenants that "run 
with the land" and property owners must carry on their activities within the 
limits of common and statutory law.

Your best bet for building muscle is to take in about one gram of protein for 
every pound you weigh (assuming you aren't obese). The quality of protein 
makes a difference.  Proteins that contain a higher percentage of essential 
amino acids are what to look for. Whey protein is popular. Some people worry 
that high levels of protein can cause kidney damage but the trick is to take 
in no more then about forty grams at one time and to space it out during the 
day.  A problem you might run into, however, is that you will never build 
muscle on that low of a caloric intake.  If you want to lose fat your best 
bet is to build muscle. This will burn the fat for you.  I know a lot of 
extropians feel that restricting their diets could increase their lifespans 
but I feel that it diminishes the quality of your life too much, and by the 
time I have to worry about my life span regenerative medicine will be readily 
available.  I'm getting ready to start a new routine this week. It calls for 
4,000 calories a day but I should be able to pile on about twelve pounds of 
muscle in six months.  If you're still concerned about body fat though, do 
sprints or some other form of high intensity exercise.  Forget jogging.  
Would you rather have the body of a sprinter or a marathon runner? And when 
you do weight train remember to work all three types of muscle fibers for 
maximal growth.

I would make a couple comments on the "bad trip" phenomenon and the general
utility of psychedelics.
 
1)  IMHO, the incidence of "bad trips" is widely overstated.
 
2) The direction and content of any psychedelic experience, while no more
predictable than life itself, is still greatly sculptable by the
individual.  Set and setting are the two prime contributors to the nature
of a psychedelic experience.  Set = mood and expectation going into the
trip.  Setting = environment during the trip.  Taking LSD and going to a
wild party is not the same as taking LSD and meditating on a topic in a
tranquil environment.
 
3) My personal experience is that psychedelics can be quite useful in
meta-programming, when properly used.  In addition, I think there is
something healthy about taking a drug that puts one in a slightly out of
control state.  Experiencing that state and coming through it builds a
certain amount of resiliance in the individual.  It is easy to be calm in
the face of many intense and unexpected experiences when one has
essentially practiced having intense and unexpected experiences.
 
4) Finally, there are indeed cases of major psychosis or long-lasting
neurosis arising from use of psychedelics.  However these are also quite
rare, and generally seem to occur to those who had an obviously unstable
personality before the use of psychedelics.

Congratulations Amara for making specifically the January issue of
Sky and Telescope.  This particular issue has a much higher circulation
than the other 11 issues because it contains the annual almanac.
Apparently the S+T editors, knowing the January issue has the higher
circulation, saved the really good stuff for that particular issue.  {8-]

I want to clear the air about Ken Wilber. Originally, yes, he was a
transpersonal philosopher/psychologist. His first book, "Spectrums of
Consciousness" was a corner stone of the movement. However, that was almost
thirty years and he has revised his thinking. He no longer considers
himself a transpersonal philosopher because it puts too much emphasis on the
transpersonal modalities of understanding.

Integral Psychology (which is the name of his latest book) is how there are
multiple developmental lines (cognitive, emotional, biological, etc.) within
the individual and society. Each person's development is the process of
integrating all lines of development into a unified whole. It does not
emphasize spiritual ascendance or material descendance. It's about
navigating all relaties as you work towards continual self-improvement.

Yes, there are gaps in his theories. He is not trying to flesh out all
points. He is trying to integrate the teaching of philosophy, psychology
and spiritual traditions into a unified model of consciousness. He's
creating a framework for others to flesh out.

One of the most interesting points he has to make is that during
development, different neurosis can develop at each stage. In order to
heal, you need to apply the right type of therapy for that stage of
development. Another recommended book is his "A Brief History of
Everything".

For those of you who want an introduction to his ideas, I suggest visiting
this website:

My own opinion is that psychedelics can be extremely useful in
meta-programming and self exploration. Much of this is spelled out in books
like "Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer" and "LSD
Psychotherapy" 

In addition, I suspect that experiencing a wide variety of conscious states
has added a certain amount of resilience to my personality.  Strange or
intense experiences can be handled with more ease if one has experienced
similar or greater levels of strangeness or intensity in the past.

I maintain a large collection of links on many
transhumanism-related topics, including life-extension
and immortality. (It's updated at least once a month.)
The life-extension/immortality page is located at
http://anzwers.org/free/tech/websites-bytopic-lifeext.html

Hope that helps :-)

I've read a few articles today about a new robot recently shown by Honda, 
named ASIMO (http://www.msnbc.com/news/492638.asp). It seemed to be 
basically for show, doesn't appear to have any very profound AI, and the 
information on it is, obviously, only what is let out by Honda (I wonder how 
many times it fell over during the demonstration..). A video shows it 
walking up stairs, and I do not doubt that it was going through an 
inflexible program based on those specific stairs, and that it would have 
fallen over if it began its walk three inches back from where it started. I 
remember seeing a video of its precursor robot playing soccer, and the video 
had so many cuts, I know each one must have ended right before the robot 
tipped over.
But anyway, it still looks pretty impressive. With a lot of development, 
mainly along the lines of integrating other already-existing technologies, I 
think it could become much more versatile.
But I don't care about it walking around in my house, I'm interested in 
having my brain put into one. I'm generally interested in keeping a 
biological body but this would be good in the case of some accident or 
illness before that becomes possible, and I'm starting to think it will 
become possible sooner then a biologically grown body. By transplanting eyes 
and ears as well, or the already existing cochlear implants and the retinal 
implants currently being tested (http://www.optobionics.com), and natural 
nerve impulses controlling the movements of the robot, the only big thing 
missing is sustaining a brain inside.
So I'm wondering, what work has been or is being done on the "brain in a 
vat" scenerio - by that I just mean keeping it alive and functional. I 
assume there isn't much being done, so what is it that has to be done? I 
think some of the existing blood vessel structure leading into the brain 
would need to be preserved and some artificial blood, capable of providing 
the right nutrients and oxygen, and absorbing waste products, would need to 
be pumped through it. Some kind of filtering system in the robot could take 
care of that, with replentishment coming from some factory-made fluid. The 
only other thing I can think of is the immune system, which I really know 
nothing about at all (are white blood cells self reproducing or do they come 
from the marrow like red cells?).
In some situations this may be preferable to biological existence. By making 
some changes to account for temperature variations (keeping the brain at a 
constant temperature would be required anyway), the robot could basically be 
a space suit for the brain, or a diving suit.
Nobody say anything about uploading.. I'm thinking nearer term.

muscle is 6 time as dense as fat, so you may find your weight staying
the same or even going up as you add muscle. for men the key test is to
look down and see if your stomach is blocking the view of you feet -- if
so you have too much fat---period.

Re daily protein requirements:
Has anyone else read any material indicating that excess protein may be a 
major factor in atherosclerosis? I am talking about homocysteine, 
specifically. Some vegans say 40 g is more than enough. One dietitian I read 
on the net talked about protein "intoxication" and its affects on western 
lifestyle, i.e., obesity, etc.

For all you Nanotech junkies out there (and I am fast becoming one of them!) 
Here is some interesting news that is going on around my school (Drexel 
University). There is a cooperative research effort starting up between 
Drexel and the University of Pennsylvania. I am trying to find out more 
detailed info on what is actually going on... I will keep you all informed 
about any progress I am making, and please, if you know more about this let 
me know! I just happen to have a class in the engineering building this 
semester... maybe I will try to get a sneek peek! ;)

Ever onward,

the robot walking up and down the stairs is the P2. P2 is the predecessor to
P3 which is the predecessor to ASIMO which is what they were showing
yesterday.  They've got some movies for download that almost made me cry
(ok, they probably won't affect you, but i think they are awesome). They are
at  http://www.honda.co.jp/ASIMO/movie/.   They are biggish (approx 3 megs
each) so you should probably skip the first two, since they don't show much.
The last three are a must see though.

I suppose that if that future came to pass, then in fact people would
applaud that devotion to genetic diversity in the past.  However from
our present perspective we don't know that this will happen.

What about a parent who takes his child into space on some kind of
irreversible journey (say, a traditional SF generation ship to the stars)?
Should children conceived on such a trip be able to sue their parents?
Should the children on the Mayflower have sued their parents for exposing
them to the hardships of the New World?  I don't think we can categorize
such journeys into necessary vs unnecessary risks.

Bah
get enough methylation agents like Folate, b12 and  trimethylglycine
and homocystine goes away largely
I recently increased my protein levels to above 200 grams and I have never 
felt better, more energy, clearer thinking, better sleep, gaining muslemass, 
clear skin , hair thicker, LESS BODYFAT.

Cut the carbs out, and eat more omega 3 oils, and take anti-oxidants



Re daily protein requirements:
Has anyone else read any material indicating that excess protein may be a
major factor in atherosclerosis? I am talking about homocysteine,
specifically. Some vegans say 40 g is more than enough. One dietitian I read
on the net talked about protein "intoxication" and its affects on western
lifestyle, i.e., obesity, etc.

Max, I run a number of high-volume mailinglists, and this
this is a *completely* inappropriate way to administer a mailinglist.
It is fundamentally based on fear of potential retribution. By demanding
indentification, you are demanding the ability to apply retribution. This
is not an acceptable way to behave.

Just moderate the list. If there are concerns as to the propriety or burden
of the moderator, have several.

End of problem.

Being heterozygote for cystic fibrosis apparently confers an advantage
against cholera. But if somebody tried marketing a cholera medication
that as a side effect had the effects of CF (including the much
shortened lifespan) I guess no agency would approve it and nearly
nobody would want to take it. There are better ways of treating
illness. 

My point above is more about whether we should accept all changes than
whether a certain change *could* be beneficial. Being born with a
cross on your forehead (due to parents having odd religious views)
*could* be beneficial in some circumstances, but most likely not and
would impose quite a bit on the child.

Isn't this a very different problem?

Yeah, that's right, you can learn all kinds of really cute Great Truths

Body modifications of infants unable to make decisions happen quite often.  One
of the most obvious examples is circumcision.  Admittedly, being hidden by a
loincloth, it is not the same as being branded on the face.

If there are true uploads in the extropic sense, then it might be like a Greg
Bear novel where infants are uploaded upon in- or conception.  Then infants
develop in a virtual world and choose their body or bodies later.

In the space of two or three generations, we could see everything change, or
not, and in the space of three hundred generations, we could observe each.

True.  Almost not any human is completely rational in a logically objective
sense, or most are in their own sense, with none two the same.  A rationale is a
state of mind.

About lawsuits, people generally have the right to raise their children how they
would, there are certain rules about abuse and neglect.  About lawsuits, in a
suit there are two sides, I think you can find a lawyer to sue anybody, more or
less.

I started reading this book about the genome called _Genome_, it tells me a lot
I did not know.  I don't have any biology background except for science-fiction
immersion and the anatomy plates.  Anyways, at some point we can tell the
computer what enzymes we want and thus print RNA to make them, in the comfort of
our own homes.  Thus any demyelinization of the neuron could be stopped, as
well, any tumors proactively prevented, and cells' multiplication delimited.

As soon as the zygote is fertilized, and then it multiplies, there is the genome
for that future person, if it is born.  If the gene absolutely predicts massive
congenital birth defects, it is perhaps better to use a different fertilized
zygote that has a better chance of a happy development and maturity.  As soon as
the zygote is then manipulated, then it too easily leads to the spiral of
eugenics.

If adults choose to modify their own genetic code, so be it.  If they are not
then mules, then they could pass it as humans.  Some forms of genetic
modification of a human would make it not human, more or less.

Tampering with the genetic code is parallel to evolution, except where evolution
is the more or less randomized sum result of incremental mutation, purposeful
manipulation of the genetic code is an extremely powerful action, thus
dangerous, morally and perhaps for the rest of the species, and in the case of
the manipulation gone wrong, dangerous for the being whose genes were changed.

Humans selectively interbreed on a more-or-less conscious level, thus some
30,000 generations bring us from using stone or bone tools to chip chert to
using nanoprobes to shape bones.

Floating 'Smart Dust' May Be New Spy in the Sky

By The San Francisco Chronicle
November 21, 2000


If Kristofer Pister has his way, we will never think about dust in
quite the same way again.

Pister is leading a team of researchers at the University of
California at Berkeley that is developing tiny, electronic devices
called "smart dust," designed to capture mountains of information
about their surroundings while literally floating on air.

If the project is successful, clouds of smart dust could one day be
used in an astonishing array of applications, from following enemy
troop movements and hunting Scud missiles to detecting toxic chemicals
in the environment and monitoring weather patterns around the globe.

The idea behind smart dust is to pack sophisticated sensors, tiny
computers and wireless communicators onto minuscule "motes" of silicon
light enough to remain suspended in air for hours at a time. As the
motes drift on the wind, they can monitor the environment for light,
sound, temperature, chemical composition and a wide range of other
information, and beam that data back to a base station miles away.

Pister, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer
science at UC Berkeley, said he came up with the idea for smart dust
eight years ago at a conference on future technology. "I realized that
sensors, computers and communications were going to shrink down to
ridiculously small sizes," he said. "So why not package them into a
single, tiny device?"

Pister submitted a proposal to the federal Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, a branch of the Defense Department, which agreed to
provide about $1.2 million over three years to fund the project.

Each mote of smart dust is composed of a number of
microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, wired together to form a
simple computer.

MEMS are made using the same photolithographic techniques used to make
computer chips. Once perfected, they are relatively easy and
inexpensive to mass-produce. But unlike computer chips, which are
solid, MEMS contain moving parts.

Patterns are etched with light into a silicon wafer to create
structures such as optical mirrors or tiny engines. Each mote contains
a solar cell to generate power, sensors that can be programmed to look
for specific information, a tiny computer that can store the
information and sort out which data is worth reporting, and a
communicator that enables the mote to be "interrogated" by the base
unit.

Later versions may also contain a lilliputian lithium battery so the
motes can operate at night.

While much of the technology used to develop smart dust already
exists, the UC researchers are breaking new ground by integrating
these systems into remarkably small, self-powered packages.


"We are pushing the limits of miniaturization, integration and power
management," said Brett Warneke, a graduate student in electrical
engineering working on the project.

In one experiment to demonstrate the viability of the concept,
researchers deployed a golf ball-sized device on Twin Peaks in San
Francisco that measured weather conditions in the area - temperature,
light, barometric pressure and humidity - and beamed that information
back to a base station in Berkeley, more than 13 miles away.

So far, the smallest device the UC researchers have developed is 62
cubic millimeters - about the size of a pea - but Pister expects to
shrink the devices to a nearly microscopic cubic millimeter by next
summer. At that scale, they would be truly like dust: small enough to
remain suspended in air, buoyed by the currents, sensing and
communicating for hours.

One of the biggest hurdles the UC researchers face is building a
mechanism that can survive on extremely low power but is still capable
of sensing, sorting and sending vast amounts of information. For that
reason, they have designed a computer operating system called Tiny OS
that can function on a mere 512 bytes of RAM - about the amount of
processing power found in a toaster.

The UC researchers are also experimenting with an ingenious optical
communicator called a corner-cube reflector, which enables the motes
to communicate while expending virtually no energy.

Pioneered at the University of California at Los Angeles, the
reflector is essentially a tiny, hinged mirror that can flash millions
of Morse code-like signals per second. When a smart mote is
illuminated by a laser fired from the base station, the station can
"read" the code reflected in the twitching mirror. The mirror itself
is powered by electrostatic energy, the force that makes your socks
cling together when they come out of the dryer.

Smart dust devices are now capable of communicating only with a single
base station, but will eventually be able to share information with
each other.  Such a system of "massively distributed intelligence"
will vastly increase their ability to organize and communicate
information.

"They will be able to do things collectively that they can't do
individually, just like an ant colony," Warneke said. "An individual
ant isn't very smart, but collectively, they are very smart."

Researchers are exploring a number of methods for deploying smart
dust. One involves the use of tiny, unmanned aircraft that would spray
motes over an area like a miniature crop duster and relay the
resulting information back to a base station. MLB Co., a Palo Alto
firm that develops experimental aircraft, has already built such a
plane - an 8-inch radio-controlled aircraft equipped with a video
camera that can stay aloft for 18 minutes at a speed of 60 mph.

MLB's "micro air vehicle" could be useful in a battlefield situation
where low clouds impeded satellite surveillance. The tiny, unmanned
plane could soar undetected above the battlefield, disperse a swarm of
smart dust and begin relaying a stream of data about the movement of
enemy troops and equipment.

The UC researchers are also exploring ways to prolong the time smart
dust remains airborne by adding "wings" like those on maple seeds. A
cubic-millimeter-sized mote dropped at 30,000 feet would normally take
five hours to reach the ground. By attaching wings, the researchers
hope to extend that period two- or three-fold.

Other researchers are attaching tiny legs to the motes to create
so-called microbots or smart insects. Instead of wafting aimlessly
through the air like dust, microbots could be programmed to perform
specific tasks, such as crawling through a collapsed building to
search for warm bodies.

"Smart dust is like the brain, and we're building the body," said
Richard Yeh, a graduate student researcher specializing in
microrobotics who is working on the smart dust project.

Yeh and his colleagues have already developed the basic components of
a smart insect - tiny, jointed members, which function as legs, and
minuscule motors, the equivalent of muscles. All that remains is to
connect the components to a mote of smart dust, a step Yeh expects to
accomplish within weeks.

Although the smart dust research is supported by the Defense
Department, its proponents see many nonmilitary applications for it,
many for motes that would stay in one place.

CRUNCHLESS CAP'N CRUNCH

They could be used to detect fires and earthquakes, tailor the climate
in office buildings to suit the preferences of individual workers, and
monitor product quality from factory to consumer (a mote of smart dust
could tell, for example, if a box of Cap'n Crunch had been exposed to
high humidity, and lost its crunch, or if a crate filled with delicate
electronic components had been dropped).

Like many other new technologies, smart dust clearly has the potential
to be used for nefarious purposes. Foreign governments (or our own),
terrorist organizations, criminals and industrial spies could use
high-tech motes to spy.

"This is a technology of total surveillance," said Richard Sclove,
founder of the Loka Institute, a nonprofit organization in Amherst,
Mass., that studies the social implications of technology.

"I have no doubt that there will be plenty of benign and wonderful
applications of this technology, but it's easier to imagine the lousy
ones.  The CIA and the National Security Administration would love to
get their hands on this, and there's no way to control what they do
with it."

While Pister acknowledges the possibility that smart dust could be
misused, he says the potential benefits of the technology "far, far
outweigh" any risks.

"You can find harmful effects in everything," added Yeh. "But the
threat is small. If a rogue state wanted to use them to spy on us,
they could do it, but not much more. They probably couldn't carry
enough poison or gas to do much damage."

The specter of millions, or even billions, of electronic motes
drifting around the globe has also raised concerns about the potential
ill effects on the environment and health.

But Pister dismissed such concerns. "Even in my wildest imagination, I
don't think we'll ever produce enough smart dust to bother anyone," he
said. "Most of these materials are not environmentally
harmful. Essentially they are made out of sand, and that's not toxic."

Potentially, the most dangerous element of a smart dust mote would be
the lithium battery, Pister says, but its minuscule size would pose
little risk.

"A small town throws away more batteries per year than we can
distribute across the entire universe," he said. "It's really a
question of trade-offs.  If you can sprinkle a few ounces of battery
over a rain forest and thereby get a better understanding of the
ecology, that's a trade-off worth making."

And what if someone accidentally inhaled a mote of smart dust? "If by
ill chance you did inhale one, it would be like inhaling a gnat. You'd
cough it up post-haste. Unpleasant, but not very likely."

I meant this in a very prosaic, practical way.  IMHO, my singular
personality is more stable for having used psychedelics.  I am more calm.
I am more likely to respond to potentially alarming or confusing situations
in a calm and clear way.  I am more competent and more able to act
effectively in confusing situations, or in other altered states.

There is a separate effect which your mention of "orthogonal states of
mind" prompts me to mention:  I believe psychedelics have helped me
integrate various aspects of my personality, specifically various parts of
my world-view which I previously felt were fairly separate.  One phenomena
frequently noted in the use of psychedelics is a tendency to see more
patterns and connections relating previously unrelated phenomena.

In truth, this may be largely illusory.   The mind has a tendency to see
patterns which may not actually exist.  But, while the psychedelic mind
produces many false-positive patterns or connections, it also produces some
true-positives that were not apparent to the non-psychedelic mind.  (Or at
least this is my own experience.)

I should also add that I agree with the poster who commented on other
techniques, meditation in particular, as viable routes to some of the same
effects.  I would also encourage anyone who wants a more predictable
psychedelic experience to experiment with the combination of psychedelic
substances and grounding techniques such as meditation and yoga.  I find
that they mix quite well, and indeed potentiate each other.

cheers,
mez

Homocysteine is something to be concerned about, however folate
(folic acid) is effective in reducing homocysteine levels. See my
next post on the book "Real Age" for details.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                       November 21, 2000

STARDUST SPACECRAFT ENCOUNTERS SOLAR FLARE

     Quick-thinking NASA engineers and scientists helped the 
Stardust spacecraft survive a close encounter with a storm of 
high-energy particles from the Sun after a recent solar flare.  
 
     Stardust, a NASA mission to return samples of a comet, 
was only 1.4 AU (130 million miles) from the Sun on the 
afternoon of Wed., Nov. 9.  It was flying at about 20,000 
kilometers per hour (over 12,000 miles per hour). 

     Engineers from the Stardust team were a little worried, 
since they had heard that the fourth largest solar flare since 
1976 was heading toward Earth.  This monster cloud of 
energized particles was 100,000 times more intense than usual, 
and it was heading toward Stardust. 

     The engineers' fears came to pass in the middle of the 
night, when the solar wind's stream of high-energy protons hit 
the spacecraft. Its two star cameras, which it uses to control 
the spacecraft's orientation, got a large dose of energy.  
Protons from the solar wind electrified pixels in the star 
cameras, producing dots that the camera interpreted as stars. 
The 12 brightest images, the ones the spacecraft relied on to 
point its way, were electrified pixels, which showed up as 
false stars. Hundreds of these star-like images inundated the 
star camera's field of view, which meant it could not 
recognize its attitude in space.  

     The spacecraft did the safest thing it could  it went 
into standby mode, turning its solar panels toward the Sun and 
waiting for communication from Earth.  While it was waiting, 
the spacecraft tried again to determine its attitude by using 
two different sets of cameras.  It repeatedly turned up 
hundreds of bogus star-like images. It also switched between 
electronics systems on either side of the spacecraft.  So 
Stardust began to slowly rotate in place, pointing its solar 
panels at the Sun. 

     The flight team didn't hear from Stardust when they tried 
to communicate with it the next morning. They deduced that the 
solar flare had caused it to go into standby mode, and they 
knew that meant the spacecraft would send a signal within 24 
hours.

     Scientists confirmed their theory when they reviewed data 
from the spacecraft that verified that the problems had begun 
when the solar flare occurred.  The influence of the proton 
stream would diminish over the next few days but still posed 
some danger, so the team left the spacecraft in standby mode 
until the threat passed. 

     On Saturday, November 11th, the flight team reset the 
first star camera and turned it back on. They used another 
method of orienting the spacecraft, called inertial measuring 
units, while they inspected the cameras. Engineers retrieved 
the last images the camera took before the spacecraft reset 
itself and saw hundreds of false star images.  Although the 
camera normally uses a circular area in the middle to take 
pictures, the proton hits were so strong they even penetrated 
parts of the camera usually hidden from the light.
 
     On Monday, the Stardust flight team commanded the 
spacecraft to leave its safe mode. The star camera was back on 
the job, controlling the orientation of the spacecraft 
perfectly.  The engineers retrieved more data from Stardust to 
ensure the entire spacecraft had not been affected by the 
solar flare.  

     An image taken days after the solar flare subsided shows 
that the camera had completely recovered from the proton hits. 
All the bright objects in the picture can be identified as 
stars, Jupiter or Saturn.

     Stardust was launched onto a perfect flight path on Feb. 
7, 1999 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The spacecraft is headed for 
an encounter with Comet P/Wild 2 in 2004. Stardust's mission 
is to collect samples of dust flying off the comet nucleus, 
and to collect interstellar particles flowing through our 
solar system. Stardust will fly back toward Earth in 2006 to 
drop off the samples in a parachute-equipped return capsule. 
Stardust, part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost, highly 
focused science missions, is managed by JPL for NASA's Office 
of Space Science, Washington, D.C.  JPL is a division of the 
California Institute of Technology. For more information on the 
Stardust mission and images from the recent encounter, go to

                 Are you as Young as you can Be?

         44 Scientifically proven Steps that delay Aging
                     Michael F. Roizen M.D.
                       ISBN 0-06-019134-1

Did you Know that:

* Financial stress can make your RealAge 2 to 32 years older?

* The difference between having the ideal blood pressure 115/76-and
high blood pressure-higher than 140/90 can make a RealAge
difference of more than 20 years?

This is another excellent health book, (also a website
www.realage.com) This book would be an excellent primer for
extropians. Here are his recommendations for vitamins/minerals:

Vitamin C: 600 mg supplement plus 5 servings fruit/vegetables to  
           total 1250 mg/day keep it less than 2000mg.

Vitamin E: 400 I.U (I take 800).

Vitamin A: do not take more than 8000 I.U.

Calcium: 1000-1200 mg a day 1200 for female extropians.

Vitamin D: 400 I.U supplement 600 I.U if your over 70.

Folate: 400 mcg (that' micrograms not milligrams). to battle the  
        evil homocysteine.

On the subject of protein he recommends no more than 20% of daily
total calories or about 7 ounces a day. You may want to add a
couple while your weightlifting, but only on days you lift.
Excessive protein can cause kidney problems and leach calcium from
bones.

He puts the typical calorie requirements for a 200 pounder at 2160
Kcal a day, he recommends 3500 Kcal a week of exercise.

A truly excellent book, it even was a #1 New York Times Bestseller.

Dr Roizen is on staff here at the University of Chicago hospitals,
I may have to look him up.

Apologies if this is redundant non-news to
anybody, but I just ran into it myself:

"One Half of a Manifesto" by Jaron Lanier,
at http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lanier/lanier_index.html

The author is a computer scientist who criticizes
the over-enthusiastic embrace of the elements of
Singularitarian thinking (as it is known around here)
by many of his colleagues,

The author calls this familiar complex of ideas
"cybernetic totalism".

To  my limited knowledge  there is  indeed very  little being  done on
this. But  work on artificial  blood, artificial livers,  dialysis and
heart-lung machines are clearly relevant. 

But I don't think it is going to be a very elegant system or even
movable before we have nanotech, good biotech or at least good
microtechnology, there are a lot of nasty engineering details to solve
(such as preventing clotting, keeping chemical homeostasis and
especially, good brain-computer interfaces).

They are mainly generated in the marrow, in a quite interesting
cascade. The problem is that if you want a working immune system for
your cyborg or brain in vat, you would need to deal with moving both
the marrow and the "training" structures of the thymus or lymph nodes
where the cells learn how to distinguish self from non-self (if you
avoid using an immune system, then you get less problems of rejection
of the "implants" (explants?) of the brain).

Well, I think this is doable in the long run, but I think it will
never catch on because it is very cumbersome to achieve with low
technology, and as technology gets better alternatives to the brain in
vat approach will emerge. It might be useful in emergency medicine
(where some cases are good approximations to this problem), but as a
way of life?

(I actually though this was a great idea myself some years back, but
that was before studying too much medicine. Things like that tend to
make you sceptic, you see all the devils in all the details. I could
be quite wrong, of course)

Do you have one basic personality or are you one of the rare individuals
with true multiple personalities and identities (this does not include
playing around on IRC with different identities :-) )?

I would not want my child to be born with a cross on his forehead,
but a religious person might.  I might want my child to be born with a
nanotech enhanced immune system, but a religious person might not.

How can we judge these differences of opinion?  Should I simply say I am
Right and He is Wrong?  Should I take a live and let live attitude, shrug
and say that each person does as he chooses?  I don't have good answers
to these questions.

It is similar in that we have a parent who is imposing risks and costs on
their unborn children.  If there is a feedback or compensation system
by which children can express their rights, wouldn't this arise in
situations other than genetic modifications?  Forcing a child to grow

Right. THis is not a chicken/egg thing. Property rights existed long
before zoning laws were even a gleam in a bureaucrats eye. Zoning laws
confiscate property rights without constitutionally mandated
compensation. If I own propery A, with a naturally infinite set of
possible uses {a...a^n}, and a government imposes zoning laws on my
property, it confiscates all possible uses but set {a...a^x) which are
dictated by that use zone.

Yes, I know of this article. It is interesting to consider the
underlying philosophy here. It all hinges on how you define integrity,
and that is a hairy issue. Quite often it seems that it becomes
confused with having unique genes, and that leads to very silly laws. 

I like to view integrity as the issue of self-ownership of one's
internal information (a kind of extension of Article 8). Moral
integrity means that I make my own moral decisions without being too
influenced by external attempts to influence or coerce me. This can be
seen as saying that my moral software is not amenable to outside
rewriting. Personal integrity implies that I have a right to keep my
personal information (like my genes or thoughts) private - or to
voluntarily decide to share it.

Integrity is the basis of informed consent, and there I have little
problems with the writing. In fact, I might want to extend it - the
current sale of Icelandic and Tongan genetic information might
constitute a breach of the personal integrity of the citizens there
since it was not done by them or with their consent. 

On the other hand, from my point of view there is hence little
problems with selecting genes etc (there is no person there to violate
the integrity of - that person will exist later, partially as a result
of the actions) or selling body parts - that really follows from
self-ownership. And banning reproductive cloning is a rather arbitrary
decision about who should be allowed to have children with who and
how, largely based on the genes=integrity view (which often is stated
in silly terms like the right to have an unique genome, which make
twins somehow victims of mutual integrity infringement).

Yes. A much more nontrivial effect is in utreo surgery, where surgery
is performed before birth. Or for that matter if the mother eats
special food in order to affect the child.

This is of course old territory in bioethics, but I would like to see
if a consistent transhumanist or extropian theory could be
developed. I think that, based on the principles, we have the seeds
for building some good ethics and politics for grownups but where we
really need to develop some new stuff is in these murky areas where
individuality, selfhood and potentiality interact in tricky ways.

Exactly. So what standards should we transhumanists suggest? I think
it is fairly clear that we would consider it abuse if changes or
upbringing limited or negated the possibility of the child developing
into a full human being, able to fulfill its potential etc. But what
about minor nastiness, like religious icons on the forehead, or
radical changes that the parents could claim did not even produce a
human in need of protection ("It is my body, dammit, and I use it to
manufacture sentient biocomputer parts if I want to!"). Sure, these
later possibilities are not very likely to be common, but they show
the tricky problems a transhumanist bioethics must be able to deal
with.

In theory, yes. But the devil lurks in the details - protein folding
is a hard problem, and even if you could design an enzyme for doing
function A it is hard to see if it is also going to have unforeseen
effect B. Not to mention that this relies on fairly mature technology,
essentially biological nanotechnology.

Which in itself is not bad (unless one believes that it is important
to maintain an unchanged genome). When it becomes bad is when it is
used coercively or to implement somebody else's views of what
constitutes a human bein instead of the parents. Of course, some
critics would say that even having parents chose genes is coercion
against the child (I don't buy that argument; the child does not exist
at that point, it is just a potentiality for a person - rights appear
as it grows up. But that should not be a reason for prenatal
mistreatment).

twins would be dual artistic recipients, just like two subsidiary
companies having the right to use the parent company's trademarked logo.
The cloning thing is, obviously, in conflict with the concept of twins.
Are twins or other multiple identical births caused by fertility drugs
clones (due to their artificially stimulated origin) or not? By their
strict definition, they are. Most people would say they were not.

For instance:

The Jehovah's Witness' are averse to blood transfusions.  JW Betty requires
a blood transfusion to live.  Facilities exist to undertake the procedure in
a timely fashion.  In the absence of her ability to remove and/or
"hack-around" (oh, just this one time,) her ideology, she will die.

But the Jehova Witness is making a value judgement that some things
come before life & death even, and the emotional attachment to this wish
for/
belief in an afterlife wins out. We might think they are wrong and limited,
but
they think the same about your outlook.


Or:

Joe is a talented, intelligent introvert, and, like most humans, has an
unfortified self-esteem.  Joe holds the belief that "doing nothing" is
better than publicly failing in the attempt.  Joe procrastinates his goals.
Joe puts off that book he wants to write until "he has a firmer grasp on
it."  Joe doesn't talk to the nice girl in the checkout line.

Joe's belief does not come out of thin air,, but is presumably a
stimulus-response
based on unpleasantness of previous public ridicule/ failings.
Circumspection
should not be dismissed out of hand since every individual and situation is
unique. Joe might not want to be seen as someone who is always hitting on
girls.

Or:

Theo believes that a passing comet is an alien space-ship, which he can
board by means of destroying his earth-bound material existence...

How is this belief "limiting"? Mad, probably, but not limiting.

Not every "belief structure" can be intellectualised as you wish.
Empowerment may be more to do with physical energy level than
beliefs ... for example, if I have been drinking at lunchtime or am sleepy,
I just can't be arsed to do much. No beliefs holding me back ...



but we have

Well, it sounds like your saying that the notion of "stripping away" is
unfeasible, rather than undesirable.  I am not a therapist, nor am I a
psychologist or neuro-scientist.  So, I can't really speak with intelligence
on this topic.  I defer expertise of "the means" to those in the know.  You
can consider my arguments as addressing "the ends."

I do not see your oversimplistic view as having any merit.

>Desirable ends:  Removal of limiting belief structures.

My limiting belief is that I am "mortal" and not superman which stops
me leaping from tall buildings ... this limiting belief is ESSENTIAL.
No need to strip anything way, just evaluate your actions/beliefs sensibly.

 Isn't

No, the annihilation of the spent idea of "human." More than human.
Humans cannot be trusted to run the planet, they are pretty stupid on the
whole!
We are try to supersede humans, surely, and establish the next level up the
phylogenic tree.

Believe me, I have considered the issues that bother you previously ...

I can use MVT to devise new types of hypnotic induction (mind control).
Should I use these techniques to promote my own agenda or not?

A month or two ago, I was reading Slashdot, and came across a link to 
www.extropy.org.  I glanced at it and book-marked it for later 
perusal.  I had never heard of extropianism (adding the word to my 
email's dictionary now. :), but the one paragraph mission statement, 
was enough to warrant a little more research.

This past weekend, I went back to the site and took the time to read 
through some of the material there.  First, I read Extropian 
Principles 3.0, and I must at very least say, "Wow!"

If you'd know me, you'd know that I'm not prone to emotionally 
rendered superlatives in my everyday life.  Normally, I couldn't 
imagine joining a mailing list and gushing "Wow!" in front of a bunch 
of strangers - but more than anything, I wanted to express this 
particular emotion to the group that has elicited it, while it was 
still fresh in my mind.

I have never in my thirty-two years read any type of statement of 
principles that so thoroughly agrees with my own outlook on life. 
The mix of libertarianism and rationalism combined with the 
forward-thinking goal of using technology to better ourselves in 
every way possible sounds too good to be true.

I'm really hoping that what's inside the box is as wonderful as the 
wrapping paper - and I'll be lurking for quite some time while I try 
to figure that very thing out.  It'll also take me a bit to get 
through that recommended reading list - ugh, homework! :)

Best Regards,

Chris Russo

the portrayal of the index "6000" is shoddy.  it is way too large for
me to believe it (real numbers are never that large and pretty).
instability equals go (in all contexts?).

Hi Steve.

Boy, you are a slippery one.

You're pretty good at "not being wrong," ain'tcha?

You're right Steve.  So let's not assume that everything is simple.  In
addition, at the other extreme, let us not practice the deliberate
obfuscation and/or avoidance of the issues by continual reference to the
unknowability of all things.  Can we agree that even in the absence of
purely predictable/deterministic properties, we, as cognizant beings, can
proceed anyway, and musn't be paralyzed with indecision?

Again, yes, there are intangibles, but that's not what I'm talking about.
Further, I'm not even saying that *I'm* the one who gets to decide what a
limiting ideology is.

To be achingly clear:  all you're arguing here is that, for some reason,
that belief may NOT be limiting in this particular case.  Fine.  If you hold
that to be the case, then it's a bad example.  The point remains: we should
try to remove the genuinely limiting ideologies.

Let me further refine my usage of the term limiting, lest you deliberately
mis-interpret my intention (whoops, too late.)  The type of ideologies I'm
talking about removing are the ones that limit the individual from achieving
'good things.'  (or increased utility, or however you want to define it.)
You choose to argue the minutiae, "oh no Jason, that's not a limiting
ideology for this and that such and such reasons."  Fine.  I agree the
consequences of actions and ideologies are debatable.  The point remains: IF
an ideology limits an individual from increasing utility, THEN it should be
stripped away.

Read that sentence again, carefully.

I'm not interested in arguing the IFs with you-- clearly we disagree on that
point: (JW Betty may be happy with her beliefs, but if her and I are in
adjacent operating rooms, facing blood transfusions, only one of us is
walking home tomorrow.  Joe's concern with being seen as someone who is
always hitting on girls is the limiting insecurity of someone who can't
approach people on a friendly level without constantly worrying about the
public perception.  Theo's insistence on drinking poison kool-aid to join
his alien liberators is a major stumbling block to his apparent goal of
exploring the universe.)

I'm not talking about -every- belief structure Steve, as the paragraph above
states in brutal, nay, shocking clarity.  Where do you get these
counter-arguments from?  Why don't you just answer the question?  I won't
hold it against you if you say yes.  If fact, it might re-assure me that you
weren't simply being difficult (whoops, too late.)


> I do not see your oversimplistic view as having any merit.

Fair enough.  You think things are complicated.  Mostly, they are.
Situational and environmental modifiers rear their ugly heads.  However, a
simple core truth remains, and I have personally reaped the benefits from
understanding it:  Humans often hold arbitrary beliefs that are negatively
limiting.  Humans should try to identify such beliefs and remove them (so as
to no longer be arbitrarily limited.)  Your protestations against this
'oversimplistic view' are argumentative and unhelpful.  The abstractions you
introduce to this discussion seem designed to preserve your authority over
the process of human therapy.  You don't need to do that-- I surrender to
your authority regarding the frequent complexity of procedure.

-I- however have luckily (and in the absence of expert advice) achieved
whiz-bang results from the logical observation of my own limiting ideologies
and the subsequent removal thereof.  Still a work in progress, I am pleased
to report that my level of personal empowerment is currently quite high.
I'm actually still quite in a state of amazement regarding the incredibly
good things that have happened to me in the last two years, wow--
particularly the last 2 months in fact.  Again, there's no self-help
literature, no expert psycho-analysis and no12 step plan behind my progress.
For me, at least, it -was- simple Steve: observation of self, determination
to optimize.  I would recommend this philosophy to list members if I wasn't
extremely cognizant of the fact that most have already adopted some version
of it.  Determine to optimize!

If you *really* think this is what I meant by 'limiting', then I hope I have
addressed this above.

But, come on Steve.  Please.

What is a human?  What is it about -you- that makes you "not-a-human?"

Ah, I see.  You don't trust other people who might empower themselves.  Fair
enough.  So what's your strategy then?  Is it your intention to prevent
other individuals from embracing rational self-empowerment?

Probably that's what he tell himself.  Again -->
http://www.wildghost.com/mandela.htm
More likely its fear-- and the longer that Joe perpetuates this belief
structure, the less likely that he'll actually sit down and do something:
write his book, say hello to someone nice.  If he's lucky, he'll get knocked
out of this negative attractor state by a major situational modifier.

On the other hand, if Joe is perfectly content to be alone and unpublished
(which I'll grant may be the case,) then, hey, more power to him.

I'm not able to read big words, so don't bother.  I'm actually quite slow,
you know.

For instance, I'm totally incapable of recognizing how your above paragraph
invalidates (or even remotely addresses) my statement that: "Environments
have decreased relevancy to our existence if we don't actually get to
"mentally interface" with them."

In fact, to my painfully addled intellect, your above paragraph appears to
be an attempt at tangential obfuscation by authority-- and seems to
demonstrate an unwillingness to agree with (or engage) a relatively
innocuous statement.

Perhaps, in deference to my ignorance regarding "E-1 non-primal-eye
infinite-state self-organizing" brain theory, you could (in detail) explain
how said terms increase the relevancy of environments that we don't actually
get to mentally interface with.

Dude!  I'm not judging the Amish.  Hey, I say: "Go Amish!"  I -love- the
Amish!

But, you'll grant (I hope, dear God, I hope) that if a particular Amish
wants to, oh... visit Mir for instance, he/she has some ideological hurdles
to overcome.

Well, if we -all- live in trance, then so what?  It's irrelevant if there is
no such thing as "NOT-trance."

Well, if you want to place the agenda of self-empowerment into an ethical
context (I touched on this briefly with my 'spirit of compassion'
statements,) then I'll have to state that I am pretty much a utilitarian.
As much utility as possible, for as many people as possible, for as long as
possible.

So, if you're asking, do I agree with ALL forms of personal empowerment, my
answer is a definitive no.  I'm a big fan of lots of them, however.

Two of my heroes are Larry Flynt and Dr. Kevorkian. Both of them treat 
absurd laws (against obscenity, and against ownership of your own life) with 
open defiance. I'd like to ultimately see government whither, by the method 
of people just not taking it seriously. This happens once in a while but the 
people who do it usually end up suffering. In Flynt's case, he got away with 
it, though fairly bruised. Kevorkian, currently in prison, doesn't seem to 
be getting away with it. I hope these two are the Galileos of a trend which 
will ultimately cause the government to whither down to the size that the 
Catholic Church has. You'll know it's a serious trend when you see large 
corporations openly ignoring violations of their freedom. Here are two 
things I've read which make me think, and hope, that this is starting to 
happen.

http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/18/business/19TAX.html
This is an article about how several companies are refusing to take income 
tax, social security, and medicaire deductions from their employees' 
paychecks. They are also refusing to report their employees' incomes to the 
IRS. So far, they all seem to have gotten away with it, according to this 
article. My favorite parts of the article:
"How many businesses are taunting the I.R.S. this way is impossible to know. 
At least 23... have made their decisions public. Sixty business owners and 
their advisers met on the weekend of Nov. 11 in California to plan how to 
persuade thousands of others to join them."
And this quote from a former IRS commissioner: "This is tremendously 
significant because we have never before had responsible parties  employers 
 refuse to withhold.. The system simply cannot work if they get away with 
this."

http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/112100/yahoo.sml
Another thing I've been impressed with is the French ruling on Yahoo 
auctions selling Nazi war items. Everyone seems to think this is so terrible 
and sets an awful precedent, but I think it's great, because Yahoo will not 
pay the fines, and it will expose government as impotent when attempting to 
act outside its jurisdiction. Hopefully this will lead to offshore-type 
thinking and ventures.
"A Yahoo attorney, Greg Wrenn, contended that France had no jurisdiction in 
the case... He said Yahoo, the world's most popular Internet portal, would 
refuse to pay the fines. "
I only wish they were a little more brazen - like putting up something on 
their site saying "We are fining the French government $130,000 per day 
until they stop being assholes", with an applet counting up the fine. The 
best that could come out of this case would be if a US court ordered them to 
pay the fines, they refused, and got away with it. [on a side note, every 
article on this seems to suggest it's Nazis who are buying and selling this 
stuff. I'm sure some of them are Nazis, but if you have a grandparent or 
uncle who served in WWII, you know this is not usually the case].

Magic is a term that can be ascribed to technology sufficiently
futuristic or alien compared to the current technology.

About the Qabalah, I often read strings of letters.

So, that is about archaicly technical modes of operation.

Astrology is seasonal, the magnetic wavelengths around the sun during
life probably affect development.  Accupuncture is rumored to have some
effects.

Anything can be marginal compared to something else.

To displace magic, it would be necessary to discard the fact that alien
or superior technology, or just not necessarily technology but state of
existence, might exist.  That is inherently unprovable.

So, there could always be magic.

Here is my Computer AI drill instructor quote:  "Get down and give 480
billion reps."  It is about the set of computer management computers.

Note that it's been going down (towards peace) over the past several
weeks.  I'd actually say it's "despite" Israel's recent flare ups, and
possibly "because of" the Bush-Gore problem.  (Less mandate for the US
pres. = less ability to try to enforce views on other nations = less
chance of violent conflicts over same, maybe?)

I read an article, in _Liberty_ I believe, that stated Kevorkian does not
believe in self-ownership but in a doctor's and society's right to
euthanize.  If this is true, he's no champion of liberty and can join Peter
Singer as a champion of the same ideals as were extolled by certain groups
who will remain unmentioned lest the thread devolve to purely emotional
rants (again:).

I hope I am wrong here.

That said, I can understand some people being in favor of antisuicide laws.
They might argue, on purely practical grounds that it might increase the
rate of murder.  After all, they tell me, if someone can get a doctor to rub
someone out...  Not that I agree here, but you can see, I'm sure, the horror
scenario in this.

Cheers!

I hear the Geometric Algebras (Clifford Algebras) can be more expressive
than vector and tensor calculation, which is otherwise exceedingly useful
for computational problems.

I have only seen some of the news video of the protein folding.  There is
valence stretching which was not taught to me, although I would call it a
pendulum (vectored spring).

What if they were just immediately given the chance to know why, such as a
debilitating genetically inherited condition, so if they wanted to know why
they could know, and more fully experience the perhaps more survivable
version.  It is perhaps macabre talk, or not.  What that means is:  the
experiences form themselves.

But does this happen?

My impression is that such drugs just promote excess ovulation (and hence
`fraternal' twinning), rather than conducing to splitting a single embryo
shortly after fertilization. The latter would presumably lead swiftly to an
antagonist drug that people might take who wish to *avoid* parenting twins,
triplets, etc, something I haven't heard of.

One of the reasons I've never gone for a second trip (besides the fact that
I'm now a "responsible" husband and father) is I heard that use,
particularly repeated use, can lead to "flashbacks."  Granted my trip was
thoroughly enjoyable, but I don't know that I'd want it kicking back in at
unexpected times.  Say, while on the job....

Do you think that flashbacks are also widely overstated?

As a matter of fact, I do think flashbacks are overstated, both in terms of
frequency and in terms of what they actually comprise.

When I used to imagine what a "flashback" would be like, I imagined walking
down the street and suddenly having a full on psychedelic experience, as if
I had consumed a hallucinogen and were once more under its full effects.

I have never had such an experience.  Nor has anyone reported such an
experience to me.

What I have experienced is as follows:

1) During a psychedelic experience, one observes some phenomena - perhaps
the brownian motion of cream dispersing through your coffee cup.  That
phenomena, which might normally be ignored as quite ordinary, this time
seems quite profound and enchanting.  Perhaps there is even some new and
valid insight into something occurring in the system.

2) Later, in a "sober" state, one comes back into contact with that same
phenomena.  This time the swirling of cream in coffee is far more
interesting when it was before you observed it in a psychedelic state.  The
observation also triggers memory of that psychedelic state, and perhaps
elicits the observation of other perceptual details that one normally
overlooks in day to day life.  However one's overall conscious state
remains quite "sober".  

I find this pattern to be about what I expect.  When under the influence of
a psychedelic, one files away experiences and learns from them, much as one
would in any other conscious state.  So it is not surprising that the
things one learned (illusory or not, useful or not) return to consciousness
when triggered by the same stimuli which originally elicited them.

Over the longer term I have found that there is a closer coupling of my
"sober" and "psychedelic" states of consciousness.  As a less experienced
tripper I was less able to discern potentially useful insights from those
that would make little sense when the drug wore off.  I was also less able
to bring useful meta-programming out of the psychedelic trip and into
effect in my everyday existence.  I feel that time and experience have
honed both of these skills.

regards,
mez

I think we should have as full information as practicable. This makes

Indeed, but nor should we be too rash ... I am arguing for balance, not for

You do love to generalise ... I am trying to inject some gritty reality into
your speculations because I hate generalisations, particularly in
philosophy.
I think a better way of evaluating ideological propositions might be on
TRUTH value .... utility is an even more nebulous quantity, and my utility
might be to your detriment. Reject ideology because is false, not limiting.

I repeat, reject ideology because is false, not on grounds that it is
limiting.
True beliefs, such as that I am not superman or batman, are limiting, but
work.

You are generalising from the particular in the same way that an evangelical
Christian gives their testimony .... Hallelujah, I have been saved, accept
God and
the same can happen for you ....

Great, it works for you (or you have convinced yourself that it does
by auto-suggestion, same thing) and you wish to share this "revelation".
Problem is, your formulae contains nothing new, is  just an naive
exhortation
to "optimise." NLP is a huge system about remodelling & changing your
meta-programming, getting rid of outworn habitual behaviour &c. What are
you saying that adds to this?

No, just to try and present them with fuller information so as to make

that is no loss to me ....

Are you attempting to use psychobabble jargon to enhance your
own authority here? What evidence do you have for "structure" as opposed for
fairly ad hoc joblots of variable beliefs ..... most folks aren't very
structured.

"Mentally interface" presumably means "think about them." We have
infinite-state
capability so can think about, or imagine, any environments we want. Cite
Leibnitz "all possible worlds."

What potential dangers do you see?

See points I made previously. You cannot deny that our brains are (1) E-1,
or
(2) are self-organising, or (3) are infinite-state (as opposed to mu- or
finite-state.
MVT is based on scientifically repeatable experiments and observations
from nature. Your "theory" is just a personalised lingoistic generalisation.
MVT does explain the mechanisms of all mentation, including dreams.

But, as pro-science Extropians and what-not, we automatically

and therefore must be able to make a strong case for advancement
rather than comfortable stasis (along with its limiting, religious beliefs).

There are various depths of trance .. from wakefulness, through daydreams,
to deep catatonic somnambulism. But, yes, all mentation is "hallucination"
even if fairly mundane such as the hallucination of our internal voice
(thought).
MVT explains this (naturally, I would say that,but happens to be the case).

Sure, I will be very beneficent, and put them in a "better" state of mind.
More people will be happier, therefore you think I should do it?

>So, if you're asking, do I agree with ALL forms of personal empowerment,
my answer is a definitive no.  I'm a big fan of lots of them, however.

Aha, so you are building qualifiers into your initial statement. You haven't
answered my specific case of the mind-control induction though.

By the way, MVT is the way to make conscious machines , so I changed
the thread name again .. sorry for any confusion.

As much as I agree that the laws those guys have fought against are 
absurd:  Is the best solution to just ignore them?

Everyone thinks some law or other is absurd, is the general solution 
for everyone to just ignore the ones they don't like?

Does the existence of factions ignoring sets of laws really reduce 
the size and power of government, or just its effectiveness?  Look at 
the War on Drugs - many politicians think that in order to solve 
defiance of drug laws, they need to spend more money on enforcement, 
which requires more taxpayer dollars, which increases the size of 
government, which increases the power of government, which gives some 
other government pinhead the power to attack some other group 
ignoring laws, and so on, and so on.

If anything, I think that we need to be zealots about both enforcing 
the laws that we have and *drastically* reducing the number of laws 
that needlessly affect our lives.

Just a thought,

Chris Russo

There is quite a bit of information in the "honest" academic literature (not
the propaganda the political-legal system puts out). Let me again recommend
PIHKAL and TIHKAL by Alexander and Ann Shulgin from Amazon. Also the EROWID
web pages:

http://www.erowid.org/index.shtml

The rational approach is harm avoidance. To bet a better view of risk
assessment look at the Dance Safe site page on risk assessment.  

http://www.dancesafe.org/risk.html


It is odd to hear such questions. I am old enough to have lived through the
50's,60's and 70's when not only were these substances legal and unregulated
but seen as one of the methods to improve the human race... extropian even
if that word did not exist then. They were featured in major magazines as a
major breakthrough in the human condition.

A general answer to your flashback question (and it is only a general rule),
given a reasonable stable mental state, water soluble substances pose little
problem of flashbacks although you may never see the world in quite the same
light. Oil soluble substances such as PCP, grass, etc can pose a problem if
they end up in the fat tissues and you at some point lose weight. But this
applies also to most oil soluble such as Phthalates, PCB's, etc. with a
vengeance. Let me highly recommend another book by Deborah Carbury "Altering
Eden".

Yeah, I have seen that mentioned a few times before,

Hi Steve.


On reading your replies, I am increasingly struck by the sensation that you
are having some sort of imaginary argument.  Evidence of this is to be found
in the mysterious spontaneous arguments you continue to construct on my
behalf (and yours.)  Let's take a look and see:

Did I miss something?  When did you heretofore argue for balance?

I absolutely agree that the point is banal and obvious.  You're debating
some sort of mythological argument I never actually made.  I'm not really
saying very much.

Dude, you gotta start somewhere.  You might prefer bottom/up, but why don't
you form some good arguments as to why top/down is bad?  You're introduction
of "
gritty reality" is an attack on specifics and I'm just trying to say: the
above is a valid generalization!  Who are you arguing against?

Uh, *I* said -everyone's- utility (but we can't be sure that you're actually
having this conversation with me.)  If you think truth is a more important
goal than utility, make an argument for it.

 > I repeat, reject ideology because is false, not on grounds that it is

Are you purposefully missing my use of the term 'limiting?'  I thought I had
made it clear that my usage is in reference to limiting utility.  Are you
aware that I proffered that clarification in my last post?



> You are generalising from the particular in the same way that an
evangelical

You interpreted my comments as an evangelical exhortation?  Wow, I'm
impressed.  This person you're arguing against must be saying some pretty
radical stuff.

Revelation?  I thought we agreed that it was banal and obvious.  Which is
it?

Exactly.  So what formula are you talking about?  What is the 'it' to which
you refer above?  Did you interpret my list of four points as a diatribe on
the detailed means by which one could successfully empower themselves?
Curious, I had intended to make a few general and obvious comments.

 NLP is a huge system about remodelling & changing your

Nothing at all.  Strangely, I don't really have an agenda.  Or a formula.
As I thought I'd made clear, for me it was simply making a decision.
Simple, small, naive, banal, obvious-- all of those things.  I'm not talking
about some sort of rapturous transformation here.  I have a very general
intention: observe, improve.  You seem to want to make my comments bigger
than they are so you have something to rail against.


> Glad that I am continually forcing you to modify and qualify your
position.

Actually, you're not Steve.  My position is the same.  What you've done is
forced me to explain to you in aching detail what I meant by my very general
comments.  That's just because, in search of an argument, you've engaged in
semantic game-play over my use of the term 'limiting.'  For most, the phrase
"strip away limiting ideological garbage," is self-evident.  (And very
small, and banal, etc, etc, etc.)

> >What is a human?
>
> One of your so-called limiting belief structures .....

You saying that doesn't make it so.  Let me make my question more clear: to
what do we refer when we use the word: "humans."  How is the word "human" a
belief?


> >What is it about -you- that makes you "not-a-human?"
>
> I have stripped away this limiting belief. Ha!

But, I thought you weren't interesting in stripping away limiting beliefs...
just false ones.  Is your belief that you are not human a 'truer' belief?

Who said I refuse to comprehend MVT?  I haven't even thought about it...
we're a far cry away from me forming the deliberate intention to
NOT-comprehend it.  Are you sure you aren't having a parallel conversation
with someone else?

Also, you just said you don't trust everyone with personal empowerment.  Now
you say you want to: "present them with fuller information so as to make a
more informed choice."  How do you reconcile these apparently contradictory
statements?

Uh, I dunno.  Is that what it looks like to you?  If so, I retract all
statements that appear to be a contrivance designed to demonstrate
authoritative knowledge of human psychology.  I don't have any such
knowledge.  All I know is that some people are limited by fear.  Some people
get stuck in negative attractor states.  Sometimes, big things happen that
get people out of negative attractor states.  Have I said something
controversial or un-intuitive here?

How have you drawn this presumption?  You have been following -this-
discussion, right?  If so, you're aware that "mentally interface" are terms
you introduced and I made use of as a means to describe how we interact with
reality.  If you want mentally interface to mean something else, then it's
not what we're talking about.

Can we imagine environments we don't want?  Does the ability to imagine any
environments we want = ALL possible environments?

Dunno.  Added the word relatively reflexively.  I don't actually see any
dangers, frankly.

I don't deny these things, I just utterly fail to see their relevance to the
statements I made.  How does this conversation keep getting blown up into
evangelical proportions?

That's nice.  So... -you're- the one with the theory, right?

I thought you weren't interested in removing limiting beliefs, just false
ones?  Is it 'false' for the Amish to believe that a simpler life will make
them happy?

Why is "hallucination" a useful concept here?  What is the alternative?

Why did we even start talking about MVT?

If more utility results (and this is debatable,) then, yes, you should do
it.

Again, I'm only doing so to appease your need for semantic nit-picking.  In
real life, I don't need to go around saying things like: "I love ice-cream!
Except for stuff that's been sitting out for 6 weeks, turned brown, and
begun to emit a foul stench."  With you it's like: "I'm in favor of personal
empowerment!  Except the kind of empowerment where someone uses their
god-like mental powers to turn the rest of us into mindless zombies."
It's silly.


> By the way, MVT is the way to make conscious machines , so I changed
> the thread name again .. sorry for any confusion.

Dude, -what- agenda are you pursuing here?  And how did -I- end up being
your guinea pig?  MVT is the way to make conscious machines, so that's the
thread name now?  Hang on a second... are you turning me into a mindless
zombie?

How did this thread end up in a discussion of your theories on mind-control,
hallucinatory mentation or conscious machines?

It seems you've seized on my innocuous comments as a possible platform for
the expression of some of your ideas.  I have no objection to the expression
of your ideas, but dude, you've re-invented my comments into some sort of
comprehensive evangelical personal empowerment theory as a potential
adversary for your own constructs-- and... well, I'm not particularly
interested in playing that role.

Let's take my simplistic comments at face value: the basic exhortation to
optimize (as un-useful as that may be,) and leave me out of the rest of
this... uh... -stuff.-

(I am fully cognizant of the fact that while clear reckoning and simple
determination was effective in my case, your mileage may vary.)

Thanks.

Welcome

I think that the general sentiment is that being an extropian/transhuman is
not something you learn. It is something you are and then discover what is
called.

Most of us here has had this experience.

I've seen the phrase bandied about.  Not sure of its meaning.  What do you
mean by "meta-programming?"

Well, this is true, but at the same time it is not enough to just
share the views and values. It is also important to transform the
views into personal (and hopefully external) reality. Going from just
thinking that an enhanced life is possible to actually living an
enhanced life is not simple or easy. It is something we have to work
on. It may start small, but grow into something grand.

Who programs the programmer?

The idea is that you can reprogram yourself, change the habits, ways
of thinking or beliefs you have by going into a special state where
they become fluid and you can reset them. I guess the the term
originates with John Lilly in his book _Programming and
Metaprogramming the Human Biocomputer_. Robert Anton Wilson did a lot
of popularization of this idea (cf. _Prometheus Rising_).

In my view (as a computational neuroscientist interested in learning),
the idea isn't bad at all. My main problem with it is that most of the
drugs around produce states that may produce a very fluid view of
reality, but they also make the users so confused that it is hard for
them to do the desirable changes. I think (the early) Leary and others
meant that this was why psychedelics should only be used in a clinical
setting where an expert helped the user to exploit the state.

>From a neuroscience point of view, the drugs also seem to be a bit
crude when it comes to modulating plasticity. Ideally, we should have
drugs that affected only some of the memory and learning systems so
that the effects were more directed and less prone to random
inprinting. Here I think current memory research will produce a lot of
interesting chemicals over the next years as the biochemistry of
memory continues to be discovered (what a wonderful time to work in!
things are happening *fast* right now!  :-).

Personally I think other means such as self-hypnosis and
self-suggestion (enhanced for example by ritual) can be even very
useful metaprogramming tools.

The first microscopic "helicopters", which could one day carry out medical 
tasks inside the body, have been built and test-driven by scientists. 
The devices, no bigger than a virus particle, could eventually move around 
the human body, ministering to its needs or dispensing drugs. 

The metal rotors of the tiny machines are powered by the body's natural fuel, 
a chemical called ATP. 

When the biomotors were tested in the laboratory, they were able to drive the 
helicopter's propellers using the fuel of the body for up to two-and-a-half 
hours. 



With this demonstration, we believe we are defining a whole new technology
 
Carlo Montemagno  
This is an important first step towards producing miniature machines capable 
of functioning inside the living cell. 

The tiny helicopters consist of three parts - metal propellers and a 
biological component attached to a metal post. 

'Physiology of life' 

When the three components are mixed together, the tiny machines 
self-assemble. 

The biological material converts the body's biochemical fuel, ATP, into 
energy. This is used to turn the propellers at a rate of eight rotations per 
second. 

A team at Cornell University, Ithaca, US, carried out the work. 

Carlo Montemagno who led the team said: "With this demonstration, we believe 
we are defining a whole new technology. 

"We have shown that hybrid nanodevices can be assembled, maintained and 
repaired using the physiology of life." 

This is only a first step as the technology is still very inefficient. Only 
five of the first 400 biomotors worked. And scientists will have to show that 
the machines can function inside the living cell, something that may take 
many years to achieve.

According to the analysis in Robert Freitas' book Nanomedicine, rotors
don't work well at the cellular scale.  The fluid dynamics are wrong.
Propellors rely on turbulence and vortices but it is hard to get that
at the ultra-small scale.

Bored, probably not original, but oh well, late as
night, seems like good entertainment for me to watch
it get eaten alive:
1. The law of noncontradiction states that there must
be no contradictions because a contradiction implies
everything, and we do not perceive everything to be
the case.
2. Amidst that implied everything would necessarily be
an implied
mind-which-does-not-perceive-everything-to-be-the-case.
3. This indicates that the LNC is indeterminable.
4. Which means that there could exist possible worlds
where it doesn't operate without everything being
apparently the case.  
5. But it also means that within that field of things
which have been infinitely implied, there must exist
some statement, "The LNC is universal and tautologous"
which is necessarily correct.
6. But that would be a contradiction, because for it
to come about, there must exist some area of
nonuniversality where the LNC is not a tautology.
7. Which wouldn't matter in the case of it not
mattering- but would imply that the contradiction
existed through every possible world.
8. Further, as far as I can tell, there's no possible
way to tell the difference between a reality which is
reasonable and logical and self contained/consistent
constructed as a necessity within an infinite scope of
variety, and a world that exists because it is
reasonable and self-consistent and follows the rules
of formal reasoning.

I wrote a review of PIHKAL 8 years ago, if anyone is interested to know
more about the book. I still think that it is one of the most courageous
books that I have ever read.

When I wrote the review in 1992, I shared it with the authors
Alexander and Ann Shulgin, and they liked it a great deal. Ann
wanted to use it somehow to promote the book, but we never followed
up on it.

Until I decide better what to do with the review, I will put it
for a short time at my anonymous ftp site:

ftp://ftp.amara.com/pihkal.ps.gz

OR

ftp ftp.amara.com
binary
get pihkal.ps.gz

[Then gunzip it, and print it to your postscript printer ...]

I'll leave it at my site until November 30.

Being so far behind and out of sync in my correspondence, I won't try to 
respond to specific posts here, but I would like to just comment on the 
general subject matter.  As a scientific rationalist, I strongly reject most 
claims to TRUTH made by mystics.  However, I think it would be a serious 
mistake to conclude that there is no real value in studying or even "using" 
much of the pre-scientific symbolic substrate we inherit in our cultural 
patrimony.  Having spent a good deal of time when I was younger reading Carl 
Jung and also having read widely (but not deeply, in most instances) 
regarding the various Western pre-Christian and Asian religious and mystical 
traditions, I believe there IS much of value in understanding and even 
"playing with" such ideas.

The human mind is a complex, evolved system. We evolved as emotional beings 
and developed an array of genetically and memetically inherited heuristics to 
deal with a complex world that did not come with a user's manual.  Symbolic 
systems that evolved in this milieu conveyed some survival value on the 
humans that came to adopt them.  Now, of course, any such system was heavily 
context-dependent, so they can become counter-adaptive if the physical or 
cultural environment changes faster than the systems themselves can evolve.  
But elements of such systems that have persisted or independently evolved 
across cultures are worth studying, both for what they teach us about our own 
heritage and current nature and also for what they might reveal in terms of 
real wisdom that may be highly independent of specific context.

That makes sense. Perhaps we should consider it a proof of principle, 
development; much like the 'successes' of the steam-powered automobiles, last 
century.

hysteron proteron (HIS-tuh-ron PROT-uh-ron) noun

1. A figure of speech in which the natural or rational order of its

A few interesting facts from the book "Living To 100" by Dr Thomas
T. Perls and Margery Hutter Silver.

* after the age of 65, women outnumber men 3-1.

* 85% of centenarians are women.

Another interesting fact confirmed in this book is the very bad
effects excess iron has on men. Iron ions are required for free
radical formation. So once again it is confirmed that men should
NOT take supplements containing iron, and the author suggests
regular blood donations as a way to lessen the iron load for men,
(I donate platelets bimonthly) apparently in a study such men have
lower risk for iron related cardiac problems. (heart
attacks/arteriosclerosis).

The argument is that the income tax is unconstitutional as a mandatory

Clinton was elected with less of the vote, and he's gotten us involved
in more military adventures than Ford, Carter, Reaga, and Bush put
together. A weak president (especially a democratic one) is more likely
to instigate military options to prop up poll ratings (the American
public loves it when some alleged-no-good-bastard is having a bad day
care of the Defense Department). If Bush wins, as it looks like he will,
despite all the games Gore is playing, he will have a Republican
congress backing him.

I was under the impression that the rotors being used have very broad
chord blades, which replicate insect aerodynamics. At nanoscale, I would
imagine that any propulsion device using rotors or wings would have to
be able to work like the blades were tennis rackets, flying about in an
environment of high speed ping-pong balls. If the fluid is dense enough,
it should work.

In my terraforming paper I wrote, I came up with the concept of a large
buckeyball (C-360  or larger) molecule with no matter inside should be
bouyant in a 1 bar atmosphere, as a nano-balloon (my CO2 sequestering
nanites would have these on their bodies to float in the atmosphere
above the point where the atmosphere was too hot for the carbon to not
burn up).

I thought iron atoms were mainly used by blood cells- by what chemical

Everything is basically real.

Mathematics is a very wide subject.  I like to follow it because it
helps me understand how something would happen.  I don't know much about
the intricacies of the regular polygons.

I have read some Russell and some other math books.  I read the sci.math
and sci.logic groups sometimes to learn more.

I'm not sure its a big enough difference to make a difference, but one
salient difference is that in one case the parents are putting themselves
at a similar risk to the one they impose on their children, and in the
other case it is only the children who are put at risk by the parents.

Indeed iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, which when
incorporated inside red blood cells is esential.

The problem as I understood it is that EXCESS iron in the blood
reeks havoc. (oxidation) In the book "RealAge" I mentioned a few
days ago, the doctor mentions a case where a young (24) man is
brought in in terrible shape, and experiencing life threatening
heart problems. The young man only months before was benching 360
and now was in terrible health.

A through history by the doctor revealed he was taking 10 grams of
iron a day as a supplement, it almost killed him. Fortunately after
treatment to remove the excess iron he made a complete recovery.

I don't have the book handy today but maybe a search on RealAge.com
would bring up the relevant papers.

Several health books I've read recently have pointed out that men
get more than enough iron in their diet, and that any
supplementation is detrimental rather than helpfull.

Which sounds convincing... yet makes me terribly suspicious.  The plural
of "anecdote" is not "data".  Does the book also mention a study where ten
grams of iron per day was being fed to hamsters or rhesus monkeys, all of
whom experienced life-threatening heart problems after six months, as
opposed to none for the control group?

Those appear to be some technical experts.  There is some more on
http://logic.stanford.edu/, also http://plato.stanford.edu/.

They're intuitive statements.  If the reference you note is about the
Principia Physica.  I think that there exist anti-foundational logics.

The reference below (to the Finnish study) is just one of many:

www.amni.com/reprints/iron.html

Iron overload is a well documented medical problem, a google search
of "Iron Overload" yielded a plethora of related materials.

Frequent transfusions are a common source, and they're some genetic
diseases that also occur.

I've seen enough to convince me.

Insects have two differences, first they are in air, and secondly they
are thousands to a million times bigger than what we are talking about.

In 9.4.2.1 of Nanomedicine, Freitas compares a human swimming underwater
with a bacterium.  There are two forces, inertia and viscous drag.
For a human swimmer inertial force is 10 Newtons and viscous force is
.0001 Newtons, a ratio of 10^5.  However for a bacterium the situation
is reversed.  Viscous forces are 10^5 greater than inertial forces.

"The bacterium (or any micron-sized medical robot) lives in a world
dominated by viscosity, where, as an example, the phenomenon of 'coasting'
essentially ceases to exist.  For enstance if motive power to a swimming
nanorobot with radius R = 1 micron and velocity v = 1 cm/sec is suddenly
stopped, then the nanorobot will 'coast' to a halt in time 0.1 microsec
and in a distance 1 nm."

He goes on, "Purcell notes that for a man to be swimming at the same
Reynolds number as his own sperm, he would have to be placed in a swimming
pool full of molasses and then be forbidden to move any part of his body
faster than 1 cm/min, roughly the speed of the minute-hand of a large
wall clock."

In this environment a better model than a propeller is a threaded screw,
which by rotating forces its way forward through the viscous medium.
This is essentially what the bacterial flagellum does.

Freitas discusses flying nanobots in section 9.5.3.1:

"Insects make use of both inertial and viscous forces, often employing
unusual wing flapping patterns and elastic energy storage systems to
remain aloft.  The smallest known flying insect that can make any use
of aerodynamic lift (inertial) forces is the four-winged parasitic
chalcid wasp Encarsia formosa, which has a total wingspan of ~1.4 mm.
Aerobotic machines with wingspans smaller than 100 microns probably must
make almost exclusive use of viscous propulsive forces."

He concludes that flying nanobots would do better to propel themselves
using similar mechanisms to those used by bacteria in water, such as
corkscrew flagellar drives, rather than wings and jets.

>From a post on sci.nanotech by Robert Shimmin, nothing near C-360 will work.
Try C-100000000:
: For a purely back-of-envelope job:
: C-60 has a diameter of 1.2 nm.  Assuming the C-C bond length remains constantish,
: a single buckyball ought to have a bulk density of about density [kg/m3] = 10200 /
: sqrt(# C atoms).
:  
: This gives C60 a density of 1320 kg/m3, abou 60% that of graphite.  To float in air
: (density ~1 kg/m3), you'd need a buckyball with at least 10^8 carbons in it.  It would
: have a diameter of about 1.5 microns.  No clue whether a fullerene this flat could
: withstand atmospheric pressure. 

Freitas has something to say about this in 9.5.3.3:

"What is the tiniest possible lighter-than-air balloon?  J.S. Hall
notes that for a one-atom-thick graphene shell the out-of-plane bending
stiffness of the C-C bond is much lower than the in-plane stretching
stiffness.  This is why hollow fullerenes of submicron diameter are
experimentally observed to collapse (and remain collapsed due to van
der Waals forces) even when their interiors are not evacuated."

Freitas goes on to analyze the weight of internal cross beams
sufficient to prevent collapse, and finds that they weigh too much.
No balloon of this design can float in air "although macroscale
geodesic trusswork-stabilized vacuum balloons cannot be ruled out".
His best approach is to fill the balloon with hydrogen or helium.
A helium filled 13.6 micron fullerene sphere can lift a payload of 1
cubic micron of water.  Generally speaking, powered propulsion will be
superior, as gravitational forces are relatively small at the nanoscale.

BTW the complete text of the book is available online at
www.nanomedicine.com.  This is an astonishingly complete resource for those
interested in the capabilities of nanomachines.  The book is about far more
than medical applications.

Th "...promote the general welfare..." clause covers all that, I believe.

Folks, I just picked this up off cnn.com. Apparently a stratospheric
research balloon has recovered bacteria from high altitudes which shows
signs of being unlike bacteria originating on earth, allegedly a 'novel'
variant of the common bacteria genus. The researchers began this
research when they noticed that some leonid meteors burning up in the
atmosphere were giving off spectral data indicating that bacteria were
burning up. Perhaps finally some proof confirming the Panspermia
Hypothesis???

I completely agree.  Metaprogramming is not in any way tied to the use of
psychedelics.  Self-hypnosis, self-suggestion, meditation, visualization,
NLP, lucid dreaming, and other techniques may all be useful.  Even more
mainstream psychological techniques such as Cognitive Therapy are forms of
meta-programming.

(BTW, I do not mean to endorse all the techniques above.  While they *may*
all be useful, there is a lack of data on the effectiveness of most of
them.)

Yes, often psychedelics can produce confusion, but again I would say that
this is affected by many variables:

Set - the mood, desire, and expectation of the person entering the
psychedelic experience.  If you choose to have a very clear, lucid
experience, chances are better that you will.

Setting - The atmosphere and environment in which you take the drug.  If
you want to have lucid experience, choose a peaceful atmosphere you are
comfortable with.  The home, parks on a sunny day, museums, and many other
venues can be useful for this.

Experience - Initial psychedelic experiences are often confusing, in part
because one is really not sure what to expect.  Second and subsequent
experiences are more known quantities, and thus less rife with confusion
and also more amenable to sculpting by the person embarking on the
experience.

To be clear, my initial psychedelic experiences were purely recreational
(though driven by a desire to broaden my experience of the world and
myself, which I find quite extropic).  It was only later that I found them
to be useful tools, particularly in combination with other techniques
listed above.

cheers,
mez

Nicely stated. Who can have any faith whatsoever in someone who claims to
be "far too compassionate"? If one has no faith in human nature, then one
has no faith in oneself. Compassion is one of the elements of human
nature. (It's human nature that provides us with compassion.) Where does
one get the hubris to consider oneself somehow above all other humans, and
to disavow faith in human nature? Sounds like the position of a Stalin or
Hitler to me. I would *never* trust anyone who claims to be compassionate
while simultaneously asserting the rest of the human race deserves no
trust. It sounds too much like the position of a socialistic megalomaniac.
It seems to me Libertarianism appeals mostly to people who have not
allowed themselves to be brainwashed by the dominant paradigms and memes.

Another interesting story from "Living to 100".

Interested in finding out how much of longevity might be attributed
to genetic components the researchers searched for families of long
lived persons.

They were informed by other researchers that this was unlikely
because then current wisdom had any genetic involvement at being
the result of thousands of genes.

The researchers in fact found a picture in the paper of a man
celebrating his 108th birthday. Looking over his shoulder was his
103 year old sister! They also had a 97 year old sister and
informed the researchers had they arrived two years earlier they
could have talked to two other sisters aged 101 and 102.

The researchers then found two other such families. This pointed to
the possibility of a few genes rather than many.

Now the REALLY interesting part "There was a strong likelihood of
family intermarriage by cousins in two of the three families.
Intermarriage has often been associated with the development of
harmful inherited diseases....We may have found a mirror-image case
in which a positive trait, that of extreme longevity has emerged as
a result of intermarriage. This discovery reinforced our belief
that a small number of genes-perhaps fewer than 10-might be
responsible for extreme longevity in the R family."

Shades of the Howards huh? Somebody get Robert a grant.

Back to the book.....

Did I miss something?  When did you heretofore argue for balance?

I have never said I am against empowerment, only urged caution, and
asfar as I am aware have always argued for balance.

I absolutely agree that the point is banal and obvious.  You're debating
some sort of mythological argument I never actually made.  I'm not really
saying very much.

It is an important topic, and I just wanted to tease more out of it ... am
not really attacking you, or trying to put words in your mouth, just
examining
the statements rather more closely than you might like.

Uh, *I* said -everyone's- utility (but we can't be sure that you're actually
having this conversation with me.)

So what are all these postings .. do you deny their existence?

If you think truth is a more important
goal than utility, make an argument for it.

I thought that is what I have done ... no point in labouring it
too much, it is fairly clear that truth is the better yardstick.

Are you purposefully missing my use of the term 'limiting?'  I thought I had
made it clear that my usage is in reference to limiting utility.  Are you
aware that I proffered that clarification in my last post?

What I want to point out is we have to test where the boundaries/ limits are
by staying within them, since mistakes and overstepping might be
irreversible.

You interpreted my comments as an evangelical exhortation?  Wow, I'm
impressed.  This person you're arguing against must be saying some pretty
radical stuff.

This is the impression you gave, about all the fantastic changes in your
life &c.

Revelation?  I thought we agreed that it was banal and obvious.  Which is

Banal & obvious .... I was trying to be ironic!

Exactly.  So what formula are you talking about?  What is the 'it' to which
you refer above?  Did you interpret my list of four points as a diatribe on
the detailed means by which one could successfully empower themselves?

I just wondered how serious you were.

You saying that doesn't make it so.  Let me make my question more clear: to
what do we refer when we use the word: "humans."  How is the word "human" a
belief?

It is a statement of identity with lot of ideological baggage.
I prefer the neutral "humanoid." "Human" is a belief in the same way
that "posthuman" or "extropian" are beliefs/aims/ideology. Its just
that "human" is more entrenched in the culture, so seems less conjectural.

> >What is it about -you- that makes you "not-a-human?"
>
> I have stripped away this limiting belief. Ha!

But, I thought you weren't interesting in stripping away limiting beliefs...
just false ones.  Is your belief that you are not human a 'truer' belief?

Again, this is my attempt to be ironic at your expense. What I basically
think is that "I" am the authority on my own identity, rather than any
outside observer ... but there is also I feel that the statement is true and
that "human" condition/ weakness/ identity is a limiting belief ... and is
one that can be "stripped away" or at least "seen through".

Your exact phrase was "gobbledegook" ..... so either you have made an effort
to comprehend, and rejected it for some rationale or other ... or you are
genuinely unable to understand what it is ... if this is the case I might be
at
fault for use clumsy or difficult language.

I feel it is important enough, in either case, for me to at least make MVT
more explicit so as to devalue & argue against your "gobbledegook"
insult. If that means destroying the credibility of your own banal and
empty proposition, so be it. I am an unashamed reductionist philosopher
and MVT represents a powerful means of empowerment not just for me, but
for anyone else who cares to apply its findings.

Now

The fuller information process does impose a delay, so eliminates certain
rash implementation. Also we should think how our actions affects the world
"in the round" rather than just the first, selfish, greedy notion that
strikes us.

We all have loads of knowledge of psychology ... don't be bamboozled
by ivory tower academics and qualified psychologists ..  hopefully  this
conversation (even putting aside MVT) might empower you a bit!

There is a big academic literature on "all possible worlds,"

What theory?

Your 4 points towards self empowerment. I use "quote marks" precisely
because
I don't think your ideology deserves to be thought of as a theory.

> MVT does explain the mechanisms of all mentation, including dreams.

That's nice.  So... -you're- the one with the theory, right?

I was the first to *discover* (not invent) MVT back in 1980 .... it is open
to
falsification by you or anybody else, in fact I try to provoke a challenge
to it
on occasions, or find someone with a better theory, but MVT happens to be
true.

I thought you weren't interested in removing limiting beliefs, just false
ones?  Is it 'false' for the Amish to believe that a simpler life will make
them happy?

No, this is a lifestyle choice .. but their claim that God exists is a truth
claim.

Why is "hallucination" a useful concept here?  What is the alternative?

A fair question. I make the distinction between *internally generated*
(hallucinated) mentation and *externally originating* real virtuality ...
in non-jargon, if you speak out load, even to yourself, the voice you hear
is not "hallucinated" in the way that a purely internally generated
simulation
of your voice is. Such hallucinations (dreams, thought) are mundane, and
nothing to worry about though .....

If more utility results (and this is debatable,) then, yes, you should do
it.

Again, I'm only doing so to appease your need for semantic nit-picking.  In
real life, I don't need to go around saying things like: "I love ice-cream!
Except for stuff that's been sitting out for 6 weeks, turned brown, and
begun to emit a foul stench."  With you it's like: "I'm in favor of personal
empowerment!  Except the kind of empowerment where someone uses their
god-like mental powers to turn the rest of us into mindless zombies."
It's silly.

Disagree ... the important thing is to decide the boundaries
for our personal empowerment ... both of us agree that in broad, banal
terms it is a good thing ... I am interested in the praxis more than the
theory.

Don't take this conversation too personally ... I am a professional arguer.

In further support of your comments, I'd add that the numeral "666" never
even occurs or appears in the Bible. The Bible is a translation from Greek
and Aramaic, and until a few hundred years ago, six hundred sixty and six
was written thus: DCLXVI, which is actually a list of the Roman numerals
in descending order.

Michael Lorrey asked,

The author was "St. John the Divine" so he wouldn't have used Hebrew.
Anyway, around that time I think the Hebrews used Roman numerals too.

Hebrew numerals are listed here:
http://members.tripod.com/alphaom/misc/numeri.htm

In Hebrew, it's four hundred, plus two hundred, plus sixty, plus six (four
numerals, reading right to left).

Bottom line: the number is also supposed to be a name or the number of a
name. What do you call a list of numerals in descending (or ascending)
order? Perhaps it's a reference to digital technology? Number theory? Or
maybe the "beast" is the idea of counting, and all that numbers have made
possible (especially computers).

Okay, take out the word "actually" (it isn't actually necessary), and our
troll-o-meter should settle back down, right?
Reality means all that exists. "Exists" means you (or someone you

Well, from reading the paper on the website the announcement seem to
be quite premature, making the Mars Meteor look like solid evidence
(out bad pun, out!). They noted an uncanny resemblance in the spectrum
with that of an E Coli. OK, but that does not show it was an E Coli or
something similar - what other things would also show that peak? Maybe
small carbon particles, for example? 

In order to recover alien bacteria you better grab a meteor, culture
something from it and show that it was not similar to any extant
terrestrial life (or at least shown that the
alien-but-terrestrial-looking E Coli could not have infected the
sample on Earth).

I think this is a nice example of how the media can overhype a rickety
scientific announcement since it is such a cool announcement. Remember
the BT Soulcatcher Chip, electromagnetic black holes and the face on
Mars?

Who's to say that a hallucination is not real?
It would most certainly be a real hallucination.
And in some cases, very real to the person
experiencing it. 
And therefore a real part of reality.

I'd say the cup is both half empty and half full.
Or completely full if you count the top half as

Reality appears to be subject to manipulation

Alien bacteria would not have to be dissimilar from terrestrial life.  I
believe the whole point of the "panspermia" theory is that terrestrial life
is possibly descended from extraterrestrial life.

The reference to the mark of the beast or 666 is made in Revelations 13:18,
which was written in greek.  The passage says, "Let him having reason count
the number of the beast, for it is the number of  man, and its number is six
hundred and sixty-six."

The actual number is in greek numerals (not roman numerals).  Like the
Hebrews and Romans, the Greeks used their alphabet for numbers.  The
numerals here are:

   [Greek-letter Chi] [Greek-letter Xi] [Greek-letter sigma-final]

Chi is the number 600, Xi is the number 60, Sigma-final is 6.  Originally,
an older, obsolete letter Stau was used for 6, later the final form of sigma
was used because it looks very close to Stau.

If these were transliterations from an older Hebrew number or name, it is
not clear what it would be.  The number 666 in Hebrew would be [Mem-final]
for 600, [Sameckh] for 60, and [Vav] for 6.  Phonetically, Ch-X-S in Hebrew
would be hard to spell, since Hebrew as [Cheth] for Chi, but it is not clear
what Xi would be in Hebrew.

Thanks to everyone for commenting on this question. Apparently whether
marriage is extropic or not depends on how we define marriage, how we
experience it individually, and ultimately, how we get on with our
marriage partners. Some of us may be married to technological singularity,
and some may have wed a cryonic community. In any event, undertaking
marriage vows while functioning as a biological carbon unit has not lost
its allure for now, but it may do so for posthumans (we can't know with
presently available data). Also (for now) marriage tends to lend social
credence and respectability to any movement.

As for the element of love in human relationships, Max wrote:
Most studies of which parts of the brain are stimulated by emotions have
focused on "negative" emotions, especially fear. But here are some results
for love. Next time you're gazing at your sweetheart, you can say: "My
darling, as I look into your eyes, I sense a surge in activity in my
anterior cingulate cortex, middle insula and in parts of my putamen and
caudate nucleus." :-)

How many of us would leave our spouses for the chance to merge with an SI
or to upload to a more complex adaptive sentient system, we can't tell
until the real opportunity presents itself. Then again, marriage may have
nothing to do with extropy at all. It's just a matter of individual taste.
I mean, is the color heliotrope extropic? Not in itself obviously, and
neither is marriage (in itself) extropic. Will Mind Children mind if their
parents aren't married? Probably not, but Hans Moravec is married for
other reasons we presume.

If marriage has extropic qualities in and of itself, then that makes
extropians rather conservative vis a vis the social engineering of the
last several decades in Western civilization. No problem. Scientists as a
group are perhaps one of the most conservative populations of all. "Change
the environment. Don't change man," Buckminster Fuller is quoted as saying
somewhere.
(For good reason: If we change ourselves, we may destroy our ability to
change back again [the Dr. Jekyll/ Mr. Hyde problem] but if we keep
ourselves intact, there's always the possibility that we can restore a
damaged environment.)

Internet associations may make it easier for compatible couples to find
each other, or the Net may make marriage seem less interesting and
relevant to the digerati. We won't know until the Digital Generation
answers this question for itself.

Damien Broderick quoted:
"Antisthenes rejoined: If that is your conclusion, Socrates, why do you
not
tutor your own wife,
Xanthippe, one of the most difficult women of times past, present, or
future?"

Perhaps Socrates did not tutor his own wife, Xanthippe, because "Once made
equal to man, woman soon becomes his superior," as he is occasionally
cited as saying. (That statement may have another meaning as well:
defective psyches sometimes become dictatorial and overbearing -- like
Xanthippe -- so don't give them the chance by granting them equality.)

Max M. W. Rasmussen wrote,
"Until we can change our genes, marriage in one name or another will be
here
to stay."

I find that the most compelling perspective in this discussion. When
transitional humans transcend biology, their views of inter-personal
relationships will, it seems to me, have to undergo radical change. The
ultra-extropic step of leaving (carbon-based) biology behind cannot fail
to also leave the memetics of intimate relationship behind as well.

Michael Lorrey wrote,
"Marriage laws in most states are essentially permitting two illiterates
to incorporate as a partnership without any business experience or
training, no assets, and allows them to assume major 18 year debts
(children) every nine months with no credit record or proof of ability to
pay, and the ability to declare bankruptcy on those debts while retaining
ownership of the assets. If that's not a recipe for disaster, I don't know
what is."

In light of this analysis, I'd have to conclude that marriage doesn't seem
extropic, not even a little bit. But some people can make a bad idea work
very well all their lives. That says more about the adaptability and
resourcefulness of people than it says about marriage. The saddest thing
about marriage is that it too often persuades two losers to combine their
misery into one agonizing self-defeat.

Not everyone agrees that marriage is based on biology of course. See for
example:
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/archive/2000/01/2
0/NEWS75.dtl
" ...the kind of official marriage that existed during the times of the
Old Testament isn't around anymore. ... Back then - and for centuries
after - marriage wasn't designed to be a loving and lifelong union between
a man and a woman; it was designed to be a productive and lifelong
contract between a father or brother and a husband for ownership of a
female."
Apparently the modern version of marriage has been around for just a few
hundred years.

At any rate, I think we can all agree that a copious amount of money would
afford one more opportunity to pursue the benefits of extropic activities.
Hence, if you know of an extremely wealthy individual who would like to
discuss marriage, please forward information to me privately.

I agree that this is quite hyped.  When discovering a previously unknown
bacterial strain at an altitude of 10 miles, it seems a more reasonable
hypothesis that the bacteria originated terrestrially and has evolved to
exist at that altitude, rather than supposing that it was deposited there
by a passing comet.

Bacteria are rather highly evolved in the grand scheme of things.  If the
earth was indeed seeded extraterrestrially, I would expect those seeds to
be complex organic chemicals (which there are reasons to believe could form
in space) rather than complete organisms.

Scientific American had an article on the topic last year, which is
available online at
http://www.sciam.com/1999/0799issue/0799bernsteinmike.html  (Sadly it is
quite poorly formatted in the online version.)

cheers,

It's not so much that I want to acknowledge the possibility of imaginary
things existing, but to simply note the fact that if a matter/energy complex
is in a causal relationship with me, it quite obviously exists.

On looking at what I wrote, I see the word "potentially" is somewhat
redundant. I use it to underscore the fact  that the definition includes
matter/energy complexes that are not in any kind of causal relationship with
me now, (for example the hypothetical electrons carrying the hypothetical
thoughts in the hypothetical "brains" of the  hypothetical crystal beings of
Antares 3) but that COULD enter into a causal relationship with me in the
future (by building hypothetical spaceships, hypothetically invading earth,
and hypothetically enslaving me in their hypothetical neutron mines, for
example. :))

Conversely, as concerns a matter energy complex that has NO potential to
share a causal chain with me, I do not feel I can say that it exists in any
reasonable sense of the word. Existence, for me, implies at least the
potential for interaction. If no such potential is present, the two
complexes do not mutually exist.

Scerir: Yes. That is exactly what I mean. Unidirectional observation is the
most non-interfering form of sharing a causal chain. When I observe a thing,
changes happen in my brain. Those changes are in response to a pattern of
photons hitting my eyes, which may be doing so in response to physical
effects impacting some sort of sensor, which are caused by those physical
effects interacting with the thing I am observing. There is a causal chain
that leads from their atoms to my visual cortex.

Even if i am not percieving a thing right now, there is a certain class of
things that I could percieve in the future (the aforementioned aliens) and a
class of things I could not (a square circle, or other similarly logically
impossible oxymorons). The former, I feel, can be said to exist. The latter
do not.

J.R. Molloy: this definition is designed, while not eliminating metaphysical
speculation out-of-hand, to firmly ground said speculation in a decidedly
materialistic and scientific model of human perception. (I.E. Angels may
exist, but if we can see them it is because they are either creating photons
in the outside world or twiddling neurons in my visual cortex.) Does that
help?

We'll know what is and isn't "real", whether it can have causal contact
with our own Universe/Reality or not, when we know why anything exists in
the first place.  This is an experimental question, not a philosophical
one, and we currently don't possess the ability to do the experiment.

It is possible that other Universes or Realities might exist which are not
in any causal contact with our own, but which are supported by independent
and equally valid First Causes.  Or it could be that everything that
exists is necessarily in causal contact.  Again, we'll know which is which
when we analyze our own First Cause, which is not presently something we
have the capability to examine experimentally.

Powering the Nanoworld

Robert F. Service

Whereas most scientists who long to produce nanoscale machines might
look to Henry Ford for inspiration, Devens Gust seems to have his
sights set on John D. Rockefeller. Today, researchers are making
rudimentary nanomachines by harnes-sing biological motor proteins
--such as those involved in muscle contraction--and plunking them down
on surfaces in hopes of getting them to do some new types of
work. That work takes energy.  "If you're going to do this, you will
need fuel," says Gust, a chemist at Arizona State University in
Tempe. And like Rockefeller, whose Standard Oil provided the juice
that launched Ford's automotive revolution, Gust is ready to prime the
pumps.

Gust and a handful of colleagues have built tiny refineries that
convert the energy in sunlight to chemical fuel. The fuel in this case
is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the same energy-rich molecule that
powers chemical reactions inside cells. At last August's meeting of
the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Washington, D.C., Gust reported
that he and his colleagues had collaborated with other groups to run
their protein-based molecular machines on little more than
sunlight. "They're like GM [General Motors] and Ford, and we're like
Exxon," Gust says.

Gust didn't start out to make the world's smallest gas stations. For
much of the past 15 years, he has worked with Arizona State colleagues
Thomas and Ana Moore and numerous students to mimic nature's ability
to harvest light energy--an ability on which nearly all life depends
either directly or indirectly. In 1997, Gust and the Moores reported
in Nature that they had developed a unique photosynthesis mimic inside
the protected confines of liposomes, spherical membranes made from two
layers of fatty lipid molecules.  Spanning those lipid membranes are
three-part molecules called artificial reaction centers, after the
apparatus in chlorophyll that allows plants to absorb sunlight and put
that energy to work. In this case, a square-shaped porphyrin group
absorbs light, which kicks an electron out of its normal ground state
and into a higher energy level, leaving behind a positively charged
electron vacancy called a hole. The electron and hole are then snapped
up by a pair of chemical groups in the reaction centers, separating
the charges and creating a chemical potential. In a multistep process,
the electron-grabbing molecule then uses this charge separation to
shuttle protons from the outside to the inside of the liposome.

Light-harvesting bacteria and plants use a similar buildup of protons
and a protein called ATP synthase to generate ATP. And following
nature's lead, in another Nature paper in 1998, the Arizona State
researchers showed that they could incorporate ATP synthase proteins
inside their liposomes and generate ATP. As the protons pass through
the ATP synthase molecule to the outside of the liposome, they cause
the protein to spin, a mechanical motion that helps create ATP, which
is dumped outside the liposome.

That set the stage for powering nanotech devices. One such set of
devices--nanopropellers--is being developed by Carlo Montemagno of
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and is reported on page 1555
of this issue. Montemagno and his colleagues also use ATP synthase,
which harbors a tiny shaft that spins inside a cylinder. But in this
case they anchor copies of the protein rotor on surfaces. They then
fuse tiny metal bars to the top of the shaft, creating what looks like
a nanoscale version of a helicopter blade that rotates when it's fed
ATP.

To set these minichoppers spinning, Montemagno and his colleagues
normally just spike a solution by covering them with ATP. But if
nanomachines are ever to have a more independent future, researchers
will need simpler ways of providing them with energy. So Gust recently
teamed up with Montemagno to supply the ATP-generating liposomes. By
merely adding them to the nanocopter solution and then shining light
on them, the researchers showed that they could set the blades
spinning. Michael Therien, a chemist at the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia, says he's impressed with the work. "It's a first step
to a purely engineered system" of nanomachines that can work without
human intervention, he says.

Gust has also begun teaming up with Viola Vogel and colleagues at the
University of Washington, Seattle, to help power a series of
nanoshuttles that also make use of ATP-driven biological motors to do
the work.  Finally, Gust's team has adapted its artificial
photosynthesis scheme to do what plants do best: convert CO2 into more
complex molecules. At the ACS meeting, Gust reported that his team can
start with a compound called pyruvate and add the carbon from a CO2
molecule to make oxaloacetate. Gust believes he and his team may
eventually be able to coax their tiny refineries to regenerate complex
hydrocarbons such as those found in gasoline from simple sunlight and
CO2. If so, nanorefineries may one day be the key to powering both the
nanoworld and the world at large.

Is Nanotechnology Dangerous?

Robert F. Service

The only realistic alternative I see is relinquishment: to limit
development of the technologies that are too dangerous, by limiting
our pursuit of certain kinds of knowledge.

Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, in the April issue of Wired.

Bill Joy is nobody's Luddite. As co-founder and chief scientist of Sun
Microsystems in Palo Alto, California, he can match technophile
credentials with anybody on the planet. So when he argued that
research into nanotechnology and other fields should be stopped before
it wipes out humanity, humanity took notice.

To the legion of chemists, physicists, and materials scientists who
spend their lives trying to understand and manipulate matter at the
nanoscale, Joy's warning--published in the April issue of Wired
magazine--felt like a bucket of ice water poured over their
heads. Others had raised similar concerns for decades. But Joy's
status among the digerati lent his allegations new heft. His fears of
nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and robotics research were
broadcast worldwide by news organizations including the Los Angeles
Times and CNN.

Other voices joined the chorus of woe. In June, a group of
nanotechnology aficionados released what they called the Foresight
guidelines. Like Joy, they raised the specter of nanotechnology out of
control. But rather than simply calling for a halt to research, they
outlined measures they said would encourage governmental oversight of
nanotech's development. Such supervision, they argued, could help
prevent accidental catastrophe, much as the National Institutes of
Health's guidelines on recombinant DNA technology helped the emerging
biotech industry avoid accidental releases of genetically modified
organisms.

At first, stunned nanoscience researchers quietly shrugged off the
concerns. But more recently, they've begun to fight back, arguing
vehemently at meetings that what Joy and others fear is at best
implausible and more likely plain wrong. "The research community needs
to divorce itself from the lunatic fringe," says Steven Block, a
biophysicist at Stanford University in Palo Alto.

These fears date back to the 1986 book Engines of Creation, by K. Eric
Drexler. In it, Drexler, a theoretician and chair of a nanotech think
tank called the Foresight Institute, paints a picture of utopia that
will result from the coming age of nanotechnology, a time when
miniature "assemblers" will run atomic-scale assembly lines,
fabricating virtually any imaginable product from the ground up, be it
a car, a carpet, or the steak for your grill. But Drexler also applies
his vivid imagination to nanotechnology's potential downside.  Of
particular concern is something he dubs the "grey goo" problem, in
which assemblers replicate themselves ad infinitum, consuming
everything in their path, including plants, pets, and people.

In his Wired article, Joy admits that on the advice of scientist
friends, he initially dismissed Drexler's prophesies of nanoboom and
nanodoom. But last summer, he says, he learned that hypothetical
pieces of futuristic tiny machines were falling into place. One
component of such assemblers--molecule-sized electronic devices--was
"now practical," Joy writes. Further-more, he learned that
self-replication--a feared component of nanomachines running amok--has
already gone beyond biological systems: Researchers had shown that
simple peptide molecules can catalyze their own reproduction. Although
perhaps not around the next bend, self-reproducing nanomachines were
becoming all too plausible, Joy concluded. And that spelled danger.

But all it really spells, Block and others say, is a flawed
extrapolation of current capabilities into the future.  "This has all
the depth of a parking lot puddle," says Block. It's simply incorrect
to make the logical leap that, just because simple molecules can
reproduce, scientists and engineers will be able to construct complex
nanomachines that do the same thing. "Nobody has a clue how to build a
nanoassembler, much less get one to reproduce," Block says. Biological
systems, of course, reproduce. But they are both far larger than the
nanoscale and fantastically complex, with separate systems to store
and copy genetic information, produce energy, assemble proteins,
transport nutrients, and so on. Viruses, by contrast, are nanosized,
points out Viola Vogel, a nanoscientist at the University of
Washington, Seattle. But they can reproduce only by co-opting the
machinery of living cells. "Even nature did not make a nanoscale
structure that can self-replicate," she says.

Richard Smalley, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist at Rice University in
Houston, Texas, says that there are several good reasons to believe
that nanomachines of the sort imagined by Drexler and company can
never be made. "To put it bluntly, I think it's impossible," Smalley
says. As he sees it, the idea of little machines that grab atoms and
assemble them into desired arrangements suffers from three
faults. First, he says, it's wrong to think you can just manipulate an
individual atom without handling the ones around it as well. "The
essence of chemistry is missing here. Chemistry is not just sticking
one atom in one place and then going and grabbing another. Chemistry
is the concerted motion of at least 10 atoms." That means to move that
one atom where you want it, you'll need 10 nanosized appendages to
handle it along with all of its neighbors.

Which raises the second problem--what Smalley calls the "fat fingers"
problem. A nanometer is just the width of eight oxygen atoms. So even
if you're trying to build something hundreds of nanometers in size,
"there's just not enough room" in that space to fit those 10 fingers
along with everything they are trying to manipulate. Finally, there's
the "sticky fingers" problem: Even if you could wedge all those little
claspers in there with their atomic cargo, you'd have to get them to
release those atoms on command. "My advice is, don't worry about
self-replicating nanobots," says Smalley. "It's not real now and will
never be in the future."

In an e-mail exchange, Joy replies that he agrees that at the moment
the task of making nanobots seems implausible. "No one denies it's
beyond the state of the art today, but many people see that this isn't
sufficient, in an era of such rapid progress, to allay our concerns."
Twenty or 30 years in the future, he argues, some combination of a
chemical self-assembly process and a bit of directed placement of
other atoms could create synthetic organisms that prey on cells just
as viruses do. And although researchers may raise objections to
specific schemes for making nanobots, "where is the reasoned argument
that says this is impossible?" Joy asks. "Must we have a demonstration
of the danger--a grey goo accident--before we act?"

But this focus on what is possible is beside the point, says Irwin
Feller, who directs the Institute for Policy Research and Evaluation
at Pennsylvania State University, University Park. "All things may be
possible," Feller says. "But society will not place equal value on all
things." Or equal concern, for that matter, if the things are
considered wildly improbable.

Which is not to say there are not reasons to be concerned about
nanotechnology. At a meeting sponsored by the National Science
Foundation in September, representatives from the research community,
think tanks, and government funding agencies huddled to discuss
emerging concerns for the field. Rather than nanobots, the greatest
issues were social: Is the educational system up to the task of
training enough nanotech workers?  Could nanoscience's progress in
areas such as electronics undermine traditional businesses on which
thousands of jobs depend? Could the decreasing cost of tools for doing
nanoscience and molecular biology make it easier for terrorists or
other small groups to engineer dangerous microbes? Such concerns, the
researchers concluded, are very real indeed.

But that wasn't all. The biggest problem nanotechnology could face
down the road is public acceptance, said Richard Klausner, head of the
National Cancer Institute. Klausner wasn't worried about
nanobots. Rather, he argued that nanoscience is exploring numerous
revolutionary medical applications, such as creating implantable
sensors to watch for the signature molecules of cancer. But unless
patients are aware of the development of such tools beforehand, many
of them may balk at having their bodies invaded by technology.

To better understand such concerns ahead of time, researchers need to
involve outsiders in the development process, much as AIDS activists
helped set priorities for research on AIDS drugs, says Klausner. "I
think that didn't happen very effectively over the last 10 years with
genetically modified organisms," he adds. And that's a danger that
nanotechnology developers would like to avoid.

Taking the Initiative

Robert Coontz and Phil Szuromi

It has been almost a decade since Science devoted a special issue to
nanotechnology, and even the title of that issue ("Engineering a Small
World," 29 November 1991) reflected the scarcity of actual working
nanotechnology at the time. Like others, we pointed to Richard
Feynman's 1959 lecture "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" to
provide some justification for why nanotechnology would emerge as a
discipline from early efforts in atomic imaging and
nanofabrication. The present special issue can reflect only some of
the current trends in this rapidly expanding area.

In the News section (p. 1524), writer Robert Service surveys
nanotechnology's near-term prospects: the role of funding infusions,
such as the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative and its European
and Japanese counterparts, and the real promise of new materials and
devices. He also takes a jaundiced view of some of the prophecies of
boom and doom made by the field's boosters and critics. Meanwhile,
amid the nanohype, researchers are forging ahead on several exciting
fronts. Short profiles of five research groups aim to give some sense
of the range of work now under way throughout the world, without
pretending to be exemplary or comprehensive.

Three Reviews focus mainly on nanomechanics, which builds on (or
perhaps below) the advances that have been witnessed in
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Some of the MEMS advances are
stunning enough in themselves. For example, micromirror arrays
developed at Lucent can be tilted to steer light beams from one
channel to another for routing fiber-optic signals. Craighead
(p. 1532) discusses how even smaller nanoelectromechanical systems
(NEMS) will have higher resonant frequencies and lower masses that
will facilitate several new applications. Complex freestanding
structures can now be fabricated and used, for example, to sense
adsorbed mass, or as radiofrequency devices in the 1- to 10-megahertz
range. These structures can be set in motion with applied electrical
fields or with piezoelectric driving of supports.  Sacrificial
fabrication can also be used to create channel structures of varying
complexity for fluidic systems and molecular separations.

Although many nanomechanical systems have been fabricated in hard,
inorganic materials, polymeric materials are now being exploited for
micromechanics and nanofabrication. Quake and Scherer (p. 1536) point
out that soft polymeric systems have some natural advantages in
fluidics, in that the pumps and valves used in "labs on chips"
normally need soft seals and seats to work seamlessly. Soft materials
can be molded and assembled in layers to leave complex fluidic
networks or to create diffractive optical elements.

Producing complex movements in devices is still a challenge,
especially for potential applications in biological systems. Jager et
al. (p. 1540) review how conducting polymers could solve some
problems.  Bimorph actuators produce movement through the differential
expansion of a layer of one material pressed against a dissimilar
material. In polypyrrole-gold bimorphs, an applied electrical field
creates a volume change in the polymer that produces motion (and can
even peel a newly fabricated device from its supports).  These
actuators could find use as cell manipulators or as microrobots, all
within a cellular milieu.

Nanotechnologists are now creating devices the performance of which
will be tested and improved by new experiments and by more accurate
theoretical treatments. Although there is still plenty of "room at the
bottom," researchers have done much more than stake out claim sites:
They are digging in.

NanoManipulator Lets Chemists Go Mano a Mano
With Molecules

Mark Sincell*

Interacting with the nanoworld is like shadowboxing in the
dark. Because objects only a few molecules across are too small to be
seen or touched directly, scientists approach them essentially blind
and numb. Now a team of physicists, chemists, biologists, and computer
scientists at the University of North Carolina (UNC), Chapel Hill, has
developed a tool that restores their eyes and fingers. It's called the
nanoManipulator.

"It is like the movie Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, except you don't
really get smaller," says UNC computer scientist Warren Robinett. "We
reconstruct your perception so that you see and feel exactly what you
would if you were the size of a virus." Robinett created the
nanoManipulator with chemist Stan Williams, who is now the director of
basic research in the physical sciences at Hewlett-Packard. The device
"puts humans in the loop in a very nice way," says Ari Requicha, an
electrical engineer who works on virtual reality interfaces at the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

Robinett and Williams, who have been friends since their undergraduate
days in the early 1970s, came up with the idea for the nanoManipulator
during a 1991 phone call. At the time, Williams was trying to string
single silicon atoms into a nanoscale wire, but he was frustrated by
his inability to touch the atoms.  "Chemists want to get their hands
on stuff," he says. For his part, Robinett was looking for a safer
application of his expertise in programming people-sized robots that
mimic the motions of their human operator. When working with big
machines, Robinett explains, "a bug in your program can turn a robot
into an eggbeater, and it can punch a hole in your skull."

To Robinett, the scanning probe microscope (SPM) that Williams used to
view his surfaces looked like a small and safe robot. Instead of the
robot's TV camera eyes, the SPM has a computer-controlled probe that
"looks like an upside-down pyramid at the end of a flexible diving
board," says UNC computer scientist Russell Taylor. The probe skates
across the silicon surface, and a computer interface converts the
probe's wiggles into an electric signal, a bit like the way a
phonograph needle creates sounds from the bumps in a vinyl record.

The probe can also be programmed to push against the surface like a
robotic finger. In the push mode, scanning tunneling microscopes
(STMs) are commonly used to photograph products of chemical reactions,
measure the mechanical properties of various materials, and rearrange
atoms and bend carbon nanotubes.  But there's a problem. To point the
tip in the correct direction, researchers first scan the surface and
find the target in the resulting three-dimensional (3D) image. Then,
they must switch from visualization mode to manipulation mode, program
the STM tip to move to the right spot, and finally press it against
the surface. In the meantime, thermal vibrations of the surface might
have bounced the atom away from the tip's preprogrammed target. It is
like trying to play blindfolded billiards during an earthquake.

But even in the push mode, the changing separation between the flexing
tip and its fixed mount creates an electric current that is
proportional to the pressure exerted on the tip. By transmitting that
current to the proper computer interface, Robinett and Williams
realized that a human could locate the target object by touch at the
same time they were pushing gently against it. All Robinett had to do
was revamp his human-sized robot control programs to link the
microscopic "robot" to a human. And the nanoManipulator was born.

In its current form, the nanoManipulator is a computer program that
fuses an STM with a real-time 3D graphics rendering program and a
haptic interface that fits over one finger like a high-tech
thimble. The scientist's fingertip gets a little push each time the
probe hits a bump. And when the scientist pushes back with his finger,
a nanoscale finger presses against the surface.

"The key to the manipulator is that it immerses users in the
environment so they develop a good feel for what they are doing," says
electrical engineer Joe Lyding, an expert in molecular computing and
visualization at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. For
example, a user can tell the difference between signal noise and real
texture by simply running a "finger" over the surface, says Williams,
who has also used the nanoManipulator to "nanoweld" atoms into a wire
strand.

Garrett Matthews, a graduate student in physics at UNC, is using the
nanoManipulator to figure out if a virus feels more like a cue ball, a
tennis ball, or a rotten tomato. The results are inconclusive. "Right
now it feels like a cue ball, but we have other measurements that
indicate it should be soft and sticky," says Matthews.  Versions of
the nanoManipulator are also being used by chemists and materials
scientists at Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, the University
of Toronto, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and
Arizona State University in Tempe.

Williams is not surprised at the device's increasing popularity. "We
used to have to stare for hours at a black-and-white picture of a
surface just to tell what was up and what was down," he says. "The
nanoManipulator has untied our hands and opened our senses."

Coaxing Molecular Devices to Build Themselves

Dennis Normile

NAGOYA--When Nagoya University chemist Makoto Fujita thinks about how
to store data in tiny spaces, he thinks big--about how nature handles
the problem. Then he tries to emulate the answer. "A living cell is
incomparably smaller than a compact disc, but its DNA carries far more
information," he says. "Handling data at the DNA's molecular scale
could lead to handheld supercomputers. But to do that we need more
efficient ways to manipulate molecules."

Fujita and others are doing exactly that through a technique called
directed self-assembly. By adroitly exploiting the chemical and
electrical bonds that hold natural molecules together, they can get
molecules to form desired nanometer-scale structures. This could lead
to computer logic and memory devices up to 100 times smaller than
their current counterparts. Self-assembled molecules might also serve
as cages to hold and deliver unstable medical compounds, and as
crucibles for chemical reactions.

The technique builds upon two properties of matter. One is the bonding
between hydrogen atoms, which holds the two strands of DNA in its
double helix. The other is the electrical attraction between
positively charged organic ions and negatively charged metal ions. The
organic ions are strategically placed on organic molecules, or
ligands, which are like the rods of Tinkertoy sets. The metal ions are
like the socketed disks that hold the rods together. Unlike
Tinkertoys, however, these metal ions and ligands assemble themselves
if mixed together in solution in the right proportions and under the
right thermodynamic conditions.

Fujita was among those who pioneered the metal-ion technique in the
early 1990s. His first construction used four simple linear ligands
and four metal ions to produce square macromolecules. More recently,
his group has built an eight-sided, three-dimensional structure made
up of two pyramids joined at their bases.  The molecule is 3
nanometers across, and the cavity is big enough to hold a C60
molecule, the so-called buckyball. Fujita and other researchers have
also created a variety of grids, tubes, cages, and catenanes, which
are rings interlocked like links of a chain. "Such structures cannot
be synthesized by conventional chemical reactions, but we can very
easily construct them using directed self-assembly," Fujita says.

J. P. Sauvage, a chemist at Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg,
France, has proposed using catenanes as computing devices. One ring
would be mechanically fixed, allowing the second ring to rotate. If
the second ring has an additional ion, it could be rotated 180 degrees
back and forth in response to an adjacent electrical charge. The
position of the ring would indicate the 1 and 0 of digital data.

The molecular cages can be constructed to have small openings through
which atoms can enter and react with other atoms, forming molecules
that are too big to escape. This arrangement, which can capture and
stabilize molecules that otherwise rapidly react and disappear if free
in solution, could be the basis for a drug-delivery system.

Donald Cram, a Nobel laureate in chemistry who is now retired from the
University of California, Los Angeles, used such a cage to capture
cyclobutadiene, a compound that briefly appears at intermediate stages
of some chemical reactions but which until then had been too unstable
for chemists to isolate. Julius Rebek, director of the Skaggs
Institute for Chemical Biology of the Scripps Research Institute in La
Jolla, California, who works on self-assembly using hydrogen atoms,
explains that the characteristics of cyclobutadiene had been
theoretically predicted but never confirmed. "By encapsulating the
molecule, [Cram kept it] stable long enough to be characterized by
nuclear magnetic resonance," he says. Aside from its value to basic
research, this trick could be used to deliver drugs that are hard to
stabilize.

Fujita predicts that the number of self-assembled molecules and their
uses will rise rapidly in the years to come. Whereas a decade ago
there were only a handful of groups working on self-assembly using
metal ions, he says, "now there are dozens. The field is advancing
very rapidly."

Atom-Scale Research Gets Real

Robert F. Service

Nanotechnology has spawned useful new materials and impressive
technical feats. But the field's most grandiose dreams, and
nightmares, remain the stuff of fiction

In September, speaking to an audience of prominent researchers and
government leaders at a meeting on the future impacts of
nanotechnology, Michael Crow crossed a familiar line. "How many of you
have read The Diamond Age?" the science policy expert and vice provost
of Columbia University in New York City asked his listeners. The book,
by science-fiction novelist Neal Stephenson, depicts a near-future
world in which advances in nanotechnology make it possible to build
essentially anything from scratch, atom by atom, leaving society to
sift through the cultural ramifications of limitless choices. In
response to Crow's question, a few hands fluttered in the air and
quickly dropped. These people, after all, were nanotechnology's
practitioners--not wide-eyed dreamers.

Crow wasn't promoting the book as a prophecy. He mentioned it, he
says, to encourage researchers to think about their unique position at
the dawn of a field that most in the room agreed will be a force in
the coming century. But clearly his question touched a nerve. Since
its inception, nanotechnology has been dominated by fiction, both
unabashed hype and better grounded hope. Science-fiction writers have
dreamt up lush scenarios of life with nanosized robots that do
everything from building gleaming cities to reaming out clogged
coronary arteries. Meanwhile, some researchers have been hard at work
drawing impressive but equally fictional blueprints for arrays of tiny
gears and pistons that could form the foundation of nanomachines--if
anyone ever figures out how to assemble the thousands of atoms needed
to build them.

This year, dystopian fiction came on the scene, as nanotech prophets
of doom made bold new pronouncements of nanotechnology's potential to
destroy humanity and called for either an end to research in the area
or new guidelines to ensure that researchers don't accidentally wipe
out life on the planet (see sidebar, p. 1526). "Nanotechnology seems
to have this wonderful property of having the most extravagant
favorable and unfavorable predictions," says Edward Tenner, a
historian of science at Princeton University in New Jersey.

In response, many researchers at the cutting edge of dealing with
matter on the near-atomic scale have become aggressively matter-
of-fact, squirming at the suggestion of cornucopian nanofactories or
even humbler mass-produced nanodevices. The nearby hurdles, they say,
are challenge enough. "Nanotechnology is a vision, a hope to
manufacture on the length scale of a few atoms," says Don Eigler of
IBM's Almaden Research Center in the hills above San Jose,
California. For now, he says, "nanotechnology doesn't exist."

Yet even the most hard-headed nanoscientists must admit that their
minute world, by whatever name, is on the move. Advances in
manipulating nanosized materials have already led to improvements in
computer data storage, solar cells, and rechargeable
batteries. Computer disk drives alone--which rely on controlling the
thickness of various layers of material on the nanometer
scale--account for a multibillion-dollar market. The field's promise
has prompted the creation of about a dozen nanotech research centers
in U.S.  universities alone. The European Community runs several
programs in nanotechnology, including the Nano Network, which contains
18 member research centers working in nanomaterials synthesis. Japan,
Singapore, China, Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and
Russia all support nanotechnology efforts.

And there is more to come. Last month Congress approved the bulk of
the Clinton Administration's request for money to launch a new
National Nanotechnology Initiative. Next year the initiative will
spend some $423 million on nanoscience, with more sure to follow. In
Japan, nanotechnology funding is slated to jump 41% next year to $396
million. Several European countries are ramping up efforts as well.

Some U.S. experts hope that the surge in funding will carry over to
bolster American research in the physical sciences as a whole. Whereas
Congress is 3 years into a 5-year effort to double biomedical research
funding at the National Institutes of Health, "support for physical
sciences and engineering has been stagnant," says Tom Kalil, a White
House specialist on the economics of technology. "We see
[nanotechnology] as a way [of] increasing support for physical
sciences and engineering."

Richard Smalley, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist, thinks the emerging
field may even reverse the long slide in the number of new students
choosing careers in science, just as the space race inspired an
earlier generation. "It was Sputnik that got me into science," Smalley
says. "Of all the impacts of [nanotechnology's rise], the most
important impact--and one that I dearly hope will happen--will to be
to get more American girls and boys interested in science."

All of this activity is leading to some rather grandiose
pronouncements. "This is an area that can have a huge potential payoff
that can be as significant as the development of electricity or the
transistor," says Kalil.  And at a 1998 congressional hearing, Neal
Lane, the president's adviser for science and technology and former
National Science Foundation (NSF) director, stated, "If I were asked
for an area of science and engineering that will most likely produce
the breakthroughs of tomorrow, I would point to nanoscale science and
engineering."

But however promising nanotech's future may be, transforming it from
the world of fiction to reality will mean overcoming some daunting
obstacles. Beyond manipulating atoms, nanoscientists must perfect ways
to mass-produce nanosized objects and integrate them with the larger,
human-scale systems around them.  And they must do it while working in
an interdisciplinary field that requires new levels of cooperation
among different specialties, raising familiar challenges of herding
academic cats and coaxing them to march in lockstep.

A new hammer

Of course, nanotechnology--in the guise of nanoscale materials--has
already been around for a long time.  For the last 100 years, tire
companies have reinforced the rubber in car tires by adding nanosized
carbon particles, called carbon black. And living organisms from
bacteria to beetles rely on nanosized protein-based machines that do
everything from whipping flagella to flexing muscles.

Today, the term "nanotechnology" refers most broadly to the use of
materials with nanoscale dimensions, a size range from 1 to 100
billionths of a meter, or nanometers. Because this range includes
everything from collections of a few atoms to those protein-based
motors, researchers in chemistry, physics, materials science, and
molecular biology all lay stake to some territory in the field. That
tends to make nanotechnology a scientific Rorschach blot: What it
includes depends on whom you ask.

"Nanotechnology is a wonderful umbrella term that takes into account
many things that we were doing before some very helpful tools came
along," says William Tolles, a nanotechnology consultant for the U.S.
Department of Defense. "To a 5-year-old with a hammer, the world looks
like a nail," adds Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, who studies the development of technology.
"Nanotechnology is a hammer, and nanotechnologists are looking around
to see what they can hit with it."

The development of that hammer was launched by a breakthrough in
manipulating atoms back in the early 1980s. In 1982, physicists
Heinrich Rohrer and Gerd Binnig of IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory in
Switzerland created a new type of microscope, called a scanning
tunneling microscope (STM), that is capable of imaging individual
atoms. By tracking the changes in a tiny electrical current from an
ultrasharp tip to atoms on a surface, Binnig and Rohrer's STM enabled
researchers, essentially, to feel their way along a surface at the
atomic level and create a computerized image of it atom by atom.

Other imaging tools followed close behind. In 1985, Binnig teamed up
with Calvin Quate, an electrical engineer at Stanford University in
Palo Alto, California, to make an atomic force microscope, which
enabled them to image surfaces that do not conduct electricity. And
since then, versions of these microscopes have been developed to
pinpoint atoms' magnetic and chemical signatures.

It wasn't long before researchers used their new tools to jump from
imaging atoms to manipulating them. In 1990, Eigler and Erhard
Schweizer, also of IBM's Almaden Research Center, used an STM to spell
out "IBM" with 35 xenon atoms atop a nickel surface. It was the first
time scientists had built something by manipulating individual
atoms. Since then, Eigler and colleagues have gone on to build a
series of atomic-scale corrals that reveal the wavelike nature of
atoms and their electrons for all to see. "Seeing the electrons in
their quantum state seems to have had a larger psychological effect
than the bare bones of the research itself," Eigler says.

Part of that psychological effect lay in convincing researchers that
they could build structures an atom at a time. It's an idea that
continues to spread. Last year, Wilson Ho, a chemist and physicist at
the University of California, Irvine, showed that he could use an STM
to help forge chemical bonds between iron atoms and carbon monoxide
molecules. Other researchers have used similar techniques to alter the
chemistry of silicon atoms on a surface, transforming them into a key
component of a transistor.

Early advances have gone beyond manipulating atoms. Groundbreaking
work in materials synthesis has given researchers the ability to
control the size and shape of a wide variety of materials at the
nanoscale.  Along the way, researchers discovered that in many cases
the large surface-to-volume ratio of nanoscale materials gives them
unique characteristics not shared by their bulk-sized
cousins. Nanosized crystallites made from semiconductors such as
cadmium selenide, for example, fluoresce in different colors of light
as they change sizes. That's already made them a hot property for use
as fluorescent "dyes" in biology experiments, and several companies
are now racing to commercialize the technology.

The large surface area of nanoparticles also makes them ideal
catalysts, whose surface atoms orchestrate chemical reactions. Whereas
bulk gold, for example, is unreactive at room temperature, 3- to
5-nanometer gold particles can promote a number of common reactions
and have already been developed commercially by a Japanese company as
bathroom "odor eaters."

Enhanced properties on the nanoscale continue to be discovered. A
number of companies are experimenting with spiking common plastics
with nanosized particles in order to bolster properties such as
strength and impact resistance. Nanosized probes are being developed
to detect biological weapons such as anthrax. And carbon
nanotubes--tiny, straw-shaped molecules a mere nanometer or so
across--have been shown to conduct either like metals or
semiconductors depending on their precise geometry, and they have
already been incorporated into a range of electrical components such
as transistors and diodes.

Reality gap

For most nanobased applications, the key to progress is
straightforward: Find ways to make very fine particles or layers of
material of a precise size, which, when incorporated directly into a
final plastic or solar cell, all share the same electronic, optical,
and mechanical properties. These simple products are already finding
their way into the marketplace, and their relative ease of production
might always ensure them the biggest share of the business.

Most of the buzz about nanotechnology, however, involves more
sophisticated applications of nanomaterials, such as electronic
devices and tiny chemical sensors. The holdup, so far, is that in most
cases there's no obvious way to transform single demonstration devices
into a working technology.  "Nanotechnology is an area that is
profoundly reductionist," says Harvard University chemist George
Whitesides. "We can pick matter apart at its basic level of the atom
and reassemble it." But researchers, he warns, mustn't take that
ability too seriously. "We want to be sure we don't fall completely
over that cliff."

Whitesides's point is that although it is possible to manipulate
individual atoms, it's much harder to do it on a grand scale. In 1998,
for example, researchers led by Cees Dekker at the Delft University of
Technology in the Netherlands reported making the first transistor
using a carbon nanotube as a key component of the device. Work since
has shown that the electronic performance of such transistors can
approach or even surpass that of conventional silicon
transistors. "But there is a problem here," says Tom Theis, who heads
physical sciences research at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, New York. When it comes to making
computer chips containing millions of such devices, "it's completely
unmanufacturable."

The problem of manufacturability remains nanotechnology's Achilles'
heel, particularly for the much-hyped possibility of creating
nanosized machines. "The technology is still almost wholly on the
drawing board," John Seely Brown writes in a research paper submitted
to the September NSF meeting.  Brown, who heads the famed Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center in California, points out that two of the main
proponents of nanomachines, Ralph Merkle and K. Eric Drexler, built
powerful nano-CAD tools and then ran simulations of the resulting
designs. "The simulations showed definitively that nano devices are
theoretically feasible," Brown writes. "But theoretically feasible and
practically feasible are two different things. And as yet, no-one has
laid out in any detail a route from lab-based simulation or the
extremely elementary nanodevices that have been chemically constructed
to practical development."

But others argue that visionary research serves a purpose, too. Even
if nanogears and pistons cannot be built yet, says Deepak Srivastava,
who heads the computer nanotechnology design group at NASA's Ames
Research Center in Moffett Field, California, the computer designs
still help focus experimentalists on what's worth looking for: "If the
ideas are based on real physics and chemistry, one has to know the
real possibilities."

And of course, experimental science is constantly expanding the scope
of what is feasible. Whitesides and Stephen Chou of Princeton
University have recently pioneered a new rubber stamping method for
patterning surfaces with features as small as 10 nanometers. That is
well below the current size limit of about 200 nanometers faced by
photolithography, the primary patterning tool used by the computer
chip industry. Still, the stamping technique has its own drawbacks: It
has trouble patterning multiple materials in three dimensions, as is
needed for making computer chips, and ensuring proper alignment of all
the various layers of material.

Another patterning alternative making headway is a burgeoning subfield
of chemistry known as self-assembly, in which researchers design
materials to assemble themselves into desired finished structures. For
example, last year IBM researchers led by chemist Christopher Murray
came up with a way to make metallic particles as small as 3 nanometers
and then assemble them into a three-dimensional array.  Such
structures could lead to material for future computer disks in which
each nanoparticle stores a bit of data. Still, for now such successes
tend to be the exception rather than the rule.

Future nanoapplications face other grand challenges as well. Even if
particular nanocomponents can be mass-produced, researchers will still
need to figure out how to position them on surfaces or other
structures so they can be used as components in electronic devices,
sensors, and the like. For tiny electronic components, researchers
will then face the major stumbling block of wiring them up to the
macro world.

They will also confront the more mundane challenge of connecting with
one another. By all accounts, nanotechnology will require an
extraordinary range of expertise. Researchers have long embraced the
concept of interdisciplinary research. And organizations such as the
NSF make it a point to finance interdisciplinary centers. Still,
academia remains largely hidebound in disciplines, making it difficult
to pursue research that falls between traditional fields. "There still
exist many elements in the culture of our research universities that
discourage multidisciplinary research," says James Merz, the vice
president for graduate studies and research at the University of Notre
Dame in Indiana.

Among the chief culprits Merz points to are the administrative
autonomy given to separate departments and the fact that faculty
members must obtain tenure from specific departments. Furthermore,
Theis points out, essentially no curricula have been developed to
train future researchers in the field, let alone degree programs to
turn out new nanotech Ph.D.s. Although those impediments aren't
necessarily fatal, they can easily hamper the field's development,
Merz says.

Beset by such challenges, nanoreality is bound to fall short of
nanohype. The danger is that disenchantment with the gap could dampen
financial support for the field, says Mihail Roco of NSF, who heads
the U.S.  National Nanotechnology Initiative. That's a scenario well
known to researchers in high-temperature superconductivity, an
enterprise that has struggled to live up to the fanfare that greeted
it in the mid-1980s.  Still, unlike superconductivity--a narrow field
whose impact is limited to a comparatively small sphere of
applications--nanotechnology is likely to benefit from its breadth,
says Srivastava. "Since the net is much wider," he says, "the chance
is bigger that you will catch some fish."

Cantilever Tales

Alexander Hellemans*

Building even the simplest nanomachines is a daunting challenge, but
working models serve as springboards to grander designs. A classic
example is the cantilever, an indispensable cog in the nanoworld that
ushered in the scanning probe microscopy revolution. Today
cantilevers, which resemble tiny diving boards, are the operating
principle behind a host of experimental devices that could debut in
the next decade.

Nanosized cantilevers earned their claim to fame in the mid-1980s with
the invention of atomic force microscopes (AFMs). To chart the
surfaces of molecules, AFMs run the tip of a cantilever across an
object under investigation; intermolecular forces between probe and
object tug the cantilever tip up and down over the surface, like the
stylus of a record player. A reflected laser beam records this motion,
and the signal can be converted into an image of the surface.

Cantilevers are proving to be more versatile than anyone
imagined. Perhaps it's no surprise that a pioneering center for
manipulating these tiny tools is the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory in
Switzerland, the birthplace of scanning probe microscopy. "The whole
field was started right there," says Naomi Halas, a specialist in
applying nanotechnology to chemistry at Rice University in
Houston. One master cantilever builder at IBM Zurich is James
Gimzewski, leader of the Nanoscale Science group. He and his team set
the pace for the rest of the field, Halas says: "When they publish
something, it is usually the first and best for a long time."

The key to the next generation of cantilever devices is being able to
make the miniature planks bend on demand. One approach is to coat the
top surface of an AFM cantilever, a blade of silicon about 500
nanometers long and 100 nanometers wide, with short DNA chains called
oligonucleotides. The researchers next expose these coated
cantilevers, which are in solution, to oligonucleotides with a
complementary sequence of base pairs. When the matched pairs bind,
they exert an intermolecular force that expands the coating, bending
the cantilever downward much as the bimetallic strip in a thermostat
curls in response to temperature changes.

A scanning laser can measure the extent to which the oligonucleotide
pairs bend the cantilever; the more base pairs that match, the more
the cantilever bends. Thus coated, cantilevers might serve as
sensitive probes for specific DNA sequences. "We were able to detect a
single [base-pair] mismatch," says Gimzewski, whose team described its
advance in Science (14 April, p. 316). This proof of principle has
attracted attention from biotech companies, which view cantilever
setups as potential rivals to DNA arrays for searching for genetic
sequences of interest, including disease genes. "We are now trying to
make [coated cantilevers] into a general-purpose diagnostic
technique," Gimzewski says. "This is a new area. There aren't many
sensitive tools around."

But cantilever-based devices need not be constrained to having the
action--or molecules--come to them.  They might be used as smart gates
that release drugs or other chemicals in response to precise molecular
signals. For instance, an anticancer pill equipped with cantilever
gates might unleash a powerful drug at the site of a tumor only when a
tumor-specific protein gloms onto a specially tailored molecular
adhesive coating the cantilevers. Or a chemical for cleaning up a
hazardous spill might be stored in pellets and released only when the
target pollutant tugs at a cantilever gate, "rather than putting
chemicals all over the place," Gimzewski says.

Closer to reaching the market, however, are cantilevers for computer
data storage. In a project called "Millipede" spanning several labs at
IBM Zurich, scientists are testing an array of about 1000 cantilevers
as a new way of building nanoscale memory devices. Piezoelectric
signals would tell the cantilevers when to jab their hot tips at a
polymer film. The impressions in the film would record the data in a
much denser format than current media do. "That has the potential to
displace magnetic technologies," Gimzewski says. That bold prediction,
no doubt, will be heeded in the nano community: Gimzewski's group has
a track record for coming through. "I always aim very high and fail a
lot of the time," he says, "but the few things in which I succeed make
an impact and are extremely enjoyable."

Eugene,

Of course nanotechnology is dangerous!

All technological development is dangerous to some sectors of human &
nonhuman existence. However the issue is: Can current human society
peacefully devise mechanisms to reliably contain nanotechnology
development - in the context of the profits & power nanotech can conceivably
generate for its implementers?

This issue is the stuff World Wars are made of... I lived though the Cuban
Missile Crisis - and I tell you the nano... and artilect... embyonic
controversies are far, far more  potent (in terms of hitting at core human
instincts...) than whether it's better to be Dead than Red!

No. Neither do I. But this is also one foundation of liberal tolerance
- since this kind of ethical questions are hard and it is not possible
to prove one solution clearly more right than others, then it is best
to try to set up a system where everyone is free to try out their own
solutions. This is largely a live and let live attitude which I think
is worthwhile. The only place where we need legislation is to deal
with conflicts between people whose views force them to interfere with
each other. Still a huge and hard problem, but at least more manageable.

What is needed here is what other ethical axioms we bring into the
discussion. Many anti-enhancement people base their position on their
view that prenatal enhancements are against the integrity and dignity
of the person. What would a transhumanist defence of such enhancements
be in terms of our views of personal integrity and human dignity? And
reverse, from these views, what would not be allowed?

A recently observed broad 3.4 micron spectral "fingerprint" in a

to emission of surrounding mesospheric bacteria heated by the passage
of an incandescent fireball.

"Woodoo programming" 
[from George Bush's "voodoo economics"] 
The use by guess or cookbook of an obscure or hairy system, 
feature, or algorithm that one does not truly understand. 
The implication is that the technique may not work, 
and if it doesn't, one will never know why. 
Almost synonymous with "black magic" [see], except that 
"black magic" typically isn't documented and nobody understands it. 
Compare "magic" [see], "deep magic" [see], "heavy wizardry" [see], 
"rain dance" [see], "cargo cult programming" [see], 
"wave a dead chicken" [see]. 

"Cargo Cult Programming" 
A style of (incompetent) programming dominated 
by ritual inclusion of code or program structures 
that serve no real purpose. 
A cargo cult programmer will usually explain the extra 
code as a way of working around some bug encountered 
in the past, but usually neither the bug nor the reason 
the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully 
understood (compare "shotgun debugging" [see], "voodoo progr."). 
The term `cargo cult' is a reference to aboriginal religions 
that grew up in the South Pacific after World War II. 
The practices of these cults center on building elaborate 
mockups of airplanes and military style landing strips 
in the hope of bringing the return of the god-like airplanes 
that brought such marvelous cargo during the war. 
Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's 
characterization of certain practices as "cargo cult science" 
in his book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman".

I would defend enhancements of whatever kind on the grounds that they
increase personal integrity and expand human dignity. Because that's what
enhancements do. They make things better, more beautiful, more free, more
excellent, healthier, more competent. Anyone who would argue against such
things simply and plainly does not understand the meaning of the word
"enhancement."

Reasonable people would not allow modifications or bio-engineering which
does not result in the enhancement (IOW improvement) of human life. BTW,
any society that can tolerate such an ugly and stupid procedure as
circumcision definitely has no business criticizing prenatal enhancements
which would help rather than hurt the innocent. Smacks of the pot calling
the kettle black. After all, few things are more against the integrity and
dignity of a person than mutilating their genitals without their
permission (and without anesthetics).

I've been thinking about what each of these words connate and wanted to
share some thoughts and see what people think in response.

Regardless of the term being used to designate our interests, what needs to
be communicated is the desire to transcend human limitation.  I do not think
that this means to become unhuman or inhuman, but rather more than human or
human plus or superhuman.  And I believe this will have to be the case, as
every stage of evolution incorporates the benefits of preceding forms while
transcending their limitations.  Thus, I don't think there will be a break
from humanity.  AI will not become some new form that transcends us.
Rather, we develop AI and incorporate it into us.

There is, however, a lot of fear in most humans regarding integration of
technology into the human species.  And it seems to me that Posthuman can be
easily misinterpreted by the fearful to be the end of humanity, a sort of
death to the species as the great computer emerges.  That is why I tend to
prefer Transhuman.  I have often heard transhuman being referred to as the
interim stage or those of us or are working at becoming posthuman.  But I
use it much like many use posthuman.  Transhumanism better represents our
desire to incorporate the best of being human while transcending our limits.
It is more digestible to fearful people with whom I try to share my positive
outlook on these topics.

Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Beta Pic has a dust disk around it, doesn't it? Pretty trippy to think
of a star fifty light years away as a clear dust source here. What are
typical speeds of these particles when they arrive in our neighborhood?
I see that some folks claim dust rings in the disk might have been
formed by a star passing beta Pic only 100kyears ago. Is that enough
time for dust to arrive here? What I'm trying to get at is, has the dust
been arriving all along from the disk, or is it a result of recent
"swirls" associated with ring formation? Hmm.

Here is a philosophical puzzle somewhat similar to the question of
germ-line modification.

Suppose at some point we got a good cellular model of brain cells and
how they grow and develop, but we didn't have good sensing technology so
that we could take a brain apart and extract all the information encoded
in its structure and functionality.  Then, suppose it were possible to
scan an embryonic brain, because it is smaller and simpler, and has less
learned information.  In this hypothetical, the first upload could be
an unborn child.

The embryo would be destructively scanned and then its growth modeled.
It would undergo fetal development and then a simulated birth.  At that
point it would live in a VR environment and be provided with care and
human interaction through some kind of virtual interface.

Would this be good or bad for the child?  On the one hand, as Robin Hanson
has argued, the first uploads could be in a tremendously advantageous
position.  On the other hand, the experiment is uncertain and the quality
of life for the child might be poor.  He might even become a slave.
He might thank you for what you have done, or he might hate you (or he
might do both, in different copies).  And of course there is no prospect
of getting his consent ahead of time.

If you had the opportunity to have your unborn child be the subject
of this experiment, would you?  What philosophical principles would
guide you?

I think the experiment should be done with animal embryos first, because
there are too many unanswered questions to try it with a human embryo.
When and if it succeeds with primate embryos, then go for it with homo
saps. (I wouldn't donate my own embryo because I don't have any.)

A bit of devil's advocate, so we can more fully understand (and thus
better rebut) the opposition:

When I try the above argument, the usual reply is that my statement
(that enhancements really are enhancements) are met with vague,
unformed responses that boil down to calling me a liar.  As near as I
can tell, they are worried that, no matter what potential is promised,
what will be/is being/has been sold as "enhancements" always turns out
to be snake oil, i.e. it profits the seller and is either benign or
actually harmful to the buyer.  The justification derives from past
enhancements like "mystical" potions and steroids (which get more
press, at least these days, than enhancements that actually do work -
for instance, keeping clean, better medicines, et cetera - which tend
to fade into the backdrop of accepted everyday life until they are no
longer "enhancements").

Doesn't anybody actually *read* the Constitution before giving
opinions about it?

	 Amendment XVI.
      The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on 
   incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among
   the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.

The income tax, even as a mandatory system, is definitely
constitutional.  The only wiggle room I can conceive of would be to
find a constitutional quarrel with the exact manner in which the tax
is imposed.  It seems from the article cited that there are some
people who have some legal quarrel with the income tax regime, but
they make their case not on the constitution but on the tax code.  My
guess is that no court will accept their argument.

I have no objection to close examination-- in fact, I encourage it.

I disagree.  Truth is an important concept, but is it really the only means
by which we should measure personal power?  Is truth always the best way to
achieve increased utility (or whatever goal you decide is worthy?)  And
further, in the context of this discussion (arbitrarily limiting belief
structures,) truth is a really fluid concept.  As far as personal
limitations go, the truth is often what you make it.  Believe in your
ability to succeed-- you'll make your own truth.  Conversely, self-doubt is
often self-fulfilling.  For myself, the goal is optimization, and truth is
often a very valuable means of achieving that-- this is why I often
reference the need for clear observation.  Learn your environment-- learn
how the system works, and play the game.

I'll repeat my point here for clarity:  If Joe holds the belief that he is,
for instance, unable to talk to women, is that a false belief?  Certainly
the aspect of JW Betty's ideology that we find limiting is its falsehood--
she's unlikely to really reap any eternal salvation from her refusal to take
a transfusion.  However, for many of us (list members) our limiting
ideologies have less to do with religious dogma, and more to do with the
particular kinds of fear that our environment imbues us with.  Many of us
hold beliefs that are 'truth-independent'... self-fulfilling bootstraps with
regards to our personal capabilities, our society, etc.  This is really what
I'm talking about.

Hmm... sorry about that, I -do- get a little enthusiastic.  I have been on a
long journey of awakening to my own potential and it has made me very happy.
I guess its sort of hard to talk about these sorts of things without coming
across as Tony Robbins or something.  But there is a great truth here-- we
humans have power... and for those of us in the First world at least, there
are endless opportunities to manifest that power (and others, too.)  I am a
wee bit of an optimist, I admit it.  I do believe there is a way.  I'm not
talking about any spiritual, philosophical or psychological magic here
either-- just be awake.  Observe that there are people out there who operate
on another level-- who understand their empowerment-- who greedily embrace
life.

This is the sort of conversation I'd like to have in person.

I'm not entirely sure why you hold that the word "Human" is a belief-- I'm
not sure that that's the context in which I most often hear it used.  I call
myself a human, but for me the word simply references my biological status.
Deciding to call yourself NOT-human seems arbitrary-- and if that's
effective for you, then I'm in favor of it.  But is that really a 'truer'
ideology, or simply a more effective one?  I think we agree here more than
you'd like to admit...

I'm in favor of this attitude, although as stated I don't think I find the
term "human" to be as attached to limiting ideologies as you do.

Sorry, but I found the paragraph in question to be irrelevant, tangential
and impenetrable.  I -am- genuinely unable to understand why you introduced
it.  We should probably let it drop.

Sorry dude, I didn't quite mean it as an insult, but... well, you know how
it goes.  I perceived the point in question to be a debate tactic and was
dismissive of it.  Ostensibly I hope to discourage that sort of thing, but I
recognize in practice that dismissivness is more-often-than-not
inflammatory.

I'm not sure if I've given you enough of a proposition for you to attack its
credibility.  Certainly you can attack -my- credibility-- for instance, you
could interview my personal acquaintances in an attempt to challenge my
claims of personal empowerment.  Or you could review my social, scholastic
and business performance.

I agree and I hope you didn't think I was arguing another position.

By the way, you're hedging, but I'll let it go.

That would be a pleasant outcome, although I'm unclear how it might be

I don't need any academic literature to know that there are hypothetical

Then let's not call it a theory anymore.

Yes, I can see that-- indeed, that very sentence proves it.  (Why should I
take this conversation personally?  You haven't made it personal.)

You don't need to worry about my feelings unless your intention is to attack
my personality rather than my ideas.

No description of the physical world that is less complex than the entire
world can be perfect.  If you drop a glass, it will fall... unless all the
air molecules underneath it happen to simultaneously move upward and
strike the glass, while all the air molecules above it happen to be
elsewhere for a few moments - in which case the glass might hover in the
air, or move upwards instead.  It can happen.  The classical laws of
physics are CPT invariant; if you play a movie backward, everything that
happens in it will still conserve mass-energy, momentum, and Newton's laws
of gravitation.  A shattered glass could leap off the ground, onto the
table, and reassemble itself, if the molecules happened to be position
exactly the right way.  This is so enormously improbable, however - and
far beyond our present art to achieve artificially - that we are forced to
assume that we are watching a movie being played backward, and not a
genuine recording of an event, because while the event is physically
possible, it would be expected to take vastly longer than the age of the
Universe for anyone to capture it on film.

The statement that glasses fall down, rather than up, is effectively
perfect.  "Effectively perfect" statements do not hold in all times and
all places.  If you live forever... not billions of years, or trillions of
years, but *forever*... you will eventually see it happen, not just once,
but many times.  The statement "glasses fall down" will, eventually, fall
down itself.

The Turing diagonalization argument proves that absolute self-knowledge is
impossible, at least for computable processes.  Nonetheless, if a
transhuman can have "effectively perfect" self-knowledge or effectively
perfect sanity, they will - in all probability - run into no problems for
the first few decillion years... and as long as the amount of RAM keeps
increasing, they need fear nothing, indefinitely.  (The probability of a
nonrecoverable error occurring, integrated over infinite time, can be made
arbitrarily small.)  This follows from the mathematics of effective
perfection, or "fuzzy phase space theory".  First, an introduction to
classical phase spaces.

-- Begin expository lump:  Hot metal phase space --

The first law of thermodynamics states that "You can't win"; you cannot
decrease the amount of entropy in the Universe.  This follows from a
theorem which states that, under the classical laws of physics, the volume
of any phase space is preserved as the system evolves.  The Hamiltonian of
a three-dimensional Newtonian system is a hugely multi-dimensional space,
which has six dimensions per particle; thus, a Newtonian Universe with
only 10 particles has a Hamiltonian with sixty dimensions.  Each x, y, and
z dimension describing the (a) particle position and (b) particle
velocity, for each individual particle, is a separate dimension of the
Hamiltonian.  Every possible state of this Newtonian Universe, any
possible combination of positions and velocities for the 20 particles in
it, is a single point within the Hamiltonian.  The evolution of the entire
Newtonian Universe, particles attracting and repelling each other, causes
the positions and velocities to change; the point moves around in the
Hamiltonian.  If the positions and velocities are continuous, which is
always true of a Newtonian Universe, then the point will follow a
continuous path within the Hamiltonian as the Newtonian Universe evolves.

The theorem responsible for the first law of thermodynamics says that,
under certain laws of physics (including our classical laws), the volume
of a phase space is constant.  If you take eighty hypercubic centimeters
of phase space and evolve each point in that volume for N minutes, you
will have eighty hypercubic centimeters at the end of it.  The volume may
start out as a very compact shape, say a sphere, and wind up spread all
over the place with all kinds of hyperdimensional wrinkles, but the volume
will still be eighty hypercubic centimeters.

Hence, the first law of thermodynamics.  A high-entropy system occupies a
large volume of phase space.  A hot piece of metal occupies a larger
volume of phase space than a cold piece of metal, since the range of
possible velocities for a particle is larger.  A physical process which
turned a hot piece of metal into a cold piece of metal plus electricity -
leaving the rest of the Universe constant - would be a process that turned
a large area of phase space into a small area, violating the theorem. 
Actually, in fact, each individual piece of hot metal or cold metal
occupies exactly one point within phase space; however, the *class* of
pieces of hot metal occupies a much larger volume of phase space then the
*class* of pieces of cold metal.  Thus, a process that turns hot metal *in
general* into cold metal *in general* is impossible under classical
physics; an individual piece of hot metal could conceivable turn into cold
metal plus electricity.  It is simply enormously *improbable* that any
given piece of hot metal will turn out to occupy one of the vanishingly
rare sub-volumes of "hot metal phase space" which will evolve into "cold
metal phase space" after some known amount of time (say, five minutes). 
In fact, the phase space volume of "a piece of cold metal heated by
electricity" will evolve into an equally small sub-volume of "hot metal
phase space".  But it isn't a compact sub-volume - not one that's easy to
describe by any method known to humanity - so we treat this information as
being lost, and say that the cold metal has now entered "hot metal phase
space" in general.

The three types of perpetual motion machine which violate the first law
all take advantage of loopholes in the theorem with respect to our actual,
nonclassical laws of physics.  (As far as I know, all three types are my
own invention, or reinvention.)

The first type of perpetual motion machine, the negative-energy method,
says that you can manufacture X amount of negative matter, X amount of
positive matter, pour all your waste heat into the newly created matter,
and then annihilate it, getting rid of the waste heat.  Each time a
negative particle and a positive particle come into existence, it changes
the total volume of the Hamiltonian phase space - by adding entire
dimensions, in fact.  When you annihilate the particles, the total volume
shrinks again.  In effect, the Type One perpetual motion machine increases
the total volume of the Universe's Hamiltonian, which means that you can
choose to wind up in a smaller area (relatively speaking) of that larger
Hamiltonian.  Then you shrink the Hamiltonian back down again by
annihilating the matter, but you do so in a way which means that you end
up in a smaller area of your own Hamiltonian.  In other words, when you
increase the size of the Hamiltonian, you perform a one-to-one
transformation of your phase space into that Hamiltonian; then, when the
Hamiltonian shrinks, you perform a many-to-one transformation; taken as a
complete operation, this shrinks the size of your phase space.

The second type of perpetual motion machine, the quantum, notes that
state-vector reduction again reduces the volume of phase space.  A large
volume of phase space, describing the probability amplitude that an
electron is present at all points of space, collapses into a single point
which describes the electron as being present at a single point in space. 
State-vector reduction takes zillions of possible superposed Universes and
annihilates all but one of them.  Thus, it may be possible to build a
quantum perpetual motion machine in which the amplitudes "cold states"
tend to add up while the amplitudes of "hot states" cancel out;
effectively, this dumps waste heat into a superposed state that gets
blipped out of existence when the quantum collapse occurs.

The third type of perpetual motion machine, the temporal, says that you
can violate the first law using a time machine.  If you take a heat bath
and watch it evolving through states for a sufficiently long time, you can
decide to stop watching at a point where all the atoms on one side happen
to be moving in the same direction.  The volume of phase space has been
preserved at all points within the temporal loop, but from the perspective
of the rest of the Universe, the heat bath rejoins our world only when it
occupies a particular volume of phase space.  Pieces of a sufficiently
large physical system will show temporary decreases in entropy due to the
operation of normal, random mechanisms; a time machine lets you take all
the temporary decreases, unsynchronize them temporally, and resynchronize
them so that they all add together.  In other words, the phase space
remains constant if you evolve *all* of it for N minutes, but if you
evolve some of it for N minutes and some of it for M minutes, the new
volumes may overlap; the total volume may not be constant.

-- End expository lump:  Hot metal phase space --

In saying that a dropped glass will fall downwards, we are making a
statement that one volume of phase space - the phase space of dropped
glasses - will evolve into another phase space; the phase space of glasses
lying on the floor.  Both volumes of phase space are extremely large, but
they are relatively compact, and a point in the core volume of the first
phase space ends up in the core volume of the second phase space, *most of
the time* - they are fuzzy, but not very fuzzy.  The phase spaces are
compact and their evolution is compact, but will never be perfectly
compact in an inperfect Universe.  Watch long enough, and you'll see
glasses falling upwards.

This phenomenon is what people refer to when they say that perfectly
rational thought is impossible.  Rational thought is the ability to model,
predict, and manipulate the regularities in physical reality.  Formally,
this is an attempt to describe a huge amount of information - the Universe
- with a small amount of information - a mind - by taking advantage of the
enormous compression efficiencies enabled by the regularities in our
Universe; a huge volume of phase space is so regular that it can be summed
up by the description "dropped glass", and our minds assume, if they see
ten glasses drop, that an eleventh glass will drop as well.  That is not a
proof of future reliability, but rather a historical fact.  Our minds
assume regularities hold, because, evolutionarily, genes that made that
assumption - that our Universe possesses an arrow of thermodynamics -
proved correct every single time in the ancestral environment.  (Almost
certainly - the whole age of the Earth is not long enough for a single
thermodynamic anomaly to be expected.)  Again, formally, particular
incidents in which an organism survived and reproduced again occupied
compact volumes of phase space; regularities which have become embedded in
us as expectations.

Turing's diagonalization theorem can be expressed as follows:  A mind
cannot perfectly describe itself because there is always, inescapably,
some part of the mind which at that moment is observing and is not itself
being observed.  The observer is always smaller than the observed, and
thus cannot perfectly describe it.

An AI, presented with Turing's diagonalization trick, would undergo a
peculiar experience.  Ve simulates and observes an AI which is simulating
and observing an AI which is simulating and observing an AI, and so on; ve
can verify that every single AI in the chain is perfectly identical, but
ve cannot be certain that ve, verself, is identical to the AI it's
simulating.  Ve can be effectively certain, but this is no help.  Suppose
that your version of the diagonalization argument is to ask the AI:  "Will
the AI you're simulating answer 'No' to this question?"  Ve knows that, as
soon as ve decides to answer "Yes, it will say No" or "No, it will say
Yes", through whatever output mechanism has been provided, the AI ve's
simulating will make the exact same answer, thus invalidating the
response.  If ve then, on observing the AI, sneakily reconsiders, the AI
simulated will observe vis own simulation and make exactly the same
decision.  The simulating AI can never get ahead of the simulated.  If ve
decides to just let the simulation run indefinitely, then the simulation
will let its own simulation run indefinitely, and so on, and no answer
will be returned until the outermost AI gives up and decides to halt the
simulation - because the underlying causal mechanisms are identical in
each case.  This is true, but the outermost AI can never be certain of
this, just as the simulated AI can never be certain that ve is identical
with vis own simulation.

A human, of course, can be put to exactly the same torture; we will in
fact be far worse off, since we'd be totally unable to mentally simulate a
system of more than a few hundred simplified neurons.  We'd have
absolutely no clue whether we were looking at a copy of ourselves or not;
facing a system of that size, we'd roll over and die of sheer boredom. 
And of course an AI, even one totally immune to boredom, would suffer a
million-to-one slowdown of the simulated AI if ve attempted to pay any
sort of conscious attention to individual bits moving around in the
simulation.  So much for the argument from Godel.

In this limited sense, then, "perfect sanity" may be impossible, just as
it is impossible to attain perfect knowledge that glasses do not unsmash
themselves.  The assumption that glasses do not unsmash themselves is
perfectly adequate for a decillion years, however, and - mathematically -
it is not too much to expect of your average transhuman that ve remain
sane for a decillion years.  In the long run, the total probability of a
single error in describing reality can be made arbitrarily low, as long as
the volume of phase space occupied by the mind describing reality keeps on
expanding.  In other words, to last longer than a decillion years, you
just need to have a finer-grained description than "falling glass",
capturing some of the more compact regularities in the irregularities -
some of the more obvious cases where glasses fall upward - and then you're
good for another centillion.  (Substitute much larger numbers for
"decillion" and "centillion", by the way.)  This requires an
ever-expanding amount of RAM - but nowhere near exponentially expanding;
more like logarithmically expanding.

A mind may not be able to describe itself in perfect detail, but it may be
able to come up with a high-level description of itself, and that
description can be good for a decillion years.  If the mind keeps
expanding, the description can be good forever.  And when I say
"high-level", I mean a description that can be pretty darn fine-grained by
our standards.  The equivalent would be a human mind describing itself in
terms of the action of minicolumns; because this description does not take
individual neurons into account, there is room enough in the neurons to
store a complete description of the minicolums.  By doing so, of course,
you are making individual neurons significant and thus ruining the perfect
usefulness of the minicolumn-level description - the standard Turing
trap.  In computable systems, there will always be that little leftover
tail that makes perfect self-observation impossible.  But this doesn't
need to rule out effectively perfect self-observation - or effectively
perfect sanity.

Now, someone could still argue that even "effective perfection" is
unattainable - that a transhuman will, of necessity, make factual errors
or insane-class mistakes at least once a month - but if so, it will have
to be an argument on grounds of cognitive science, rather than mathematics
or computer science.

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE NOVEMBER 24 2000

NOVEMBER IS NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
Low dose aspirin helps prevent Alzheimer's disease

The November issue of the journal Archives of Neurology featured the
results of an Australian  analysis (The Sydney Older Persons Study) of 647
subjects with an average age of 81 years, which demonstrated that the use
low doses of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is
associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease.   One hundred
sixty-three subjects were diagnosed with various forms of dementia, with
seventy-eight of these diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease without vascular
dementia, forty-five with vascular dementia, and forty with other
dementias.   Three hundred seventy-three participants served as controls.

Fifty drug groups were analyzed for their association with the diagnostic
groups.  There was an inverse correlation observed between aspirin or
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the incidence of Alzheimer's
disease.  The association was not observed for other dementia diagnoses.
Analysis of the results did not reveal a dose dependent effect, with
response the same for high or low doses.  An inverse correlation was also
observed between the risk of Alzheimer's disease and the class of drugs
known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

The finding concerning low doses of aspirin or NSAIDS is promising.
Previous studies had uncovered a correlation between high doses of aspirin
or NSAIDs and Alzheimer's disease, a finding which, although significant,
can be risky to put into practice because of the liver damage and gastric
bleeding associated with high doses of these drugs.

The researchers believe that the benefit of aspirin or NSAIDs might be due
to the improvement of blood flow, because of the the reduction of blood
clotting.


PROTOCOL

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is
the fourth leading cause of death in developed nations (after heart
disease, cancer, and stroke). Up to 70% of dementia cases are due to
Alzheimer's disease, with blood vessel disease (stroke, atherosclerosis)
being the second most common cause. The frequency of Alzheimer's among
60-year-olds is about 1%. The incidence doubles approximately every 5
years, becoming 2% at age 65, 4% at 70, 8% at 75, 16% at 80, and 32% at
85. It is estimated that as many as two thirds of those in their 90s
suffer from some form of dementia. For those who aspire to live a very
long life, dementia is a threat second only to death-or is death in
another form.

Alzheimer's disease is incurable. It leads to death within an average of 8
years after diagnosis, the last 3 of which are typically spent in an
institution. Besides memory loss, Alzheimer's patients show dramatic
personality changes, disorientation, declining physical coordination, and
an inability to care for themselves. In the final stages, victims are
bedridden, lose urinary and bowel control, and suffer epileptic attacks.
Death is usually due to pneumonia or urinary tract infection.

Studies with 2 or 3 grams a day of acetyl-L-carnitine have shown a reduced
rate of disease progression for Alzheimer's patients. Acetyl-L-carnitine
reduces lipofuscin in neurons. Although lipofuscin is cellular debris from
glycation and oxidation, detrimental effects in general and a contribution
to Alzheimer's disease in particular have not been shown. The (modest)
benefits of acetyl-L-carnitine are more likely due to its ability to
normalize cell metabolism, increase NGF utilization, and increase
acetylcholine synthesis.

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK

Healthprin

Numerous studies document the multiple health benefits of daily low-dose
aspirin. While abnormal platelet aggregation (which can cause a heart
attack or stroke) can be inhibited by vitamin C and E, fish oil, and
herbal extracts such as ginkgo and bilberry, aspirin provides additional
protection against abnormal blood clot formation within blood vessels.

In addition to inhibiting blood from forming clots inside arteries,
aspirin has been shown to inhibit prostaglandin E2, which has been linked
to many chronic inflammatory conditions that may result in
colon-esophageal cancers and other diseases.

In order to make it easy to take low-dose aspirin, The Life Extension
Foundation offers a bottle of 500 heart-shaped tablets containing 81 mg of
aspirin per tablet. These easy to swallow tablets are equal to 1/4 of one
aspirin tablet, which is the dose the published studies indicated may be
ideal to prevent heart attacks, and possibly, prevent some forms of
cancer.

Acetyl-L-carnitine

Aging occurs when the energy producing components of the cell deteriorate,
resulting in reduced cellular metabolic activity, the accumulation of
cellular debris, and the eventual death of the cell.

The most effective antiaging therapy to maintain youthful cellular energy
metabolism is the amino acid L-carnitine, which functions via several
mechanisms to protect cells from the effects of aging.

Acetyl-L-carnitine is the acetylated ester of the amino acid L-carnitine.
Acetyl-L-carnitine is absorbed into the bloodstream more efficiently than
L-carnitine and, more importantly, acetyl-L-carnitine passes more
effectively through cell membranes, and is utilized more efficiently in
the mitochondria of the cell.

BLOOD TESTING SALE!

People often fall victim to a disease that could have been prevented if
their blood was tested every year. When a blood test reveals an
abnormality, corrective actions can often be taken to prevent a serious
disease from developing.

Since 1996, Life Extension Foundation members have been able to order
their own blood tests and pay only a fraction of the price charged by
commercial laboratories. The good news is that The Life Extension
Foundation has negotiated a better price structure with one of the
nation's largest testing laboratories. In addition to saving big money,
this new arrangement makes it more convenient for members to have their
blood drawn throughout the United States.

Foundation members residing in South Florida can have their blood drawn at
the Life Extension Nutrition Center located at 995 SW 24 Street in Ft.
Lauderdale. Those residing outside of South Florida now have access to
hundreds of licensed blood drawing stations. For information about blood
testing or directions to any of these blood drawing stations, call
1-800-208-3444.

There is no longer any shipping charge to add, even when having your blood
tested outside of South Florida. Members previously had to pay an extra
$20.00 in shipping charges if they had their blood drawn anywhere other
than our Ft. Lauderdale drawing station.  Please note that our retail
prices are lower than what most commercial laboratories and doctors
charge. Until April 15, 2001, The Life Extension Buyers Club is offering
an extra-special member discount on all blood tests.

Actually I think this is the second law; the first law is conservation
of energy.  However in some of your perpetual motion machines you seem
to be violating the first law more than the second.

Assuming, as is reasonable, that the electricity had only a small
phase space.

Of course, in classical thermodynamics there is no such thing as negative
matter, and if there were I'm not sure if it would have negative entropy.
However it would arguably have negative energy, so if you were worried
about satisfying the first (not second) law of thermodynamics, this part
could in principle work if negative matter were real.

However I'm not sure it makes sense to explain that the whole idea works
because of increasing the volume of phase space due to adding particles.
If all it took to violate thermodynamic laws were to change the number
of particles, it would happen all the time.  Chemical reactions change
the number of molecules, which is often what we count in thermodynamics,
and nuclear reactions can change the number of subatomic particles.

I don't think this part will work.  Keep in mind that systems don't
actually occupy volumes of phase space, they occupy points.  Think of
families of systems, each at a different point in the phase space that
makes up the volume.  To perform a transformation which shrinks the phase
space means that some initially distinct members of that family have now
merged and are identical.  This requires nonreversible transformations,
and I don't see anything here which is nonreversible.

If you think of a many worlds model, any such attempt would not actually
blip any other universes out of existence, but rather it simply allows
you to learn where you are in the multiverse.  Learning where you are
can't change the overall statistics of what happens.  So I think this
blipping-out is a bad model and misleading about what could happen.

Maxwell's Demon can accomplish the same task and he doesn't even have
a time machine, he just opens the door at the right time.  It's the
measurement process that defeats him, and I suspect the same thing will
happen to you.  Knowing when to stop time requires measuring the atoms to
know when they are all moving together.  That is costly.  (Technically it
is in the erasure of the measurements that we account for the cost.)

It's not that the phase spaces of falling-glass and dropped-glass are
fuzzy; they may be perfectly well defined.  Rather, not all of the first
volume ends up within the second.  A little bit is outside, representing
dropped glasses which don't break.

Where'd this come from?  I've never heard anyone say this, at least
not in those words.  A google search for "perfectly rational thought"
finds no such claim.  (Of course most people would agree that any form
of perfection is unatttainable.)

I'm not convinced of this argument.  It sounds like it could equally well
"prove" that self-reproducing automata are impossible, because they have
to have a model of themselves, and the model is always smaller than
the total automaton, hence there must be part that can't be modelled.
When people first go to write a self reproducing program they run into
this, and in some cases they may conclude that it is impossible, if
they don't stumble onto the trick.  Yet von Neumann showed and biology
confirms that self reproduction is entirely possible.

I'd say the reason is that the model is isomorphic (via some mapping)
to the system minus the model, and so adding the model does not increase
the information in the system.

Couldn't a mind's mental model share the same property?

"AI, will you answer 'No' to this question?"
"Of course not."

I don't think this kind of trick question sheds much light.  It's just
playing with words.  An AI with an incomplete model is no more able to
answer the question than one with a complete model.  An AI with a fully
complete model of itself, one which understands itself perfectly, can't
give a consistent or correct answer, but that doesn't indicate a lack
of understanding; it is simply that the question is a trick.  In effect
it is being asked two questions at once: what is the next word you will
say, and will you say "no".  There is no way to answer this question if
we stick to yes or no answers!  The existence of unanswerable questions
fails to prove that beings can't fully understand themselves.

The problem with the analysis is that it assumes that the AI understands
itself in a very simplistic and mechanical manner.  The only way it can
answer the question is by running its own program by brute force.

It's like the person who wants to write a self-reproducing program, who
starts out with:

main(){
putchar ('m');
putchar ('a');
putchar ('i');
putchar ('n');
putchar ('(');
putchar (')');
putchar ('{');
putchar ('\n');
putchar ('p');
putchar ('u');
putchar ('t');
...

He soon realizes that this isn't going to work.  He's losing ground with
every statement he writes.  The real solution takes an entirely different
approach.

In the same way, a perfectly self-understanding AI could have a more subtle
model of its own workings.

This is not necessarily a violation of the halting theorem.  The AI does
not claim to be capable of telling whether arbitrary programs will halt.
It is probably not even Turing complete, in the sense that it can't
necessarily run any arbitrary program "in its head" (people certainly
can't).

In truth, the notion of self-understanding is not very well defined.
To continue this further it will be necessary to have a more rigorous
definition.

I doubt that anyone sensible would say such a thing about transhumans
in general.  Estimating the mean time between errors for any complex
system requires a detailed specification.  Once that is in hand, I would
imagine that the task would more likely be a matter of materials science
than cognitive.

(The original post was cc:ed to extropians, so this one
is going there too.)

Eliezer described three ways of throwing away entropy - an
enabling technology for perpetual motion, since this would suck
some energy back from thermal equilibrium. It was just a long
detour in his post, but I want to correct some mistakes, and
make some simple comments. The issues involved are quite subtle
in my opinion, so I'll probably make mistakes of my own, but
better to mail now than wait until morning.

First, the mistakes:

>The first law of thermodynamics states that "You can't win"; you cannot
>decrease the amount of entropy in the Universe.

This is the second law. The first law is conservation of energy.

And: Hamiltonian != phase space. The Hamiltonian is a function
on phase space, whose value is the total energy, and in terms
of which you can write Hamilton's version of the laws of motion.

Now, some more substantive comments.

- The negative-energy PMM

Paul Davies talks about negative-energy perpetual motion
machines at http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980321/features.html,
along with the extra influences that would stop them working.

I would take issue with the description of phase space
here. Suppose you have a world in which particles can be
created and destroyed. This doesn't mean that phase
space changes in size each time that happens, it means that
phase space is the union of zero-particle phase space,
one-particle phase space, two-particle phase space, etc.;
and when a particle is created, you move from the N-particle
region to the (N+1)-particle region.

- The quantum collapse PMM

The proposal here is pretty vague. It's just, 'what if
entropy-increasing processes somehow acquired very low
probability'.

There is a 'quantum thermodynamics', it's called statistical
mechanics, and entropy still increases there. There's interesting
recent work in quantum information theory which suggests that
entropy and entanglement are related, and maybe there will be
distinctively quantum ways to *locally* decrease entropy ... but
there's no inkling of a global violation of the second law.

Once again on phase space ... You can conceive of a
quantum state as a wavefunction on a classical state space,
or as a point in Hilbert space, but in neither case does
'phase space'(*) itself change size when a wavefunction collapses.
In the first case, the wavefunction is suddenly restricted to
a small region of state space; in the second case, the state
vector jumps to a different point in Hilbert space.
  (*) Technically, I'd rather say 'configuration space', since
  phase space refers to a space which has a position *and*
  a momentum coordinate for each degree of freedom, and neither
  Hilbert space nor the space upon which a wavefunction is based
  is like that.

- The time-travelling Maxwell's-demon PMM

This I haven't quite heard before, although I daresay someone
who studies wormholes has thought about thermodynamics in
wormhole spacetimes.

But there's a hidden energy cost in waiting for the low-entropy
states to come along. It takes energy to register the current
state and decide whether it's low entropy. So entropy will be
generated by the selection process. This is the parable of
Maxwell's demon.

As for phase space here ... the Hamiltonian framework describes
the state of the universe by a point in phase space, and the
history of the universe by a path in phase space. A universe
with time travel is probably better described in some other
way, since it likely can't be divided up into a simple series
of 'spacelike surfaces', it will have some more complicated
topology.

I disagree.  Truth is an important concept, but is it really the only means
by which we should measure personal power?  Is truth always the best way to
achieve increased utility (or whatever goal you decide is worthy?)  And
further, in the context of this discussion (arbitrarily limiting belief
structures,) truth is a really fluid concept.  As far as personal
limitations go, the truth is often what you make it.  Believe in your
ability to succeed-- you'll make your own truth.  Conversely, self-doubt is
often self-fulfilling.  For myself, the goal is optimization, and truth is
often a very valuable means of achieving that-- this is why I often
reference the need for clear observation.  Learn your environment-- learn
how the system works, and play the game.

Truth, in this context, means a realistic assessment of our ability rather
than
an outlook based optimism.

I'll repeat my point here for clarity:  If Joe holds the belief that he is,
for instance, unable to talk to women, is that a false belief?

Am not sure "talking to women" is empowerment. Is visiting a
prostitute *empowerment?* Isn't deliberating choosing NOT to talk
also an empowerment ....an exercise of choice? Why not empower
Joe by normalising his choice rather than by forcing him to act differently?

Certainly
the aspect of JW Betty's ideology that we find limiting is its falsehood--
she's unlikely to really reap any eternal salvation from her refusal to take
a transfusion.  However, for many of us (list members) our limiting
ideologies have less to do with religious dogma, and more to do with the
particular kinds of fear that our environment imbues us with.  Many of us
hold beliefs that are 'truth-independent'... self-fulfilling bootstraps with
regards to our personal capabilities, our society, etc.  This is really what
I'm talking about.

Children will automatically assume that the words of adults are true.
Adults will instantaneously take what people say at face value, but will
assess the truth-value very rapidly, measured against their life experience,
then either accept or reject. We may be acting on internal scripts learnt
from adults in childhood that were never properly analysed ....

Hmm... sorry about that, I -do- get a little enthusiastic.  I have been on a
long journey of awakening to my own potential and it has made me very happy.
I guess its sort of hard to talk about these sorts of things without coming
across as Tony Robbins or something.  But there is a great truth here-- we
humans have power... and for those of us in the First world at least, there
are endless opportunities to manifest that power (and others, too.)  I am a
wee bit of an optimist, I admit it.  I do believe there is a way.  I'm not
talking about any spiritual, philosophical or psychological magic here
either-- just be awake.  Observe that there are people out there who operate
on another level-- who understand their empowerment-- who greedily embrace
life.

Do you mean "self-actualisation" in the Rogerian sense?
If so, then you get my approval. I work as a brief strategic therapist
trying to achieve this type of (defined ) empowerment by hypnosis and
by other means ... shadow self work is particularly successful for me.

This is the sort of conversation I'd like to have in person.

$50 an hour I'm afraid ..... (I jest, meet me for a drink if in Leeds).
>

I'm not entirely sure why you hold that the word "Human" is a belief-- I'm
not sure that that's the context in which I most often hear it used.  I call
myself a human, but for me the word simply references my biological status.
Deciding to call yourself NOT-human seems arbitrary-- and if that's
effective for you, then I'm in favor of it.  But is that really a 'truer'
ideology, or simply a more effective one?  I think we agree here more than
you'd like to admit...

The whole point (I though) of this list was that participants are actively
"trans-human" going on "post-human" .....

Just my normal conversation ... though I should remember that Americans
don't handle irony very well, it's more of a British thing maybe.

Sorry, let me rephrase for clarity: "can we imagine environments we don't

See, I thought it would boggle the mind, once given the thought :-).

They travel at speeds up to 75 km/sec (45 km/sec with respect to the

Until someone finds some other kinds of data, we only have our current
radar meteor observations to know, so I don't know.

The mechanisms are fascinating though. I would love to have it as
my thesis topic, if I didn't already have a thesis topic (below).

For a dust particle to escape from beta Pic, it would have to be
accelerated to greater than beta Pic's escape velocity. What might do
that? If the dust particles are small enough, then the Lorentz force
(from beta Pic's magnetic field) would do it.

For example, dust from Io's volcanoes in the Jovian system is
accelerated enough by Lorentz forces (Jupiter's magnetic field) to
escape Jupiter and be detected outside Jupiter's magnetosphere by
the Ulysses, Galileo, and Cassini spacecraft. The picture that we
have for the Io dust ("Jovian dust streams") is a little like a
"dust sprinkler system", spewing the dust in all orientations (here
is my thesis topic). The magnetic field of Jupiter can act as a mass
spectrometer, selecting the smallest particles to be accelerated the
most, so then the spacecraft see mostly the tiny nanometer-sized
particles.

But the beta Pic particles are 40 microns... rather large to be
dominated by Lorentz forces, which dominate submicron sized
particles.

So what other force mechanism? Can gravity accelerate 40 micron
sized particles from there to here? Can radiation pressure force? I
don't know.

Also, the interstellar beta Pic dust particles have to be the right
the size and velocity (and charge and other bulk properties) to
enter our solar sytem. The particles are too big to be embedded in
the interstellar gas flow that flows through our solar system. The
dust particles' optical (etc.) properties are such that they can
penetrate deep into our heliosphere, to Earth, which means that
radiation pressure force from our Sun is not blowing them out. Or
perhaps it is, but on different sized particles than the ones that
we are detecting (duh).

OK, so thinking out loud. I haven't worked out any of this, however,
probably Jack Baggaley, the New Zealand radar researcher who
reported the results, has, no doubt, considered these things.

Still mind boggling.

The second type of perpetual motion machine,

A large volume of phase space, describing

into a single point which describes the electron
as being present at a single point in space.
State-vector reduction takes zillions of possible
superposed Universes and annihilates all but one of them.
Thus, it may be possible to build a quantum perpetual
motion machine in which the amplitudes "cold states"
tend to add up while the amplitudes of "hot states"
cancel out; effectively, this dumps waste heat into
a superposed state that gets blipped out of existence
when the quantum collapse occurs.


Since measurement on a quantum system seems to be
an irreversible process one would say that, performing
such a measurement, the entropy should increase
(John von Neumann,the projection postulate, about 1930).
But the entropy change occuring, without measurement,
in an isolated quantum system and the entropy change due
to measurement are, of course, different (in the later
case some amount of information can be obtained).
So, how this information gain must be paid for?
And, If we look for the entropy change when the unitary
evolution of a quantum system is interrupted by a
"sequence" of measurements, how does entropy change?
"Repeated" measurements, with same result, on a quantum
system, reiterate resettings of the evolving wave function.
It brings about even an impediment of the evolution, when
the temporal separation of the detections is reduced, and
the interaction approaches to "continuous" measurement.
Well, the answer seems to be that: "repeated" measurements
on a quantum system tends to decrease the entropy
of this quantum system; a "continuous" measurement
on a quantum system tends to reduce the entropy to zero.
Of course it is somewhat counter-intutive that "repeated"
measurements decrease the entropy of a quantum system.
This "Zeno" effect is, perhaps, suggesting another
perpetual motion weird machine!

That an amendment was passed (relatively recently) ok-ing government extortion
(and passed in an arguably incorrect and unconstitutional manner) does not mean
that this level of government extortion is in keeping with the original intent
of founders of this country.  Nor does it mean that the people should not
complain bitterly about their de facto enslavement.   That Congress gave itself
this power also says little about how it is done or how much is correct or sets
any limits at all.  It is extremely dangerous wording.

There is nothing "voluntary" about sums collected at literal gunpoint if you
decide not to "volunteer".  Let's not pretend about that.

not because of but in spite of many of the efforts of government.  Government has become
a major oppressor in this country as it historically has in ev every country where its
power went effectively unchecked for too long.

As Will Rogers once said in an era of much smaller government, "Thank God we don't get
all the government we have paid for!"

[Non-member submission]

First of all, you certainly have not shut the door to a mathematical proof
of transhuman
minds' significant imperfection.  The analogy to thermodynamics is OK, but
it doesn't give you
guidance as to what the actual probabilities involved are.  You just pull
the probability values
out of a hat (leading to your figures of decillion years, centillion years,
etc.), by analogy to
the logic of much simpler systems.  The door is open for a real mathematical
analysis of
the lossiness and error-prone-ness of knowledge and inference in minds of
various sizes.  However,
I do not intend to provide this at the moment -- though I do hope, before I
die (if I ever do, which
I hope I don't ;), to create a real mathematical theory of mind that would
allow such questions
be be explored...

Second, your investigation raises an interesting question.  If a human were
faced with the tasks of a
leaf-cutter ant -- find some leaves to eat, carry them back home and store
them, then eat them when hungry --
then presumably the human would not make very many errors of fact or
judgment.  (If the human went insane
it would be from boredom ;)

The point is: We have sought out tasks that strain our cognitive
architecture.

What tasks strain us most?  Science and mathematics are two candidates.
Another candidate is social
interaction.  Many primate anthropologists believe that the impetus for the
origin of our big brains
was the need to socially model each other (lying, cheating, thieving and all
the good stuff ...)

Similarly, for our posited superduperbrilliant transhuman minds, there will
be some tasks that will
strain even ~their~ intelligence.  Perhaps including the tasks of
outsmarting one another, or perhaps not --
I won't pretend to foresee the nature of transhuman social networks or
whatever replaces social networks
in such groupings of minds...

When dealing with tasks that push the limits of the mind, error-prone-ness
will increase.  I fuck up a lot
more when proving theorems or making business deals than I would when
gathering leaves to eat, for example.

On the other hand, perhaps transhumans won't push the limits of their
minds... so they'll never have this
problem, unlike humans.  I can't give a precise refutation of this.  I just
have an intuition that for any
intelligent system, a certain percentage of the population will get bored if
it's not pushing itself to its
limit.  Maybe this is an anthropmorphization.

Or is there an uncertainty principle here?  You go nuts from boredom on the
one hand, or you push yourself
to the limit and make mistakes on the other hand?

[Or, better yet, if you're really advanced, you can do
both at once -- just atke a job in the software business!!  ;p ]

I don't claim to have demonstrated anything here -- except that there is a
lot of room for doubt where these
matters are concerned... that the apparent solidity of arguments based on
the thermodynamic analogy is only
apparent.  You may well be right Eliezer, but by ignoring "cognitive
science" issues you really ignore the
crux of it all.  Of course our knowledge of transhuman psychology is fairly
limited, which just means, to my
mind, that a lot of humility is appropriate in the face of these huge
questions.

With a project like building a thinking machine, or proving a theorem, or
even composing a piece of music,
one's ideas can eventually be refuted by experience.  The algorithm fails,
the proof fails, the composition
sounds bad [to oneself, or to others].  In noodling about transhuman
psychology, there's no feedback from
external physical or social or mathemtaical reality, so anything goes --
until 500 years from now when AI's
look back and laugh at our silly ideas...

What we actually need is to remove every single law that contradicts the
Bill of Rights.  The DEA has been a disaster of major proportions largely
because it ignores people's right to make their own decisions about what
they ingest and in the process has fueled unconstitutional search and
seizure, detention of citizens, and so on.  Everything you own can be
seized by the government and sold off before you ever get to trial if
someone claims you traffic in drugs (in some states if they even claim
you are a user).  Black-clad unidentified goons can kick open your door
in the middle of the night without identifying themselves much less
presenting a warrant.  There have been people killed for attempting to
defend their homes and loved ones against such interlopers.  The IRS has
been known to seize entire estates over the smallest sums in dispute.
This country where the government is supposedly the protector of
individual rights has become instead a tyrant that its own citizens
fear.  As well they should when such things as these take place and are
sanctioned.  This country, land of the free, has more of its people in
jail per capita than any other.   Something is obviously badly wrong.

Civil disobedience is one way to fight.  Ignoring laws and not making

It is actually essential.  If you learned and obeyed the letter of every
law that binds you you would have little time for anything else and would
not be able to do very much in what time you had left.

Open disobedience arguably brought the first prohibition to an end.  I
recommend that we campaign as hard against the "War on Drugs" as some of
us campaigned against the Vietnam war so long ago.  In the meantime
whatever freedoms have been wrongly coopted by the State can only be
exercised in secrecy or  publicly in civil disobedience.

But the many of those laws we already have deny  our rights and thus
contradict the very basis of government power in this country.  Their
zealous enforcement is nothing short of tyranny.   You must pick and
choose and oppose as best you can what is oppressive.

Yes.  Finding and duplicating human learning programs, much less
radically improving on them for machine use, is likely to take far
longer than merely matching raw hardware.   Arguably, AIs should not
think or learn quite like humans have evolved to.  But that does not
make the problem more tractable.

Maybe, maybe not.  If the intelligence is actually learning in a similar
way as humans do then the very act of learning consists of integrating
the new information within the net of information already possessed and
binding it up with such already present information and mind-state.  It
is quite possible that information so integrated is no more seperable
and easily transmitted to another machine than it is from human to
human.  This would be ironic but not unexpected.  Since the AI operates
at higher speed it might still learn and teach much faster than we do
however.

I think it can be proved that a general purpose computer (a Turing
equivalent) can be constructed using quantum computing techniques. But I

And that wiring is nothing much more than programs burned into these
levels.  There is no reason I see that an Artificial Intelligence could
not run and even auto-generate similar programs.  There are also quite
logical components to many of the named "human" qualities above that any
sufficiently intelligent consciousness interacting with others is likely
to come up with in some form or other.

I could see that faster intelligences would at least regard unagumented
humans as too slow to be competitive or sufficiently capable in some
areas.  It is already obvious to many of us that humans (as currently
existing) are quite inefficient and inadequate at some types of tasks
increasingly required by even current circumstances.  I predict that
within 10 years no human not highly wired into the computer nets will be
able to compete in many white collar jobs.

I also predict that within 10 years of getting
human-equivalent-processing-power machines that many white collar jobs
will be off-loaded to specialized machine intelligences.  The economic
incentives are high.

Without a change in human consciousness from scarcity to abundance-based

This is a strawman.  Let me live 2000 years with at least the mental
capacity I possess now and I will find more than enough to do and enjoy
and plentiful ways to effectively multiply that capacity.  There is no

Actually, I predict that the only way to eventually keep the peace and
allow everyone maximum freedom is to pop the more coercive (of others)
elements into a VR where they can live out whatever reality they choose
until such time as they choose differently.  A sort of high-tech karma
system.  Some days I am not convinced we aren't already in such a
system.

	well, in the case of self-reproducing automata, "there's no one
home." _our_ minds (external to the automaton) can distinguish that the
automaton is performing perfect self-replication, but it is far from
obvious that the automaton itself enjoys the same degree of
discrimination.

Drug companies can take small comfort in the fact that Hamied might be out

In the long run, geriatric luddites will die off, thus freeing drug

D'oh!  I knew that.  Actually, it would be more accurate to say that I've
*heard* that, but the version I keep on remembering is "You can't win, you
can't break even, and you can't get out of the game."  Sorry.

Double d'oh!  I remember that too - or think I do; can't trust LTM. 
Wasn't there a name for phase space, though?  M-something?  I can't find
it on the 'Net, though, and "phase space" is something for which it's
really convenient to have a single word.

Incidentally, one formulation I've run across online is that the
"Hamiltonian" refers to the (6N-1)D surface in (6N)D phase space with
constant energy, with the (as it turns out) first law of thermodynamics
referring to a constraint on the trajectory through phase space; i.e., any
individual point must move along the Hamiltonian hypersurface that has
constant energy.  The memory I seem to remember having is that the
"Hamiltonian" is the (6N+1)D hypersurface that shows the energy as a
function of phase space and is used locally to describe potential energy
surfaces.  Sigh... I either need to actually read my set of the Feynman
lectures, find a good physics encyclopedia, or give up physical science.

<RANT>

Paul Davies sez:  "It is easy to dream up scenarios that produce
unphysical or paradoxical consequences--building perpetual motion
machines, or even travelling backwards in time. To physicists, these are
alarming notions."

Who knows, Davies may turn out to be right; but even so, this strikes me
as the sort of thing that future historians call a 'blind spot', like the
unbreakability of the sound barrier or the impossibility of
heavier-than-air flight.  "Despite numerous demonstrations that their own
theories permitted the possibility of time travel / negative energy /
naked singularities etc., twentieth-century physicists still refused to
believe, calling them 'alarming notions'."  This rant is more about time
travel then about thermodynamics, but real physical laws don't look like
they're about to be violated every second Tuesday.  Sometimes physics
fights back, as when it turns out that the Alcubierre warp drive required
more energy than existed in the entire Universe, but sometimes the Cosmic
Censorship patches turn out to be equally flawed themselves - the
Alcubierre drive was replaced by the Van Den Broeck drive, and so on.  The
original "Cosmic Censorship" hypothesis preventing naked singularities
also turned out to be flawed, as I recall.

Real physical laws, like conservation of mass and energy, are not
preserved by all these Cosmic Censorship patches; the global law is the
result of the absolute firmness of the local law.  Paul Davies talks about
"permissible fluctuations in entropy", but did you ever hear of a
permissible fluctuation in mass-energy?

If current physical theory offends a physicist, so what?  God does play
dice with the Universe, Einstein, get over it.  Even the more imaginative
physicists, like David Deutsch, suffer from the same disease, confining
closed timelike curves to quantum universes and so on.  Time travel,
*including* global causality violation, is explicitly permitted by General
Relativity.  Physicists will just need to learn to deal with it.

Oh, never mind.  I'm not a physicist.  You can get personally annoyed with
physical theories, but you're supposed to buy the right to do so with a
physics doctorate.  This system works so well generally that I would have
no real objection to being slapped down by it personally.  Not my job.

This is an interesting way of looking at it.  It looks to me like
particles being created and destroyed - in particular, negative-energy and
positive-energy particles annihilating, as opposed to matter-antimatter
interactions which give rise to gamma rays or other new particles - are
intrinsically many-to-one or one-to-many rather than one-to-one.  As I
understand it, there is no way to predict, from the current state of the
Universe, where a negative and positive particle pair will come into
existence; thus the current phase-space point of the Universe can give
rise to multiple points at the next instant - one possible alternate point
for each place a virtual particle pair can pop up.  Similarly, a virtual
pair ("virtual pair" in the negative-positive, not matter-antimatter,
sense) can annihilate either over *here* or over *there*, and the state of
the Universe will be same either way, since neither particle exists any
more - a many-to-one interaction.  It's an interesting question whether
this same objection applies to Feynman diagrams; that is, whether a
positron and electron can collide in two different ways and give rise to
precisely the same gamma particle.  I myself don't know.

(As Hal Finney from "Extropians" put it:

)

Anyway.

There are two possible ways that entropy could be conserved; either the
method of manufacturing negative matter could intrinsically create as much
additional entropy (through one-to-many interactions) as could be
destroyed by annihilating the matter (through many-to-one interactions);
or, it could be demonstrated that phase space really is unified and all
interactions involved are one-to-one; that is, no two different
annihilations will give rise to the same state of post-annihilation
Universe.

It's hard to tell which theory is represented by Paul Davies's Censorship
objections, but I would guess the former, since he does talk about
"permissible fluctuations in entropy".  Paul Davies's objections seem to
show that if you try and take a beam of negative energy and use it to cool
something off, or if you try to go somewhere where there's a lot of
negative energy, you'll get hit by at least as much positive energy as
negative.  This is not too surprising - conservation of mass-energy says
that positive energy has to show up somewhere.  My specific suggestion
relied on actually manufacturing negative *matter*, not just beams or
regions of negative energy - which, confessably, is a much less analyzable
proposal since there's much more real analysis of negative *energy* than
negative *matter*.  Nonetheless, physicists do make proposals relying on
negative matter, not just negative energy, and I recall that some
manufacturing proposals have been made.  The lynchpin of my proposal is
not to just cool down matter with a negative-energy beam; it is to use the
negative and positive matter as actual heat sinks for the entropy of your
laced positive-matter and negative-matter Solar-System-sized computer,
then throw the matter away.  In particular, it would be interesting to see
what Paul Davies would make of a proposal to transfer entropy to the
negative energy or positive energy itself before it annihilated, rather
than directing negative energy at an external target.

The key feature of the proposal is not that the phase space changes sizes;
that is simply one way of looking at the underlying "problem", which is
that multiple points in phase space move to single points in phase space. 
E.g., an electron with a .8 probability amplitude of being at A and a .6i
amplitude of being at B, and an electron with a .9 amplitude of being at A
and a .4i amplitude of being at B, can both collapse to having a 1
amplitude of being at A.

Hal Finney's objection in the parallel Universe of "Extropians" is quoted
here:

> If you think of a many worlds model, any such attempt would not actually
> blip any other universes out of existence, but rather it simply allows

The problem is, of course, that the many-worlds model just isn't true.  If
quantum collapse were an observational-effect illusion, it would make no
difference what the probability amplitudes were; we would have the same
observed chance of winding up in a .2 probability Universe as a .8
probability Universe.  In this case, of course, my proposed method for
entropy disposal would totally fail.

Hal Finney's objection could be resurrected by pointing out that
decreasing the probability of high-entropy Universes, or increasing the
probability of low-entropy Universes, could require that a superposed
state learn how much entropy it has, which - in turn - could turn out to
generate more entropy than could be disposed of.  After all, getting
particular states to add up or cancel out has to happen *before* the
quantum collapse.  That would be a classic Censorship patch.  It might be
possible, however, to generate all the self-observation entropy in the
high-entropy superposed states that are cancelling themselves out, thus
getting around that objection as well.

My mental visualization here is not a Maxwell's demon situation, but
something more "emergent" - some way of ensuring, e.g., that electrons
which all happen to be moving in the same direction, have amplitudes that
build up, while electrons which happen to be moving in different
directions have amplitudes that cancel out.  From the internal,
pre-collapse perspective, no entropy violation has occurred.  Let's say
there are two electrons.  There are four superposed states where the
electrons are moving in the same direction, and four superposed states
where the electrons are moving in opposite directions.  It's just that the
first four superposed states all have amplitudes of .8i, while the second
four superposed states have amplitudes of .8i, -.8, -.8i, and .8
respectively, cancelling each other out.  In which case you could create a
crystal in which quantum effects turned heat directly into electricity,
although it might not be direct current, or at least not direct current of
a predictable direction, as that would violate CPT.

Maxwell's demon applies to individual particles, rather than whole
systems.  Different rules might apply if you're willing to wait a
"decillion" years to get your low-entropy state.  In other words, it could
be that the entropy cost of Maxwell's demon making one "selection" is
constant, and that it's performing the repeated discrimination on each and
every particle that defeats the process.  Of course, it's just as possible
that constructing a demon which will actually last for a "decillion" -
I'll just say "zillion" - years would cost far more than any useful work
that could be gained from the system.

But your objection is probably correct; e.g., performing a discrimination,
or continually checking for one, on an entire physical system, could
easily turn out to have entropy costs far in excess of entropy gained.

A more interesting idea is this:  Perform the Maxwell's Demon
discrimination, extract the information, send the information backwards in
time, and then don't perform the costly process that got you the
information in the first place.  This throws away entropy into a future
that gets wiped out of existence by tampering with the past.

Yes, that's what I see as a possible opportunity for violating the usual
"conservation of phase space volume" rules.

==============

What we actually need is to remove every single law that contradicts the
Bill of Rights.  The DEA has been a disaster of major proportions largely
because it ignores people's right to make their own decisions about what
they ingest and in the process has fueled unconstitutional search and
seizure, detention of citizens, and so on.  Everything you own can be
seized by the government and sold off before you ever get to trial if
someone claims you traffic in drugs (in some states if they even claim
you are a user).  Black-clad unidentified goons can kick open your door
in the middle of the night without identifying themselves much less
presenting a warrant.  There have been people killed for attempting to
defend their homes and loved ones against such interlopers.  The IRS has
been known to seize entire estates over the smallest sums in dispute.
This country where the government is supposedly the protector of
individual rights has become instead a tyrant that its own citizens
fear.  As well they should when such things as these take place and are
sanctioned.  This country, land of the free, has more of its people in
jail per capita than any other.   Something is obviously badly wrong.

Civil disobedience is one way to fight.  Ignoring laws and not making

It is actually essential.  If you learned and obeyed the letter of every
law that binds you you would have little time for anything else and would
not be able to do very much in what time you had left.

Open disobedience arguably brought the first prohibition to an end.  I
recommend that we campaign as hard against the "War on Drugs" as some of
us campaigned against the Vietnam war so long ago.  In the meantime
whatever freedoms have been wrongly coopted by the State can only be
exercised in secrecy or  publicly in civil disobedience.

But the many of those laws we already have deny  our rights and thus
contradict the very basis of government power in this country.  Their
zealous enforcement is nothing short of tyranny.   You must pick and
choose and oppose as best you can what is oppressive.

Well, sure.  Once you've said that the expiration date on a description
increases exponentially with RAM, or that the time for a thermodynamic
miracle increases exponentially with the number of particles in the
system, you've said everything there is to say from a complexity-theory
perspective.  Trying to come up with real numbers for that would be
totally hopeless.

I don't see how you can possibly do this.  Given a specific physical
system, you can estimate the error rate of the underlying processes and
demonstrate that, e.g., there is a 10^-50 chance of a single error
occurring in ten thousand years of operation.  I don't see how you could
possibly get specific numbers for software errors in a program as complex
as Webmind, much less a human, much less a totally unspecified transhuman.

There will never be a real mathematical theory of mind that is less
complex than a mind itself; no useful part of the mind will ever be
describable except by all the individual equations governing
transistor-equivalents or neurons.  The wish for such a theory is simply
physics envy.  We live in a world where physical systems turn out to
exhibit all sorts of interesting, mathematically describable high-level
behaviors; but neither the biology of evolved organisms, nor the behavior
of evolved minds, nor the computer programs we design, exhibit any such
tendency.  If you took the sum of all the numbers in a computer's RAM and
plotted it over time, you might find that it danced an airy Gaussian
minuet around a mean, but I don't think you will ever find any behavior
more interesting than that - there is no reason why such a behavior would
exist and no precedent for expecting one.  Mathematics is an
extraordinarily powerful tool which will never be useful to cognitive
scientists.  We'll just have to live with that.

Precisely.  Effective perfection is achievable.

Yes.  And, at our current level of intelligence, staying sane - or rather,
developing a personal philosophy and learning self-knowledge - strains
these abilities to the limit.  Indeed, before the development of
evolutionary psychology and related sciences, humanity's philosophers
totally failed to deduce these facts through introspection - even though
all the information was, theoretically, available.

We have no ability to observe individual neurons.

In the realm of the mind, we have no ability to construct tools, or tools
to build tools, whereby we could examine intermediate levels.

We have no direct access to, or manipulation of, our underlying functional
layers.

Of course we fail.

Now, you can make up all kinds of reasons why AIs or transhumans might run
into minor difficulties decoding neural nets, failing to achieve complete
perfection, and so on.  But it looks to me like simple common sense says
that, if we humans had all these abilities, we would have achieved vastly
more than we have now.  No, we still might not be perfect.  But we would,
at the very least, be vastly better.  And, given enough time, or given
transhuman intelligence, we might well achieve effective perfection in the
domain of sanity.

Will transhumans seek out tasks that strain their abilities?  I don't
know.  Will they take these domains and make them part of themselves,
assimilating them, running mental simulations, so that their self is also
a strain to understand?  Maybe - the border between external and internal
reality gets a bit blurred when you can *really* run mental simulations. 
Even so, however, the domain of "sanity" is only a subset of the domain of
"self-observation".  I think that the problem of sanity can be solved,
completely and forever.  I think it's a problem that strains our current
minds and current access, but would not strain either a transhuman mind,
or a mind with the ability to access the neural-analogue level and build
tools to build tools.

I never wanted to ignore "cognitive science" issues.  The whole point of

it back into the cognitive one.

Of course.  But, though perhaps I am mistaken, it looks to me like your
beliefs about transhumanity have effects on what you do in the
here-and-now.  Certainly your projections about transhumanity, and your
actions in the present, spring from the same set of underlying
assumptions.

Hi Steve.

You wrote:

I agree that we should make realistic assessments, but I suppose I'm trying
to be evocative of the somewhat more fluid actuality.  Our abilities are
often inextricably linked to our self-perception-- for instance, strangely,
my billiards game falls apart when I play my father.  The sort of
limitations I'm talking about removing have less to do with the physical
truth of our reality, and more to do with arbitrary limits we assign
ourselves for non-rational and emotional reasons.  The 'truth' of whether or
not I am capable of doing certain things is very often a function of, for
instance, my self-confidence.  This might be Yoda-esque, but I am no longer
'trying' to be successful, I have 'determined' to be successful.  In making
such a determination, I am choosing a greater truth for myself.

I'm not talking about forcing Joe to do anything... hey, if he doesn't want
to talk to someone, that's fine.  The far more common scenario that I'm
referencing however, is the case of an individual wanting to talk to other
people, but sabotaging their own efforts due to self-imposed doubt.  BTW,
I'm not suggesting the solution is trivial-- au contraire.

You would need a branch of mathematics that does not currently exist,
i.e. a real "complex systems science"

That is entirely ridiculous, in my view.  I have a mathematical theory of
parts of Webmind, and I know mathematical theories that explain how parts of
the human mind work (so far not the most interesting parts) ... see the
Journal of
Mathematical Psychology (at least 10% of the papers in there are of real
value ;)

You can say "There will never be a mathematical theory explaining the exact
dynamics
of a particular mind that is less complex than that mind itself" -- but so
what.
Even physics doesn't explain the exact trajectory of a pendulum.  One is
seeking approximate
explanations, or more technically "probably approximately correct" (PAC)
explanations...

We have theories of mind that we use all the time in practical dealings with
other beings.
Autistic people lack these; chimps have only simple ones.  I see no reason
why a mathematical
theory of mind can't bring together the kind of practical heuristics we use
in everyday mind-modeling
with the empirical data analysis we have in mathematical and statistical
psychology.

I don't have such a theory right now -- though I've tried to sketch the
outlines in my books Chaotic
Logic and From Complexity to Creativity -- but you certainly haven't given
me a reasoned argument
as to why such a theory can't be achieved.

As for getting precise numbers, why do you assume these are the only
possible outcome of a
mathematical theory?  Much of mathematics is non-numerical in fact --
algebra, topology, logic....
Certainly, one would expect to be able to prove things about the probability
that a system's error
rate lies in a certain interval, much more so than to be able to derive
exact numerical values
describing complex system states.

 > The wish for such a theory is simply
 > physics envy.

It seems to me that, rather, your view of what a mathematical theory ~is~ is
overly constrained by
what physics theories are.

I'm finding it hard to resist using unpleasant language in response to this
very
silly statement.

How can you make such an emphatic, authoritative-sounding declaration
regarding a topic that you obviously know very little about!!

Why the hell would you assume that statistical analysis is the only
mathematical analysis
one can do of digital or biological brains?  You can do more interesting
stuff than that with EEG's
for Christ's sake.  Ever study Walter Freeman's work on the chaotic dynamics
of the rabbit brain?
This is a long way from statistics.

We now lack the data to study the dynamics of human brain/minds in detail,
but in 20 years when
we have PET or fMRI scans (which give spatial maps of the active regions in
the brain),
with the temporal resolution of EEG's, we'll have the ability to make 3D
movies of brain function,
and to apply intelligent data analysis techniques to these.  I'm willing to
bet you anything you
want that this will yield to a lot more interesting things than are revealed
by simple statistical
analysis of individual numerical parameters.

In digital brains, the situation is much better, because we don't need fancy
quantum resonance
scans to measure a system's internal state.  We can generate vast tables of
numbers by logging the states
of the components of our AI systems.  These tables of numbers, I can tell
you from practical experience,
DO reveal interesting patterns going far beyond simple statistics, from
which it is possible to infer
interesting approximative models of mind structure/dynamics.  See Jim
Crutchfield's work on
"Computational Mechanics" for a review of one approach to automatically
inferring computational models of complex
systems from time series data -- my own approach to this problem is subtler
and more practical than his,
but along similar lines.

I think this is a confusion.  Self-knowledge, in my view, will always stress
a system to the limit, because of its peculiar self-referential nature.
True self-knowledge is never possible... and the more complex you become in
order
to solve the problem of modeling yourself and others, the harder you become
to know
due to your increasing complexity...

 > We have no ability to observe individual neurons.

Actually, we can track the state of an individual neuron pretty well, the
problem is monitoring
more than a couple thousand at once, using current technology -- which will
surely be superseded
in a few decades...

To me, your leap from "vastly better" to "effective perfection" is a huge
and
unjustified one..

We are vastly better than ants in many senses, but nowhere near perfect in
any
objective sense...

Yes, where differ is then in our intuition about the relationship between
mathematics and cognitive science.  I think that a new kind of math is
needed to
transform cognitive science into a real science.  Perhaps AI's will help us
create
this new kind of math.

Well, the fact that I believe transhumanity is possible has a huge impact on
my
life, since I spend a lot of my time actively trying to create it.  The fact
that
I believe transhumanity will probably be a good thing also has an impact...
otherwise
I wouldn't try to build it even though I think I know how.

Beyond that simple level, my particular intuitions about transhumanity don't
affect my work
very much, and certainly not my personal life...

Say that we get the technology to vastly improve a person in some fairly
unambiguous way (say indefinite lifespan). Say also that the only way to
make this work is to do some pre-natal hacking.

What is the ethical position in this case? It would seem to me that it would
be highly unethical to allow children to be born without the enhancement. Am
I crazy?

Are you crazy? Yeah, probably. So what? You answered the question
correctly.
Prenatal enhancement might help to insure this crazy accuracy gets
replicated.
(But will it be in time for technological singularity? It may *be* the
singularity.)

I don't see how. Tomorrow  you might find a proof of the Goldbach Conjecture
and prove it true, or tomorrow you might find a counterexample and prove it false,
or it might be Turing unprovable, meaning it's true so you'll never find a counterexample
to prove it wrong but a finite proof does not exist so you'll never find a way to
prove it's correct. You might not  find a proof or a counterexample, not in
a year, not in a million years,  not in 10^9^9^9 years, not ever. You won't
even know your task is hopeless so you might just keep plugging away at the
problem for eternity and make absolutely zero progress.  We don't know even
approximately how this might turn out because we can't assign meaningful
probabilities to the various possible outcomes, we don't know and can't know
what if anything our mind will come up with. I just don't know what I'm going to
do tomorrow because I don't understand myself very well, and the same would
be true if I was a chimp or a human or a Transhuman.

Don't forget, position in phase space fully determines the future
trajectory (in the classical model).  Phase space points represent
positions plus velocities.  Given a point, you can trace the line
which the system will follow.  In this model there is little need for
a hypersurface of constant energy.  You could define one, but it's not
really very meaningful since you already know exactly where on that
surface it is going to go, given the initial position in phase space.

An interesting article. The drug companies have been using a bad
economic model that depended on the government running interference
for them. Now that the "cat is out of the bag" they will have to
adopt a more realistic, free market model.

Extropian investors beware during the interim.

One thing I thought the article failed to point out is that if
those who do not understand TANSTAAFL get their way they could
easily kill the "goose that lays the golden eggs", in other words
if pharmaceutical companies intellectual property is compromised,
they will not generate any more or at least dramatically less.

                        Muscle Mechanics
     Correct technique for 73 resistance training exercises
                         Everett Aaberg
                       ISBN 0-88011-796-6

This is a book that's so well done that it's convinced me I was
doing something wrong just from the preface. From now on it's not
"weightlifting" it's "resistance training".

Check out this obviously extropian paragraph from the preface:

" Throughout our lives, most of us have learned certain things
which we may have developed very strong feelings and opinions
about. Eventually these beliefs are challenged, and we are forced
to question them. Fitness is still a relatively young field of
study. We should look on any new ideas presented with an open mind
and perhaps analyze the validity of our present beliefs. Many
times, if we trace them to their origins, we will find that our
present beliefs have been passed on to us from less-than-reliable
sources."

Mr Aaberg is a instructor with the Cooper Institute for Aerobic
Research for a specialty certificate entitled " The Biomechanics of
Strength Training."

Darn good stuff.

Hi Brian.

Can you briefly share some of the core elements of the unique thought that
Mr Aaberg is bringing this field?

For those of you interested in Gnutella, Freenet, and other peer-to-peer 
and distributed computing infrastructures, here's a good paper on the 
topic, with some other more popular news stores on closely related issues:

FREE RIDING ON GNUTELLA

ABSTRACT:
An extensive analysis of user traffic on Gnutella shows a significant 
amount of free riding in the system. By sampling messages on the Gnutella 
network over a 24-hour period, we established that almost 70% of Gnutella 
users share no files, and nearly 50% of all responses are returned by the 
top 1% of sharing hosts. Furthermore, we found out that free riding is 
distributed evenly between domains, so that no one group contributes 
significantly more than others, and that peers that volunteer to share 
files are not necessarily those who have desirable ones. We argue that free 
riding leads to degradation of the system performance and adds 
vulnerability to the system. If this trend continues copyright issues might 
become moot compared to the possible collapse of such systems.

Hi Extropes

I was cleaning up some files on my hard disk, and I ran across the
following file, written by an acquaintence many years ago. Since
I was thinking of the whole "None of the Above" voting procedure
recently, I thought I'd post it for fun.

It is still appropriate after all of these years, wouldn't you say?

(even if the tone is a bit.. uhmm..  biting .. so then tongue-in-cheek humor)

In the science fiction books that I have seen, there are items about big
things in space.  Niven wrote about a Ringworld, there is Dyson Sphere
which is shell around the sun, etc.  What I am wondering about are
constructs around a planetary solar satellite.  For example, if a 3 inch
reflective layer around Mercury was made from solar cells, it could
generate lots of power. Or, if a shell was built around the entire
planet of Neptune, there could be an environment on the planet's
surface.

Megascale engineering could give a planet its complete atmosphere and
home sun radiation exposures and gravitational effects regardless of
whether the sun still existed if it had novaed.  So, it would be a
projected sun in the sky, and the surrounding stars at night, with
regular gravity.

If the Earth is 25,000 miles in circumference, it would have to be
bigger than that.  Refer to Anders Sandberg's web pages for megascale
engineering.

Yeah, well, lucky I said nothing like what you're talking about, so
I'm still 100% correct.  I know taxation is theft.  Theft happens to
be in the Constitution.

My point, my only point, was that the income tax is constitutional.
Here's why it's constitutional: it's in the Constitution.  This ends
the discussion of the Constitutionality for reasonable people.

James

Yeah, but is it constitutional?

I find it rather difficult to pity the failed efforts of groups with 
no better goal than to circumvent the rights of copyright holders.

Copy pasted this from some obscure node on the 'net =]



--------

In 1894, Congress adopted an income tax act which was declared 
unconstitutional in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429, 15 
S.Ct. 673, aff. reh., 158 U.S. 601, 15 S.Ct. 912 (1895). The Pollock Court 
found that the income tax was a direct tax which could only be imposed if 
the tax was apportioned; since this tax was not apportioned, it was found 
unconstitutional. In an effort to circumvent this decision, the 16th 
Amendment was proposed by Congress in 1909 and allegedly ratified by the 
states in 1913. As a result, various opinions arose regarding the legal 
effect of the amendment. Some factions contended that the 16th Amendment 
simply eliminated the apportionment requirement for one specific direct tax 
known as the income tax, while others asserted that the amendment simply 
withdrew it from the direct tax category and placed the income tax in the 
indirect, excise tax class. These competing contentions and interpretations 
were apparently resolved in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 240 
U.S. 1, 36 S.Ct. 236 (1916).[1] Rather than attempt a determination of what 
the Court held in this case, it is more important to learn what various 
courts have subsequently declared Brushaber to mean.

    A little more than a week after the opinion in Brushaber, similar issues 
were present for decision in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103, 
112-13, 36 S.Ct. 278 (1916), which involved the question of whether an 
inadequate depletion allowance for a mining company constituted a direct tax 
on the company's property. As to Baltic's contention that "the 16th 
Amendment authorized only an exceptional direct income tax without 
apportionment," the Court rejected it by stating that this contention:

"... manifestly disregards the fact that by the previous ruling it was 
settled that the provisions of the 16th Amendment conferred no new power of 
taxation, but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of 
income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken 
out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged, 
and being placed in the category of direct taxation."
The Court clearly held that income taxes inherently belonged to the 
indirect/excise tax class, but had been converted by Pollock to direct taxes 
by considering the source of the income; the 16th Amendment merely banished 
the rule in Pollock. See also Tyee Realty Co. v. Anderson, 240 U.S. 115, 36 
S.Ct. 281 (1916), decided the same day.
    However, the victory of defining what the 16th Amendment meant was short 
lived and later decisions commenced a course which appears to have changed 
the meaning of Brushaber, or at least provided fertile grounds for an 
entirely different and opposite construction of it. In William E. Peck and 
Co. v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165, 172-73, 38 S.Ct. 432, 433 (1918), which involved 
a tax imposed on export earnings, the Court seemed to indicate that what was 
accomplished by the amendment was the elimination of the apportionment 
requirement for the direct tax known as the income tax, an argument rejected 
in Baltic:

"The Sixteenth Amendment, although referred to in argument, has no real 
bearing and may be put out of view. As pointed out in recent decisions, it 
does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects, but merely 
removed all occasion, which otherwise might exist, for an apportionment 
among the states of taxes laid on income, whether it be derived from one 
source or another."
    The drift away from the position of the Court that the income tax via 
the 16th Amendment fell within the excise tax category became more 
pronounced with the decision in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 206, 40 
S.Ct. 189 (1920), which involved the application of this tax to a stock 
dividend. Here, the Court plainly stated what many lawyers and some judges 
today think was accomplished by means of this amendment: the elimination of 
the apportionment requirement for the direct tax known as the income tax. In 
deciding this case, the Court quoted the amendment and then redeclared its 
meaning:
"As repeatedly held, this did not extend the taxing power to new subjects, 
but merely removed the necessity which otherwise might exist for an 
apportionment among the states of taxes laid on income. Brushaber....," 252 
U.S., at 206.
"A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, 
requires also that this amendment shall not be extended by loose 
construction, so as to repeal or modify, except as applied to income, those 
provisions of the Constitution that require an apportionment according to 
population for direct taxes upon property, real and personal."

Is this the resurfacing of the argument that "the 16th Amendment authorized 
only an exceptional direct income tax without apportionment" condemned in 
Baltic?
    From a study of Brushaber, it is thus possible for someone to rely upon 
those portions of the two phrases at the beginning and ending of 240 U.S. 19 
to believe that "the 16th Amendment authorized only an exceptional direct 
income tax without apportionment." If one fell into that error, this belief 
would be magnified by the above highlighted portions of Eisner. Confusion 
abounds as to the correct interpretation of Brushaber, and this is obvious 
because various courts of this nation have relied upon this line of 
authority to reach diametrically opposing results.

    The state courts have been particularly split over the nature of an 
income tax and whether it constitutes a direct property tax or an 
indirect/excise, which is not imposed on property.

     This is the 32'nd update on my fly longevity experiments. In Run 
 #31 I retest coconut juice, and synephrine, which improved longevity
 back in Run #28. For comparison purposes, I have reproduced part of 
 Run #28 below as well.

     The flies used in Run #31 were derived from a rather old breeding
 bottle, which presumably held a lot of older flies. An increased 
 number of doddering flies might account for the higher than normal 
 short-term mortality in both the control bottle, as well as several
 other bottles in this run.
     This time around synephrine did not increase maximum lifespan, 
 though early survival was enhanced. Judging by its effect on flies,
 synephrine might prove to be a non-toxic antiobesity agent for humans.
     Once again coconut juice was associated with superior overall
 survival, increasing both average and maximum survivals in both runs.
 The active ingrediants in coconut juice are unknown, as is the
 mechanism of their operation.
     I included IP6 (inositol hexaphosphate), and resveratrol to test
 thet iron, and copper dependance respectively of fly longevity. Flies 
 fed 4-24 fly food are known to accumulate iron in tissues. Inclusion
 of iron chelators is known to block this accumulation and increase
 longevity slightly. However I use citric acid as a standard additive
 to block pathogen  growth, and this may also reduce iron availability.
 This may be the reason IP6 failed to offer a benefit in the present
 experiment. Resveratrol also proved to be a disappointment.
     One surpise hit was with Knudsen elderberry nectar juice. The
 ingrediants are as follows: filtered water, juices from whole apple,
 elderberry, bosenberry, plum, and grape. I was not impressed with the
 results with either apple juice (Run #11), prune juice (Runs #22 & 24) 
 or  with grape juice (Runs #11 & #30), although grape may offer a very
 minor benefit. Both elderberry and bosenberry juices remain to be
 investigated. Although average longevity was the best with elderberry
 nectar, no benefit on maximum lifespan appeared in this run.
     In Run #32 I retested both coconut, and Knudsen elderberry nectar
 juices. The results were uniformly good. At a 50% dilution both juices
 increased lifespan. At full strength, coconut outperformed 50% juice up
 until the day 37 census. Full strength elderberry improved survival over
 50% nectar at all time points. I will admit to being impressed with
 elderberry nectar. Further experiments investigating this nectar, as
 well as its components are planned for the future.

     I tried another freezer experiment in my ongoing quest to discover
 a method for implimenting hopefully patentible reversible
 cryopreservation, getting rich, famous, etc. Pycnogenol was added to
 all bottles, since this earlier had been found to be beneficial. 
 Various amounts of polyethylene glycol 200 were added to see if this 
 could further increase survival. I chose a low molecular weight PEG,
 so it would be absorbed from the food into fly tissues.
     Unfortunately adding PEG 200 to fly food results in some extra 
 fluid being released from the food when it is thawed out after
 freezing. If there were any surviving flies, they were all drowned.
     The moral of this story is that experiments testing the 
 effectiveness of cryoprotectants in inhibiting freeze/thaw damage
 are not feasible with the current setup.

>Can you briefly share some of the core elements of the unique

I don't have it with me today but here goes.

One of the things I liked was his approaching the whole issue from
the perspective of biomechanics. He gives an excellent introduction
to the various parts of the skeletal system, muscles and joints and
how they interelate. Simple things, like pointing out that muscles
can't push, they can only contract and use bones as levers. Sounds
simple but it affects the way you think about things. Or the fact
that weights don't actually do anything, it is GRAVITY which only
moves in one direction (towards the center of the earth) so
naturally this is the precise direction the weight should travel
for maximum effectiveness. Simple things like making sure the
exercise is oriented along the length of the fiber, which is the
direction it contracts in.

He argues against the confusion of all the different names for
exercises and proposes an effective nomenclature. It has three
parts, the first being the type of resistance, the second the
muscle being worked, and the third being the activity. For example
a "bench press" becomes either a "barbell chest press, a "dumbell
chest press," or a "smith machine chest press". Simple but very
effective.

In the long section on different exercises he will show several
ways to work each muscle with both free weights and machines. Each
page has a black and white drawing of the body with the muscles
being worked shaded in blue, also  a list of the muscles involved.
Very effective.

I like the way he argues for maximizing effective exercise while
minimizing any chance of injury. 

In short he imparts a great deal of knowledge in a very effective
way.

I own a number of books on the subject and found this one both
unique and a valuble addition. I thought it would be particularly
good for beginners, and yet, it has plenty of information for more
advanced users. I found it very extropian in scope.

Sorry, I haven't been here very long and was just chiming in.  I'm

No, unless the industry is of vital importance to protecting the 
lives (and property rights) of the citizens of the country, like the 
military.


>If... a... "right"... is... unenforceable... is... it... a... natural...
>right?

Unenforceable?  Copyrights aren't unenforceable.  They're difficult 
to enforce, but they aren't "unenforceable".  Have we switched 
subjects here?

Another approach:

You have a societally agreed upon right to live: agreed?

We may discover a deadly poison that takes effect one month after 
skin contact.  Since this is an extropians list: imagine a nanobot 
that would burrow into your skin and then lie dormant for one month. 
After that month, it would release some deadly toxin into your blood 
stream.

Imagine further that we reach a point where creating nanobots is 
something that anyone can do with a reasonably-priced kit.

Just think of how easy it would be to kill someone without anyone 
knowing who did it.  Your right to live would then become an 
"unenforceable" right.  Does that mean that you should no longer have 
it?

Chris Russo

According to http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,40356,00.html
Stephen King has suspended work on his online novel The Plant, which he
had been releasing in installments on a pay as you go basis.  This was
considered a possible model for authors to be rewarded financially in
a world where intellectual property protection is becoming uncertain.

"Originally King said he would keep writing if readers kept paying. By
part four, only 46 percent of the people who downloaded the book paid
for it"

The target percentage was 75%, which is about what the first couple of
chapters pulled in.  Apparently it has been falling since then.

Sounds like we need to go back to the drawing boards to come up with a
new idea to pay for IP.  Anyone who has sat through the annoying pledge
breaks on PBS will know that it's not easy to get people to pay for
something they can get for free.

Gnutella's woes demonstrate that making a scalable, usable peer to
peer file sharing system is not as easy as it looks.  In retrospect it
is amazing that Napster was able to do so well.  Of course the other
systems are handicapping themselves technologically by trying to avoid
the centralized servers that make Napster so vulnerable to legal attacks.
But at this point none of the alternatives appears to have the usability
that made Napster so successful.

Gnutella's real problem is network overload, as their broadcast based
system doesn't scale.  The network is fragmented and transitory, and
the only reason it's stopped getting worse is that people have largely
given up on it.  ("Nobody goes there any more, it's too crowded.")

Freenet is really still alpha quality software, breaking regularly,
with still more incompatible changes planned before the 1.0 release
(hopefully in 2001, but no promises from the core developer (yes,
there's effectively only one developer)).  The system is designed to be
scalable, but there is as yet no search mechanism.  It's much harder to
make searches scale and there is deep dissension about whether and how
searches can be made to work.

Mojo Nation is also early alpha and suffers major reliability problems.
Their economic model doesn't seem to be right for the net: you get paid
for offering server space, but you have to pay to publish content.
In other words, content providers pay, while disk space providers
get paid.  The problem is that disk space is much more available than
content these days, and as a result there is almost nothing to download in
the system.  It's the "free rider problem" to the nth degree.  They are
looking at new design ideas to address this but most of the effort now
is just in getting the basic system to work stably.

All these systems are still in active development, and hopefully the
technical problems can be solved, or at least ameliorated.  It's not clear
how long this will take, though.  As long as Napster continues to operate
there is not a sense of urgency on getting these alternative working.

There are a dozen or more other P2P systems out there that I don't know
anything about.  This fragmentation is itself a problem because these
systems have to reach critical mass to be useful.

Not long ago Max More recommended 8 reps for muscle gain.  I have tried that
suggestion in only my last 2 workouts and have noticed significant
improvement already.  I had always stuck with the 3 sets of 10 routine I
learned in high school football, and just figured that was the best way to
go.  Anyway, thanks for the advice Max.  That was the best fitness advice
I've gotten in years.

Netherlands has now legalized euthanasia, the first nation to do so.  I hope
that this "movement" gains global momentum, particularly here in the US.  If
I get the legal right to commit suicide, then as soon as I suffer an injury
or ailment that might start damaging my memory, I could give a jingle to the
folks at Alcor to come give me the deep freeze treatment before its too
late!

As an aside, I recently ran into the solar satellite fleet power
people again. The new model includes large-aperture solid state phased
array microwave radiating antenna (principle similiar to SAR) directly
integrated into the thin solar cells. It is LEO-based, and tracks
receiving rectenna arrays on the ground. From a critical satellite
density onward, you have a total coverage, one satellite taking over
when one moves out of the direct line of vision. One doesn't need that
much hardware in the skies, surprisingly, and of course this can
greatly profit from linear mass driver launched solar sats fashioned
from lunar material.

Megascale engineering gives you means to dismantle the planets, and

You've pointed to an important service of government. In addition to the
military industry, what about the banking industry? If the government
didn't "prop up" banks by providing police protection, gangs of thugs with
machine guns could take over all the banks. (wait, maybe they already did
that when I wasn't looking -- Bankster.com ?)
I don't think that means banks don't deserve to exist. (They may not
deserve to exist for other reasons, but not particularly because of
government "propping up" their security.) The same argument applies to
practically all industries at least to some degree. Without government
"propping up" Microsoft, bands of well-armed thieves could have taken over
all Bill's campuses long ago.
Anyway, you're not going to keep government from propping up industries.
The primary education industry (public education) would evaporate without
propping up by government. In this case, I might agree that this
particular industry does not deserve to exist.
"Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone!" --Pink Floyd

And don't forget the prison industry. Does it deserve to exist? Probably
not. But government doesn't need to prop up such a lucrative (and sick and
wrong and ugly) industry. The privatization of US incarceration stands to
enslave tens of millions instead of the one million it presently does.
Investors are not difficult to find.
As for Gnutella, I don't think the problem relates to the dearth of
content, but rather with a lack of vision. Someone needs to present an
outline of what the new economy will do to improve the human condition,
not just how it will make money for infrastructure and content providers.

I think it goes beyond implication. People *do* en masse abandon all
decency and history and respect for each other. It happened in Germany (a
very highly civilized country I'm told) and I don't believe the US is
immune to this mass socio-genic illness.

Difference is that it doesn't cost anything to vote. (In Australia it
costs *not* to vote.) If people had to pay directly for government, all
ideas of democracy would instantly change.

That's right. Poor people can't afford the luxury of moralism that rich
folks advertise.
"It's illegal for both the beggar and the billionaire to steal a loaf of
bread" but the fact that a billionaire doesn't steal a loaf of bread
doesn't make him as moral as the beggar who also suppresses the urge to
steal it.

Pure democracy is based on the false premise of equality. The truth is
that we are not all created equal, and even if we were, we sure don't stay
that way.

New Essays:

Scholars intending to present and defend papers at the Enlightenment
Annual Meeting were required to provide several samples of their work,
including one substantial essay and two new critiques of material
available somewhere on the web. I've published several of these
submissions in the last few days and will be continuing to get more
material published over the next week or so. You can find the
announcements on the front page. People interested in attending the
meeting may begin sending application materials immediately; see the web
site for instructions.

The Online Conference is tentatively scheduled for January 20-21.  The
submissions for this conference are being evaluated and published at this
time. Please look for announcements on the front page.

Universals:

Enlightenment's Analytic discussion list has been critiquing chapters 5
and 8 of Carolyn Ray's doctoral dissertation, IDENTITY AND UNIVERSALS.
We have now begun more direct discussion of chapter 3, "Universals" and
will continue with this topic until winter break.

Since some people on Atlantis and OWL have commented on the dissertation,
members of those lists might be interested to know that they and anyone
else are welcome to join the list and observe or actively participate in
this discussion.  Though anyone is welcome to submit posts for
consideration, it is asked that everyone keep in mind that the purpose of
the list is to assist professional philosophers by providing a forum in
which they can receive critiques useful to the development their theories
and written works. The list is strictly moderated by Bryan Register for
content, quality, and relevance, and the standard is generally graduate-
to professional-level. And, as the name of the list implies, we're mostly
doing analytic philosophy there. Most of the active participants
explicitly use the method of objectivity to approach problems and handle
objections.

Posts will all be available in the web archives, but since updating must
be done by hand, they do not appear immediately. They are, however,
public; so people who are not interested in joining the list are free to
read them at something of a delay. 

(Note: I won't be actively participating in discussions of the topic that
have been occurring on the wetheliving lists, as I'm spread a bit thin as
it is and have a prior commitment to Analytic. Don't let that stop you.)

Veatch:

The Veatch discussion has been postponed until after winter break, due to
widespread difficulties in obtaining the out-of-print but
still-copyrighted text. We are currently seeking contributors willing to
write chapter summaries to start the discussion of each chapter of
INTENTIONAL LOGIC; please let list owner Bryan Register know that you are
interested when you subscribe.

The mp3 version of my TOC Summer Seminar 2000 talk, "How To Win
Arguments," which targets the kinds of reasoning errors made by, at, and
among Objectivists, is available for free download. CD's will be burned on
demand and may be purchased for $5.00 US.

If the weather can be directed without capping volcanoes, or otherwise, there
are already large engineering projects, mostly about water management.

Can tethers have a complete orbit?  For example, from an orbit could a
satellite have a cable that reached all the way around the planet back to
itself?  That might be a first stage about putting a structure around the
entire planet.  If a couple cables were in orbit, they could generate
deionizing fields around the planet outside of it's magnetosphere.

There are a lot of ways to speculate about how something on a different scale
could exist.

Another idea, somewhat less ambitious, is to seed the southern oceans
with iron in the hopes of triggering a plankton bloom which will take
up atmospheric CO2 and fix the global warming problem.  Wired had a long
article on one such proposal in the November issue, online at:

I have a stupid question about Joy's article and the title of the debate.
"Why the Future Doesn't Need Us".  What does this mean, exactly?

The future doesn't need us because... we're going to wipe ourselves
out?  That's kind of a weird way to put it.

We wiped out the dodo.  Would we say the future didn't need the dodo,
as a synonym?

A more plausible interpretation is to stick to the AI "threat", and to
say that our machines will become more creative, more intelligent, more
*human* than we are, so they can carry on the legacy of the human race
without biological humans.  In that sense, the future doesn't need us,
because our mind children can do the job without us.

But Joy never actually makes this point.

What do you think the title means?

I realize that we can't expect the tradition-bound U.S. Supreme Court

What will happen when someone walks into that court with the device

a prosthetic vision system that goes far beyond the correction possible

Futurists have predicted more tightly integrated augmented-vision systems.
Eventually we will reach the point where everything anyone sees, hears

What will the Supreme Court do then?

Confiscating pencils to stop people from keeping notes!  How dare they!
My memories, my experiences, are my own, and whether my memories are
stored in neural synapses or scribblings on paper is irrelevant.  It's sad
to see the court clinging to a 19th century model of information when so
many important 21st century issues, from IP protection to crypto rights,
will turn on exactly that issue.

I don't think any of us have a clear idea as to what will become of our

Maybe we'd feel something that felt just like love for the rest of the

I think there are problems with stability in such a structure.

I've read that if you had a *rigid* ring, it could not be in orbit.
One side or the other would tend to drift downwards.  It wouldn't make
any difference if it were rotating or not.  Of course this is only for
an idealized, perfectly rigid ring, and no solid materials could be
particularly rigid at the size scale we are talking about.

For a flexible ring, I think the problem is that if the orbit is slightly
elliptical, as any true orbit will be, the particles of the ring want to
move faster during the lower part of the orbit.  This will compress the
ring in some portions and stretch it elsewhere.  I suspect that this
energy transfer will cause the ring to become deformed and to collapse
into the atmosphere eventually.

You could possibly fix these problems with active elements, little rockets
or perhaps solar mirrors to monitor the position of each ring element
and herd it back into the desired configuration.  But this would add
greatly to the complexity of an already difficult project.  25000 miles
of cable of any practical thickness is going to be a mighty big spool.

Also I'm skeptical of this "deionizing fields" concept, because a cable
moving parallel to it own length won't cut any magnetic field lines and
so won't generate any significant currents.

I think it failed for obvious reasons. The target percentage of 75% is
arbitrary, and rather high. The price was also way too high (1-2$
would have been more like it, and ~100% should have gone to the
original artist), the threshold wasn't as simple as a single
mouseclick.

I still think that Damien B. et al. would be better off with a
voluntary payment scheme. If you like artist's stuff, you don't want
to seem him starve, quite the opposite.

But we will see soon enough how it all will pan out.

Gnutella's woes demonstrate clearly is that if you take a broken
protocol written by an idiot (Napster) and try to make it
peer-to-peer/headless without any modifications it will break horribly
all over the place. Duh. Napster/Gnutella is really, really broken. It
totally ignores prior art addressing these obvious problems, and a
number of projects (I'm really looking forward to run MojoNation) did
so and do it much better.

Otoh, Napster created the user nucleus with usable criticality, and
thus amplified the meme all over the place. Subsequent efforts don't
have to explain themselves, just tap into existing infrastructure with
a (preferably, one-way) gateway, and declare "we're the better
Napster". As soon as the new service reaches criticality as enough
users install the clients, you break the (vulnerable, since traceable)
connecting gateways, and go fully autonomous.

 > is amazing that Napster was able to do so well.  Of course the other

IIRC, Gnutella's problem is that it uses a Napster protocol without
caching indexes (Napster runs over a central server, so it doesn't
have to deal with that query amplification problem). Each query gets
amplified to essentially the entire network. A major fraction of
people are 1) freeloader scum 2) run 56k modems 3) don't use
lightweight query coding, so packets are large.  So each query got
amplified a lot, and eventually clogs the bandwidth of your modem
given a relatively modest size of nodes. Finis, the network fragments
in several subnetworks -- each of them are still operational, however.

An SDSL line gives you an order of magnitude larger bandwidth (and a
much smaller latency) than a 56k modem, and hence would not saturate
so easily. A rewrite, where each node caches the common index of next
few neighbour (few-hop) nodes (resulting into a bit of initial setup
time/initial travel spike before your peer will accept your queries)
would let the whole saturation problem disappear into thin air.

This simple measures (advent of xDSL and a protocol patch) do not
address the other pressing problems, however. Did I already mention
that Napster/Gnutella is b0rken?

Thanks for the mini overview. I think we can agree that the problems
currently plaguing P2P share are not fundamental, and are IMO already
adequately addressed in several existing and forthcoming packages,
albeit probably not all in a single one.

The demand is certainly there, and since steganography and remixing
will make the resulting network both unfilterable and untraceable, we
can probably also agree that you can't stop the emergence of global
P2P neither at technical nor at legal level. The only way to stop it
would be to rip out existing infrastructure, and substitute it with a
lawnik-mandated one, while also inserting multiple probes into user's
orifices. I think it is easy to see that this won't happen.

As soon as the beta code bugs are ironed out, any digitized or
digitazable IP for which there is a demand for in a negligeable
fraction of entire participants will be on the network. I'm not
worried about music or texts (street performer procol & Co), I'm
worried about movies, which are real expensive to make. (But I never
liked Hollywood, anyway. They may all burn in hell for what I'm
concerned).

I think the net result will be a win. But we'll find out soon enough,
anyway.

Looking for Madam Tetrachromat
Do mutant females walk among us?

By Glenn Zorpette
>From the December 04, 2000 issue 

"Oh, everyone knows my color vision is different," chuckles Mrs. M, a
57-year-old English social worker.  "People will think things match,
but I can see they don't." What you wouldn't give to see the world
through her deep blue-gray eyes, if only for five minutes.

Preliminary evidence gathered at Cambridge University in 1993 suggests
that this woman is a tetrachromat, perhaps the most remarkable human
mutant ever identified. Most of us have color vision based on three
channels; a tetrachromat has four.

The theoretical possibility of this secret sorority -- genetics
dictates that tetrachromats would all be female -- has intrigued
scientists since it was broached in 1948. Now two scientists, working
separately, plan to search systematically for tetrachromats to
determine once and for all whether they exist and whether they see
more colors than the rest of us do. The scientists are building on a
raft of recent findings about the biology of color vision.

The breakthroughs come just in time.  "Computers, color monitors, and
the World Wide Web have made having color blindness a much bigger deal
than it ever was before," says Jay Neitz, a molecular biologist who
studies color vision at the Medical College of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee. Color-blind individuals, he explains, often lose their way
while navigating the Web's thicket of color cues and
codes. "Color-blind people complain miserably about the Web because
they can't get the color code," Dr. Neitz says. (Just try surfing on a
monochrome monitor.)

Most people are trichromats, with retinas having three kinds of color
sensors, called cone photopigments -- those for red, green, and
blue. The 8 percent of men who are color-blind typically have the cone
photopigment for blue but are either missing one of the other colors,
or the men have them, in effect, for two very slightly different reds
or greens. A tetrachromat would have a fourth cone photopigment, for a
color between red and green.

Besides the philosophical interest in learning something new about
perception, the brain, and the evolution of our species, finding a
tetrachromat would also offer a practical reward. It would prove that
the human nervous system can adapt to new capabilities.  Flexibility
matters greatly in a number of scenarios envisaged for gene therapy.
For example, if someone with four kinds of color photopigments cannot
see more colors than others, it would imply that the human nervous
system cannot easily take advantage of genetic interventions.

For years now, scientists have known that some fraction of women have
four different cone photopigments in their retinas. The question still
remains, however, whether any of these females have the neural
circuitry that enables them to enjoy a different -- surely richer --
visual experience than the common run of humanity sees. "If we could
identify these tetrachromats, it would speak directly to the ability
of the brain to organize itself to take advantage of novel stimuli,"
says Dr. Neitz. "It would make us a lot more optimistic about doing a
gene therapy for color blindness."

There have been very few attempts to find Madam Tetrachromat. The one
that turned up Mrs. M in England, in 1993, was led by Gabriele Jordan,
then at Cambridge University and now at the University of
Newcastle. She tested the color perception of 14 women who each had at
least one son with a specific type of color blindness. She looked at
those women because genetics implies that the mothers of color-blind
boys may have genetic peculiarities of their own.  Among that somewhat
peculiar group of women, one could expect to find the odd
tetrachromat.

It's almost as if the supersense these women enjoy comes at the
expense of the men in their families. "I'm just sorry I've robbed my
son of one of his color waves," Mrs. M says.

Dr. Jordan reports that of the fourteen test subjects in her study,
two showed "exactly" the behavior that would be expected of
tetrachromats. "It was very strong evidence for tetrachromacy," she
adds. The apparent tetrachromats were Mrs. M, who was identified in
the study as cDA1, and another candidate, cDA7.

Dr. Jordan set up an experiment in which subjects tried to determine
whether a pair of colored lights matched. They used joysticks to blend
two different wavelengths as they pleased. The resulting hues lay
outside the spectrum of the blue photoreceptor, rendering it nearly
useless, so that normal trichromats would have the use of only their
red and green photoreceptors. Having hit upon a color, the subjects
would then try to reproduce it by mixing two other wavelengths.
Because the tetrachromats had the use of only two receptors, they
found a whole slew of mixes that produced a matching color.

However, any tetrachromat should have been able to use three receptors
in this color space, and therefore make a single, precise match. In
the experiment, cDA1 and cDA7 performed pretty much as a tetrachromat
would be expected to.

Nevertheless, Dr. Jordan declines to say that she has finally found a
tetrachromat, partly because her testing is still a work in
progress. The vast majority of us have no idea what tetrachromacy
would be like. Anyone who had the supersense wouldn't know she did,
let alone be able to describe it.  After all, it is an exercise in
futility for trichromats to try to explain their visual experience to
color-blind people.

Dr. Neitz and Dr. Jordan each plan a more definitive search for
tetrachromats. Dr. Neitz plans to take advantage of the fuller
understanding of the underlying genetics of color vision.  His will be
the first experiment that will use genetic techniques to identify
women with four different color photopigments.

What will he be looking for? Let's start with the basics. The genes
for the red and green photopigments are adjacent to each other on the
X chromosome; strangely, blue is way off by itself on another
chromosome. Women, of course, have two X chromosomes and therefore two
sets of red and green photopigment genes. Men have only one X, so they
have just one shot at getting the red and green photopigment genes
right.

Unfortunately for men, it turns out that those genes are prone to a
kind of mutation that occurs when eggs are formed in a female
embryo. When the eggs are created, the X chromosomes from the maternal
grandmother and grandfather mix with each other in random places to
make the egg's brand-new X chromosome. Because the genes for the red
and green photopigments are right next to each other, those genes
sometimes mix.  That's perfectly normal. But every once in a while,
the mixing occurs in a lopsided way, and the result, 30 years later,
could very well be a man who has to check with his wife every time he
dresses.

A lopsided mix can have three outcomes: (1) the egg in the embryo has
an X chromosome that's missing either a red or a green photopigment
gene, (2) the X chromosome has two slightly different red photopigment
genes, or (3) the X chromosome has two slightly different green
photopigment genes. In any of these cases, if that egg gets fertilized
and becomes a male, the man will get that X chromosome and be
color-blind.

Here it gets interesting. Suppose a woman inherits one X chromosome
with two slightly different green photopigment genes. And let's say
her other X chromosome has the normal complement of red and green
photopigment genes. Because of a well-known biological phenomenon
called X inactivation -- which causes some cells to rely on one X
chromosome and others to rely on the other -- that woman's retinas
would have four different types of photopigments: blue, red, green,
and the slightly shifted green.  (It would also be possible, through a
different genetic sequence, to produce blue, green, red, and a shifted
red.) X inactivation is only possible in women, so there has never
been, and probably never will be, a male tetrachromat.

True tetrachromacy would require a few other characteristics in
addition to retinas with four different photopigment receptors. For
instance, there would have to be four neural channels to convey to the
brain the sensory inputs from the four receptors, and the brain's
visual cortex would have to be able to handle this four-channel
system. If a woman were born with four types of photopigments, would
her brain wire itself to take advantage of them? No one knows for
sure, but some experts strongly suspect it would. "Yes, definitely,"
says Jeremy Nathans, a pioneer in color-vision research at Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine. One reason to think so is the
brain's great plasticity in other respects.  People with special
skills -- musicians, bilinguals, deaf people who learn sign language
-- often show characteristic brain patterns.

Dr. Nathans also believes, however, that for full-blown tetrachromacy,
the fourth photopigment must not have a peak in sensitivity that is
too close to the peaks of either the red or the green
photopigments. That's the rub, as far as he's concerned -- he suspects
that most female tetrachromats would have only mildly superior color
vision, because the genetics indicates that the fourth photopigment
would almost always be very close to either the red or the green.
Every now and then, however, an oddball photopigment might appear,
well separated from both red and green.  "The genetics do not rule it
out," Dr.  Nathans explains. "It would be a rare event. But who's to
say it hasn't happened? There are a lot of people out there."

That idea finds support in the recent discoveries about the genetics
of color vision, many made by Dr. Neitz's group.  Those findings have
shown that the genetics underlying color vision are surprisingly
variable, even within the narrow range regarded as normal. "The
variety in photopigment genes in people with normal color vision is
enormous," Dr. Neitz reports. "It's enormous."

Would there be any practical advantages to tetrachromacy? Dr. Jordan
notes that a mother could more easily spot when her children were pale
or flushed, and therefore ill. Mrs. M reports that she has always been
able to match even subtle colors from memory -- buying a bag, for
example, to match shoes she hasn't laid eyes on for months. And
computers, color monitors, and the Internet raise a whole raft of
possibilities. Just as someone with normal three-color vision surfs
rings around a dichromat on the Internet, a tetrachromat, looking at a
special computer screen based on four primary colors rather than the
standard three, could theoretically dump data into her head faster
than the rest of us.

If Dr. Neitz or Dr. Jordan finally finds Madam Tetrachromat, the
discovery will confirm that the human nervous system can handle
four-channel color vision. And that confirmation would raise the
possibility that, within a couple of decades, gene therapy will make
tetrachromacy just another option that wealthy parents could check off
on the list when they are designing their daughters.

It won't be possible with male children -- not for quite some time,
anyway. So as long as we're on this flight of fancy, let's take one
more short hop: a few decades from now, men and women will still be
seeing the world differently. But the expression might not be merely
figurative any more.

Gah. Let's see who'll be affected. We're talking about digital or
digitizable content, preferably low-threshold digitizable
content. We're talking software, music, video, books. 

Software. I don't care about this too much: I already use OpenSource
software. In fact I think the world could use more OpenSource
software, not less of it. Revenues of OpenSource software developers
can come from support, and in fact they currently do. Look up Ars
Digita and Zope. Revenues of closed source software developers can
come (hardware tokens and crypto-authentication, watermark and
"phone-home"-assisted) licensing and subscription model. I don't see
software people hurt in the slightest.

Music. p2p share plus low-threshold small-grain payments will
noticeably *increase* the total revenues effectively reaching content
producers, and shift the distribution from few biggies (who will have
to skip the occasional Ferrari) to less known musicians. Oh my god,
this will actually increase diversity, on the costs of Britney Spears
& Co. How very horrible.  Most of the cash flow comes from current
music pieces, you can as well download the latest opus for a cyberbuck
from the artist's site directly, instead of napstering the same stuff
from the network (notice that most stuff on Napster is of inferior
quality, and that the CD sales are *up*, not down, as a result of free
advertisement via word of mouth) -- paying in the process, as the
payment model a la MojoNation is clearly the way to go. A large
fraction of distributors and marketers will need to learn a new
trade. You can believe that my heart is bleeding for them.

Video, this might make production of very expensive movies
impossible. An alternative fully authenticated reproduction
infrastructure may be deployed (decryption of movie within the
unique-key display), provided the user base will accept the subsequent
loss of privacy. A considerable fraction of users will not. Movie
industry might see an impact, but this is really difficult to
predict. I have to admit I'm not caring overmuch either.

Books: see music. Provided, we're talking about already digitized
books. Putting paperbacks into a scanner is a chore. I will certainly
do that to my rarer/out of print volumes, because I expect others to
do the same. I would really like to hear what Damien Broderick has to
say about this. He'll be directly affected, after all.

I have probably overlooked something, as this post is a reflexive
jerk. Doubtlessly, other people will chime in, and mention stuff I've
overlooked.

Turn industry into charitable organization? What the fsck are you
talking about?

Devaluation of work? An artist wants to produce content which will
reach the maximum appreciative audience, or so I've thought. It is
prestige, though you sure don't want to have to be distracted by
realities of life. I don't think Stephen King will notice much if he's
to lose 80% of his revenues, unless he's collecting aircraft or
yachts, or small islands in the Caribean. (Personally I think King
sometimes writes with the power of a gold bullet plowing through your
brains, and deserves to be paid (directly. without paying the
lumberjacks, and the paper pulp, and the printers and the marketing
weasels and the rest of the merry bloodsucker crew), but that's just
me).

So, if your stuff is really widely valued, these single cyberbucks do
add up. And now and then there's an occasional windfall from a
maecene. (You're rich, you like the stuff, you want to see more of it
in future, so what do you do? Fork over the cash, of course). If your
stuff is not widely read, you can't expect to be able to live from the
revenue. However, because of the lower threshold of accessibility, you
can be sure that your content will find the widest possible
audience. Some of which *will* pay slip you the occasional
cyberbuck. Which *will* increase your total revenue (by giving you a
cash trickle instead of having to publish and distribute your stuff on
your own budget -- this can become real expensive if your audience is
negligeable).

I wonder what makes you say that. Remember, we're talking only about
digital content, not physical objects. Digital content which is craved
by a considerable fraction of online users, and which has a high cost
of production. Right off the cuff I can only think of movies. Please
show up the logics of your analysis, because your results are far from
being obvious. Mildly put.

So in your view, for an entity to have perfect self-knowledge requires
it to be able to answer any question about its future behavior, even a
question which would require infinite computing power to answer?

I don't think this is a reasonable requirement.  We wouldn't expect
an entity to be able to answer questions on other topics which require
infinite computations, would we?  I don't see why you view this as an
imperfection.  An entity could have perfect knowledge of the rules of
the Game of Life, say, without being able to predict whether an arbitrary
pattern will stabilize or not.

Maybe it's just semantics, and for you, perfect knowledge means
omega-point levels of omniscience?

To me, the interesting question is whether an entity can have perfect
self-knowledge in the sense that it has an accurate and complete model
of its own mind.  It can answer any question about the present state of
its own mind accurately (modulo trickery along the lines of "John Clark
cannot consistently assert this sentence," which shed little light on
the fundamental questions IMO).  We don't have perfect (or probably even
good) knowledge of ourselves in this sense.  Will future intelligences
be similarly restricted?  I don't see why they should.

Huh? Will people who produce digital content for a living will be
forced to go flipping burgers as a result of advent of p2p share
networks, resulting in less quantity and quality of said content? I
don't think so. Will some of the distributor mafia? I sure hope so.

Hi!

I'm reading the new book by Poul Anderson right now. I'm almost at the
middle of this book and so far I'm very amazed by it's story.

Has anyone already read this book? What's your opinion?

Thanks for your input.

Although not a chemist, I'd have to answer "no" -- there are not any.
Organic chemistry is even more tenuous, of course. When transitional
humans leave biology behind, they will (naturally) leave behind biological
imperatives which prompt marriage.
Without biology, marriage looks rather ridiculous.

That's why there would be two.  If one is in orbit and the the other one floats
over and beneath the poles, I thought that would have to do with field.  If a
field could be established, then it could deionize incoming solar mass, for
example. So one equatorial and the other polar.  If that worked, you could make
more.

If there are ways to store and reuse kinetic energy, then torsion could be
smoothed out of the flexible orbital ring.  Maybe it could be magnetically
connected at joints.

Maybe it is better to try it on other planets and planetoids, extraterrestrial
construction.

Oh? What about Morganatic marriages and corporate mergers?

I could see fidelity and polyfidelity extending as far foreseeable as
marriages in the US today, and perhaps farther. Gentleman adventurer
contracts, clans, line marriages, you name it.

I don't expect *divorce* will go out of style.

As the Chinese historians said when asked what they thought of the
American War of Independence: Too soon to tell.

I'm pleased to annunce the final schedule of this meeting, entitled "Europe:
the last Leviathan". I think it could be interesting for both all round
eurosceptics and pure libertarians.
The conference will be both in Italian and English, with headphones'

You may not have to wait for genetic engineering and to be (re)born a
woman in order to benefit from extra-channel color perception.  I wrote a
few months ago about a patent by cypherpunk Raph Levien which accomplishes
much the same thing using special glasses.  Here is the description,
from http://www.delphion.com/details?&pn=US05218386__:

        The present invention is directed towards a method
    and apparatus for permitting human perception of more of the
    spectrophotometric values which define the color of an observed
    object. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention,
    a first optical filter is provided having a spectral response
    curve that selectively admits portions of three bands of light,
    corresponding to red, green, and blue. The optical filter would be
    worn over one eye (say, the left eye). The right eye would observe
    color through a similar optical filter, but with different portions
    of the three bands admitted.

        The two eyes perceive two different shifts in
    the color of an object relative to the perception of the color of the
    object by the unaided eye. These shifts are dependent on properties
    of the spectrophotometric color of the object which are not visible
    to the unaided eye. Therefore, the eye is capable of an expanded
    perception of color compared to the unaided eye, because each eye
    sees different colors of the same scene.  This expanded perception
    is analogous to the added dimension of depth perception because each
    eye sees perspectives of the same scene.

It would take some time to get used to your two eyes seeing different
colors, but perhaps it would eventually become unconscious.  There were
famous experiments back in the 60s in which people wore special glasses
that turned the visual image upside down!  After a few days they got used
to it and everything looked normal.  Then when they took the glasses off
they had to adjust again.  If people can adapt to such a radical change
as this, then incorporating some extra color information ought to be easy.

I agree with J.R.Molloy.
Without biology, marriage looks quite ridiculous.
And with the new discoveries in genetics, evolutionary psychology, our
"Adapted Mind" (great book) and us being "Moral animals" (good one too),
even less.

That doesn't seem likely to me, because the divorce rate seems to parallel
the rate of technological advance.

I'll drink to that! Sounds like a cyborg orgy ("borgy"?). Instead of
proposing marriage, partners could invite each other to borgy together, to
commune beyond biology.

Even more esoteric is the question: What would it feel like to be a
*married* posthuman.

Blessed if you know. Personally, I speculate that I'd rather borganize
than marry. (But hey! nobody has asked me -- yet.)

(There's nothing hopeless about romance. Romance is all about hope.)

Michael M. Butler wrote,

I don't know about Morganatic marriages... whazzat? As for corporations,
remember that they can't own real estate (according to California RE law)
as joint tenants, because corporations never die (so they can't assign
property to surviving spouses). Perhaps borgs will come under the same
laws as corporations. Maybe Greg Burch has considered this. In any event,
corporate law now differs dramatically from divorce/marriage law. I
suppose marriage will go the way of chivalry and knights in shining
armor -- or perhaps it will go the way of phlogiston and vitalism. <g>

No, but which function shall we attach love to, if we don't need it

The difficulty with the energy in the oceans is that it is an energy
bank. It is the earth's (and its ecologies) starting capital, its
principal. Extracting more than is put in (minus that which comes out as
a result of natural processes) is like eating your seed corn: a really
really really dumb idea (if most of us intend to live here in this
current environment for more than a few centuries). The only real margin
we have to work with is that extra which is being retained as a result
of climatological change trends (no matter whether they are caused by
CO2 pollution or Malenkovick Cycles is irrelevant to this). This energy
comes from the sun and from deep geological processes. If you can't get
sufficient energy from solar power, then there isn't enough input to the
oceanic energy bank to compensate any withdrawals.

that is the beauty of all of these entity-types; they are transient,
mirrored, and interchangeable.  they are all using the same energy
system.  and perhaps the same energy doctrine.

Ah, this is a star with an evolving 'proto-planetary' dust disk that has
a detectable warp to it (at least in simulations I've seen).

Mutual defense, willing intimacy, shared endeavors, fostering new lives.
Those are just off the top of my head.

I hope a love like that exists, but I admit to moderate skepticism--
billions and billions of years?  Can we really expect our core architecture
to support that particular type of bonding over that period of time?

Arguments are many and various. There has been significant contention
about whether the sixteenth amendment was ever properly ratified.
Something to do with the number of states that ratified it in a given
time period versus the number of states in the Union at the time the
last state that ratified it in the specified time period did so. As
states are added to the union, the number required for ratification of
any outstanding amendments goes up. If it was not properly ratified,
then we fall back to the consitutional principle that the federal
government can only impose indirect taxes, while only the states can
impose direct taxes like income taxes.

Another item of debate is what the true definiton of 'income' is (or
what it was at the time this amendment was written) versus what the
government bureaucrats would like it to be. They ARE notorious for
redefining things to suit their goals. There are arguments that 'income'
as specified at the time of the 16th amendment only applies to revenue
from things like bonds, stock dividends, pensions, and other securities
related income. Direct remuneration for labor by individuals is
supposedly not considered 'income' under these legal theories.

Also a matter of debate (which does not violate the amendment if it is
in fact properly ratified) are actual loopholes in the law (as is
asserted by the referenced story) that exempt large numbers of people
and businesses from paying any income taxes. If that is indeed what the
law says (as dictated by congress, as the 16th amendment requires) then
those people do not, in fact, have to pay the tax if it does not apply
to them under congressionally passed tax law (which congress can change
as it sees fit, but the IRS cannot by itself).

There are arguments that the IRS tax code itself states that income tax
is voluntary for most people. Where they get you is that most all
government programs that involve some sort of payment of money or
services to individuals from the government involve a contract clause
where the individual agrees to comply with the section of the tax code
that specifies them volunteering to pay income tax. Even having a bank
account at a federally insured financial institution 'volunteers' you
for the income tax (because that federal deposit insurance makes you a
federal beneficiary), and it is in your account agreement.

I happen to know an author here in New Hampshire who has not paid income
taxes for 20 years, and belongs to a Tax Patriot protest group.
Membership fees entitle you to fully paid representation AND
compensation for all confiscated property in the event that a member is
successfully prosecuted by the IRS. They have somthing like 50,000
members, and claim zero successfull prosecutions by the IRS.

Sorry Eugene, can't afford to get drawn into this debate again.  I've
written reams of relatively cogent material on the subject on this very list
and would be simply regurgitating those ideas-- I invite you to skim the
archives if interested.

A brief recap:

1. EVERYthing will be IP eventually
2. Mr. John S. Novak said it well:  "[IP] defines and protects a mechanism
by which two or more
parties can VOLUNTARILY exchange services for MUTUAL gain."
2. We should be making our information smarter-- have it follow rules,
contain meta-information (as per the gene) as opposed to being dumb,
anonymously replicating information (as per cancer.)


In the meantime, I'm pleased to accept my licks for my apparently
unsubstantiated comments regarding the devaluation of IP made heretofore.

<Eugene.Leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de>

	Thanks for reporting this fascinating information!!  I've
never heard of this possibility before.

	There is a huge categorical difference between having
additional colors in our color awareness and simply inverting an
otherwise subjectively similar image and it eventually seeming
normal.  The article touched on this a bit by pointing out that simply
having an extra 4th receptor in the eye isn't enough for us to be
aware of an additional color.  You must also have an additional
channel in the optic nerve to convey the added information to the part
of our brain where the awareness is produced (the visual cortex) and
of course the most important part of all is, one's conscious knowledge
must be enhanced to be able to produce additional quale to represent
this 4th color dimension in order to be what I would consider a full
blown subjective "tetrachromate".

	I'd bet that, given what little was in this article, It is
likely that Mrs M is simply mapping the set of trichromatic color
qualia produced by most of our visual cortexes in our consciousness a
little more broadly over the tetrachromic set of information, hence
still enabling her to distinguish differences in perception better
than a trichromat, yet not really experiencing a truly subjective
tetrachromatic experience or in other words Mrs M can't really
experience any additional subjective color qualia.

	Or can she!?  To me that would be by far the more interresting
question in all this.  Who cares what one can perceive compared to
what it is really subjectively like!?  As in, will I ever be able to
say: "Oh wow, that gred (or whatever) color is fantastic and nothing
like I've ever experienced", thanks for enhancing my primary visual
cortex so it can produce this new quale in my subjective awareness!
Now can you make me a tetrachromat and wire the additional sensors
added to my eyes, through an addition chanel added to my optic nerve,
to this new quale my visual cortex can now produce in my consciousness
so I can be a subjectively full blown tetrachromat!?

	And are there more than just 3 (or 4) dimensions to the qualia
possible in this physical universe so that our visual cortex can use
such enhanced awareness to be aware of data from receptors that can
pick up additional information not just between red and green, but
from outside the visible spectrum altogether!?  I don't just want to
reuse the qualia I've got and map the additional spectrum my sensors
can pick up into this! I want more qualia too!  If so, you'd be able
to do a lot more than just zip through the internet faster!!!

If use licenses cannot be enforced in the courts, and if the population
stops respecting them, then all of contract law (and rule of law in
general) is in danger. Rights are only unenforceable when enough people
choose to stop respecting them. That does not mean they are not natural
rights. Did the holocaust make the right to live no longer a natural
right?

Actually asexual reproduction is for lower lifeforms, human
reproduction is a fusion of two lifeforms that while just similiar
enough are also very different.

Human reproduction is also a fusion of spirit, which for the sake
of discussion we can define as a Meta-process of sentient entities.

Even now humans often reproduce without love.

Love is not limited to reproduction.

Love's only purpose is to serve itself.

Now we're entering the domain of poets.....

Actually with the exception of the Friday edition of Investors
Business Daily I don't. Chicago "newspapers" are little more than
tabloids in my eyes.

I don't mind paying for things I want, I do mind paying for things
I don't want.

If the networks can run commercials to pay for programming that's
fine. If PBS can't make the same obviously effective model work
than there's something wrong.

I'm not out to support their bad economic model.

The same could be said about slavery and freedom, to paraphrase
Clausewitz, "Slavery is the natural state of humanity. Freedom is a
theoretical ideal whose existence we deduce from the fact that there are
occasional intervals in human history within specific classes of some
societies where individuals are not enslaved."

Rather, what I think the current state of marriage in our society
indicates is only that the currently accepted legal forms of marriage
are insufficient for the needs of society.

Hi All,

I've noticed that among the people who post frequently on this list, the
majority are involved in computer science and nanotec pursuits, as
opposed to media and other fields. While we have achieved a good deal of
positive press (Wired, Slashdot, etc.) in the past couple years, I think
it's time that we organized some more effective
method of popularizing Extropinistic attitudes and ideas. In short, an
Extropian Meme Machine. 

In order to get more minds aware and active in Extropianstic ideas and
pursuits. Many organizations with fewer members and less valuable purposes
have very effective PR machines (just think, the extreme christians). Have
we thought about utilizing more modern forms of PR such as press releases,
publicity stunts, gurilla media, viral marketing, sending experts to
media oragnizations arround issues in the news, etc., etc.

As a media-worker (at least in part), I would be able to add some
suggestions, strategies, and perhaps some additional resources (mailing
lists, etc) should the right opportunity arise.

Any effective ideas?

- Eric

+ \\No, but which function shall we attach love to, if we don't need it
+ \\for reproduction anymore?
+ \\

'love' is integrated to the entire interactive system, in varying
amounts.  love has utility in production, association of all types. 
however, it is most intense near the reproductive cortex (if we were
to diagram all cortices..and because it should be {to ensure
survival}).  it is also present in homosexual, intergenerational, and
abstract societal conditions (loving specific societal patterns, etc);
so what does that mean? is one system failing to update another?  or
is the secondary utility in place?  i argue 4 latter.

Ok, I've come up with a very useful, money making use for quantum
entanglement and wormhole technology here on earth in the here and now:
instant mail ordering. Lets say I am leaving on a trip, and I want that
pair of LL Bean docksiders for this trip, TODAY, or maybe I'm on a trip,
and I wanted them before I left. I call up an LL Bean operator, and
place my order and say I want to receive it today (or maybe last week
some time). The order goes through the Wormhole Area Network Loop to
return to the server two weeks ago. The order gets processed in that
batch then, giving plenty of time for the LL Bean to ship by the slowest
method (thus saving the most money on shipping) and still getting you
your product today, or else before you left on your trip. The only
difficulty I see is dealing with the looping perceptions if you receive
the product before you order it. People will get products before they
order them, refuse to accept the shipment, then bitch when they need
them, order the product, only to have the operator say,"We sent you
those shoes last week but you refused the shipment, though you still owe
us for shipping. We're putting it on your quantum credit card, so you've
already paid, thanks. Have a nice day!"

Color receptors are not really dimensions, they are simply separate
ranges in the visual spectrum, and only overlap a bit. Likewise, deer
have only two color receptors, so they see the world as a matter of
blue, yellow, and shades of grey in between (which is why they don't see
blaze orange)

Love = The desire for higher organization and higher complexity

Love, whether it is directed towards another person, towards an art form,
towards a study, towards one's self, or towards the universe, is what drives
entities to create- in essence, love is a very extropian principle.  Even if
marriage is a dying institution, love isn't leaving- love will continue to
drive humanity and the cosmos onward to it's final destination, wherever
that may be.

 > Now we're entering the domain of poets.....

And what a sweet domain it is.

"We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight." -Aleister Crowley, "On

The central question here is: will people retain love? I think rather
few of us would deliberately remove such feelings from ourselves, even
if they have their basis in "primitive" evolutionary reasons. We still
turn even the basic need for food into complex cultural events with
high symbolic and social significance ("dinner"), and I doubt a
posthuman would make itself unable to enjoy a meal even if it was
powered in other ways. Radical technology doesn't seem to imply that
we *remove* much of our current selves, but that we extend them in new
ways, redefining and refining the.

As for that the social forms these basic feelings take, that is
another matter. Marriage is just one possibility. I have faith in
(post)human creativity to come up with many more.

[this post seems to have vanished into the void, or at any rate it never
came back to my @ via the extropian list; I figured I should re-post it,
since there seem to be glitches in the list at the moment. It was written
by a guest at my house:]

=================

In my quest for the Perfect Place to Live I now find myself enjoying the
clear spring air, graceful architecture, and abundant parklands of
Melbourne, Victoria. Damien has been showing me around the area, has
introduced me to some of the more interesting people here. It's been highly
entertaining to listen to the reactions of the people here to American
politics, especially at this particular moment.

I've maybe been corrupting Damien--we went dumpster-diving yesterday, found
a lovely bicycle which I will be using for future sight seeing expeditions.

Just one comment that I must make when I see Open Source Ubiquity 
proponents claiming that loss of IP is no big deal:

>Software.

[...]

>I don't see
>software people hurt in the slightest.

It'd be nice to consider those with "non-geek" interests in making 
such a sweeping generalization.  My mom, for instance, likes to do 
quilting and has some little program she bought for it.

Exactly which geeks are going to scratch their itch to make quilting 
software if they can't make some money off providing the authoring 
service?

We've had this massive move toward everyone finding a reason to get a 
computer and use it in many facets of their lives.  That's a good 
thing.

The destruction of IP rights will act to oppose the development of 
non-geek uses of computers.  That's a bad thing.

I like open source software.  I contribute to it where I can both 
with coding and with donations.  It's not the answer to everything, 
though, and thinking that we should completely eliminate the classic 
commercial software model is destructive to the overall greater good 
of making computers used and useful for both the geeks and the moms.

Chris Russo

I imagine people will still go to the cinema, which would be
rather easy to regulate.  And then there's merchandising.
So you're really only talking about the loss of video sales.
Even then you can add interactive elements, stream the
content, and the resulting non-linearity should make capture
more difficult.  (This is why software is safe: if you
stream software, which you should, it's almost impossible to
capture.  This is obvious to see in videogames, where you
can stream in geometry, textures, etc, according to game
state.  Trying to grab all the data is not an easy task and
can be made much more difficult, perhaps impossible, by
design.)  I also think that if the payment scheme is simple
enough the majority of people are going to download from the
official site rather than use P2P software, especially if
the publishers realise that the experience of the movie (or
book, or song) begins before the purchase.  (And if movie,
music, and book publishers start offering small fees for
referrals you can also expect official, paying links to be
as prevalent as banner ads for porn.)

The PBS you describe seems to be following the model of magazines and
newspapers everywhere, while only online news/mags seem to follow the tv
broadcast model, and scholarly journals typically only follow the
subscription only model. The old PBS model only works so long as enough
people with money are bamboozled into beleiving in the superior quality
of programming on PBS, and don't mind paying other people's way
(typically under the elitist meme that they are helping to 'enlighten'
people), which is why PBS tends to be dominated by left wing liberals.

Like others, this post of mine never came through, so probably was 
dropped.  My apologies if it comes through again later.

Protecting banks (and others) from gangs of thugs is a "property 
right" issue, and explicitly falls within the argument that I wrote 
above.

Generally, I take a minimalist, mostly-Libertarian view of what 
should and shouldn't be propped up by our Government.  Public 
education, as you imply is arguable. :)  It certainly could use a 
good swift kick in the ass.

>Investors are not difficult to find.

We could drastically reduce our prison population by removing the 
laws we have against victimless crimes (prostitution, casual drug 
use, etc.)

After that, once again, prison maintenance is fundamentally an issue 
of property protection - so does fall under the job of the 
government.  Now, whether or not private industry can be allowed to 
help out where it makes sense is a much deeper argument than I'm 
prepared to have.  I'd imagine that you'd need to have a lot of 
oversight to prevent abuses.  Whether or not the oversight costs more 
than having the government maintaining the things outright would have 
to be estimated or demonstrated.


>As for Gnutella,

Oh yeah, we're talking about Gnutella. :)  I forgot all about those guys.


>  I don't think the problem relates to the dearth of

I never did say anything about the dearth of content.  Actually, my 
original statement merely expressed disdain for those building a 
system designed to circumvent the rights of copyright holders. 
Ironically, the system is failing because people are selfishly taking 
from the system but not contributing to its resources.

It's always a damned shame when greediness of non-contributors 
destroys a system designed to help a bunch of greedy non-contributors.

Well, if swapping Bittany Spears MP3's doesn't improve the human 
condition, I just don't reckon I know what does.

I agree with your sentiment, but I also like to assume that there's a 
reason for such a strange-sounding rule.

Maybe there's limited seating for the press, and the press has tried 
to get around it by taking up seats kept available for the general 
public or interested parties.  The no-pencil rule could actually be a 
means of ensuring that the general public has equal physical access 
to the Supreme Court.

Just a thought,

Chris Russo

I just checked my constantly-updated royalty statement at Fictionwise.com
(information you'd never see from an orthodox dead-tree publisher, btw),
where I currently have two items available for paid download. The cheaper
and very much shorter of the two, to my surprise, had received fewer
purchases. The longer one, `The Game of Stars and Souls' (or is it `The
Game of  Souls and Stars'?), has earned back about half my [fairly modest]
advance already. 

What does interest me, from a technical/marketing point of view, is how few
purchasers have troubled to click their rating of either story after they
read it. The posted histograms at

http://www.fictionwise.com/servlet/mwserve?action=view&template=author.htm&a
uthorid=25

show far fewer voters than purchasers. Maybe I'm fortunate that all those
who detested my work and ardently wished their money refunded (bad luck)
haven't hit the `Sheesh, it *stinks*' button...

According to "Emotional Intelligence", there exists eight emotional areas
in the human brain. One of areas express the feeling of "agape", which is
one of the meanings of the fuzzy word "love".

Subject: Vegetables from outer space to land on China's markets

  	  				 
   SHANGHAI, Nov 30 (AFP) - Vegetables grown from seeds sent into  
orbit will soon land in Chinese markets with consumers expected to 
bite, the Shanghai Daily reported Thursday. 
   "These green peppers are more tender in taste and their size  
huge. As long as the price is not to steep, I will definitely buy 
them," said Zhao Ming, a farmer who tried a prototype of the new 
product. 
   Peppers and tomato seeds were spun in orbit around the earth for  
15 days and bombarded with a wide range of cosmic rays which 
produced mutations in the seed's genes, the paper said. 
   After the satellite returned to earth, researchers planted 400  
seeds to see whether the mutations were beneficial -- some were, 
others were not, the paper reported. 
   The first generation of space peppers had a misshapen appearance  
but after breeding the space seed with a local variety, researchers 
produced a pepper with more nutrients, trace elements, vitamin C and 
dissolvable sugars than ordinary varieties, the report added. 
   The peppers bred by the Jiading Agrotechnical Centre, an  
institute responsible for crop research are expected to receive 
sales certification from Shanghai's Science and Technology 
Commission before the end of the year. 
   "People don't have to worry about eating space food," said Pang  
Yingjie, president of Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences. 
   "Unlike other genetically modified food, space food changes its  
own characteristics on its own rather than through operations by 
biologists," he added.

Out there in the real world, I've heard some pesky rumors.  There
are people who claim that some printed books actually don't sell
very well.  Even worse, I've seen people state flat out that they
didn't bother to finish reading a book, despite them already having
paid the full price for the whole thing.  Clearly this implies that
selling books is not a viable proposition.

Look folks, I have no idea why _The Plant_ failed, but so far I
haven't seen anybody even mention the simple idea that readers just
didn't like it.

(Personally, I've read only a single King book--_The Stand_, long
version--and I have no interest in reading another one.)

Maybe I sent this previously, apologies if so. It's the review I wrote for
The New York Review of Science Fiction, which was published in slightly
different form:

========================

*Genesis* by Poul Anderson 
New York: Tor Books, 2000; $23.95 hc; 256 pages

reviewed by Damien Broderick

Stanislaw Lem, the great Polish polymath and sf writer/critic, published
*Fantastyka i Futurologia* in Cracow in 1970. It included a long discussion
of Olaf Stapledon's magisterial 1930 novel *Last and First Men* and its
even grander sequel *Star Maker (1937)*.[note 1] Lem critiques several
aspects of Stapledon's two billion year future history, noting almost in
passing that its repeated total regressions in technological progress are
implausible, constructed only for the literary motive that taking into
account genuinely expectable change would have made it impossible to write
the novel.  

Vernor Vinge would independently rediscover what he would term the
Singularity more than a decade later (in his *Marooned in Real-Time*,
1986).[note 2] Lem wrote:

[start indented block]

But let us keep in mind that another vision, in which the species'
cataclysmic degeneration is not so profound - in other words, in which
there would be some continuity in the current of civilizational
transformations - would have made it impossible to write the book. For the
ascent that follows exponentially from this premise would surpass the
capacities of any artist's imagination. This means that even if the fate of
humanity is not at all tragic, we are incapable of plausibly foreseeing -
in the very distant future - different qualities of being, other than the
tragic... But the existence of future generations totally transformed from
ours would remain an incomprehensible puzzle for us, even if we could
express it.

It is a law of civilizational dynamics that instrumental phenomena grow at
an exponential rate. Stapledon's vision owes its particular form and
evenness to the fact that its author ignores this law... Technological
development is an independent variable primarily because its pace is a
correlative of the amount of information already acquired, and the
phenomenon of exponential growth issues from the cross-breeding of the
elements of the mass of information... His cautious pen never drove the
narrative to `techno-orgiastic escalation'... (pp. 285-7)

[end indented block]

Vinge realized this much later, eventually creating a Zoned universe, in *A
Fire Upon the Deep* (1991), that allowed certain restrictions on routine
and swift technological transcendence - allowing him, as well, to create a
rip-snorting yet principled space opera. Lem's entire discussion is worth
reading for its nuance as well as its priority. His scathing criticism of
the failure of imagination of Western sf is now rather dated, happily, but
still applies to most `consumer fodder' science fiction. 

His own apparent lapse of imagination - that proviso, `in the very distant
future' - is compensated by his insistence that *already* we have achieved
most of the great technical breakthroughs expected by Stapledon no sooner
than millennia or even millions of years hence. `[T]he moment of the
chromosome structure's discovery cannot be separated by "long millennia"
from an increase in knowledge that would permit, for example, the species
to direct its development' (p. 285). He even preempts Vinge's metaphor of
an event horizon of prediction: `[Stapledon] has invalidated the real
factors of exponential growth, which obstruct all long-range predictions;
we can't see anything from the present moment beyond the horizon of the
21st century' (p. 287). 

No less remarkably, perhaps, Lem made a cognitive leap still seldom seen, I
believe, in most futurism. There are reasons to doubt his conclusion, but
it is an impressive leap of connective imagination:

`Predictions beyond 80 or 100 years inevitably fail. Beyond that range lies
the impenetrable darkness of the future, and above it, a single definite
sign indecipherable, but impinging on us all the more: the Silence of the
Universe. The universe has not yielded to the radiance of civilizations; it
does not scintillate with brilliant astro-technical works - although that
is how it should be, if the law of psychozoic beings were an aspect of the
exponential ortho-evolution of instrumentality in cosmic dimension.' (p. 288)

Must we assume that cosmic superintelligences, whether AI or augmented
organic beings, future human or past alien, would place their stamp
detectably on the physical universe? In Arthur C. Clarke's *The City and
the Stars* (1956), advanced intelligences re-position seven different
coloured stars to form a ring in the heavens. They might not be so modest.
Emblematically - since They might be impelled by aesthetic whimsies as
readily as by economic imperatives. Consider a fragment from a recent
Australian young adult sf novel (please forgive the self-indulgence):

[start indented block]

Now the sun was definitely brighter.  In the year 2,173,698,172 its furnace
was burning harder, and according to Daddy it was more than ten percent
hotter than in our own time... The earth was empty again...

`Oh my god,' Dad said, as the first stars began to prick out in the heavens.

`Funny way to set up your satellites,' I muttered...  `They must have built
more of those orbital rings and stuck them everywhere.  You'd think they'd
bang into each other.'

`Not satellites, darling.  Those are stars,' Daddy said, and came and sat
down beside me on a shelf of cooling rock, putting his arm around me
tightly.  `That's what they've done to the stars.' The sky was a vast
curving criss-cross grid of points of hard light, like atoms seen from
inside a crystal.

Someone had actually revised the sky.  Somebody had come in and moved the
stars around.  Some Mind had reached out and flicked the billions of
burnings suns of the Milky Way as if they were some kid's marbles.

`A moir pattern,' Dad mused.

`A what?'  I looked at the changed universe with horror, but also
wonderment...  

`It's a spherical grid,' Dad was saying in a frail voice, `all the stars
have been moved to locations at regular intervals on a series of concentric
spheres,' but I hardly heard a word.  I just looked and looked, and you
could see places where the spots of brilliance ran together, which was just
where the lanes of light overlapped in the endless dark deeps of galactic
space.  The Milky Way itself was gone, its billions of stars relocated into
the grand crazy rational design.  But you could pick out the core of the
galaxy, because that was the brighter place that the endless onion skins of
stars wrapped themselves around.

`Wow,' I said.  `Oh, wow.' [note 3]

[end indented block]

All this as prelude to Poul Anderson's interesting attempt to confront that
basic and almost unsurmountable fact about the far future. Technological
time will be neither an arrow nor a cycle (in Stephen Jay Gould's phrase),
but an upwardly accelerating curve. It will pass through what Vinge terms a
Singularity and what I call the Spike. [note 4] Unless self-inflicted
disaster inevitably reduces intelligence to ruin and global death, it is
plausible that consciousness will proliferate, mutating and extending its
own capacities, perhaps replacing its very substrates - relocating itself,
for example, from limited organic bodies to very much more adaptable
synthetic forms (discussed by Hans Moravec in his recent astonishing book
*Robot*). [note 5] Poul Anderson, like Fred Pohl and other sf writers
steeped in the ever-revised history of the future, is familiar with
Moravec's extrapolations, and builds them gracefully into his own saga of a
galaxy a billion or more years farther off into deep time.

An earlier version of *Genesis*, a 100-odd page novella, appeared several
years ago in Gregory Benford's uneven anthology *Far Futures*. Anderson's
tale was perhaps overshadowed by Greg Egan's extraordinary "Wang's Carpets"
in a competing volume, Greg Bear's anthology *New Legends*: a
post-Singularity story so uncompromising that it seeded his remarkable
novel *Diaspora*, probably the most rigorous posthuman sf work yet published. 

Now Anderson extends his story of Gaia's plans for ancestral Earth
threatened by a swelling, terminal Sun. The vast, immanent AI custodian and
consciousness of the world, Gaia rather frighteningly wishes to allow the
world to perish in final flame rather than disrupt the `natural'
astrophysical trajectory. Other mighty Minds throughout the galaxy, and to
the `shores of the Andromeda', find this plan perverse. One such godlike
node, Alpha, hives off a sub-mind (still Olympian by our standards), and
sends Wayfarer to Earth to investigate and intervene. A still more
diminished aspect or agent of this fragment, a reconstruction of the early
upload engineer Christian Brannock (merely a human-scale genius), visits
the planet as his larger self communes and debates with Gaia. What he
finds, inevitably, is baffling yet emotionally moving (in its constrained
way), recalling those Norse sagas Anderson loves so well. 

And all of this impossibly remote story is told to us as myth, as
repeatedly distanced construct. We are informed again and again that what
we read is nothing like the vast reality (as of course must be so, given
the premises of ruthlessly projected futurism). `All is myth and metaphor,
beginning with this absurd nomenclature [Alpha, Wayfarer]. Beings like
these had no names. They had identities, instantly recognizable by others
of their kind. They did not speak together, they did not go through
discussion or explanation of any sort, they were not yet "they". But
imagine it' (p. 112).

And we do, for we have been here before. This is the grand proleptic
mythology of Stapledon himself, of Roger Zelazny's `For a Breath I Tarry'
(1966) - in which Machine remakes Man, but there bows before Him (which is
absurd and sadly farcical, however much we loved that story in the 1960s).
In this revised version of his myth, Anderson eases our entry to allegory
via several well-formed episodes from the comparatively near future: a
boy's epiphany beneath starry heaven, in our Earth; Christian's empathy
with his robotic telefactor extension on Mercury, prelude to his own status
as an uploaded and finally multiply-copied personality; English bureaucrat
Laurinda Ashcroft who plans the first millennial salvation of Earth from
the brute assaults of a heedless cosmos; a small, neat parable of rigid,
gorgeous clan rivalries held in check and paralysis, finally, by the
emerging Mind of Gaia. These are Anderson's antinomies again (and perhaps
American sf's): the sacred autonomy of the self, the craving for
transcendence in something larger; personal responsibility, and its
terrible limits in a world linked, defined, by a billion threads.

Returned to Earth, Wayfarer's Brannock and Gaia's Laurinda tarry in 18th
century civility, falling in love (of course), driven together and apart by
a series of visitations to simulated histories as dense and real and
tormented and doomed as the `real world'. Their own personalities are no
less constructed (of course), however rooted in some small early reality,
and so the poignancy of their dilemma is the greater. But for us, knowing
that we read a fiction, and fetched in a kind of postmodern gesture again
and again by Poul Anderson from our comfortable readerly illusion, these
figures and their worlds run the risk of all allegory: can we care? 

It is the great artistic problem for any form of art that expects utter
disruption. Religious art faced it long ago, and clad its transcendent
message in parable, majestic song - and quietness, sacralized domesticity,
anguish transformed at the graveside. These are territories Poul Anderson
has trodden in all his work, more so, perhaps, than any of his peers. Now
he confronts the Singularity, reaching to these well-honed tools to give
himself voice and range, and perhaps he succeeds as well as anyone can
manage - given that the task is impossible. I suspect he does not, however.
It might not be his fault, if so: it might be that it takes an entire
culture to sustain such myths. Sf has begun to grow the myths, but
meanwhile the world's culture turns them into jingles and plastic toys. It
will be interesting to see how the genre, the mode, of sf responds to this
immense new perspective. For now, Poul Anderson has made a brave early
foray into its pitiless depths.

Uh-oh, the clear light of neuroscience has come to reveal a glimpse of
verisimilitude here. Yep, I can see the borgs now, they're producing
surges of activity in their anterior cingulate cortexes, middle insulas
and in parts of their putamen and caudate nuclei -- all generated by their
Palm GX-9000 with Sensoria VR auxilliary customizations. Ah... ain't love

Well, sure. I mean that's what *I* use porn for. Marriage doesn't need to
enter into it. (Okay, I admit I've had a few extended conversations with
the checker at Blockbuster, but hey, we'll get over it without a nuptial

Holy sheep dip! I'm glad to hear you say that. Those of us who wish to,
can continue to enjoy wedded bliss while inventing a future that provides
possibilities that only a borg can fully comprehend and appreciate. I
think we've pretty much worked ourselves out of this box. Borgs can
provide social relationships to order. End of story.

I not only used to subscribe, but I used to man a phone during
pledge drives. I'm hard pressed to say what I watch on 11 anymore
with the exception of "Wall Street Week".

They always whine during pledge drives how they don't get a dime
from cable, I wouldn't let cable have the channel for free.

Just noticed this on the net:

http://theanimist.netgazer.net.au/pg000014.html#The Initiate

Here's a partial:

<The Last Mortal Generation, written by a devotee of the cult of science
(which has held sway over the mind of Western man for the past four or so
centuries), gives us a timely overview of what the 'white-coats' are up to
in the realm of immortality research. It also gives us some interesting
insights into how they view the human condition:
  "We might be the last humans in history doomed to perish simply because
we can't  do anything about it."
 Though I admire the depth of vision and imaginative genius on display in
this work I have many problems with its philosophical underpinnings.
Broderick, and the scientists he discusses, seem to have little conception
of old age and death as necessary parts of the human life cycle. This to me
is the major weakness of the book. It is taken as fact that old age and
death are evils to be avoided at all costs, that they are in short
pathologies of the human, diseases, rather than experiences related to
summarising, relinquishment and moving on. True to the philosophy of
materialism, the book's analysis centres upon the physiology of ageing and
death ... little time is spent on the psychology of old age, the immense
psychospiritual changes (the getting of wisdom?) that accompany old age and
that may even be necessary to younger generations. Are we to believe that
the reveries of old age, the processes of looking back, of advising, of
learning from experiences, of learning from the various stages of the life
cycle, of learning to accept and come to terms with death and its capacity
to illuminate the meaning of life are to be dismissed as 'aspects of a
disease' in the same way that Broderick dismisses the physical changes
associated with the same? Don't get me wrong here I'm not saying that we
end research into technologies which stop people dying by non-natural means
- I am no Jehova's Witness. My quibble, rather, is with the desire to
reverse the natural processes of old age, to flee from death and other life
experiences into science and technology. The cult of youth that sees
millions of older people yearly submit their bodies and psyches to invasive
surgery, hormone therapy and other 'remedies' in order to avoid the
wrinkles and character lines of old age seems to be all of a piece with
this strange fear of death and ageing that now motivates scientists to
search for eternal youth.
 These and other issues are matters of personal opinion, however, and to
give Broderick his due many such objections receive a fair hearing in the
book. Although I would recommend more criticism of the peculiar world view
of the scientists Broderick discusses - with a special emphasis on the
possibility that there is something psychologically suspect about people
who flee from old age in particular - the book itself is a factual,
well-researched and imaginative discussion of scientific developments which
are altering our sense of what it is to be human - even as we speak.
 As a final thought: One day soon it may take courage to allow oneself to
grow old and die: we live in eerie times when death becomes the ultimate
subversive act. >

Where is the "scrith" when you really need it?!? We engineers are always looking for solutions, and of course, new materials. "Unobtanium" is something we are looking for to please our fussy, weight-conscious NASA customers! 1/100th the weight, 6 times the strength.... ooo what I wouldn't give right now for some carbon nanotube materials! Another interesting area to look into is aerogels.... The insulating properties of aerogels and the potential of using them to screen not only micrometeorites but also guard versus radiation if doped with the proper elements. I'm certainly no expert, and please, if anyone has more information on the potential applications of aerogels, please let me know!

Whew! Rather, toxic in my opinion. Or "just lay back and enjoy it!" as the 
old, saying went. Wisdom seems to come mostly, from experience, rather then 
the pile-up of debri in human cells. The materialist culture comment was a 
bit crazy, since the "spirtual" cannot, as such, be detected; if it were, 
then the world would appear as something from Larry Niven's "The Magic Goes 
Away".  So the choice is to do something or do nothing. If death by aging is 
so preferable then why work on allieviating Alzheimer's, which is normally 
age-related? Let the children die of the disease, Progeria, rather then 
attempt to examine genetic therapy. 

There are people who may actually disagree with the reviewer, and consider 
that some of the tasks ahead, that would help humanity and earth-life 
survive, may (as Arthur C. Clarke has often stated) "take the labour of 
centuries". Cleanning up the earth, enhancing its plant-life zones, helping

Which areas are that?  (I have just spent an afternoon drawing complex

maybe we should add love there too :-)

I wrote sooner about Singularity as it was presented by Vernor Vinge and

I will send Zbigniew some information, but I must know his valid email

Dear Mr. Irvine,
You say in your review of The Last Mortal Generation:
> True to the philosophy of materialism, the book's
> analysis centres upon the physiology of ageing and death ... little time is spent on the psychology of old age, the immense psychospiritual changes (the
> getting of wisdom?) that accompany old age and that may even be necessary to younger generations. Are we to believe that the reveries of old age,
> the processes of looking back, of advising, of learning from experiences, of learning from the various stages of the life cycle, of learning to accept and
> come to terms with death and its capacity to illuminate the meaning of life are to be dismissed as 'aspects of a disease' in the same way that Broderick
> dismisses the physical changes associated with the same?

This indicates that you have your own blinders on here. You seem to
assume that the wisdom acquired in old age is a consequence of the
individual slowly rotting away, and in coming to terms with one's
mortality, rather than as a consequence of the accumulation of one's
past experience actually LIVING life. While there is something to be
said for confronting one's mortality, the rot of old age does not result
in wisdom, its simply a pain, an impediment, and a source of suffering
that could and should be avoided. Humanists claim to seek to alleviate
suffering in this world, yet they refuse to admit that the greatest
amount of suffering is from old age. If you claim that wisdom results
from this suffering, then you cannot conversely claim that other sources
of suffering, like child abuse, scholastic, military, gender, religious,
and racial/ethnic hazing and discrimination, police torture and
imprisonment of criminals, are not all character building activities
that should also be accepted in our all too human world. By opposing
such suffering, you are thus opposed to creating greater wisdom in the
world.

As this reducto ad absurdum demonstrates, the logic of old age related
suffering producing wisdom is false, or else your whole worldview is
false. Wisdom comes from experience. Becoming practically immortal
should thus result in greater wisdom in the world.

Additionally, practical immortality is not total immortality. Even if
all diseases and old age are cured, unrepairable fatalities due to
accidents (particularly brain hemmorage or destruction) would result in
a life expectancy of approximately 4000 years, so there is still room
for one to come to terms with one's mortality, especially if one engages
in more risk filled activities.

Regards,
Michael S. Lorrey

Ditto to that. I wish I could have been there. I suppose that PR-wise there 
are drawsbacks to this kind of counterdemonstartion, as others here have 
pointed out, but emotionally, I love it.

I am stunned almost speechless by the depth of the gulf between his thinking 
and ours. When I hear someone who is apparently educated and well-read make 
this statement, and realize that the vast majority of humans share his 
viewpoint, I wonder if we have any real chance to win them over, ever.

Perhaps the old saying about how new ideas win acceptance--the holders of 
the idea paradigm simply die out, leaving the field open for the new
--is completely correct.

	Yes definitely.

	It seems so sad to me, but evidently all these people will
obviously be the most significant, final and mostly avoidable,
casualties of the primitive survival of the fittest method of growth.

I wouldn't say its completely correct. Don't buy into Kuhnism. Its
Saberhagen's Law: Fugheads is fugheads. Never underestimate the power of
human stupidity.

Now, I read the whole review, and he did try to start off acknowledging
and illustrating the hypocrisy of his own self confessed luddism, so he
tries to approach his review as an 'I've got clay feet, where are
yours?' type of underhanded attack.

This is one of those issues that will have extropians on both sides
of the fence.

I did some quick searching on this, including the EPA factsheet on
tolworthi (the organism) and its expressed Cry9C protein.
(Starlink). Note that Starlink uses a modified protein more
powerfull than that found in the original organism.

In part 1c they state " EPA does not have any information regarding
endocrine effects for these kinds of pesticides at this time." They
further state that the "company" claims there is some minor
staining for the presence of carbohydrates" in other words leaving
the door ajar as to whether it is an allergen.

Under part 3a they completely discount any exposure to the actual
toxin since the tests were performed on levels that might result as
residue from animal feed.

In part 1 the toxicology assessment part A Acute toxicity, they
mention that at these residual testing levels some test mice got
sick, but only the FEMALE mice. CLASSIFICATION Acceptable

Other fun things:

"should pest resistance to Cry9c corn be detected in the field
Aventis has proposed a remedial action plan that calls for
immediate suspension of seed sales in the affected counties once
resistance has been confirmed."

In the case of polyphagus pests (they feed on more than one
species) the pests may change food sources in the presence of Bt
corn.

In normal use of the toxin, the toxin is activated by the stomach
conditions of the pest it is inactivated otherwise. In Starlite
it is expressed as the active toxin.

So I'm not placing any bets on Bt corn.

If the biotech industry needs a killer app, the California wine
regions are facing devastation from the glassy wing sharpshooter,
maybe they can find some converts there.

Old age, like most other forms of suffering, *does* produce wisdom.  This
itself is a part of the human condition that needs to be fixed.  There are
other ways.

One of the truly beautiful truths about modern times is that technology
creates more wisdom through education and cultural self-awareness than it
eliminates by eliminating suffering; compared to past times, we suffer
less, yet are wiser.

St Johns wort for depression 
Full source: ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, 2000, Vol 160, Iss 2, pp
152-156 
Articles with data on the efficacy, safety, and availability of St Johns
wort were studied and randomized, controlled, double-blind trials were
selected and assessed for methodological quality using a standardized
checklist, and data on pharmacology, cost, regulation, and safety were
extracted. Eight studies were identified, found to be of generally good
methodological quality, and determined to provide a modest amount of data
to suggest that St Johns wort is more effective than placebo in the
treatment of mild to moderate depression. The response rate with the use
of St Johns wort ranged from 23% to 55% higher than with placebo, but
ranged from 6% to 18% lower compared with tricyclic antidepressants. More
data are required to assess both its use in severe depression and its
efficacy compared with other antidepressants. Rates of side effects were
low. As a potent and useful dietary supplement, St Johns wort is currently
largely unregulated. However, the FDA is reviewing plans to tighten its
regulation. 

Kava extract for anxiety 
Full source: JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY, 2000, Vol 20, Iss 1,
pp 84-89 
Synthetic anti-anxiety drugs are effective for treating anxiety, but they
have many adverse effects. A review and analysis assessed the evidence for
or against the efficacy of kava extract as a symptomatic treatment for
anxiety. Systematic Literature searches were performed in the computerized
databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, AMED, CISCOM, and the Cochrane Library.
Experts on the subject were contacted to provide further information. The
results showed the superiority of kava extract over the placebo by all
seven reviewed trials. The analysis of three trials suggests a significant
difference (90%) in the reduction of the total score on the Hamilton
Rating Scale for Anxiety in favor of kava extract. The data imply that
kava extract is superior to placebo as a symptomatic treatment for
anxiety. Therefore, kava extract is an herbal treatment option for anxiety
that is worthy of consideration. 
Use of complementary health practices with prostate cancer 
Full source: CANCER, 2000, Vol 88, Iss 3, pp 615-619 
There has been increasing interest in complementary health practices among
individuals, popular media, and even institutional health care providers.
A study of 50 individuals undergoing radiation treatment for prostate
cancer found that a surprisingly high proportion (37%) relied on
complementary health practices not prescribed by physicians. In contrast,
according to a separate survey of the treating physicians, the physicians
believed that on average only 4% of their patients resorted to such
practices. The use of complementary health practices usually continued
even after the initiation of definitive treatment for prostate cancer.
Those who used complementary health practices tended to have higher levels
of education and income, whereas there were no differences in age,
religion, perception of health status, stage of prostate cancer, or
prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. Herbal remedies were the most
frequently utilized, by 60% of those using complementary health practices,
followed by old-lime remedies (47%), high dose vitamins (41%),
chiropractic/ massage therapy and relaxation techniques (18% each), and
special diets (12%). 

Effect of Ginkgo/drug combination on pancreatic cancer 
Full source: Arzneimittel-Farschung-Drug Research, 1999, Val. 49, Is 12,
PP 1030-1034 
A study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability as well as the quality of
life under treatment with a drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), combined with
ginkgo biloba extract (GEE) in 32 individuals with locally or metastatic
advanced pancreatic cancer. The treatment was repeated every three weeks
until progression. Response to therapy was evaluated after 2 and 4
treatment courses. Progressive disease was observed in 22 ( 68.8 % )
individuals, no change in 7 (21.9 % ) and partial response in 3 (9.4 % ).
The overall response was 9.4 %. Adverse events were judged as related to
the drug 5-FU and consisted of liver toxicity. In comparison with the
results of the studies with the drug, gemcitabine, the combination of
5-FU/GEE shows comparable response rates. The toxicity of the 5-FU/GEE
combination was low. The results suggest a good benefit-risk ratio of the
combination of the drug 5-FU and GEE in the treatment of pancreatic
cancer. 
Selenium inhibits angiogenesis in breast cancer 
Full source: Mol Carcinogen 99, Vol. 26, Iss. 4, Pgs. 213-225 
The trace element nutrient selenium (Se) has been shown to possess
cancer-preventive activity in both animals and humans. The process of
angiogenesis (development of new blood vessels) is necessary for the
genesis and growth of solid cancers. A study examined if selenium exerts
its cancer-preventive activity, by inhibiting cancer-associated
angiogenesis. Increased selenium intake as selenium-enriched garlic,
sodium selenite, or Se-methylselenocysteine led to a significant reduction
of tumor density in breast cancers during continuous exposure for 7 weeks.

Also, there were significantly lower levels of vascular endothelial cell
growth factor activity in a sizeable proportion of the selenium-treated
cancers, compared to the control group. In contrast to the breast cancers,
the microvessel density of the mammary glands that were not involved, was
not altered by the selenium treatment. In cell culture, direct exposure of
human umbilical vein endothelial cells to selenium induced cell death
predominantly through apoptosis. The results indicate a potential for
selenium metabolites to inhibit key attributes (proliferation, survival,
and cell matrix degradation) of endothelial cells which are critical for
angiogenesis to begin. Therefore, inhibition of angiogenesis associated
with cancer may be a mechanism for the anticancer activity of selenium in
vivo. 
Ginkgo biloba extract and peripheral arterial occlusive disease 
Full source: Arzneim Forsch Drug Res 99, Vol. 49, Iss. 11, Pgs. 900-904 
Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba
extract in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. A study
that was conducted to confirm the superiority of the higher dosage of
Ginkgo biloba extract on 74 individuals indicated the superiority of 240
mg Ginkgo biloba extract daily compared with the standard dosage of 120 mg
to 160 mg daily. The primary efficacy criterion was the difference of the
pain-free walking distance between the start of treatment and after 24
weeks measured on a treadmill under standardized conditions. The pain-free
walking distance improved in both groups. There was a mean increase of
60.6 m in the group who received 120 mg Ginkgo biloba extract daily and a
statistically significant higher mean increase of 107.0 m in the group who
were treated with the higher dosage. Both dosage regimens investigated in
this study led to an improvement of the pain-free walking distance after
24 weeks of treatment. The superiority of the higher dosage over the
standard dosage was statistically significant. Both treatment variations
were safe and well tolerated. 
Green tea extract decreases iron-induced free radical damage 
Full source: J Nutr 99, Vol. 129, Iss. 12, Pgs. 2130-2134 
Regular tea consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of cancer.
Green tea contains catechins with antioxidant properties. In one study,
cells grown with or without green tea extract were treated with iron as an
oxidative stimulus for 2 hours. Supplementation with green tea extract
significantly decreased malondialdehyde production and DNA damage after
iron oxidative treatment. (Malondialdehyde is a lipid peroxidation
product, believed to be a marker of radical generation and tissue damage).
In cells untreated with green tea, there was no effect on membrane
distribution of (n-3) fatty acids due to iron treatment. It is likely that
the protective effects can be attributed to epigallocatechin gallate,
which is present mainly (670 g/kg) in green tea extract. This supports a
protective effect of green tea against free radical damage.

This doesn't seem consistent with my experience.  A large part of my law 
practice relates to construction of power plants, especially the new, smaller 
"merchant plants" (they used to be called "cogeneration facilities" -- a 
regulatory figleaf to protect these facilities from being trampled by the 
monopoly utility companies in the early days of gas turbine tech).  My 
clients like Dynegy and Enron (to name just two of the dozens working in this 
field) are building 50-500MW plants in the US as fast as they possibly can; 
so fast, in fact that you can't get a new gas turbine generator (GTG) in less 
than two years for love or money.

As for it being worth the investment -- look at Dynegy's stock price.  
Building smaller, more efficient, more flexible power plants is attracting a 
LOT of investment because it's very profitable right now. (It's also a LOT of 
fun!)

Yes, this is good. I'd like to know how to find out when Greenpeace (and 
similar groups') protests are scheduled. I think the best way to counter the 
bad PR is to have the counter-protesters be smarter (not difficult), more 
concise and intuitive in providing sound-bites, friendlier, and more fun. 
Like setting up a stand giving out free tacos made with starlink shells and 
GM tomatoes.
I read a great book a few years ago, "Rules for radicals", it's basic 
instruction for protests and the author's manifesto to some degree. The 
manifesto aspect is crap, but the instruction is very good. It's like "The 
Prince" in reverse. Here's a link on amazon:

I have seen concern on this list that aerobic exercise, by producing
oxidative stress, could actually *decrease* longevity if taken to extremes.
 
I have two comments on this:
 
1) This notion is not supported by epidemeological data.  In studies of the
death risk of distance runners, for example, number of miles run per day
correlated with likelihood of surviving the study.  Since the average
distance runner is well exceeding 30 minutes of cardio exercise per day,
this supports the notion that even large amounts of aerobic exercise
increase rather than decrease longevity.
 
Also note that several studies on CR in rats have found that 
  a) Exercise does not offset the benefits of CR by producing increased
oxidative stress; and 
  b) The effects of exercise and CR are not additive in rats; and 
  c) Exercising rats tend to outlive CR rats 
 
References:  McCarter (97), Holloszy (97), Holloszy (98)
 
(See especially the McCarter paper which shows exercising rats outliving CR
rats.)
 
2) The 9 November Nature Insight section on ageing engages in some
speculation on the need for acute oxidative stress to build up oxidative
stress resistance.  In particular it theories that one mechanism via which
exercise extends mean longevity is by producing an oxidative stress on
cells that builds a resistance to future oxidative stresses.
 
To support this notion, the Nature review article cites papers
demonstrating a correlation between "conditioning stresses" (heat and
radiation) and increased mean longevity in C. Elegans and Drosophila.
 
References: Nature 11/9/00 - "Oxidants, oxidative stress, and the biology
of ageing"; Lithgow (95), Johnson (98)

The tone of the review was more that of someone trying to convince himself 
of what he's saying.
The kind of attitude expressed is not surprising and it's easy to see how it 
comes about. As long as people have existed, death has been inevitable (and 
even with billion year+ lifespans, it is still something which will 
eventually happen). Those who accept this hideous inevitability as "a 
neccessary part of life", thus desirable, probably were the ones better at 
coping with their own morality, and the deaths of others around them. I saw 
this documentary, "Sick: The life and death of bob flanagan, 
supermasochist", about a guy with Cystic Fibrosis, constantly in pain since 
childhood, who became a masochistic performance artist, doing things on 
stage which would kill me if I did them. It's the same mechanism, you try to 
turn something you can't get away from into something you love, something 
you wouldn't give up for the world, a neccessary part of the grand cycle of 
life.

Hey you materialist! URLs with spaces in them are a natural part of 
being on the internet. These URLs sometimes lead to wisdom if you 
know how to follow. Now sit back down and return to clicking the 
broken URLs fate has dealt you.


My god, that review... I keep hearing the same damn opinion echoed,
right down to the same cliche metaphors, from people who couldn't have
possibly met! Where is this crap coming from?! It just doesn't make
sense. Having exhausted all the rational explanations, I'm left with
the following theories:

1. Aliens have infiltrated our culture and are spreading defeatist
memes, presumably to non-violently pre-empt competition.

2. Once a culture reaches a certain critical size a subtle, low-key
mass insanity (mass neurosis?) takes hold. CF fall of the Roman Empire.

3. Humans have an inherent tendency toward self-defeatism and hatred
of success. Except us mutants.

4. Some religionists went underground and resurfaced as "modern" luddites.


Whatever the case, there's too many of them to enlighten. We'll soon be
overrun. The only remaining course of action is clear... let's re-read
Atlas Shrugged and start packing our bags.

Replicators: Evolutionary Powerhouses

	http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/home.shtml

This interactive exploration of evolutionary and cultural biology
was created by three high school students (Russian and American)
and their coaches as a Thinkquest project. The premise, the theory
of replicators, was developed by biologist Richard Dawkins and
described in his popular writings. Replicators are "anything in

It took 208 trials to get from `extropian' to `posthuman' (but it's
actually just a sequence of individual point mutations with no global
phenotypic interaction beyond its teleology, which is a shame).

Well, one place to inject new "genetic" information is at the point
where RNA is transcribed (heretofore, from DNA). Ribosomes read the RNA
to produce proteins.

To what end does your genetics shape you now? I would suppose, in the
most general way, one could overcome some limitation in one's genetics,
whatever one might consider such a limitation to be, in this way.

It comes from the same place our own opinions come from.  There are
always relatively conserving of the status quo forces arrayed against
relatively expansionist forces of change.  Indeed there is some need
that it be that way.  Why does it dismay you?

Competition is one of many memes.  One that is not the cure for all
evils now and forever necessarily.  In the Open Source world I see
another word being floated, "coopetition".  Cooperate where cooperation
is the best choice or where there are common interest served and compete
in other areas.  Defeatist stuff has been part of human cultures from
the beginning.

Well, they in part got screwed by having much of their plumbing and the
drinking untensils of the rich be lined with lead.  Lead poisoning
psychosis is not a pretty thing.

As the pace of change accelerates more and more people will feel serious
strain.  Many of them will attempt to stand aside from the changes or to
demand they slow down or go away.  Many will choose between old
religious values they once learned and having to cope with the
increasingly complex real world.  If you want to reach them perhaps you
need to show them that this changing world is actually massively in
their interest and that of their children.

That article was not completely off.  From a point of view of attempting
to learn wisdom in the face of adversity (which many have learned to
prize throughout human history) it seems quite perverse to simply
eliminate huge swaths of the adversity thus making the wisdom of
accepting it foolish.  It is not difficult to understand how some people
would feel this way.

Religionists have not uniformly been in a luddite or anti-progress
camp.  You can fine perfectly healthy religious fervor in many
extropians.  Except that many of us think we see how a true New Heaven
and New Earth (if you will) can come to be.

Do you then assume people cannot be reached and cannot change?  Where
exactly will you pack your bags off too?  You might want to develop an
impervious force field before claiming a sufficiently large hunk of
earth real estate for all of us.

Due to the lingering effects of the patriarchy most guys are arrogant
selfish twits who shouldn't be allowed out in polite society. :-) Many
of them have ingrained "me man, you my woman" BS at some level that
precludes real equality in a male-female relationship.  Many men are
still scared shitless of a woman as smart/capable (or heaven forbid)
smarter than themselves.

Just a tad stereotypical here.  Women have for quite a while not
emphasized the actual looks of the men they were interested in.  At
least not the way guys are trained to see a woman's looks as a plus or
minus in their own status system.  Women tend to be more interested
classically in whether the guy is a decent provider (not so relevant
today but still relevant) and whether he is reasonably stable and not
likely to be abusive and of course in what kind of companion he is on
multiple levels.  Bright women want to know they have a lover/mate that
understands what moves them and will actually be a help rather than the
kind of hindrance that feels their careers detract from the guy's
"legitimate needs" or something.  Women (and men) also want a partner
who they respect and admire.

It is mainly the guys that need to get past "lookist" bs.  

Now some of this and women's equivalent hankering for the "hunk" is
biological wiring looking for likely good reproductive candidates.  That
of course is becoming far less relevant.

I disagree.  A good solid life-partner (at least for the foreseeable X
years) is a real asset.

Well, I wouldn't limit it to just extropians of the opposite sex
myself.  Many computer geek folks and extropians are bisexual or
gay/lesbian.

Cool.  But a bit too dry for me.  A little bit more romance doesn't hurt
at all. What you are describing sounds more like a marriage of
convenience.

Hmmm.  So how does a "good extropian" cure herpes anyhow?  

Gays and lesbians should be able to marry also of course.  And marry
their actual partners rather than create the same legal fiction so many
of us have since the beginning of human history.  

I am of mixed mind about open relationships.  They are quite natural and
beautiful for me in many respects.  But I have had too many partners I
loved a great deal who couldn't get the hang of it.  Also, I think there
is something to be said for a long-term one person only sexual/romantic
relationship.  So I guess my position is that I understand and
appreciate both open and monogamous relationships that are healthy.
