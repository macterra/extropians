Most artists have always been poor and/or had day jobs.  Art has its way
of rewarding masters as well, including fame, friends, sex and most

I thought you were sticking to art.  SV is hardly a hotbed of art. 
Still, huge numbers of artists do scrape by _and_ create in places like
NYC, traditionally more expensive than SV.  Many great artists also live
comfortably in much cheaper locales, which gives the option of
alternating between holding down a day job and taking long sabbaticals. 
There's an art scene pretty much anywhere you care to look, just
requires turning over rocks some places.  Now that computers have become
so widespread, the same is becoming true of what people typically refer
to as "high tech".

More fantastic music than I could ever listen to has been and is being
created by impoverished musicians.  If really pressed someone with
talent can make great music with zero budget and begged and borrowed
equipment.  It's been done many times over.

Rest assured, the most promising writers are presently flipping burgers,

sole aim of getting rich will move into fast food management.  Good

It might have just been a slip of the pen, though. Certainly Ray's machine

Don't confuse ANN in their wide spread implementation with biological 
neurons. In most ANN simulators don't model neurons at all. They are 
connectionist models, such as neural networks are connectionist, but there 
the similarity ends. There are more realistic models available. See

which tries to model biological neurons in all their complexity with the aim 
to help understanding NNs

For a simulator that tries to capture the information theoritical aspects in 
order to solve problems such as spacio-temporal pattern recognition.

This is called Hebbian learning and is available in all decent ANN 
simulators. I am not aware of meta-signals. If you have literature to this 
topic, please point me to it! Hebbian learning seems not to be enough, 
however. Something is missing....

.... Every brain (of a given species) is locally very different even though 
it globally looks the same. It's not plausible how a genome with maybe 100MB 
of data is able to describe the synapses of a human brain which is way more 
than 1PetaByte of data. The genome is not a blue print! It's rather a 
program, the execution of which builds a phenotype. My hypothesis is that the 
initial micro anatomy of the brain is such that self-organizing by Hebbian 
and maybe other types of local learning is possible.

Nope. But I would not worry about this part of uploading technology. Once 
scanning technology is developed enough we can scan a mouse and instantiate 
it into different neuron models until we find it eats virtual cheese ;-)

yeah, do it, it's a nice term, your one, but otherwise we're promoting at

A more robust approach would seem to start with a series of 
well-characterized organisms, e.g. D. discoideum -> C. elegans -> Aplysia 
-> D. melanogaster->M. musculus-> H. sapiens, validating behaviour in 
machina along each step.

Apart from scaling issues one would have to develop new methods at each
step. C. elegans is still small enough for a conventional manual tracing
from EM micrographs, but the next steps will require machine vision, and
then automated imaging. Mice (and certainly men) are too large to be
imaged en bloc (the surface, that is), requiring recursive subdision into
individually imaged blocks.

Another issue is development of new simulation paradigms, as larger
organisms are impractical to simulate even on large scale molecular
circuitry machines.

It is interesting that so many software developers have apparently a blind
spot in the area. And we're not even talking about juggling thousands of
concurrent threads of control here.

I also fail to see a real breakthrough anytime soon. Pattern-driven code
generation is about as good as it gets for gurus. We will be able to have
automatic code generation eventually, which generates codes to specs or in
interactive sessions (reward/punishment or simon says sessions), but this
is something clearly quite far removed from what we currently call code.

Getting there is a nontrivial process, given that the industry as a whole 
is oblivous that there is a problem.

A good review of state-of-the-art laser physics

energy limits might be when optical damage becomes
less relevant (due to nanotech based reconstruction
and installation of new optical elements in real time).

Significant because easily produced solar cells actually
achieve energy yields similar to or greater than natural
photosynthetic processes (that harvest solar energy at 1-2%
efficiency).

Significant because it demonstrates that "memory" mechanisms

have their hands on the "smoking gun(s)" responsible
for the "memory" mechanism in brains.

one or two major intellects to do the work, someone

I've seen other organizations with military/government

be moral, but lawyers are clever and some management
may be unethical.

"This cigar is not a cigar. If you wish to believe it
is you are welcome to do so. But it is too convenient
by far. Saying there will always be theories dismisses
some quite important possibilities that it may be
dangerous to dismiss at this time as they are, if
realistic, in the way of our fondest hopes."

I agree, it's awful convenient for the Luddite and/or
power-conservation blocs, among the groups who most
benefit from such action. In the first place, the tech
was destabilizing and the "camel's nose under the
tent" (meaning the first indication you were about to
be visited by a most objectional neighbor), and in the
second the economic response was destabilizing. In
either case, they (the potential conspirators) need to
do something to halt the destabilization.

However, both would require significant access into
the technological sector (aka the 'dot coms') to set
this up. Do-able, but objectional to both groups
either due to morals or economic risk. It'd be more
likely that one or both (or the possibility that both
are represented in the same organization of people)
have access to/control of the venture capitalists.
Considering just how bumptious that group is,
something which I must consider unlikely.

If I'm wrong about this, please, do correct me. I'd
love to have a valid target.

I stated earlier, "All I can honestly say is that if
there *IS* convincing evidence of such a group
controlling our lives, I have yet to see it in the
(relatively few) years I've been watching.". Ms Atkins
responded, "If it could be seen easily it would of
course not be very effective. Personally I lean toward
believing there is some reason to be somewhat paranoid
at this time."

True, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean
they're not out to get you. However, paranoia is often
counterproductive in that you spend too much time
looking for connections that aren't there. *shrug* To
each their own, and I hope you find anything that's
out there. If you do, please DO let me know, and we'll
see what can be done. I'm just a loudmouth with a
fraction of the brains of some of the people on this
list, but I'm willing to stand up and speak as I feel
the need - and, quite frankly, in that type of
situation I probably would feel the need. *wry grin*

I stated, "In short, I don't see the dot-coms as
anything other than people betting - BETTING - on a
'sure thing' and getting their hands slapped
financially."

Ms Atkins posted, "So you are simply dismissing the
many, many companies and businesses who do not fall in
this neat package? You are dismissing the size of the
meltdown that did not limit itself to dot-com
companies and that continues long after any real
correction? Almost all nominal companies tanked
including many  high-tech and AI efforts. A lot of
cutting-edge research has been set back as far as
being available to you or I. 

Perhaps it was not a conspiracy but it has slowed all
of us down. My own goals of financial independence and
freedom to move to a different job, contract or start
my own business have also been effected negatively. I
am not alone in that."

As the great majority of venture capitalists are NOT
highly technically educated (at least those I've met
and read of), I can easily see one portion of the
"cutting edge" of technology's failure to be
economically feasible affecting all others. Especially
since the sectors involved here (dot-coms, AI) are all
computer based.

And computers are the same world-wide, ain't they?
*wry grin* I'm a system administrator by trade. I
can't count the number of times people have asked what
I did, and then asked about the intricacies of their
favorite software package on a platform I'm not savvy
on. "But, you run computers, right?" is the amazed
response when I explain that I don't know what they
need to do.

As for having slowed the advance of technology down -
you betcha. It's much harder to get funding - and
therefore jobs and new technology - into the technical
sectors. And yes, it's affected my life as well,
significantly.

But, is this necessarily a bad thing? That we have
TIME to adjust to this bunch of new technologies (new
processor types, new communication routes,
expansion/enhancement of old types like fiberoptics,
new software standards and 'standards' such as
Microsoft's .NET and XML respectively)?

I've argued here before that we need to understand the
tech while we can. Eventually, assuming the technology
continues its historical exponential growth, it's not
going to be possible as we are now. However, the
longer we're able to maintain comprehension the less
problems we'll have. And if we're capable of
generating friendly AI or IA before we loose that
comprehension, we may never need go through some of
the nastier potentials of the Singularity.

A goal I find extremely attractive.

-John

...and you're sure the sheet-music publishing business didn't die
because (1) technology made producing and selling recordings of
actual performances cheap and easy, and (2) copyright law was changed
to cover recordings of performances, so musicians could use the same
business model with a different product which had more demand?

The Xerox machine didn't destroy the book-publishing industry.  What
makes you think that it was the primary thing that destroyed the
sheet-music industry, and not the fact that the industry was created
by the vagaries of copyright law in the first place, and changes to
that law brought the market more in line with what peole actually
wanted to buy?

I always thought it was meant to symbolize the fertile crescent
area of north Africa.  Just goes to show that one can read many
meanings into a symbol after-the fact, regardless of what its
origins might be, so I'm sure someone will concoct different
stories about the meaning of the simley face, some of which will
undoubtedly be derogatory.

Actually it would not require any significant access into the 
technological sector.  Most of the effect could have been run at 
the financial level.  It does not have to have included that 
many VC people as they are a secondary specialized type of 
financial folk who could have been considered at best 
unavoidable "collateral damage".

As many of us are in our forties or older now any significant 
slowdown of technology has potentially fatal personal 
consequences.  Plus the US is dragging significantly on some 
technologies such as wireless that could significantly impact 
our competitiveness.  MS can go straight to hell along with 
.NET.  I will happily help them along the way.  There is no 
reason to take our time about things that are that simple (some 
would say brain-dead).

What do you mean by "comprehension" here?  Without significant 
technological advances, particularly in the direction of 
augmented intelligence, I don't believe we comprehend very much 
of our world now well enough to wisely make choices.  We already 
have very significant problems (most of them not technological) 
that we are having a difficult time keeping abreast of.  Our 
world already moves faster than our current level of 
intelligence and interaction is sufficient to handle.  We can't 
get to full AI, friendly or otherwise, without going full-steam 
in technology development.  Going slow will not be to our 
benefit at this time in history.

Like, say, initial weights geared towards the problem (though probably

But if we don't have the models, we don't know what to scan for...not
exactly, anyway.

Hey, the Mouse was a joke, not a practical proposal. The point I want to get 
across is: Once we 

1. have sufficient HW power
2. have sufficiently advanced scanning technology

then instantiating a brain is engineering and will not require further major 
quantum leaps in science. 

For simple organisms (up to Salamander or so) you already can buy the 
necessary HW/SW from our salary if your salary is good (a 100 SMP PC, 
Myrinet, a Linux CD, Amygdala) if Moravec is right with his estimates. Of 
course if Penrose is right then no Linux cluster will help, regardless of 
it's size.

Hey, words are cheap. Where is the code? -> I've heard that it's custom to 
offer bets on this list. What about this: If someone gives me a map of a 
drosophilia brain with all neurons and their connections we'll have an 
Amygdala NN that likes to eat virtual fruit and fly around virtual jam jars 
in less than 8 months. USD5,000. , anyone?

There is no need to simulate on the molecular level - capturing all relevant 
information theoretical aspects of spiking and synapse strength adjustments, 
maybe also gap junktions (and leaving out all quantum information theoretical 
micro tubule bull^H^H^H^H theories) will get us there, I am sure of that.

Ahhh, yes, 2 second's research on google finds:

http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa060401a.htm

---------------
The early Muslim community did not really have a symbol.  During the time of
the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), Islamic armies and caravans flew
simple solid-colored flags (generally black, green, or white) for
identification purposes.  In later generations, the Muslim leaders continued
to use a simple black, white, or green flag with no markings, writing, or
symbolism on it.

It wasn't until the Ottoman Empire that the crescent moon and star became
affiliated with the Muslim world.  When the Turks conquered Constantinople
(Istanbul) in 1453, they adopted the city's existing flag and symbol.  Legend
holds that the founder of the Ottoman Empire, Osman, had a dream in which the
crescent moon stretched from one end of the earth to the other.  Taking this
as a good omen, he chose to keep the crescent and make it the symbol of his
dynasty.  There is speculation that the five points on the star represent the
five pillars of Islam, but this is pure conjecture.  The five points were not
standard on the Ottoman flags, and as you will see on the following page, it
is still not standard on flags used in the Muslim world today.

For hundreds of years, the Ottoman Empire ruled over the Muslim world.  After
centuries of battle with Christian Europe, it is understandable how the
symbols of this empire became linked in people's minds with the faith of Islam
as a whole.

Based on this history, many Muslims reject using the crescent moon as a symbol
of Islam.  The faith of Islam has historically had no symbol, and many refuse
to accept what is essentially an ancient pagan icon.  It is certainly not in
uniform use among Muslims.

As most of you should know, the situation with Rémy Martinot's
parents in France is still a precarious one.  It has made us
take a closer look at the legal challenges facing us even here
in the United States, and what we as Extropians can do to
ensure that we will be able to accomplish our goals with minimal
interference from local, state, and national governments.

Acordingly, I have asked Greg Burch to begin the paperwork
necessary for establishing The First American Church of Extropy,
a 501c(3)-exempt religious organization, to further our goals.
Religions have many legal advantages in this country and many
of its regions.  Members of our church will be better able to
direct their medical care, and in particular will be able to
claim religious grounds for refusing autopsy and requiring
immediate cryopreservation of their mortal remains.  Likewise,
we will have standing to protest school books and curricula
that conflict with or ridicule our beliefs; local school boards
are reluctant to dismiss the concerns of religious groups on
these matters.  Finally, this may enable us to bring
constitutional challenges to many laws that interfere with
popular aspects of the Extropian lifestyle, including polyamory,
nootropic drug use, bodily enhancement, and weapon use.

Priestess Matasha will be available to solemnize weddings in
accordance with California Fmily Code section 307 for reasonable
fees that should help defray the cost of some of these changes.
We also intend to lobby Congress to make Isaac Newton's birthday
a national holiday.

We are not ready to accept formal memberships or take tithes,
but any of you with other questions can contact Deacon Russell.


Yours in the quest for eternal life,

Max

For PR reasons, might it not be a good idea for the Church to have a 
different name?  Church of the Future, say?  Church of the Promise to
Come?  Church of Human Potential?  Extropy is a philosophy, not a 
religion, and it will be annoying to have Church of Extropy cited in
debate.

Dost thou question the divine word of His Humble Yet Hortatorial Holiness 
Maximus More?  In the name of all that is noble and sacrosanct in our 
sacred sect, I beseech of all ye True Believers to cast this infidel from 
our divine ranks.

April is a month of true beginnings and ultimate decisiveness.  Let all 
Fools be segregated from the flock, and all of the Chosen be brought to the 
Path of Righteousness.

In the recent past I have seen two references to a great war by two parties
that I think worth a 2nd look. Are they simply depressive or are they
visionary?
===========================================================
Discovery Today Video Discovery Today Video (real player)
http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/videos/hugo_discovery_today.ram
Here we have Hugo de Garis of ex-Brainbuilder project who's frightened
and grieving ahead of WW III (literally).
He's invented the protagonists in the subject line.
===========================================================
and here, at Johm Archibald Wheeler's 90th Birthday bash...
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/26/science/26COSM.html
...<At the end of the weekend, Dr. Wheeler pronounced himself pleased and
optimistic, sort of. It was "marvelous to see the creativity of this
congregation," he said. Yet, he said he felt "in his bones," that by the
year 2050, "we will have seen the greatest war in the history of the world."

The job then will be to put things back together. After being surrounded by
all this brilliance, Dr. Wheeler said, "I am convinced that we can."
>....
=====================================

It seems that the folk on this list and others are the likely embryonic
cosmists.
Doesn't it mean access/equity for all in the _potential_ boon to come?
Doesn't it mean defusing fears of the post singularity creatures to
come....which will be far more confronting that mere skin colour or
ethnicity?
The job of ensuring post-singularity humanity's (whatever it is afterwards)
seems to be ours. Yes, we'll get lots of wonderful rights - and here's the
big responsibility to go with it.

I vote we skip WW III. I'm not sure I want my kids or grandkids to have to
fight it. As my ol' grandaddy said " *p'ttoheyy*.....*spittoon dong* don't
bother with death, Colin, there's no future in it".

I presume this topic has been done before. I'm just wondering what the
feeling is now.

I have to agree with CurtAdams.

Church of Extropy = too much explaining to do
Church of the Future = head in clouds
Church of the Promise to Come = same as current religions 

"Church of Human Potential"

sounds good. Simple. Says what it does. Does what it says.
It also lets other post/transhumanists groups deal with it without
directly dealing with the extropian philosophy.

This was an idea, not a coded-out algorithm.  But, if you want, here's a
very basic code translation (probably missing a lot of details).  Better
versions can probably be had at the sites already mentioned.

# put initialization (from genetics) here

while (1) { # to the end of time
   # need to add in a process to check for cell death
   for (my $i = 0;$i < $numOfNodes;$i++) {
     evaluateNode[$i];
   }
   for (my $i = 0;$i < $numOfNodes;$i++) {
     for (my $j = 0;$j < $numOfNodes;$j++) {
       if ((rand($hugeNum) <= 1) && (arePhysicallyClose($i,$j))) {
         # check for random/"imagination"
         verySlightlyAdjustNode[$i];
       }
     }
   }
   # need to add loop to reflect whole-brain altering things like
   # cocaine, alcohol, sugar (in sugar rush amounts), etc.
}

sub evaluateNode {
   my $node = shift(@_);
   $fired[$node] = 0;
   if ($dead[$node]) {
     $excitation[$node] = 0;
     return;
   }
   my $excitationLevel = $excitation[$node];
   for (my $otherNode = 0;$otherNode < $numOfNodes;$otherNode++) {
     next if ($otherNode == $node);
     if ($fired[$node]) {
       $excitationLevel += $weight[$node][$otherNode];
       $potential[$node][$otherNode] += $firingIncreaseAmount;
       if ($potential[$node][$otherNode] >= $synapseThreshold) {
         # maybe adjust this to track individual synapses, instead of
         # lumping all synapses together in a block
         $potential[$node][$otherNode] = $potential[$node][$otherNode]/2;
         $weight[$node][$otherNode] = $weight[$node][$otherNode] * 2;
       }
     } else {
       $potential[$node][$otherNode] =
         $potential[$node][$otherNode]/$decayFactor;
       # $decayFactor is probably very small, to reflect that decays
       # are re-evaluated on every potential firing
     }
     $excitationLevel = $excitationLevel/$excitationDecayFactor;
     if ($excitationLevel >= $firingThreshold) {
       $fired[$node] = 1;
       $excitation[$node] = 0;
     } else {
       $excitation[$node] = $excitationLevel;
     }
   }
}

A good idea.  If you can't beat them, join them, or something like

While channel surfing I happened to catch part of an old
Vincent Price movie last night and was shocked and delighted to
learned that he was evidently the person who coined the term
bwaahahahahhahahahahaaa.  Or is that a phrase?  In
any case, that is the first place I know of that the universal
mad-scientist evil laugh was used, so the evil laugh contest
we had at my place during Extro5 was actually then a
Vincent Price impersonation?

Does anyone know of a pre-Price use of bwaaahahahahaaa?

He probably found out that business lobbies have paid off the elected
officials in order to import foreign labor, thus greatly reducing
available jobs for new computer science grads, except those with good

Think pre-med or pre-law.  Nowadays that could be any degree....
They seem to be the only professions with enough organizational power

I can't figure out how to join the extropy.org team, it doesn't even show

Help? Anyone?

Well, when I have thought about founding a transhuman 
progressive religion the name I toyed with was
"Church of the Fulfillment".  I picked that because increasing 
extropy can lead to the fulfillment in reality of almost all of 
the things promised in religion.  Not in some mystical realm but 
here.

No, but I enjoyed Price's TV endorsement for a credit card in the late
80s- it showed a zapper crackling away, and ol' Vincent chortling with
glee- then his *wife* joins him on camera and says, "Ever since Vincent
retired, purchases like this have kept him happy," or words to that
effect.  Hysterical.  In the photo you can see how thrilled she isn't.

with first use, in my novel THE JUDAS MANDALA (which also uses the terms
`transhuman' and `matrix', and has an Omega end-of-time god thing, blah
blah) which came out from Pocket Books in NY in 1982. Publication had been
delayed for years, although a chunk did appear (as `Growing Up') in the
short-lived sf zine GALILEO vol 1 no 1 in 1976, republished in my anthology
THE ZEITGEIST MACHINE (Oz: A&R, 1977).

So it goes.

The slides for C. Elegans are there.  Much smaller and simpler, and i
think there's almost no way it will be done in under 8 months.  (Even
the physics simulation of the external world and body in the fly's case
would take much, much longer than that.  How is the virtual fly meant to
recognise the virtual jam for what it is? are you suggesting hardcoding
a symbolic 'this is jam' -> 'jam activates neurons 34 to 102' in which
case jam-analogues that would excite the real fly would not excite the
virtual fly, or are you going to simulate jam's molecular chemistry and
fly's receptor, in which case your computational needs just jumped by a
fair bit i imagine.  Even in the C.Elegans case, i think this would be
harder than the neuronal simulation)

I recognize the sheet music industry was in decline before photocopiers.
Fewer high school students are choosing to take up music.  There are
ever more good alternatives.  Copiers merely contributed to a trend.

Copyright law as it applied to recording has been universally ignored
as long as I have been around.  As a teenager I was in a band and even
made some money, but I never took it seriously as a means of making
a living.  People recorded us in every gig, we didnt care.  I did get
some great funny stories out of the deal.

But this does bring up an interesting side thread.  More and more,
the attempt to protect media from copy is making the information
less accessible.  As Eliezer pointed out, text on dead trees is not
so much information as a picture of information.

Soft copy text can have hyperlinks.  It is getting difficult to
write without those, isnt it?  {8-]  Within 10 years, I predict
that the lack of hyperlinking capability on paper text will
cause that medium to become practically obsolete.  Watch
the book industry implode by 2012.  I dont know how
professional authors will copy protect their work.  Lee
Daniel, would you go into that as a means of making a
living?  Now?

Today, when I invest the ever more valuable resource of time into
the written word, I want a soft copy of that material so I can
search it later.  Books do not lend themselves to this very
easily.  I still consider it stealing to reproduce copyrighted
material for others, but I deal with this by choosing carefully
what I read and listen to.

For instance, I rip my own CDs onto my MP3 player but do
not email the files.  Since I became aware of the issues of artists and
writers work being copied, I have become very reluctant to
spend much time reading copyrighted material.  I respect the
author's copyright, but now I purchase less than 10% the number
of books I once did.  The web is filled with non-copyrighted
material of which I can get a soft copy, which is far more
valuable to me anyway.  I foresee the day, soon, when we
will carry our libraries around with us, on a palm-pilot like
device.  

I have purchased exactly two hardbound books in the last
12 months (both of them written by Damien Broderick).  
I used to buy average 30 to 50 books a year.

I see no moral dilemma in any of this.  If one believes copyright
is a good thing, then either buy the books or dont read them.
There are plenty of alternatives.  Music is easy for me: I dont
particularly care for the latest stuff.  There are *some* advantages
to being old.  spike

A very clear-eyed and admirable choice, sirrah, and one I can only applaud!
But if anyone wishes to buy soft text by me and see me paid (as
hard-working author), they can buy a number of sf works of mine from
Fictionwise.com (I'd recommend THE DREAMING)--and I believe Tor offers a
download/searchable edition of THE SPIKE as well.

Some links for anyone curious can be found at

(As Buffy said last night to another Spike: you didn't think I was just
going to let that *sit* there, did you?)

Yeah. I have spent serious time looking in detail at the innter workings of
human neurons, purely from the point of view of deriving the computational
equivalent on my own. A neuron is a beautiful, enormous city of operations.
Garbage department, power plant, central government, local councils,
roadways, bridges, repair crews. Incredible.

When I then went and looked at all the ANN models, I couldn't believe how
far off in the weeds they all were.

It's a really interesting situation. There's a level of interpretation where
you see the computational intent. Assume/simplify more and you get a watered
down, not very clever NN model. Go further into it, and you start to
simulate the electrochemical workings directly, and bury the intent in
complexity, really losing the plot. I don't think the fastest mega computer
on the planet could simulate the entire workings of even 1 neuron, let alone
a brain-full.

It's a question of knowing what to ignore. After 20 years of musing and then
months busting my brain on it, the 10 point cook's tour of the big issues
that I arrived at:

1) The key currency in a neuron is charge, not potential, although they are
related. It's charge manipulation that is actually going on, from which
potentials can be seen. A neuron is a leaky membrane bag filled with charge.
In varying-density/type clusters over the surface are 'windows' to control
charge flows through the membrane (in and out). It's like a 3D mexican wave
of windows, guiding charge to the destination. The niftiest doors (down the
axons) are like time delayed double-glazing! At this level, you really need
to model it with flow dynamics or Maxwells equations (arrrgghhh!!). Charge
flows in all directions, not just towards the axon hillock. In complex
dendrite systems, you can even get 'firings' in the dendrite structure (eg
purkinje).
2) Parallelism rules. The order of execution of the individual neuron models
in an overall NN application is critical. Synchrony is the key word. Leaving
any PC operating system to sort it out for you and you're dead. Not dead.
You'll end up with a greyed out version of what you'd think it should be. It
just won't work very well. Think old age. 99% of the NN models in the world
are kind of senile.
3) The glial cells, combined with electro-chemistry _outside_ the neurons
plays a pivotal role in learning, based on specific behaviour in 2). It's
what everybody has been ignoring (ie what's _not_ a neuron) that sorts out
learning. Individual weights are adjusted, full time, depending on their
instantaneous role in whatever activation regime is happening. Check out
this, -hot from Mr Bradbury-: recent post "SCIENCE: progress on various
fronts", down the bottom. Typical of what's coming out of labs in the last 6
months.
4) It appears like there's a huge number of physical types of neurons. The
zoo of dendrite/synapse types alone is phenomenal. However, when you look at
it in detail, this begins to dissappear. As far as I can tell, there appears
to be only 2 basic flavours of neurons needed, say, type I and type II and
the closer you get to sensing, the more type I is needed. The brain,
however, uses the same basic neurons and simply ignores the difference
between I and II, as far as I can tell. It didn't invent a new neuron, it
just uses the bits it needs and it has heaps of them to spare. The type I
neuron is there to allow spatio-temporal invariance during property
extraction. Eg if I talk faster, you can still decode it the same.
5) Numerical 1D, 2D and 3D power spectral density (fourier transforms, kind
of) are everywhere in the audio and visual sensory decoding.
6) The brain stores nothing. As in no _thing_. It doesn't have to.
7) Short term memory, long term memory and the learning process are based on
the same synapse creation/alteration system, tuned up by appropriate
chemistry and interconnects. The 'leaky membrane' part of the process is
useful in the 'spatio-temporal invariance' that I mentioned above. Otherwise
it plays no part in memory.
8) The brain is entirely models of reality that transduce to a common
currency in the thalmocortical area, which any sensory model and any
internal belief model may interact. Left un-cordinated and purple could
smell like dogshit or hope could feel like your left nipple was on fire. for
example. :-) Yes I'm crude, sometimes. :-)
9) The subjective experiential side of the mind results from symbol
allocation in the models.
10) Consciousness results from the structural re-entrancy and co-ordination
of the models. The way and rate at which the models are executed and
interact.
11) Bonus stop off. Past, present and future are all models, Goals (Desires)
are models of future events created from interacting with belief models.
Intent is a selection from the goal models activated in the present to cause
goals to happen, and past is models of goals completed, which includes the
sensory events at the time, as necessary.

When you look at the brain at the computational equivalence level and get it
right, the brain is like a sea of uniformity, as far as I can tell. All the
same neurons, all models. Simplicity in the midst of a maze of complexity.

I'd be interested in anyone elses musings on this kind of thing. Maybe off
list. My Easter de-lurk is now complete. Back to the real world.

cheers

That is an interesting statistic.  I probably a book a week
or so even today; in fact I've bought about 8 in March (sorry,
Damien, none of yours; but I already have Spike in hardback
and White Abacus in paperback).  I don't know if that will
change if technology does.  Maybe it will.  But it is
evidence that there is still value in things other than the

Good.  I was hoping it was an April Fools gag.  Talk about having to fend

Exactly.  Lawyers are like cops.  Nobody likes them until they need one.  
California has the highest number of lawyers per capita of anyplace in the 
world.  And, recent highly publicized law firm layoffs notwithstanding, very 
few of them go wanting for work for very long.  The "cancer," if you will, 
is our litigious society, not the lawyers or their number.  Blaming 
litigiousness on lawyers is like blaming forest fires on firefighters.  
Lawyers can't litigate with having clients (most of whom are *not* lawyers) 
who are involved in litigation.

You got me pants down ;-)

A rough idea is:
dream up a simple function for jam-smell-molecule concentration in the air, 
maybe:

smell = k * 1/(distance^2)

then take the relevant input neurons and determine how to let them get 
excited. Just how that happens I don't know yet because I don't know how and 
how long a molecule excites a receptor neuron. I guess I'll have to figure 
that out for C.Elegans ASAP since a few hours ago I commited to Eugene Leitl 
for this challenge.

The sentence: 'this is jam' -> 'jam **activates** neurons 34 to 102' doesn't 
make too much sense in an Amygdala network. Amygdala has neuron IDs, of 
course. An Amygdala neuron gets spike input from other neurons, the 
**timing** of which determines whether it will fire or not (sending out a 
spike). I don't know if this integrate and fire type of neurons is good 
enough a model (Penrose says NO), but I think it is. Your sentence make sense 
if you think about spike rate neurons. This is definitelly not enough because 
spike rate is not a very important measure (except for motor neurons and 
such). There is no way to get a C.Elegans simulation with SNNS or PDP++.

I LOVE books!  I have been utterly nuts about them since 
pre-school.  So much so I used to hoard the best books in school 
lest I not be able to access them when I needed them. <not 
appreciated>  I am one of Amazon's best customers.  I read 
usually 2-3 books or the equivalent a week.  Sometimes it is 
hard to keep track because I may have up to 9 or 10 open that I 
am reading from.  I've averaged a book a week or better since I 
was 8 or 9.

But I am a convert to digital books.  I read entire books on my 
Compaq IPAQ and have been known to do the same on a Palm (more 
painful until recently).  I love the feel of regular books 
EXCEPT that I have had to pack half of a large moving truck with 
all my paper books one time too often.  And I always want some 
book or other when I am away from my collection and haven't put 
it in my backpack.  And I get tired of the linear nature of 
conventional books with only as much lookup as they thought to 
put in the index or that I can simulate with hyper-skimming. 
Some of the e-book readers allow multiple bookmarks, notes, keep 
track of how far I've read in each book in my collection and so 
on. If I could I would cheerfully convert my entire library 
except a few collector quality volumes into electronic form.  I 
especially wish all my reference books were online and 
preferably in a form I could mark up with html to get linking 
and so on.

Books ideally should be input devices of 
information/entertainment and auxillary (to your brain) storage 
of the same.  Physical paper books just aren't the most 
efficient form for satisfying those needs.

No, the labor lobbies have paid off elected officials in order to
prevent the free movement of goods and labor, protecting highly paid
union jobs at the expense of many more non-protected jobs and all
consumers.

Yeah, the primary determinant of one's success is the level of
competition from "foreigners".  That's why high school dropouts aren't
making top dollar at McDonald's, it's that damned importation of foreign
fast food workers.

Here's to hoping that doctors do face increased competition in the near
future, whether from immigrants or from teleoperating doctors in India
or wherever.

BTW, I'm surprised nobody mentioned the business or related (e.g., econ)
degree.  Such should allow one to obtain a job that involves some mix of
helping and interacting with people, using analytical skills, and fairly
rapid feedback.

The labor lobbies ATTEMPT to elect GUARDIANS to PROTECT the place of
business (America) that they (and their ancestors) have established
and nurtured with their taxes and the blood of their ancestors, lo,
these many years....  

In years past, when those guardians betrayed them, they on ocassion,
hung those guardians from convenient trees and lampposts,all the while
taunting them and splashing their empurpled visages with all manner of
vile excreta.  They seem to have forgotten that lately....

If a business finds a way to (legally) virtually eliminate (or greatly
reduce) competition from other businesses in its particular field of
expertise, what do you think will happen to its stock price?
How about an established business making a good profit in the area of
its expertise, where barriers to entry for new business startups in
that particular area have suddenly been greatly reduced, thus ensuring
a flood of new competitors? In which direction will its stock price
go?

Not that I really expect you to answer rationally: you speak from
dogma--in this area.  This particular area you have reserved as a
"Logic-Free Zone." Rationality is not applicable to concepts in this
area--for you.  Logic is still applicable to OTHER areas for you. You
can still solve a word puzzle, etc.  But certain areas, such as the
aforementioned, are off limits for the application of your well-honed
logic skills. You are a True Human Critter....

>Here's to hoping that doctors do face increased competition in the near

>or wherever.

I hope so, too.  You see, I, and EVERYONE else in America, have much
to gain should such a series of events occur.  Each and every one of
us inhabit, and are totally dependent upon, frail biological shells.

However, if the job market for computer science grads is flooded by
foreigners, I, and maybe 95% of Americans, have maybe a little to
gain.  And 5% of Americans (programmers, engineers etc) have a lot to
lose.  Ever heard of the Social Contract, the contract you have with
your "Fellow Citizens"?  I thought not....

That is why I support building and maintaining free medical schools
overseas, and allowing any grads of those schools to emigrate to the
USA.  

Not surprisingly, you, and virtually everyone else in America, have
never heard of such an outlandish idea. That is because the organized
lobby of doctors control -- to a great extent -- the public "debate"
in this area.

Hello,

You should be able to :

-- download the client program for your operating system at
   http://folding.stanford.edu/download.html

-- install it on your machine, then configure it by giving an
   arbitrary user name and giving the team id 346 (= Holy Church of
   Extropy)

-- after one work unit is completed or so (about one day of
   computing), your user name will appear in the list at
   http://folding.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/teampage?q=346

At least I did just these steps yesterday and it worked fine, in fact
I never thought that evaluating the equilibrium thermodynamics of GNRA
hairpin via replica exchange stochastic dynamics would be that easy. ;-)

Nanotech Might Cut Solarcell Costs
Berkeley - Apr 1, 2002

University of California, Berkeley, chemists have found a way to make
cheap plastic solar cells flexible enough to paint onto any surface and
potentially able to provide electricity for wearable electronics or
other low-power devices.

[April Fool's not???]

Slashdot has an interesting discussion about the trojan horse
in the Kaaza music downloading software here:

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/04/02/0417208&mode=thread&tid=158

Related CNET story:

(Also dated April 1st...)

Of interest (if accurate) is their EULA:

> 4(b) You hereby grant BDE the right to access and use the unused computing
> power and storage space on your computer/s and/or internet

This would have caught someone like me who generally doesn't
read the EULA's very closely.

Apparently its also a pain to remove the program once installed.

More importantly its a strong case in point about how private
companies acting in their own self-interest could disseminate
the vehicle for the development of rogue AIs.  All it would
take is hacking BDE's communication protocols and you have
millions of computers at your disposal.

Not good.  *Really* not good.  I'd like to have Harvey confirm
whether or not this is "real".  (Even if it isn't, its worth
considering that it could be.)

Actually, I must amend that statement.  A certain percentage of
American citizens have more than a little to gain from having job
market for computer science grads flooded by foreigners. A certain
(small) percentage of Americans benefit a lot because they derive
their livelihood, directly or indirectly, from the purchasing (in one
form or another) of labor of engineers and programmers. In fact, these
people are in large part the faction that has accomplished said
flooding.

It is an april fools, check the "cnet" URL. But a plausible one.

Now that it's been suggested, I give it six months or less until someone's
on this -- it's an obvious source of revenue with little extra work on any
one of five or six existing p2p platforms. This could be the way in which
those failed processing farm business models actually work. Piggyback off
entertainment software, which harks back to my discussion last month on
virtual nations rising out of MMORPGs.

Did I mention that someone wants to make use of some of my (game) AI stuff
in a porn-focused MMOG? That'll be interesting...and I take back some of the
dubiousness I voiced to whoever it was trumpeted sex as the way forward.
Heh.

I was just minutes behind you Randy.  Though I don't think
I'd use the word "disasterbation" to describe it... :-)

Now, before nearly everyone starts complaining ... try to think
rationally and productively on this topic (so we have answers).

e.g.:
> Major increases in human longevity could also be disruptive, he fears, because
> "life extension will wreak havoc with most existing age-graded hierarchies,"
> postponing social change in countries with aging dictators and thwarting
> innovation in others.

Isn't he denying the strength of his own political arguments here?
If the drive is towards liberal democracy, then presumably we should
not have "aging dictators".  And most studies show that innovation
tends to be made mostly by people in their 20's or perhaps 30's.
A different type of creativity can be developed if one lives long
enough to develop significant experience in multiple fields
(take my experience in computer science and biotechnology for
example).

I don't see the preservation of "age-graded" hierarchies as being
a strong argument unless there is more to it.  If he is talking
about the upset this causes to social security/pension systems,
presumably those get solved by nanotech (though I doubt
Fukuyama is aware of that).

Unless his argument is deeper than what is quoted I don't think
it can hold water.

Now, there is some meat for consideration:
> But the most serious threat to the stability of human societies is genetic
> engineering that may alter, by design or inadvertence, the special balance of
> contrarieties of human nature.

I think the current scientific debate on cloning shows "reasonable"
consideration for the risks it poses (my recent work suggests to me
that until you can do whole genome sequencing on developing embryos
there will be significant risks of producing "defective" copies and
as a consequence reproductive cloning of humans will remain very
questionable morally).  Not enough is known about the genetics of
"human nature" to know whether genetic tinkering would corrupt it.

What is first needed is to identify those disruptions of human nature
that could indeed pose a threat to society.  For example, we need
serious studies searching for alleles that lead to criminal, violent
or other sociopathic behaviors.  Presumably it is reasonable
for society to prohibit individuals seeking to modify themselves or
their children in these directions.  While increased aggression might
be useful for sports competition, it is a trait of questionable value
in a densly populated society.  On the other hand one may wish to
allow modifications that increase ones intelligence even if it
increases your sensitivity to pain.

We need careful and reasonable thought here -- not ranting about
the individual liberties we naturally have or should be granted
by society.

I thought the NY Times bringing up the concept of "posthumans"
a good thing.

Robert

Nope, it's true. I read that in the EULA when I installed the program, but
figured long before they figure out what to do with it I'll have gotten bored
and uninstalled it.

Except that paying a lawyer hundreds of bucks an hour to do his job is
legal, which is why they are so much easier to find. It's illegal to pay
a cop this much to do his job, which is why they are never around and
take too long to show up.

No, firefighters don't initiate fires, they only put them out. Your
statement would only be true if lawyers only represented defendants and
not plaintiffs.

> who are involved in litigation.

Untrue on your last point. Plenty of lawyers create lawsuits then go
looking for clients (i.e. the Erin Brokovich strategy, pioneered by
Ralph Nader).

The only reason we need lawyers today is because there are people
willing to sit on a jury and be conned that acts like fraud, theft,
assault, murder, etc are not really crimes or torts. The degree to which
societies need lawyers is directly proportionate to how badly such
societies (or its constituent members) have lost their moral/ethical
compass.

people get conservative in their decisions and willingness to take risk
because they a) don't have anything to fall back on, and b) are
generally physiologically unable to start over from scratch in a
competetive and demanding job market. With the sort of age ameliorating
technologies we forsee, this will not result in a greater degree of
conservatism as the population ages, but a greater willingness to take
greater risk for longer into one's life, thus leading to a more
speculative and dynamic economy.

Similarly, aging dictators will have more time to come to the
realization that they can be forces for good without having to send
one's opponents out to the firing squads.

The real threat that aging poses is those who are unable or unwilling to
make the shift from Aresian to Athenian thinking (using the analogies
used in Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon"). I think, though, that such
individuals will die out. If they embrace anti-aging technologies for
themselves but retain a general abhorrence for technology and liberty,
they will eventually undermine their own credibility within their
juntas.

Listen, I'm no plaintiff's lawyer, in fact quite the opposite.  But the fact 
of the matter is that the great majority of Americans favor a legal system 
wherein individuals are allowed to seek redress for their injuries caused by 
others in civil courts of law.  Granted the plaintiff's bar benefits as much 
as their clients many times.  But, hey, nobody wants to work for free.  And, 
believe me, litigation is *work*.

Your post leads me to believe that you don't have much real world experience 
with the world of civil litigation.  For instance what do you mean by the 
"erosion of contract law?"  I've been practicing law for well over a decade 
now and have yet to see anything like "erosion" in the law of contracts.  
Perhaps you could eloborate.

>A tort reform, and institution of a "loser pays the legal costs" rule,

In California that *is* the rule.  You lose, you pay the other side's costs. 
  In several instances those costs also include attorney's fees.

Be interesting to see where it all goes, even if the company is steaming
merrily along to be clouted by someone who treats their customers better.
You actually have the inklings of a micropay/barter system here with enough
users to really make a go of it. People pay for what they download in
processor time -- zap, simple, uses what you have, huge userbase to build
on, none of this messing around with annoying intermediaries like money for
anything other than a yardstick.

I didn't mention it for 2 reasons: 
1) An undergraduate degree in business/econ doesn't open many
doors.  You need an MBA or econ PhD for that.  If  you're good
your degree doesn't matter - but then your degree doesn't matter.

2) I think business operations are very abstract with a long feedback
time to see benefits.  Lower level jobs have a lot of paper pushing.
Higher level jobs have a lot of planning - which can be fun but you
often never know whether you made the right decision - no control
group.  And, especially  in larger companies, benefits are spread
over a large # of people  and you don't get to experience them 
directly.

Well of course it can't hold water but that doesn't mean ideas such as this
can't have a profound influence, just look at religion. So we have yet
another bioethicists, a man by definition far more ethical than you or me,
suddenly discovering that future developments in science will lead to
profound changes in human beings, well thanks for the news flash Mr.
Fukuyama. He figures people will live longer, probably much longer, and they
could get more intelligent too and that would for the first time change
human nature. All this might lead to social problems
and he can't think of a immediate and simple solution to these problems.
Thus this great moral philosopher has concluded that things should to
regulated by government so people remain stupid and die when nature (that is
Mr. Fukuyama) thinks they should. I said it before I'll say it again,
bioethicists are the lowest form of human life.

Contract law has been eroded to some extent by allowing social
considerations to modify post-hoc the interpretation of the contract. In the
legal theories (I'd need to ask my wife for the names of their proponents)
which lead to extending the application of tort law to what used to be
contracts, the "socially disadvantaged" or the "consumers" are to be
protected over and above (sometimes despite) the language of a contract, by
the threat of huge damages to be paid by the "rich corporations". In
practice, the legal costs are shifted to consumers, good people lose work
(as in the Corning breast implant debacle), innovation is stifled - too high
a cost for incremental changes in safety.

I would be surprised if the uninstaller program actually removed the
spyware - I'm pretty sure that it will remain lurking in the system,
unless you go hunting in the registry and delete some obscure keys.

Taming High-Tech Particles. Cautious steps into the nanotech future.
Richard Smalley's lab at Rice University wrapped carbon nanotubes in
the polymer polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Scientists are seeking
water-soluble nanostructures for biomedical uses, such as drug
delivery. Yet making the nanostructures water soluble could permit
them to move easily though the environment. There is more to this
article. (Science News 3/30/02)

New MIT Nanomaterial Could Slide Into Future Soap And Beyond. A new
designer nanomaterial, created by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology researchers and described in the April 2 online edition of
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, acts like the
main ingredient in soaps, shampoos and detergents. This biological
substance may represent a big improvement over chemicals commonly
used in the multibillion-dollar detergent industry.

Spiders Put A New Spin On Nanotech Industry. It's spring and the
spiders are coming - on the big screen and in small tech. In Sony
Pictures' "Spider-Man," which will be released next month, geeky
Peter Parker gets bitten by a genetically altered spider and becomes
a superhero who can cling to any surface. The web slinger in the red
suit is science fiction, but not so far-fetched is the idea of using
spiders' handiwork as natural-world inspiration for how to make
better nanomaterials. (Small Times 4/2/02)

Nanocrystals' trapped atoms technology studied at Oak Ridge Labs. A
whole new technology awaits exploration with the discovery of a
technique for trapping single atoms, say scientists at the Department
of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). ORNL's Mike Barnes,
Thomas Thundat and Adosh Mehta have collaborated with Ramesh Bhargava
of Nanocrystals Technology in Briarcliff, N.Y., to cage single
europium atoms in nanocrystals not much larger than the atoms
themselves.

Nanobots are not smart...yet. In a talk that was equal parts humor,
speculation and up-to-date research, the director of the University
of Southern California's Laboratory for Molecular Robotics discussed
the endless possibilities of nanoresearch. Citing health care as an
enormous area for applications of nanotechnology, Requicha predicted
a future in which our natural defenses are bolstered by technology.
"You might be able to detect pathogens very early and have millions
of these (man-made) organisms in your body happily replicating. You'd

Magnetism to its lowest terms. While an ideal infinite chain of atoms
cannot sustain ferromagnetic order at nonzero temperature, an
international team of physicists shows that the finite length of the
chains and magnetic anisotropy barriers stabilize ferromagnetism at
finite temperatures in monatomic cobalt chains. The persistence of
ferromagnetism in monatomic chains has important consequences for the
design and properties of magnetic nanostructures, a very active field
of physical research and development today. (Max Planck Society

British Law Would Make Organ Donation Automatic Upon Death. People
should have their organs automatically removed for transplants after
they die unless they had expressed objections when alive, according
to a Bill to go before the Commons today. The 10-minute rule Bill,

Scientist wires his nervous system to computer. A British robotics
scientist has wired up his nervous system to a computer in an
experiment he hopes will eventually give paralyzed people more
control over their own bodies. Kevin Warwick, professor of
cybernetics at Reading University in southern England, has had minute
sensors implanted in the main nerve in his left arm and hooked up to
a radio transceiver that will send and receive messages from a
computer. "We have a serious goal, a very medical goal of helping
people with spinal injuries and the like where there is a break in

Self-configuring array enables atomic-scale fabrication. A
next-generation configurable circuit architecture is being proposed
by a group of designers at startup Cell Matrix Corp. The company is

Lab-grown fish chunks could feed astronauts. Cooking up ways to feed
explorers on long trips in space, scientists have coaxed chunks of
fish meat to grow in the laboratory. The technique could lead to the
production of copious amounts of protein for consumption without the

We are in the process of converting my entire libary to scanned images
(.pdf).
We run our scanner day and night, and my entire science magazine collection
going back to 1966 is slowing
being reincarnated on the 1 TB raid.

The problem is no one wants to proof millions of pages if we ever OCR all of
this stuff.

My office used to consist of floor to ceiling periodicals and books and
papers. The reduction in volume converting
all that paper to electronic format is wonderful, and my students can still
look stuff up in the office.

I am less thrilled about doing recreational reading electonically, I guess
because my entire life is being
overtaken by electronic displays...

I LOVE books!  I have been utterly nuts about them since
pre-school.  So much so I used to hoard the best books in school
lest I not be able to access them when I needed them. <not
appreciated>  I am one of Amazon's best customers.  I read
usually 2-3 books or the equivalent a week.  Sometimes it is
hard to keep track because I may have up to 9 or 10 open that I
am reading from.  I've averaged a book a week or better since I
was 8 or 9.

But I am a convert to digital books.  I read entire books on my
Compaq IPAQ and have been known to do the same on a Palm (more
painful until recently).  I love the feel of regular books
EXCEPT that I have had to pack half of a large moving truck with
all my paper books one time too often.  And I always want some
book or other when I am away from my collection and haven't put
it in my backpack.  And I get tired of the linear nature of
conventional books with only as much lookup as they thought to
put in the index or that I can simulate with hyper-skimming.
Some of the e-book readers allow multiple bookmarks, notes, keep
track of how far I've read in each book in my collection and so
on. If I could I would cheerfully convert my entire library
except a few collector quality volumes into electronic form.  I
especially wish all my reference books were online and
preferably in a form I could mark up with html to get linking
and so on.

Books ideally should be input devices of
information/entertainment and auxillary (to your brain) storage
of the same.  Physical paper books just aren't the most
efficient form for satisfying those needs.

Before I leave for a trip for a day or two, I want to be sure that 
yesterday's April Fool's gag is clear to all.

The Church of Extropy post that appeared apparently from me on April 1 was 
a fake. It also was *not* from me, but from Lee Daniel Crocker. If you 
examine the headers you can see the "piclab" domain that LDC uses. LDC said 
he would fess up today, but I want to be sure that any confusion is 
dispersed before I leave.

A good gag, I thought, so I kept quiet for April 1.

I was a bit disturbed by the number of people thinking this was a *good 
idea*! To those folks -- please read the Extropian Principles to see why 
extropian ideas are utterly unsuited to a religion.

I highly approve of April Fool's as a cultural institution. It shows why 
critical thinking is important. And it shows that you have to be a wee bit 
cautious in assuming that an email is from who it appears to be from.

Onward!

Max

Yes, some of it does do that. Ad-Aware works well for

hunt through the registry yourself.

Jared Diamond asks whether agriculture was worth it:

http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/anthro/learning/lifeways/hg_ag/worst_mistake.html

>From my perspective, of course, it doesn't matter much whether agriculture
was worth it; the history of life on Earth is divided into pre- and
post-Singularity, not pre- and post- agriculture; you have to expect that
life on pre-Singularity Earth is going to suck.  Others may accuse Jared of
Luddism, but like it or not, we're waaaay out of our ancestral environment;
and regardless of whether it's worth it from a personal perspective (it is
from mine; I like knowing stuff), things are going to be weird around here
until we ditch the hunter-gatherer phenotype.  (After that it gets *really*
weird, but we'll be able to cope.)

However, the cumulative costs distributed among consumers who
individually have little to lose far outweigh the cumulative gains made
by protecting those with concentrated interests.  Nearly every stupid
policy can be analyzed in terms of concentrated interests trumping the
general welfare with disastrous results.  If I remember correctly, this
is largely what the field of "public choice" economics is dedicated to
explaining.

> Ever heard of the Social Contract, the contract you have with

How did you know I emerged from a dank cave only yesterday?

Why should the nation be the granularity at which the social contract
applies?  Why not my family, city, state, continent, earth?  Why should
US citizens have an obligation to protect certain US citizens operating
is certain professions?  Shouldn't California citizens, or San Francisco
citizens act in the same manner to protect their fellow citizens? 
Californians were really stupid for allowing me to immigrate from
Illinois and drive down the wages of California computer programmers!

Even if the US (or California, or Santa Clara County, or the city of
Mountain View) completely prevented the immigration of software
engineers, existing citizen software engineers would still face
competition, from those in Sunnyvale, San Mateo County, Texas, Canada,
etc.  Those competitive areas that did let in new engineers would
quickly supplant the closed regions.  The constant influx of engineers
into Silicon Valley and more broadly into the US have helped maintain
SV/US as the most dynamic place for software development.  Contrary to
your expectations software engineers in SV/US command higher salaries
than those in similarly wealthy regions not "suffering" from an influx
of software engineers.

Prevent migration of software engineers to the US and software jobs will
migrate to India, Russia and elsewhere with increasing rapidity.  End
result: fewer US citizen programmers doing less interesting work for
less money.  Ah, to be protected by my wonderful fellow-citizens! 
Praise to the nation-state and the social contract which can only apply
to the nation-state and its citizens!  No strange foreigner's gonna
steal my job and wealth when I and my fellow nation-state citizens can
leech them away ourselves!

I recall some cave paintings several years ago that outlined similar
ideas in response to some healthcare crisis or another.

Please leave the creation of a transhumanist "religion" to David Pizer and Mike Perry! ; ) lol!      

I greatly respect Max More's integrity for not turning his ideas for an ExI into another California new age cult.  Max does alright, but is not a rich man, and he could have been had he gone down that road.  If Rael or L. Ron Hubbard could build extremely successful money making organizations, I sure know Max and Natasha could have.

But could Max and Natasha have lived with themselves when having sold out in such a way?  I admit having mansions all over th globe would be nice, with a Gulfstream jet to go along with it, but could it salve a bothered conscience?  

I can imagine us one day finding an alternate reality out there with an "evil" Max and Natasha who have done these very things!  But what will the good Max and Natasha do then?

best wishes,

Asking whether agriculture was "worth it," even if only from a
consequentialist perspective, is too speculative a question to begin
to answer.  Agriculture was as necessary "way back when" as it is now.

For example, it's quite evident (and Diamond agrees) that peoples who
develop agriculture can pretty much kick any hunter-gatherer society's
collective ass when it comes to direct conflict.

There's more to this fact than the mere point that agricultural
societies can sustain higher birth rates than hunter-gatherer
societies.  There's also the diseases; Diamond points these out, but
he neglects to point out their advantages in war.

When agricultural Europeans came to the Americas, they brought their
diseases with them.  Having faced years of plague, their constitutions
were able to handle anything they encountered in the New World; native
Americans died of stuff that would never kill a European.  The reverse
effect, Europeans dying of native American pathogens, is historically
negligible.

Then, of course, there's the specialization of labor.  Diamond sees
this as essentially a bad move, but once he concedes that agriculture
made modern specialization (as well as, he concludes, the class
system) possible, it's hard to imagine how he'd refute the
"progressive" argument that the B-minor Mass was thanks to
agriculture.  At any rate, _Guns, Germs and Steel_ used this argument
convincingly to suggest that this was the reason the Europeans were
the ones sailing to America on complicated sea-faring vessels, rather
than the other way around.

At any rate, I think that the naive argument that agriculture has made
us better off in *every* way is easily refutable: some pretty bad
things happened as a result of agriculture.  But I don't think Diamond
makes his case that agriculture was, by and large, a bad idea.

Agriculture is a political necessity; not just because we're now
"locked in" after the fact, but because agricultural societies are at
an extreme political advantage over hunter-gatherer societies.  Given
that, you find yourself asking highly impractical questions like:
"Would it be better if agriculture DIDN'T provide a political
advantage?"

I think we've got to conclude that agriculture was as necessary then
as it is now, and that we've got to find some better way to solve our
political, economic, and epidemiological problems than wishing that
nobody had tried to get an advantage or imagining what the world would
be like if agriculture provided no advantage.

It *could* be really cool, there were 1.4 million users connected last night,
and that makes for some hefty processing power, large user base etc., rah rah
rah.

But, you just know that they are going to do something evil and dodgy with it,
because, sigh, that's how the  internet works these days.  Mind you, they are
australian, so if they are *really* evil we can go pay them a visit :)


I'd like to see it fired up into some vast distributed operating system which
the users can make use of, run inferno over it or something, but I suspect my
system will be crippled by some proprietary widget doing god knows what.

A first draft of a new paper, "A Transhumanist Perspective on Genetic 
Enhancements". It's an attempt to begin developing an ethical framework for 
public policy regarding genetic enhancements and, particularly, human 
germ-line genetic engineering. The target audience is professional 
ethicists. (Many of the ethical issues about genesis-choices - i.e. choices 
involving the creation of new persons - are independent of the particular 
technology used, so the genetic case can be used as an example for a more 
general class of problems.)

I think this is relatively well-worn ground in Sociology & Anthropology.
Yes, people were way better off in all kinds of ways as hunter-gatherers,
certainly as compared to the average human possibly even now.

What talk of average standard of living hides, of course, is population
changes. You can't really compare the average standard of living of people
in a post-agriculture world to people in a pre-agriculture world; the
average post-agriculture person would never have existed without
agriculture.

I think this is an extremely significant point. Many people seem to regret
the moves to the post-agriculture (and post-industrial, etc etc) society;
but few of them seem to recognise that they owe their lives to it. Jared
Diamond doesn't seem to, certainly.

Humanity has a history of these leaps. Hunter-gatherers became
horticulturalists, horticulturalists became agriculturalists, who became
industrialised, and on to now. At each stage, we are told that people traded
a lower average standard of living for an order of magnitude increase in
population (except note that there is evidence to suggest that average
standards of living have increased in the last century, bucking the trend).

I have this in mind when thinking about the "population problem". Extropians
often deny that there is a problem, which is maybe slightly misguided;
certainly there is a pressure surrounding the world's current population and
projected growth. Not as much as many sources might have one believe, I
think, but still more than nothing.

I wonder whether this comes from an intuitive support by Extropians for more
people, which is something I fully support. The more I've read about and
thought about the "population problem", the less I've been able to find any
way to justify restriction of population. Go into the "overpopulated" future
and hand-pick 9 of 10 people to remove from existence; that's what a policy
of population restriction does by implication (and it's what Jared Diamond
must be able to do, by extension, in the present, except his ratio is
something like 99 from 100). I guess if you follow a philosophy derived from
humanism, you must come to the conclusion that people (sentients and
potential sentients) are the primary objects in your philosophy. When can
your philosophy direct you to limit their numbers (ie: cause some potential
people to never exist) to achieve some other end? This is what Eliezer
refers to as subgoals stomping on supergoals.

When I think of increasing population, I say Bring it on! Population
pressure drives technological progress, and I do think we may be on the
verge of technologies that can help us escape this gross-pop vs
living-standard tradeoff. Oddly enough, I think that the hunter-gatherer
lifestyle, in an abstract form, would suit libertarians rather well, and
certainly seems to be highly suited to an individualist philosophy (although
bear in mind that hunter-gatherers actually experience a high degree of
social coercion). Maybe we'll re-achieve the high tech version of a h-g
lifestyle; space based lifeforms falling across the universe, hunting matter
and gathering energy.

I'd love to see a world (universe!) where we could increase population by
orders of magnitude, and actually increase the average standard of living as
well. We (humanity) can probably begin doing that within a present human
lifespan; astounding! 

What a stupid time to be deploring agriculture.

(the far-flung future pressure for space-based sentients to band together in
competition for resources, in a loose analogue of the agricultural
revolution, is a subject for another post...)

I can't claim to have any sense of certainty about
this issue, but my ruminations follow this general
path.  Consider the cost factors involved in a
conventional book:  work of author, work of editor,
management and marketing work of publisher, cost of
printing, cost of storage and distribution, cost of
retailer for his store and staff.  Add all these cost
factors together and you get the base cost at the
point of purchase.  Then add the mark-up, and you get
the sale price.  If there is thought to be sufficient
demand at that price for the publisher to give the
green light, then maybe you have a commercially viable
book/item.  

For electronic publishing, materials costs, printing,
storage, and shipping costs, retail shelf space and
sales staff costs are gone.  Costs would seem to be
reduced by a least an order of magnitude, while the
market expands by at least a couple of orders of
magnitude (certainly, the global penetration of the
internet has a ways to go yet before leveling off).
Under these conditions , a book which once sold for
$25 should now be able to generate the same gross
revenue for 2.5 cents, or ten times the revenue for 25
cents.

I got to thinking again, about the business model for
electronic publishing, when, some time back, Damien
posted the following, regarding the possible
electronic publishing of his work: 

"Suppose I e-posted advertisements (somehow/somewhere)
that my latest novel can be downloaded free from one
given server, and asked for a $1 or less tip. Terrible
idea: I need to pay for server space, and the
inundation of hits from my zillion eager fans will
lock up the system and send them to Piers Anthony
paperbacks instead. 

So what if, instead, I use a sort of benign pyramid
scheme:

I send Eliezer, Spike and Robert an attached e-copy of
the 85,000 word novel apiece (after politely inviting
and receiving their request for it). 

Thereafter they can do what they wish with it, but I
ask nicely that if they enjoy the book they send me a
buck (by whatever appropriate means, maybe Paypal) AND
THAT THEY SEND A TEASER TO ANOTHER THREE FRIENDS who 
they judge might care to read it." 

END OF QUOTE

First, why bad-mouth electronic distribution by using
the term "pyramid scheme"?  Don't be ashamed of
marketing.  Marketing by an electronically (ie
internet) mediated distribution system is perfectly
legit.  In fact, it's better than legit, because it's
new tech, exploiting the very purpose of tech, which
is, of course, higher productivity.  Also multi-level
marketing is just SOP. You start out with one
author/editor and you (hopefully) end up with a
multitude of readers.  A branching--ie
multi-level--distribution hierarchy is just a
self-evident connection mechanism.  

As for marketing, conventional publishing presupposes
marketing costs--you pay the publisher for this very
major task.  If you propose--as I infer from the
above--a more decentralized, reader-to-reader,
word-of-mouth method to accomplish the same
end,...hey, it's just another way to get the job done.
 If it works, you're an innovative marketing genius. 
If it doesn't, who cares.  People try new things all
the time.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

Anyway, I thought about Damien's above-proposed
method, and took it a bit further. Reconfigure the
person-to-person/reader-to-reader
marketing/distribution mechanism by PAYING THEM.  That
is, pay a percentage to anyone who generates sales of
your work.  Say, 40 percent for all first level
recommendations, 20 percent for second level
recommendations, ten percent for third level, and so
forth.  If you have to market--and you do--don't shy
away from it and don't let irrational greed mislead
you into thinking that parsimonious is better than
generous.  You want rational greed.  You need the
right balance.  The numbers here are just a
suggestion, what you're looking for is the formula
which gives you the maximum distribution (ie profit)
at the minimum cost.  Good old capitalism.   Use the
profit motive to set up a self-organizing, free-lance,
self-employment, self-empowerment, be-your-own-boss,
for-profit, intellectual property distribution system.
 I will leave it to the software people to confirm
whether or no it is reasonable to hope for a software
system to keep track of all the persons and
percentages involved and collect and distribute the
proceeds accurately.  It goes without saying that we
must have a zero-complexity, bedrock-reliable,
ubiquitous-to-the point-of-invisibility micro payment
system.      

Finally, after sequestering the matter for a certain
period, that it might ponder its fate and role in the
universe in the sanctuary, such as it is, of my
unconscious, it reemerged with a solution to the
thoroughly odious $1 tip/beg-for-payment compensation
method.  

Here's how it came to me.  

I hate pop-up windows.  Hate them.  Wish serious harm
to the spawn of satan responsible for this
abomination. 

When a pop-up window appears on my desktop, I dash my
cursor at light speed to the "kill the abomination"
x-mark in the upper right hand corner of the box. 
Die! vile unbidden interruption, die!  My response is
instantaneous, reflexive, passionate, hyperbolic.

Does anyone else feel this way?

Now suppose, just suppose, that the software which
makes a given piece of writing available for
consumption, presents the first, introductory portion,
in a pure and perfectly conventional free manner. 
Same as now.  Then, after you've settled in for a
pleasant read, a pop-up window appears and occludes
your view.  It is a request for payment.  But it has a
gimmick.  To wit, the payment amount requested is
very, very low, a couple of pennies, a nickle, a dime.
 Genuine chump change.  And that as you sit there,
nose to nose with the pop-up window, the price goes
up.  Two cents to three cents to four cents, etc.  All
you have to do the get on with your reading is to
click a payment confirmation.  The sooner you click,
the sooner you're back doing what you want, which is
to say reading without interruption.  And how much
does it cost you?  An insignificanly small amount. 
Essentially you're paying tolls as you travel down the
information highway.  The period between toll
assessments, and the amounts, can/should be
algorithmically determined so as to maximize profit. 
Or the reader, having reached a decision on a bulk
purchase, can intrude in the automated assessment
process, and make the appropriate payment.

That's my take on the subject.

Best, Jeff Davis

Oh, it's much older than that.  You really have to stretch things to say 
standards of living haven't been improving in England since at least the
late 1600's.  If you're going worldwide, yes, as 
industrialization/commercialization
has really only gotten to the majority of the world's population in the last
half-century.

With agriculture, there's evidence of a deterioration in living standards.
But as Diamond himself points out in Guns, Germs, and Steel, the 
deterioration almost certainly preceded agriculture and agriculture
was a method to get things partway back up.  I've never heard any
claims that horticulture (management of wild plant resources) was
associated with anything bad; those are held up as the "good" 
predecessors to agriculture.  For pre-horticulture you've probably
got to a low plant food diet and that's not good for people.  We need
too much water-soluble vitamins.

Not that I don't agree with the sentiment (I do), but I think its not 
nearly as bad to prevent someone from coming into existence, rather than 
killing them off while they are around.  Of course, going back to a 
pre-agricultural society would entail murder, but I think its a completely 
different story to restrict it now.  Extrinsically bad, yes, for reasons I 
don't think I need to repeat here.  Intrinsically bad, yes, but only 
because you are coercing existing people, not because you are murdering 
unborn people.

Well, yes. Among other weirdnesses. This is what I said in THE LAST MORTAL
GENERATION on that topic, when Dr Hayflick raised it some years ago:

===========
What of Hayflick's cost-benefit analysis based on the prevalence and
persistence of tyrants? Is it a strong argument for throttling the new
science in its cradle? Surely not. If ever I've heard a
cut-off-your-head-to-save-your-face pseudo-argument... this is it. Let us
all die, to save a few from the heinous attacks of murderers? Kill
everyone, by inattention, to spare us from the malevolence of dictators? In
1997, cryonics commentator Tim Freeman made the retort apposite: 

	"Suppose all reasonably free people got an aging prevention treatment
tomorrow. So we'd eliminate the meaningless deaths of millions of talented
and productive people in the US, Europe, places like that, but let's
suppose for the purposes of argument that Saddam Hussein and the like would
stay in power indefinitely, and the conditions of their subjects would be
unchanged forever. Would that be a net win? In my opinion, it would be,
even from a global utilitarian viewpoint instead of the obvious selfish
viewpoint of a US resident."

But is it even likely that the conditions of the oppressed could remain
unchanged forever?  Dictators and other bullies are always with us, for new
monsters readily spring up to replace the old - who are often slain by the
new, in any case. The remedy for death by terror and war is not involuntary
`natural' death for everyone, however peaceful. It is not universal,
DNA-programmed mortality, but political awareness and action. Freeman
added, astutely, `Hayflick wasn't properly weighing the ordinary horror of
aging that strikes the large populations that are not affected by tyrants.
This is a common psychological error - people undervalue ordinary dangers,
and overvalue unusual dangers.'
	We're stuck, at the moment, with death's pain, loss and grief, and must
make as decent a fist of it as we can. But in the longest term of the
history of intelligent life in the universe, it will surely be the case -
tragic, but blessedly brief in comparative duration - that the routine and
inevitable death of conscious beings was a temporary error, quickly corrected.

It is a evil low-down wicked wretched {insert Davisian string

Let me explain my reasoning with this experiment:  Write your
autobiography in 100 words.  Now put hyperlinks in those 100
words with the total number of words in all the links not exceeding
1000.  Now put hyperlinks in the links for a total of 1E4 words.

What you end up with is a document that cannot effectively be
used on paper.  The hyperlinked document isfaaaar more useful,
far more informative, more convenient, cheap, and lets the reader
spend only as much time as necessary to get the facts about
you that she wants.  Being set free from paper is a huge leap.
Once you get used to reading soft copy, you cannot effectively
go back.  You dont want to.

What I expect is to see authors taking the leap into a related
but unique genre of writing novels that cannot be effectively
written on paper.  It becomes a kind of hybrid between a
traditional novel and a text based adventure game.

This all ignores the possibilities of inserting graphics into
text, as well as sound files, odor files and perhaps tactile
files.  We could even imagine specialized hardware that
would allow authors of the future version of the romance
novels to insert orgasm files.  I dont pretend to know how
that would be accomplished, but I would buy one.

I think Damien Broderick is already experimenting with
soft copy hyperlinked novels.  I am eager to see the
result.  I myself am creating documentation of my project
at work that is highly hyperlinked and cannot really be
used without the link capability.

In the latest ish of the Aussie zine THE SKEPTIC (Autumn 2002), it's
mentioned that `American trauma nurse and Rationalist Jan Eisler told the
stunned Conference that most American health insurers now pay a benefit to
Christian Scientist practitioners who *pray* for the recovery of a policy
holder!' (pp. 9-10)

But surely technological advances can improve upon this method. The Church
of Singularity Healing Vibrations of Omega, Inc, will gladly receive
insurance payments on behalf of the many registered ill people who will be
prayed for by a computer program that repeats their name and their request
for healing thousands nay millions of time a second. The Divine Being at
the end of the cosmos--or in 2032, whichever comes first--will reach back
through time and lay soothing sacred healing forces upon these poor sick
people.

Actually, this reminds me more of those funky tibetan prayer wheels.
I've seen wind-powered ones, little petrol-motor driven prayer wheels, etc.

It's real, and it's not new.  Most EULAs give total control over your 
computer to the software company.  Microsoft's agreement gives them 
permission to download and install software onto your system without 
your knowledge.  This is common practice in the industry, but not well 
known.  Even in my security business, I can't get customers interested 
in this stuff.

Cool!  What kind of scanner, process, automation are you using? 
   I did one book the slow way recently and it was no fun at 
all.  Given the volume I assume you have much better going.

This is somewhat silly.  Books are not very big as downloads go. 
  Server space is not that expensive.  Disk space needs are 
minuscule, the transaction could be kept very simple.  There 
would not be much of a problem serving up many thousands of 
copies a day.  A more interesting scheme would be distributing 
the work on a p2p file system.  But even a central server 
adequate to the job would take a reasonable SDSL or better 
connection and a few thousand dollars of hardware and some 
pretty simple server software.  Even easier would be to use one 
of the online store portals with PayPal or some micro-payment 
system tied in.

The problem is that I will be flooded with offers from potential 
sales partners for sundry items.  No thanks.  It is much better 
to have online catalogs where products of various kinds can be 
registered.  This is not that hard to do.  What do you think the 
web stores do?  The code underneath is not that complex at all. 
  New goods would simply be registered in the appropriate 
categories and people could search for type of goods and various 
subcategories and author/originator/manufacturer and so on.

Picture something like a more distributed electronic book 
Amazon.  Author publishes excerpt, blurb, book cover image and 
so on and link to download.  On-line store gives general format, 
search capabilities, payment mechanism, feedback from readers, 
ratings and so on for a small slice of the book earnings or a 
fixed fee.  There is no reason the per book fee need be very 
large, especially if the books are being stored and served up 
elsewhere on the net.

Why "not good" exactly?  Getting to an SI is considered a 
general good, but preferably with more checks and balances 
toward Friendliness.   Several million computers without a 
workable plan of how to acheive a full AI and with the latencies

I do. If you use windows, get the Proxomitron:

http://proxomitron.cjb.net

It's a proxy server that will modify web pages on the fly, removing most
banner-ads and pop-ups, and other 10.000 options (you can add your own).
It's nothing short of wonderful

Though I'm sure you are aware I'm not a 'strong' fan of
the Sysop scenario (with nods towards Eliezer, the
Singularity Institute, et al if I'm munging fine
differences between "friendly" AI's and Sysops),
I think all would agree that an amoral AI could
potentially be *very* bad.  (This isn't too different
from Fukuyama's objection that genetic engineering
might create an amoral human.)

You may be more optimistic than I (and thats generally
a hard position to take).  I expect that the latencies
will go down (I'm moderately certain that there are
bills circulating in the U.S. for fiber-to-home funding).
It becomes a question of whether a "workable plan" can
be implemented to take advantage of the fact that the
much of the required capacity is already installed.

To make it clear -- it looks like BDE has 16.2 million shares
outstanding -- according to the EDGAR 10-KSB:
http://www.edgar-online.com/bin/cobrand/finSys_main.asp?formfilename=0001011438-02-000252&x=29&y=11
At the recent yahoo price of $0.35 / shr (http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BDE&d=t),
you could buy the company outright for less than 6 million dollars.
Assuming that Kazaa is installed on a base of 1 million machines
worth $1000 each -- buying out BDE gives you access to $1 billion
of computing capacity.

I happen to know people to whom $6 million is chump change
and who might look fondly on the idea of a subservient AI 
whose primary purpose is to remake the world the way
they desire it to be.

The point would be that once the license agreement
has been "approved" and the software installed
(some /. comments suggested that you could never
"revoke" the public access to your resources under
the terms of the license agreement) you have sealed
your fate.  So the resources are out there now and they
seem likely to increase.  The bandwidth and computational
capacity seem to be available for whomever develops
a strategy for using those resources effectively.

More importantly -- you cannot rely on the ethics of
the people who have developed such systems not to use
them for purposes such as developing rogue AIs -- you
have to determine whether or not such systems are
indeed "unhackable".  Unless Kazaa/BDE are much
smarter than Microsoft I would argue that that is
a very questionable assumption.

Who was it that said
 "There is no such thing as a free lunch"?

Or, simply ask your readers to share the book whenever they run a
filesharing program.  This eliminates your bandwidth problem, and
effectively every sharer passively recommends your book to anyone who
browses their shared files (assumes file sharing program allows browsing
a user's files, many do).

You just need a means of communicating your wishes to your users --
presumably something like a) send me a buck and b) share the book and c)
tell others nicely.  You could embed this message in the book and/or in
an external metadata catalog.  Probably both, as you want your user to
see your request without taking any trouble to look it up, though you
also want the user to be able to verify your request, not to mention the
book's contents, either of which could easily be tampered with.

The only real hurdle a simple tipping system faces is adoption. 
FairTunes and others have tried, but you need to be baked into a bunch
of software (e.g., media players for music) to obtain critical mass. 
Technically you just need some reasonably certain method of tying a file
or files to a creator or creators (I believe FairTunes' plugin just used
filename or embedded metadata, both of which are easily subverted, but
the system could evolve to check with verifiable external metadata), and
a means of collecting payment from users and distributing payment to
creators.  You don't even need a real micropayment system.  Rather users
could have an account with an aggregator.  Users would draw down this
account when making microdonations and the aggregator would send checks
above some amount to artists, thus cutting way down on transaction
costs.  There are a few obvious options for giving the user some control
over who gets paid: a) tip a cent or whatever with each "play" (this
would be hard to do for books) or b) at the end of each month
automatically divide some preset amount the user is willing to donate
each month or c) show the user their habits and suggest a distribution,
but allow the user to alter the distribution.  The last makes the user
more comfortable about trying unfamiliar art.  If they don't like it,
they can cancel the donation.

However, your affiliate/MLM idea would be hard to implement.  You'd have
to obtain along with the book/music/etc file a list of referrers, add
yourself to the list for anyone you share the file with, and communicate
the state of the list whenever you tip the creator of that file.  This
passing of referrer information has to be supported by most of the
mechanisms files are shared by or it's basically useless.  I don't see
it happening.

Another idea proposed along these lines is FairShare
http://freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Main/FairShare which
proposes that early donors get a cut of subsequent donations.  This
seems like a better option because it rewards tipping (as opposed to
rewarding sharing, which people do without compensation -- though early
donors would also have an incentive to promote the work in order to
obtain a bigger downline) and doesn't require passing any extra bits
around.

I've forgotten.  Haven't seen a popup in something like a year.  If you
aren't using a browser that allows you to disable popups, change
browsers.  I use *nix-only Galeon, though I think Mozilla now has this
feature on all platforms: <http://mozilla.org>.  Although it's based on
Mozilla, you probably don't want AOL/Netscape 6.x, as I've heard that
they disable disabling popups -- unsurprising in that it's a marketing
platform for AOL.

We can't go back to hunter-gatherer days as a society regardless, but as
individuals we can compensate for adverse effects agriculture and later
developments may have.  If you believe agriculture turned us onto
unhealthy food, you can avoid much of it.  See http://www.paleodiet.com
for suggestions.  (I only avoid some things rather than trying to "eat
paleo" primarily because I dislike animals.)  Similarly you can avoid
overspecialization, sedentary lifestyle, etc.  Effort required.

Current online computers (infrastructure such as routers included) can be
quantitatively taken over a small, moderately competent group of crackers.  
Worries about your P2P suite's potential hidden cargo (hi Googlebar!) on
this background are immaterial.

There is no trend towards deployment of inherently safe protocols, OSses, 
and sandboxing of the application layer. Future infrastracture still looks 
like today's, like swiss cheese.

None of which really matters; the important thing is that someone slips over
the idea threshhold and makes an attempt at it. Once that happens, three or
four other entities will start on their own spin on the idea. Given a year
or so, we see if any of the business plans work -- if they do, then many
others will follow, among which one or more that cater to the evil-averse
users.

I'm becoming quite interested in following the use of entertainment
properties in tech to acquire large userbases for more practical things
piggybacked on top...

The monkey needs to be burned a couple of times before starting

The strange thing is that most IT persons believe they're operating in a
rational manner. Time to start looking for a new field...

There are a number of solutions but installing Opera 6 is pretty easy.

Hi,

I think you fail to assess correctly the actual benefits of the
present system -- which is a bad starting point to propose an
alternative system.

The chain-letter model won't appeal to the readers. Simple readers
don't want to be sollicited all the time with manuscripts written by
unkown folks. They are not publisher, just casual readers. Try to pay
people to make such suggestions, and what you're trying to achieve is
have friends to spam each other (good luck with that model).

It is true that bringing a book to the market in the normal way is
very costy, and that this cost has to be payed in the end by the
reader. But the reader, who only reads so much, is assured by this
very investment made by the publisher that the texts have been
carefuly selected to please him. So is the critic, who has a
preselection made by the very obstacles to publishing, and so is the
book shop.

The reader is not primarily looking for something that would lower the
price of the book, because the main cost for him is the TIME
INVESTMENT and the READING EFFORT, not the book price. He is primarily
looking for a good filter allowing him to identify the very best
books.

This is not to say that the present system is very good, or even OK.
It's bad, and the Internet can make it better. But it has to match the
benefits of the present system. In particular, you need to have "third
parties" who replace the material obstacles of publishing as a filter,
so that the reader is not presented with the totality of writings. (Of
which most is very bad.)

Indeed. The problem regarding agriculture is not a good or bad choice,
it is that, made the way we are, with the desires we were given as
guides, we were bound to embrace the changes and technologies we
perceived as useful.

By doing this we progressively modified our environment, but as we
didn't modify ourselves (biological evolution being too slow), we
became ill adapted to our environment, and thus started to explore a
new variety of problems and suffering, from the lack of vitamins and
exercise to the lack of scenery change.

Of course our most obvious desires were matched more and more -- this
is precisely the criterion on which we progressively embraced each new
technology after all. But desire is just an artifical guide devised by
evolution; there's no inherent truth to it.

You can kill yourself by following your desire, if the environment is
not the one for which your desire evolved. Birds do so when they crash
on windows, for example.

I think that Ted Kaczynski made the point of this ineluctable
dis-adaptation through cultural development quite well, and I've not
yet understood if most of the people here have thought this through,
or have simply repressed it or neglected it.

Eliezer makes two points in passing :

1) that from a personal perspective, he values knowledge enough to be
   happy with cultural development, despite its problems

2) that when we start changing ourselves, thus readapting to whatever
   our environment becomes, we'll solve that ongoing mess

I personaly feel very close to the first point, and probably many of
us do (we're a sociologically weird bunch).

The second point is of course the unknown. Will we make it ? Will we
not be too ignorant to change ourselves meaningfully early enough, and
so will we not be smashed by our technology, à la Kaczynski ?
(Self-destruction is really a particular case of dis-adaptation.)

The standard, no-risk, easiest answer is: We have to try anyway, as we
are ineluctably going in that direction at full speed and there's no
going back.

A politically incorrect but sincere (in many cases) answer would be:
Life being quite pointless right now, I think I want to know. (Though
politically incorrect, I think the number of people who can
potentially share it is very large.)

A more modest one, content with life as it is now would be: No. So
let's regulate as much as possible and delay the chaos as long as
possible. (Fukuyama)

Fukuyama, and most such people, neglect that human nature will
change anyway.  Human nature (by which I mean our biological
leanings and some cultural responses to those leanings) evolved
in a particular environment.  We are now in a very different
environment and the "nature" which will maximize long-term
reproduction is going to be very different.  In particular, the
desire to limit reproduction under certain circumstances,
probably adaptive in a world of shortage and periodic famine,
now greatly reduces reproduction.  Desire and ability for
education apparently activate reproductive limitation in an
educated society, so those are on the chopping block too.  There's
a lot of worship, almost literally, of "DNA" and "nature" but DNA
is a virus; driven to reproduce as much as possible, mindless,
and heedless of any side effect that don't interfere with its goal.

Genes and culture have complex interactions, both symbiotic and
antagonistic.  It's the cultural aspects which include most of what we
consider good about being human.  Some genes support those aspects
and some oppose them.  The genes that oppose many good aspects of
culture are assaulting them now and will gain the upper hand if we 
just ignore things and let evolution have its way.

contact me directly (karron_NO_SPAM_PLEASE_PLEASE_@casi.net) and I will
explain in detail.

It is expensive, and scanning heaps of old books and journals is trickey. It
depends on humidity, age of the paper, and how good the gum rubber pick-ups
on your automatic document feeder are.

We had very good results with old ADF's on HP flat bed scanners, and the new
scanners are junk junk junk. We ended up getting a high end scanner.

I have my students scanning while we programme, as you can't throw more than
a half inch of paper in the hopper at a time.

I it is basically a labor of love, and a way for me to reclaim space in my
little midtown manhanttan apartment.

Cool!  What kind of scanner, process, automation are you using?
   I did one book the slow way recently and it was no fun at

Jacques,
       I came into this discussion late so let me ask a couple of question?  
Even if we consider the agricultural revolution to be a step backward have we 
factored agri-forrestry or permaculure into our thoughts along with the 
various low simple carbohydrate diets that have came along lately.  
       Frankly, I have little to argue about with what I have read but with 
those three factors introduced into consideration I think we may well have a 
new ballgame.

Cultural progress is likely to have a huge impact on both our
environment and our nature in the next few decades.

Biological evolution in the sense of the natural selection of genes is
negligible on that time scale. It's barely one or two generations !

And if our nature failed to change significantly through evolution in
the last 10 000 years since we dropped the hunter-gatherer way of
life, leading to the disadaptation that was the object of my post, I
fail to see how evolution will suddenly re-adapt ourselves to our
exponentially changing environment in a few generation.

Unless you imagine that the future will be SO BAD that to even survive
our environment within 50 years we will have to be the bearers of
extremely rare mutations, leading to a very fast transformation of the
species. However, this is a scenario very close to extinction.

On the contrary, since its agriculture that causes 90% of the
environmental damage, come up with a technological solution (like
photosynthetic/photovoltaic human skin) and there won't be a need for
it, we can all go back to a hunter gatherer lifestyle to obtain our
protein and vitamins, leaving most of our caloric needs to our skin's
ability to catch rays.

Agriculture is also the cause of statism, another blight on humanity.
Eliminate it and the need for statism will die out.

Probably, but we can't stand still.  The conservative position
is untenable.  Only active processes can counter the effects of
evolution.

Current selection pressure on increased fecundity is astronomical.
If say, the standard deviation of offspring  number is 1 and the heritability
1/3, offspring # goes up 1/3 every generation and you have pressure
to speed up generation time.

Going to agriculture is not the relevant shift, although I expect that has
changed human nature too, albeit less significantly.  The shift is that
there's no limit on reproduction, which is quite recent.  Freedom from
famine is only 300 years old even in England (Holland might be longer,
I don't have data; certainly nowhere else) and in most of the  world it's 
only 
this generation.  The demographic transition is more recent than that
and so alleles which permit the transition have been shielded from
detrimental selection.

I'm with Samantha here, which is one reason I thought the joke
might be more interesting--because it's just on the edge of
plausibility.  Except for silly things like belief in God,
dogmatic principles, and such, religion has much to recommend
it.  I won't repeat my
<http://www.piclab.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Positive_Atheism>
page here, but I might well update it based on the reactions
to my joke.  I rather like Curt's "Church of Human Potential"
name, for example.

And I'm definitely with Max that April Fool's Day should be
an important Extropian holiday, celebrating the facility of
the human mind to resist being fooled.  Now, if I can just
figure out some way to justify Halloween--maybe "body
modification day"?

A few small points:

1. Between the extremes of saying that we should never genetically enhance
and those (like us) who say we should enhance today, there is a moderate
position that says that we should proceed very, very cautiously. Suppose
someone agreed with you that there are potentially great benefits for
genetic enhancements, but the serious risks indicate that we should study
this in extensive detail before proceeding. Some might think that a dozen or
more generations using animal models might be appropriate. If one of the
animal models is the chimp then this will take us into the next century.
Along time by impatient transhumanist standards. I have had this sort of
objection raised by audiences at a couple of papers that I have given so it
might be worth distinguishing a bit more between those against it in
principle, and those that say, maybe, but not just yet. I realize you flag
the difference with 'ban' and 'moratorium' but strategically it might help
to say a bit more.
2. Is your discussion limited to genetic enhancements of humans? (See 3
below). If so, it might help to say what sorts of genetic manipulations are
not covered by your discussion.
3. I see how the issue of personal identity comes into it, if you are
talking about in vivo enhancements. But isn't another central issue 'species
identity'? Genetic manipulation of a human zygote raises the possibility of
a speciation event. (I discuss the possibility of such a speciation event in
"Prolegomena to Any Future Philosophy", specifically, the creation of Homo
Bigheadus).
4. In ibid. I suggest that it is quite possible that a few genetic changes
might lead to a speciation event. (See the discussion of homeobox genes). I
think that some might fear that allowing enhancements will lead down the
slippery slope to a speciation event. If you are attempting just to discuss
enhancements then you might need to say something about the speciation
possibility. If you intend to cover the speciation possibility you might
need to say a bit more about this. (I take the proverbial bull by the horns
in "Absolute Perfectionism" and argue  that it is our ethical duty to
speciate).
5. I realize that you are attempting to confine the discussion to the realm
of practical ethics, I wonder whether this is ultimately possible. But a
single example: You say, "But at least we can conclude that an enhancement
that has both intrinsic benefits for the enhanced individual and significant
net positive externalities for the rest of society - health and intelligence
enhancements, for instance, seem to belong to this category - should not be
banned; the question, rather, is how strongly they should be encouraged, and
by what means." The idea, I take it, is to evaluate in part in terms of
raising the total good--is the question of the nature of this good besides
the point for your purposes? It seems that if we plugged different values
into this equation, e.g., 'pleasure', 'happiness', or 'perfection we might
get quite different recommendations about how to proceed, i.e., about which
enhancements to encourage and which to discourage.

Greetings:
Are these ultra-capacitors commercially available, and if so, from where?
Or even just research prototypes would be fine.   Any info you could forward
along is highly appreciated.

Charles

     ---------------------------------

Charles, If you go to www.matweb.com (a good source for information on
materials) and look up 'aerogel' they will provide a link to suppliers.  

Here is the main supplier for silica aerogels and carbon aerogels they list

http://www.mkt-intl.com/

They also have RF aerogels and new alumina aerogels

http://www.mkt-intl.com/aerogels/index.html

You can get carbon aerogel papers (the ones good for ultra capacitors) on
this page

http://www.mkt-intl.com/aerogels/aerogel_order.html (scroll to bottom)

They are sold as paper like sheets 3.5" x 10".  5 sheets go for $100 US

Their chart says it all!

Properties of Carbon Aerogel Available Ranges 
Density  0.3 - 1.0 g/cm3 
Surface Area, BET  400-1200 m2/g                   (1200 m^2 !!!!!!)
Average Pore Size 0.5 nm 
Compressive Modulus  3000 psi* 
Electrical Resistivity  0.010 - 0.040 ohm-cm*  
Capacitance 30 F/g*                                (30 F/g !!!)
Thermal Conductivity 0.4 W/m/°K*  
Gas Permeability 4.86x10-12 
Color black 

You should be able to get two paper sheets and roll them into a cylinder
with a dialectric sandwiched between them and make a good ultra cap.

Hope that helps.

In the terms of my original message about disadaptation, that's a
theoretical alternative: redirect cultural progress to readapt
ourselves, without changing ourselves, but by changing our environment
back to a simili-ancestral environment, though augmented by
technology. Not very likely, but still a possibility.

The problem I see (apart from the fact that many external problems
could prevent anyone to do this) is that the conjunction of our
unchanged desires and of the availability of technology will keep
pushing us to exit this lifestyle at many occasions. Say, we will be
lazy(1), and we will want a nice cozy home to read books and play with
the computer instead of chasing the beasts in the mud -- something we
may be designed to do, but that we also HAD TO do in the ancestral
environment. Just knowing that this is the environment we are made for
won't be enough to keep us there in the long run, even with a life
made better by technology -- so the disadaptation process will
reoccur.

On the other hand if we DO change ourselves (which your flavor of
technology seems to suggest), then I don't see why we would want to go
back to hunting-gathering, except as one of many possible lifestyles.

I may not be perceptive enough tonight, but I didn't find very obvious
connections between my post and your answer.

What I understand is you are stressing the importance of biological
evolution, and this is why you offer the end of famine and of any
limit to reproduction as the main shift, rather than agriculture.

I have to agree that this is an important theoretical shift as far as
biological evolution is concerned, and provided we agree that the
shift is aptly characterized that way (I'm not quite sure).

But as I said, to me, biological evolution in the sense of gene
selection is important to understand what we ARE; not to understand
what we will be.

Hi Ron,

The author of the article mentionned by Eliezer might consider your
point relevant to his argumentation. What I personnaly tried to point
out, however, is that the problem is not such and such particular
problem with agriculture, like a low diet, but our progressive
"disadaptation" through cultural development.

By adopting new technologies with our evolution-given desires as
guides, we modify our environment in the process in such a way that,
though the new situation seems better according to certain criteria
(which is why we embraced the new technology in the first place), it
shifts farther and farther from the environment for which we have
evolved, and (as we don't have time to change through biological
evolution) we become less and less adapted to it. The most obvious
desires are better served (food, shelter -- probably not sex which is
still competitive), but many others, sometimes quite important and
deep, are left starving, and on the whole it all seems quite
incoherent.

I tried, from that theoretical starting point, to think of what we can
hope to achieve to "readapt".

Jacques

How do they work that figure out?
Oh, and by the way.

When  kazaa updated to version 1.5.1 some time ago, that clause was in the
EULA then.
I know this because I read it, because I'm always finding easter eggs in them
such as the current situation we are discussing.
I'm mildly disturbed that it took this long for anyone to notice, and freak
out about it.

I figured I'd run it until it started locking my system up or acquiring vast
amounts fo disk real estate, and then I'd delete it.

It is not that simple.  The dielectric has to have the same surface area on each side as the electrodes.  For aerogel capacitors a liquid electrolyte is used to get into the tiny spaces as part of a system that forms the dielectric. See:

Huh?  Human fecundity hasn't changed at all in a long time.  What
has changed is the fraction of infants (and mothers) surviving
the childbirth and early infancy stages.

Wrong! (sorry Curt) -- the evolutionary pressure that speeds up generation
time (and generation size) is your environmental hazard function.  The greater
the hazard function, the more pressure there is to reproduce sooner with
more offspring (insects being a case in point).

Going to agriculture allowed people to live in cities which in turn
required a diversification of immune systems to resist microorganisms
that are transmitted by close proximity.  This, I suspect would promote
mate selection on the basis of different immune systems.  There may also
be some "socialization" selection that may go beyond that one finds in
very small groups of primates.

> The shift is that there's no limit on reproduction, which is quite recent.

Huh?  Humans have never had a limit on reproduction.  It is thought
that one of the primary reasons women get breast cancer is that
in primitive eras women spent most of their time pregnant or lactating
reducing the number of ovulation cycles.  The human (female) genome
is not designed to promote longevity for non-pregnant females.

However -- it doesn't do you much good to be reproducing continually
if most of those children fail to reach reproductive maturity.

I think you ought to go research China or Japan.  I suspect that
other than brief instances of harsh conditions induced by weather
variants they have had sufficient food for thousands of years.

Going back even further -- I think it is believed that most hunter
gatherer "tribes" had no shortage of food supplies -- at least
in Africa where fruit was abundant or in the fertile crescent.
(Of course you can make a case that in glacier covered Europe
that was not the case.)

I don't believe for a second that evolution of the human species
has produced the "demographic transition".  Its a combination
of better medical practices, vaccinations, better nutrition
(not always dictated by absolute caloric intake...) and
sanitation (reducing the risks to which we are exposed).

Oh, certainly, but in such situations, you'd be externalizing your
caloric production onto the environment and fellow man, thus incurring
opportunity taxes.

Yes, one of many possible lifestyles. And the vegans will finally get
one-upped as photosynthesizing huntergatherers protest the unethical
consumption of plant life forms (after all, since plants can appreciate
music, they must be 'sentient', right?)

That's not at odds with my position.  I'm arguing that human nature wil
not remain fixed, even over relatively short time scales, regardless of
what we do.  Nothing inconsistent with interest in what were are and how
we got this way.  I was disagreeing with several assertions in your post,
such as that since human nature has remained relatively stable over
historical times it isn't going to change substantially in the near future.

Which others?  I'm at a loss to think of any significant way in
which I'm worse off than I'd be in an agricultural or hunter-gatherer
society.  I'd like to see my family more often than I do; but I
certainly *could*, and I choose to live where I do for compensating
benefits.  I can think of much I'd miss in a less-developed society
even if I'd always lived there.

Until recently, more children meant fewer resources for the rest and
a consequent decreased survival.  While data on historical humans is
lacking, it's a good rule for any creature that its fecundity is near
optimal.  So alleles for increased fecundity had both benefits and costs.
Now survival is almost 100% regardless of how many kids you have.
Increased fecundity is now just gravy for the genes.

No, high population growth rates also select for rapid reproduction.  Alleles
for increased fecundity are experiencing growth relative to the rest of the
population and so are alos selected to move reproduction forward.

Testing these would be interesting.

Well, call it a limit on successful reproduction.  You could birth more, but
they'd just starve.

Definitely not China; they had major famines into this century.
I'll look for data on Japan, but weather variation is the primary 
traditional cause of famine everywhere and Japan gets some 
pretty wild weather.  (modern famines are primarily political)

Anthropological research shows all the hunter-gatherer societies
have periodic severe food shortages.  Africa and the Fertile Crescent
have *huge* rainfall variation.  Periodic famines are part of what's
killing traditional societies today - famine forces them into the 
better-prepared modern societies.  Such problems only occur every
few decades, perhaps, but that's plenty often in the long term.

It wasn't a change in genes that caused the transition, but a change
in culture.  However, the lower reproduction due to those
shift is going to be partly caused by pre-existing genes, (virtually
anything about humans has both genetic and cultural components) and 
those genes now face huge negative selection pressure.  When they
go away people will go back to having lots of babies.

I only discuss the human case, but I'm not sure I'm saying anything that 
wouldn't also apply to transhumans.

The main difference between a distinction between race (which is very 
superficial) and a distinction between species, as I see it, is that 
members of different species cannot interbreed under natural conditions; 
that gives a little more substance to the latter distinction. Apart from 
the possible practical problem of interbreeding, I don't see any ethical 
significance of species boundaries.

 From a technical point of view, I expect human-descendants to be 
interbreedable for at least as long as we remain biological. By the time 
genetic differences have accumulated to the point of causing difficulties 
in natural breeding, I think genetic science will have progressed to make 
it possible to overcome those difficulties.

The upshot is that I don't see an issue in speciation, apart from the 
concerns about inequality that I talk about in the paper.

I'm using the 'benefits' in the social choice sense, of (more) people 
getting (more) of what they want. I'm not committing myself to benefit in 
this sense as being identical to the good, but only to the weaker claim 
that in practise, if something is a benefit in this sense, that is a good 
prima facie ethical reason for being in favor of it. (In fact, I'm 
attracted to the dispositional theory of value, developed e.g. by David 
Lewis, which I mention earlier in the paper).

Thanks for your comments!

Actually, this reminds me more of those funky tibetan prayer wheels.

Embarassingly parallel teraflops, that is. Looks highly useful for virtual

Hi all,

Just a quick query: has anyone read the David Cope/Douglas Hofstadter book 
_Virtual Music_?  It looks like an expansion on the musical aspect of 
_GEB_, with relation to intelligent computation.  If anyone has read it and 
has an opinion, please let me know as the subject matter is of keen 
interest to me.

						Thanks!

I asked Jaron Lanier about the statement in his bio on The Well that says he
coined the term virtual reality. He says he used the term to describe
networked virtual worlds and as far as he knew, he made it up.

<<But who knows? The first use of the phrase was by Antonin Artaud back in
the 1920s, though I didn't know about that at the time, which was
about 1981. The first programming language for vr was called
Mandala, and was from about that time, so it's a double coincidence,
I guess.>>

Artaud used "la realite virtuell" to refer to the theater "in which
characters, objects and
images take on the phantasmagoric force of alchemy's visionary internal
dramas."

Hi everybody!

I thought of an interesting venue for a possible London meeting:
Waterstone's flagship store in Piccadilly, London. It's the biggest
bookshop in Europe and it offers a licensed restaurant, lounge bar,
juice bar and café.

It's central and it's worth the trip by itself. It's also
conveniently located for any shopping anyone might want to do.

I'm going to suggest the weekend after next for the first UK
extropians meeting:

>>saturday the 13th at midday<<

There is no *specific* theme to the meeting, it's just a way to get
to know other local extropes and "talk extropy" face to face rather
than via email, for a change.

IF YOU WANT TO TAKE PART, PLEASE REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE (don't just
show up on the day, there might be nobody there!)

Here's the URL for a map:

Subject: [MURG] minduploading.org: Bulletin on the Status of Mind Uploading

(This bulletin is updated periodically at
minduploading.org/mu-status-bulletin.html and posted to the MURG mailing
list.)

Thu Apr  4 08:44:58 EST 2002
Randal A. Koene

Perhaps we will all be astonished at the rapidity with which the public
and officials adopt mind uploading as a scientific and social goal. Other
technologies with similarly portentious anticipated effects on humanity
are receiving credence and support from individuals, corporations and
governments alike. Previously it was genetic engineering that made its way
into the mainstream. Now it is nanotechnology that, while not many leaps
beyond the stage that mind uploading is at, receives substantial official
backing, such as R&amp;D at Sandia National Laboratories (see
http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2000/nanotech.htm). This bodes well
for the prospects of research into Whole Brain Emulation, in addition to
the immediate benefits that progress in nanotechnology will bring to Whole
Brain Emulation.

Generally speaking, it seems that the population in-the-know is
surprisingly (at least it keeps surprising me) uncritical of the
sociological impact that mind uploading will make, while in majority
positively inclined towards the concept, and often-times quite literally
anticipating it (see comments by Slashdot readers concerning the article
by Ray Kurzweil:
http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/01/26/1133249&mode=nested). The
readership of that site is perhaps a rather skewed sample of the general
population, but nonetheless a fair sample of the generation of scientists
and technologists that will witness and participate in the development of
mind uploading.

Previous Mind Uploading Bulletin (Apr. 20, 2000):
minduploading.org/mu-status-bulletin.20000420.html

What can you do to help develop whole brain emulation?

Do you have items for:
this bulletin?
the FAQ?
mind uploading News?
a summary for a Featured Site?
an announcement related to whole brain emulation research?
experimental results?
pointers to papers relevant to mind uploading?
important information to share?
questions, requests or suggestions for collaborations?
information related to the organization or planning of MURG and whole
brain emulation?

Then please send them to rak@minduploading.org or simply post them to
MURG!

Please remember to browse the News page for recent events.

I'm looking forward to continued work with you all, on the NematodeUpload
and otherwise!

Cheers,
rak@minduploading.org

Extropes,

Certainly, only parts of the world are overpopulated - areas in China, India
and
Japan for instance... also parts of Africa and South America.  In the case
of
Japan, the society may be able to deal with the extremely dense and aging
population.  The Japanese government is extensively funding android robotics
research so that the aged can have automated help in their current homes.
There
is not enough space for sprawling nursing homes.  Japan is the only
overpopulated
society that appears to have the wealth and industrial infrastructure to
deal with
the situation currently.

If the United States became overpopulated wherein the density of people in
California and Florida became very widespread, similar problems will occur.
For a Libertarian, the current Welfare State is a crime and would turn a
mildly
socialist US government into a very massively socialist one like in Sweden.
People should NOT be paid to have kids as is true now and I would strongly
agree with the general vision in the A.I., Artificial Intelligence movie:
reproductive licenses would be an extremely good idea.  If the 2 parents
could
not afford to pay for raising the kid that they had, obviously the cost is a
massive
drain on the society at large.  Thus, after one irresponsibly conceived and
born kid,
mandatory sterilization should be enforced.  Historically, a "marriage
license"
served the function of a "reproductive license" since unwed babies were
tabooed.
Since this implicit regulation is now worthless an explicit license should
be made
mandatory.   - Bill.

Bad news for the Sheik, he's as wrong as wrong as wrong can be, and
if he and his associates don't knock it off, they will either be in
jail, or dead wrong.

I think Israel might have sufficient paperwork now to press a case
against Arafat in the world court, I would encourage them to do so.

Indeed.

Would a SI solve this? Is it more intelligence we need in such
situations?

A close friend is a Jewish writer, right now in Jerusalem in fact (but
usually living in France). He told me that when he was 10 (in 1948),
he wanted that the conflict waits that he turns 18, so that he could
solve it (he did many wonderful things, but he didn't manage to do
that). He said that at the time to her neighbour, a Hungarian Jewish
lady. She said: "What? You want us to wait 8 more years?"

Bill this is hardly a Libertarian solution....

Restructure taxes and go to a flat tax so that everyone has an
investment in the government, lets say 10%. Now eliminate children
as a tax deduction.

Everybody would pay a small amount for schools, but the bulk would
have to be paid by the parents on a per student basis.

Pay as you go.

Actually, only parts of CA or FL can be considered "densly" populated.
Obviously we could do the calculations of people/sq km and determine
this precisely instead of speculating about it.  My guess would be
that one of the New England states or Delaware would end up as
"most densely populated".

I assume you are speaking for yourself, yes?  Libertarian != Extropian.
I for one would argue fairly strongly that any system that taxes the
general population and puts a reasonable fraction of that income into
peer reviewed scientific research is going to advance an extropic agenda
faster than a "pure" libertarian society where the only scientific
research that gets funded is by those who understand science sufficiently
to want to donate their resources to it.  [That would be another "useful"
figure for extropic discussions -- which country spends the greatest
fraction of GDP on scientific research?]

It puts you on the slippery slope.  You immediately have to judge the
"quality" of the upbringing a child would have.  Do you only give licenses
to parents who can afford to send their children to private schools?
Would not extropians consider religious and potentially many public
school systems harmful to the child (and therefore justification for
denying licenses to parents who would send their children to them)?
What about college education?  Should the parents be able to pay
for that as well?  While we are at it, lets only give licenses
to people who are going to have children of above average intelligence.

We do not have an overpopulation problem that cannot be solved by
laws and/or technological improvements.  One only has to look at the
general improvement in air and water quality in the U.S. over the last
30 years to realize that.

I'm probably one of the more well traveled people on the list
having visited ~45 U.S. states and more than 20 foreign countries.
I can speak from first hand experience that most of the U.S., Russia
Russia even India are not "overpopulated" (if by "overpopulation"
you mean the counties around Los Angelas).

If your measure for "overpopulation" is traffic density, then
that can easily be solved by air cars.

So I don't think "licenses" for reproduction are the right way to go.

I disagree. Extropianism isn't about forcing people to Do The Right
Thing. Just as freedom speech means that people are free to voice
dissenting opinions, true freedom means that people are free to not
support the government's agenda, however "good" it might be in
"everyone's" opinion.

I think personal liberty is fundamental to extropy, and I don't think
it can be achieved by suspending liberties "temporarily".

Well, of course starting an organized religion is not very compatible with
the Extropian principles, but from a purely pragmatic point of view I think
it would be a VERY good idea for those who want to protect themselves
against the current legal system when it is not cryonics friendly. It is a
fact that refusing to comply with existing laws is more accepted when the
refusal is explicitely justified with a (real of fake) religious belief.
Example: the sect whose members refuse to give blood transfusions to their
children even when it appears as the only way to save a life.

check your Iodine.

I had thought that iodine deficiency was mostly a thing of a past,
but a discussion with an endocrinologist today taught me something
different. If you don't use iodized salt (the regular table salt in
Germany is not iodized), and if you don't live near the sea, and if
you don't take iodine supplements (in your multivitamin/mineral),
then you are likely low on iodine. I also learned that water
supplies in this country have iodine added to fight this deficiency.
Southern Germany has much less iodine added to the water than
Northern Germany, which might explain why I've seen more than a few
older people here with enormous goiters.

Some medical information regarding iodine, intake levels for
good health, etc:

Normal table salt in the United States is iodized, though
"kosher" salt is growing popular among cooks.  Those of us
in California who eat local seafood now and then shouldn't
have to worry either.  But those inland folks who use kosher
salt (and those living in Germany, like you) may have to
pay a bit more attention.

It's nice to spout this sort of clever, sensible stuff, but it seems to me
that the Palestinian's tactic of blowing themselves up and taking as many
Israelis as possible with them HAS worked, rather well.  It's gotten the
attention of the world, a Palestinian state is now supported by most of the
world, it seems, and this was in the offing BEFORE the current Israeli
invasion of palestinian territory.

It seems to me that they have gotten what they wanted, world attention, and
now that the cat is out of the bag, how do you plan on putting it back?

Ummm... I pay for the research when I buy the car, pay for the medical
care, buy my food, etc.  They amortize research expenses the same way I
do for my businesses.

If your line of thinking is correct, how is it that Americans were so
technologically innovative in the 19th century absent taxation?

I received this article from a friend which is basically saying that
recycling, overall, takes more energy and produces more waste then producing
materials from the raw resources.  This got me thinking a little, how much
energy is required to produce an aluminum product from bauxite, to mine it,
ship it, process it, and make a can.  Conversely, how much energy is used to
collect all those sparsely located aluminum cans throughout the urban sprawl
maze that is the US with big gas guzzling wasteful recycling collection
trucks.  Aluminum cans are very light, but take up a lot of space, so a
comparable mass of aluminum cans vs. bauxite may be like 10 - 15 trucks of
cans carry as much aluminum as one truck of bauxite.  The cans then must be
cleaned and melted, so how energy efficient is this process when taking into
account the collection of the cans?  Aluminum cans are the shinning beacon
of the recycling mythos, what about Plastic products, newspapers, and steel?
This article is from Cato institute and has an obvious bias so it would be
nice to see some facts to figure it out either way.  It would be interesting
if environmentalists were actually producing more waste and pollution by
recycling than by mining raw materials.

Nutrient deficiencies are more common than people think.  The US 
government has instituted the following public health policies to 
address widespread deficiencies in the "typical" American diet:

	- butter provides additional vitamin A supplementation
	- milk provides additional vitamin D supplementation
	- water provides additional fluoride supplementation
	- salt provides additional iodine supplementation
	- cereal provides additional vitamin B complex supplementation
	- baby formula provides additional neonatal vitamin supplementation
	- doctors monitor women for calcium and vitamin B-12 supplementation

*Shameless self-promotion follows!*  This is what lead me to write my 
book _Nutrients_Catalog_.  I wanted to document the deficiency symptoms 
for every known human nutrient, so I would know which ones to 
supplement.  I also took care to document toxicity symptoms and 
side-effects of each, so I would know if I was taking too much.  I think 
that human nutrition should be tuned and tweaked, just like we do with 
our computers and our automobiles.

A Palestinian state was supported by most of the world including
the U.S. and Israel long before now, in fact the best deal the
Palestinians will ever see was sitting waiting to be signed in Sept
2000. Something like 97% plus of what they ever said they wanted.
Any negotiator would be extremely proud to get such a deal. But
Arafat after negotiating that deal walked away and started the
Intifada again.

They wanted Israelis soldiers in their living rooms?

They got attention, but is that all they really wanted? Arafat
wanted to destroy Israel, that's not going to happen, and any peace
deal will include putting the Hamas/Hizbollah/etc out of business
for good.

Still, I'm rather disappointed at the way the administration has
handled this.

But extropianism is also about being "rational" (see principle 7).
If I rationally think that one of the greatest goods is saving
the greatest number of human lives and that accelerating our
perpetual progress (principle 1) will be the best way to get
the intelligent technology (principle 4) necessary to do that
then it rationally makes sense for me to choose to live in
the country that taxes my income and uses that money most
effectively to protect me while encouraging the research necessary
to accomplish this.  I would claim anyone choosing not to
do this would be behaving irrationally unless they cite
the principle of self-direction (#6) as trumping the above
cited principles.  And even then I'd likely consider them
to be irrational -- they would be playing russian roulette
with their life because their hazard function is significantly
increased by choosing to live outside the society I've just
described.

So I think extreme libertarian positions are not extropic.
You need to come up with a way to convince me that libertarian
societies would be safer and better at accelerating the progress
than the current system we now have.

Want to play rock, paper, scissors?  :-)

Well, look, you can wave your opinions about as much as you like, but when you
read what the palestinians militants are saying? They claim that this whole
suicide bombing effort is a HUGE success. Your wishful thinking will not calm

Report: Depression Research Supports Dual-Brain Theory

   from Mental Health Weekly


   Researchers have uncovered evidence that illnesses, such as depression, are
associated with one half
   of the brain and that by activating the brain's healthier other half, a
person's condition may improve. The
   report appears in this month's Neuropsychiatry, Neuropsychology, and
Behavioral Neurology.

   "If you activate the healthier hemisphere, you may help the person. If you
activate the hemisphere where
   the troubles were, you make it worse," Fredric Schiffer, M.D., an associate
attending psychiatrist at
   McLean Hospital, told MHW.

   According to Schiffer, who is working with researchers at other
institutions on this research, severely
   depressed patients' spirits were lifted when they received visual stimuli
primarily to the healthy left side
   of the brain, and their mood improved significantly when their left
hemispheres were treated with a more
   powerful form of stimulation, involving electromagnetic fields.

   In a healthy person, the two parts of the brain work together in harmony;
however, in people suffering with
   an illness like depression, one hemisphere may sabotage or dominate the
other.

   Schiffer said this latest report supports his earlier theory developed
several years ago, which found that
   each half of the healthy brain houses a separate emotional mind. At that
time, he found that he could
   elicit positive emotional responses from depressed patients by restricting
their visual stimuli to one
   hemisphere.

   He equipped his patients with goggles that restricted their visual stimuli
to the right field of vision. He
   found that the goggles directed stimuli mostly to the left hemisphere,
because signals from the right field
   of vision travel primarily to the opposite side of the brain.

   Schiffer's depressed patients reported feeling better when visual stimuli
was directed primarily to their
   left hemisphere, which suggested their right hemispheres were functioning
abnormally. To develop a
   stronger approach to stimulating the healthier left hemisphere of the
brain, Schiffer began working with
   Alvaro Pascual-Leone, MD, Ph.D., a researcher at Boston's Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, who
   developed a method of stimulating the brain using electromagnetic fields,
called transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS).

   Schiffer and Pascual-Leone suspected that the TMS method benefited only 50
percent of depressed
   patients. They suspected that those patients were the ones whose healthy
hemispheres were being
   stimulated. They embarked on an experiment to determine if those patients
could be identified in
   advance by Schiffer's goggle test.

   When they channeled visual stimuli primarily to the left side of 37
depressed patients for 45 seconds
   and then to their right side for the same time, they found that 20 patients
reported feeling better when
   stimuli were directed to the left side of the brain, suggesting it was the
healthier hemisphere. Fifteen
   patients felt worse, which suggested the right half of their brain was
healthier. The patients subsequently
   received a two-week course of TMS treatments only to the left hemisphere.

   The patients' depression levels were tested prior to wearing the goggles
and tested again two weeks
   after the last of a series of TMS treatments using a standard measure,
called the Hamilton Depression
   Rating Scale (HDRS).

   Under the HDRS measure, higher scores are associated with higher levels of
depression. The
   researchers found that the 20 patients who felt more improvement with the
left hemisphere visual
   stimulation experienced a median 42 percent reduction in HDRS. A
fifty-percent reduction is considered
   remission. The average reduction for the second group of 15 patients who
felt worse was only 11
   percent, which is considered below the failure mark.

   Schiffer said the study could be used to fortify current TMS procedures by
predicting which individuals
   with depression will most likely benefit. "In addition, this study bolsters
my dual-brain hypothesis," said
   Schiffer.

   Schiffer said he uses goggles with positive results in his clinical
practice and as an adjunct to
   psychotherapy. He said he intends to take his approach a step further by
using functional MRI to study
   how the brain changes with goggle use. Schiffer said the functional image
will help them determine if the
   goggle activates one hemisphere more than the other.

I think what's relevant here is not the relative frequencies of the
alleles, but the relative amounts of resources they have access to. Today
having more babies gives you more offsprings that survive into maturity,
but it's not clear that it increases the total wealth/power of your
offsprings compared to having fewer babies (because it causes you to
invest less in each offspring and the return on that investment is
increasing up to a point). If it doesn't then increased fecundity is going
to be a losing strategy in the long run.

Any guesses what genes are casuing the lower reproduction?

This implies that there's a smorgasbord of countries to choose from,
and that people can simply choose the one that best meets their
needs. In reality, many people are stuck with the country they're born
in--and the alternatives aren't very attractive.

How about the Open Society (#5)? "Preferring...exchange over
compulsion". If citizens are compelled to support the Master Plan run
by the wise and rational Benevolent Dictator, who, after all, just
wants to make things better for everyone, I don't think that's
consistent with Open Society.

Because your plan is obviously best. Uh huh. And since you deem them
irrational, it'd probably be OK to expel them or round them up and,
er, recycle their components, maybe? To tolerate irrationals would be
downright irrational.

I don't think the goal is race toward Extropia as fast as possible,
damn the consequences, ignore the collateral damage, etc. I think we
should proceed deliberately and gradually, following the Principles as
much as possible along the way. Forcing people to fund your agenda
because you think it's obviously the most rational way to proceed is
not extropic, it's evil.

My guess that if we have lower reproduction rates now its
primarily cultural and not genetic.  People have more sexual
partners now so its much easier to contract a STD that makes
you less fertile or infertile.

In addition, the demographers and the Hunger Project have
shown that as you educate women, give them more control
over their fertility and the population as a whole becomes
wealthier, people simply choose to have fewer children.

In poorer countries where there is no national social
security or pension system, having many children is how
people guarantee that there is someone around to hunt
or grow food for them when they are less able to do so.
The social security systems transfer that responsibility
to the younger generation as a whole so individual families
can decrease the number of offspring they have.  The only trend
against that is in cultures that may remain largely
agricultural and having extra hands around at planting
or harvesting time increases family income.

The standard line you get from biologists is there isn't
anything that has happened during the period that humans
have been civilized that could significantly alter the
natural gene pool.  I suppose that we could speculate that
civilization has probably allowed the overall fraction
of deleterious genes to increase in the gene pool.
Obviously near-sighted people like moi make lousy
mammoth hunters.  That might account for any reduced
natural fecundity.

Rationality, in my opinion, is a means to an end. It is not an end in
itself. On the other hand, many of the extropian principles (like self
direction) are ends in themselves.

Perhaps it would be useful to make this distinction explicitly in the
principles? That is, the distinction between principles which encapsulate an
axiom of extropianism, a given, and those which present the best known means
of getting there.

Evolution of genes is affected solely by the number of people produced.
Quite possibly wealth and and power won't increase with the number of
people, but the people will still be there.  If the high reproducers 
don't interbreed with low reproducers you eventually end up with 
a dystopic situation of a small wealth, powerful elite and a large,
dispossed majority.  Ick.  More likely, though, they will interbreed and
the new genes will spread through the entire population.  You'll have
some lagging groups who behave more like current developed world people,
with small number of educated, supported children, but they'll follow
along in a few generations.  Selective pressures will be operational
within each such group, along with interbreeding. 

If low wealth and power eventually blocked reproduction then, yes,
your restriction would take hold.  And, through most of history, that
*has* been true, but today it's been nixed.

>Any guesses what genes are casuing the lower reproduction?

Specific genes, no; we're not that far along in understanding the human
genome.  I speculated a few years ago that operational genes were those
that caused humans to delay reproduction until they've picked up the
skills available in their groups.  So, if you encounter somebody more
knowledgeable than you, or new fun things to do (useful for sexual selection)
you delay reproduction until you learn that stuff.  In a tribe, you're 
going to catch up with everybody you know before too long.  In modern
society, you're never satisfied - there's always something to learn and
something to do, so reproduction gets delayed indefinitely.

Plug it the rest of the way, Harvey: where can one get it?

I've been concerned for some time about the long term effects of drinking
iodine-flushed water from my PUR field pump. There's an activated carbon
postfilter that takes some of it out, but I have wondered about longterm
deleterious effects of using it as a primary potable water source in extremis
for weeks on end.

t
to turn its mantra, =B3The Network is the Computer=B2, inside out. Will the
new
vision relegate centralised servers to the scrap heap?

http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3D1020705



HISTORY repeats itself, even in the computer business. Decades ago, Unix
programmers formulated ways of getting the most out of their computers by
tapping storage drives, memory and processing power from countless location=
s
around the network. That way, they hoped to squeeze out every bit of power
for their number crunching. In the process, they created a virtual
computer=8Balbeit a relatively slow one by today's standards=8Bwith its
innards
scattered about the office or campus.

The idea is fast coming back into vogue, as a host of high-tech firms start
unveiling distributed computing efforts of their own. All of them aim at
tying disparate computer systems together to create a system that behaves
like a single unit. This time, however, the goal is to create new
capabilities instead of simply borrowing resources.

Over the past year, IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard have all unveiled
integrated distributed computing efforts, seeking to sell products and
services that take advantage of this emerging technology. Yet by far the
greatest convert to the new religion has been Sun Microsystems=8Blong the
stalwart of network computing with the mantra, =B3The Network is the
Computer=B2. But the way things are going, that slogan could soon be =B3The
Computer is the Network=B2.

In February, Sun outlined its vision for computing within data centres, the
highest performance computer market. The initiative, called N1, borrows fro=
m
all the distributed computing work going on within the company. At its most
basic, N1 is a network architecture that builds a computer out of countless
bits and pieces scattered around the network. It employs many of the same
protocols used on the Internet itself, and combines both hardware and
software to achieve its effect.

At the heart of it all is an effort to =B3virtualise=B2 computing systems,
turning servers and file storage systems into buckets of computing power
that can be connected like Lego blocks and managed just as easily. In doing
so, N1 allows computers and storage systems to be assembled into a much
larger system that can be treated as a single unit. As Sun's chief
technology officer, Greg Papadopoulos, notes, this was the same thinking
behind operating systems such as Unix, which was designed by some of Sun's
top executives in the 1970s to manage separate pieces of hardware as if the=
y
were all part of a single computer.

For Sun, the initiative emphasises the company's head-long dive into
distributed computing. Long a pet topic of Bill Joy, Sun's co-founder and
chief scientist, a host of distributed computing initiatives is being
pursued within the company. Last year, Mr Joy launched Project JXTA
(pronounced =B3Juxta=B2), a peer-to-peer computing effort which is seeking to
provide the wherewithal for connecting together countless devices ranging
from personal computers to refrigerators. Ultimately, Juxta resembles an
open-source operating system for peer-to-peer computing, providing a stack
of protocols that will allow all computers to find and connect to one
another without any form of centralised help.

In the same spirit in which N1 was launched in February, Mr Joy started
Juxta in order to create an industry standard for peer-to-peer
computing=8Band, in the process, encourage the development of new peer-to-pee=
r
applications. Juxta is seeking to build a peer-to-peer platform that is
available to any developer who wants to create applications on top of it.
Sun has enlisted a group of programmers from CollabNet=8Bone of the more
prominent communities of volunteer developers and hackers=8Bto help produce
the software.

Today, Juxta uses a stack of six protocols, based largely on the XML
(Extensible Mark-up Language), the programming language used to define a we=
b
page's layout and subject matter. In Juxta, the protocols let individual
computers (ie, peers) do various things, such as advertise their presence
and resources they possess; locate other peers; inform one another about th=
e
status of other peers; let various peers organise themselves into teams;
establish =B3pipelines=B2 throughout the peer community; and allow two or more
peers to borrow a pipeline so they can send private messages back and forth
securely. Underlying all the protocols is a security mechanism that prevent=
s
anyone from listening in.

The community aspect of Juxta has turned out to be more complicated than
expected. Unlike a corporate group of software developers, CollabNet brings
together a ragtag assortment of crack programmers who volunteer their
services for the prestige and personal satisfaction. That makes the effort
inherently political and far slower than a commercial one. =B3Grassroots
movements aren't easy to organise,=B2 says Mr Joy. Working together has been =

I can personally attest to the apparent relation between creativity and
depressive episodes. Lets look at this:

The left hemisphere: logical, analytic, quantitative, rational and verbal
The right hemisphere: conceptual, holistic, intuitive, imaginative and
non-verbal.

1) Left side inactive (depressed) = right hemisphere dominance? manic
creative
2) Right side inactive (depressed) = left hemisphere dominance? manic
retentive
I assume 'stimulation' means, to each hemisphere, presumably more of what it
does?
Assume Hitler = 2, Van Gogh = 1
According to the above researchers:
Hitler needed to block his right eye and paint pictures.
Van Gogh needed to block his left eye and do some racial cleansing and
marching in neat lines.

When I look back, my personal history is of swinging between the two more
severely as I get older. Therefore I have to pick which way the swing is
going and wear a different eye patch/pick the appropriate activity? Hmmm
tricky.

anyone else think it pans out like the above, or have I got my lefts and
rights all mixed up?

cheers,

Colin

While this is almost all completely true, as Hegel and Heidegger proved
long ago, there's just one teeeeny flaw:

These guys would need to block the relevant side of *both* eyes, since each
eye sends half its visual field to each hemisphere.

They seem to be assuming that if you stimulate the "healthy" hemisphere,
you feel better and then use that to find which one of their hemispheres
is "abnormal", but then the assumption is transformed into the
conclusion.  or am i missing something?

eye patches won't work.  IIRC, there's signals going from both eyes to
both hemispheres, but the right side of each eye goe to the left
hemisphere, and the left side from each eye goe to the right hemisphere.

Yep. But note that as we move our heads, information about the world tends
to be captured by both sides at different times (except, of course, when
sitting numbly in front of a screen), and moreover the posterior of the
corpus callosum connection between hemispheres, the splenium, exchanges
information between the two halves. So visual data is constantly integrated
across the hemispheres.

Consumer-driven Access to Natural Health Products

Can Natural Health Products Therapeutic Coops working with  small and
medium size private nutraceutical/food product  manufacturers promote
Agriculture sustain-ability and Quality of Rural Life?   I believe the
answer can be Yes.  If one utilizes diligence to increase the system
extropy of the consumer to farmer value chain. (Definition:The extent of
a system's intelligence, information, order, vitality, and capacity for
improvement)

Throughout this article,  I will try to demonstrate how Extropian
Agroforestry Ventures Inc. is creating a new model for Healthful
Businesses.  This model  tries to find solutions for long standing
problems so is a work in progress.  Comments which might make our model
work better are highly encouraged...We do not think we have any monopoly
on making good  ideas practical and workable.

Current  Agricultural Trends:  In Western Canada it has been accepted
that  large equipment  utilizing  technological innovations including
Global Positioning Satellite equipment will optimize agricultural
inputs. Physical and internet marketing of raw product is  balanced by
trading futures and options. Investment of off farm income is used to
build a farm.  Later, investment of agricultural profits into  large
non-agricultural businesses  creates a retirement nest-egg.   Control of
a larger and larger  land base part owned, part rented or leased is the
trend for the next 20 or so years.   If history and other sectors of
agriculture are any indication of the future of Western Canadian
Agriculture, individual owned and operated family farm businesses are
going the way of the wood grain elevators and branch rail lines. There
is currently some desire to move beyond this crude form of
industrialization of agriculture to a  kinder, gentler more consumer
driven one.  The task I feel at hand is to empower small and medium
sized  nutraceutical food/ingredient producers and processors not to go
the way of the  Tyson Foods Poultry factory Mega-farm model.  The
concept that improved quality of life for the customer should directly
translate to improved economic and social benefits to the
farmer/processor  provider of services is best exemplified by the
Organic farming community.  These farms use knowledge as intensively as
their factory farm neighbors use chemicals.

There is  a considerable lag in time between  medical  discovery of
healthy  food  chemistry  and when  people can conveniently buy and
consume these specially selected  foods.
For example, over the last 30 years I can cite 3 specific instances of
drugs of which I have personal knowledge of , which have not been put to
the uses that medical researchers originally found for them.  In each of
these cases company politics and profits as well as government
regulations prevented access by the North American consumer  to  safe,
cheap drugs.   These drugs are Dimethyl-sulfoxide, Levamisole and
Piracetam.   The lesson to learn for those who desire freedom of access
to Natural Health Products is that history must not be let to repeat
itself.

In Canada , the Natural Health Products (NHP) Directorate, beginning in
2004 will regulate 25-30,000  food and supplement ingredients and
products.  Foods such as flax and hemp oil, high omega-3 eggs,
ingredients such as stevia(a natural non-nutritive sweetener), soy germ
isoflavones, as well as all current food supplements and some over the
counter products will all be considered NHPs.   If you have a poultry
farm that grows, packages and sells omega 3 pork or eggs  you will have
no choice but to spend large sums of money to hire personnel, licence
your farm production facilities, and do  things like pave the  lane  up
to your production site.


The cost to bring a new item directly from the farm to the customer,
even for test purposes will be completely out reach for small business
people and farmers with less than 2 million dollars of assets and cash

The pharmaceutical and applied Healthcare industry constantly creates
new miracles.   The spin-off of this is a massive amount of new basic
medical knowledge.  The rate of knowledge creation exceeds the rate of
full application of this knowledge to deliver health products and
services.  The cost to acquire health benefits for the consumer is all
too often  too high to allow people the  full benefits of all the
disease treatments (Example-  beta-interferon drugs for multiple
sclerosis)   Health service providers (USA) and Medicare (Canada) ration
healthcare utilizing a  science which analyzes the cost of treatment in
comparison with  the likelihood that life will be extended.  This
mathematical analysis is called  pharmaco-economics.  Simply put it
determines if  it is cheaper to prevent disease (set aside degenerative
conditions until the very end of life) or  wait until disease symptoms
appear and attempt to treat an already damaged body.  In the USA
Medical Foods have been proposed by lawmakers to be  eligible for
health insurance coverage.

The USA market currently severely restricts hemp products because they
lack  formal  GRAS status and also  make DEA drug law enforcement
(marijuana) more difficult .  Buffaloberry can be sold currently,  but
could in the future be challenged to produce data to support a formal
FDA-GRAS status.  Canada has allowed several markets for hemp and
cannabis as a highly-controlled  pharmaceutical/nutraceutical.

So how does the consumer get direct access to NHPs on their own terms?

OTTAWA, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 22, 2001- Pg  4913,  4914 Canada Gazette Part
I
These Regulations would place requirements on persons who sell NHPs,
namely manufacturers, distributors, importers, packagers  and labelers.
The NHPD considers that growers, who handle and/or treat a product in
order to preserve the integrity of the raw material, are not considered
manufacturers. Heath care practitioners (for example, pharmacists,
Aboriginal healers, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners,
herbalists, naturopathic doctors, etc.) who compound products at the
request of a patient are not included within the manufacturer
definition, and therefore, the Regulations do not apply to products
compounded by these people.

EAV conceived of a better  way to link customers needs with primary
agricultural production and this has been called the Natural Health
Products Therapeutic Coop (NHP).   The manner in which NHP members can
request specially compounded Natural Health Products (NHPs) also
specifically exempts these products from mandatory compliance with the
NHP regulations  being phased in over the next 2 years.  This is the
niche EAV and its  NHP Coop  occupy.

 The members of this coop would also be shareholders.  Members would
consult with their regular medical doctor, alternative health
practitioner,  herbalist, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, or
aboriginal healer to monitor their health and specify   individual needs
to  be included with their own personal bar supply.  An initial order of
base formula bars and consultation would establish that the bar was
acceptable to all parties.  A long supply contract would be entered into
after this.   EAVs greatest weakness is its small production runs.
This becomes its greatest  asset however if its customers demand
compounded variants of a basic proprietary food bar formula unique to
EAV.  Individual health problems or dietary restrictions can be
accommodated and individualized bars manufactured on demand.

 NHP intends to develop a method of gathering health related information
from customers and analyzing this information to verify the specific
health benefits the base formula and individual custom formulations
provide.  This Scientific research can then be published.  After that
application for specific health claims can be made for Lifespan bars.

The end point of the initial Research Permits from Health Canada will be
the collection of sufficient information to support a GRAS Status
application in the USA  for both Hemp products (foliage as well as
oilseed) and buffaloberry shrub products.  As well sufficient data to
support product specific health claims is anticipated.  Research papers
will also be submitted to Scientific Journals for publishing to document
discoveries and  advances in scientific knowledge.

One very special benefit of organizing our business in this way is also
that it will exempt it from (allow voluntary rather than mandatory
compliance) of the forthcoming Natural Health Products Regulations.  For
a small, growing business, the cost of immediate,  full-compliance would
mean that none of the founders of EAV would have the academic
qualifications to even work in their own business.  Voluntary compliance
would mean that EAV could send employees out to further their education
and hire them back  rather than bringing in new people  at the same time
as laying off current staff.

The business Extropian Agroforestry Ventures (EAV)  was formed in 1999
by Arla Johnson, Beaubier, Saskatchewan  initially and  brought in other
partners (investors)  later on.  Prior to 1999 her husband Morris had
performed personal research for 25 years in the area of diet and length
of healthy lifespan.  Their farm, between 1999 and 2002, has been
absorbed by EAV.  The farm land now owned by EAV is planted to crops and
managed as an organic farm.  The land is divided into about 140 strips
by tree rows.  Land between the trees is currently planted to ordinary
field crops.  This is a form of Agroforestry called Alley Cropping.
The first trees were planted in 1989.  About 200,000 trees
(buffaloberry, chokecherry, caragana, sea-buckthorn, oak) have been
planted to date.   The trees were chosen for 2 traits- the first being
that they could survive any climatic changes produced by global warming-
the second was that they might be able to be harvested for medical
uses.  February 1998,  it was decided that the time had come to make
edible products which contained the medicine of buffaloberry, flax,
buckwheat and other complimentary food ingredients.
The scientific knowledge acquired between 1973-1999 was converted into
the first EAV food bars.   During 2000-2001, the name Lifespan was
trademarked and the bars themselves changed from a  formula to something
that was economical to manufacture with a flavor that was good enough
that you did not have to be forced to eat it.  It was as big a challenge
in 2001  to combine the ingredients and make them palatable as it had
been to create the basic formula.

The original powerful, Full-bodied flavor LIFESPAN     XXX-TRA

seed/flour/oil blend, buffaloberry fruit/leaf/bark/stem blend, natural
flavorings (vanilla and vinegar), milled  flax seed, cranberry fruit,
cocoa, specially milled soy-germ,  milled fenugreek seed, a selected
variety of milled  buckwheat seed, soy lecithin, ginger root, cinnamon
bark, spray-dried  bovine colostrum, selected grape tannins, turmeric,
special selected variety of mustard seed, cloves, rosemary leaf, rice
bran, ground sesame seed, Wild Oat flour, stevia leaf extract.

Non THC containing  food products with Hemp Foliage in addition to
oilseeds(oil & hemp oilseed cake - flour)  can only currently be
accessed with a medical marijuana or research permit from Health
Canada.  Health Canada has implemented a medical access program for high
THC cannabis as well.  This program provides 3 levels of access
segmented according to the severity or graveness of the illnesses for
which medical doctors feel they can prescribe cannabis.  This program is
not well suited to all those who may apply.  Many may wish to obtain the
benefits of cannabis without THC in the dosage form of a food bar.  Many
may wish the benefits of the hemp  cannabinoids without the Buzz of
THC.

EAVs founder, Arla Johnson currently holds a section 56" Health Canada
medical marijuana exemption and has enjoyed piloting the use of the hemp
foliage containing XXX-TRA Cannabis bar which has been specially
compounded for her by Morris.

The Lifespan bars go under the basic formula name XXX-TRA with custom
formulation possibilities : -  Fenugreek(for diabetics),
Buffaloberry(for nutritional support during cancer therapy),
Cannabis(medical marijuana), Broccoli(for stress ), Buckwheat (for
heart patients),  Chlorophyll(medicinal porphyrins), CLA conjugated
linolenic acid(for dieters) , Bison pemmican bar(jerky)  to name a
few possibilities

Lifespan bars offer carefully selected food items  most individuals
would have great inconveniences buying individually and incorporating in
precise quantities into their daily diet  in a stable, palatable
combination.

NHP Customers/Members  or their health care advisors  will be able to
specify the specific ingredient options they personally require within
limitations including - personal limits for daily consumption of
individual ingredients,  counter-indications between bar ingredients and
customerss medications and diet, individual taste preferences.
Anticipated customized formulations- deletion of colostrum for the
lactose intolerant, sweeteners other than honey (unrefined  or pure
stevia)  for diabetics, Certified  organic  ingredients, food allergy
related  functional substitutions(different ingredient with same
function).

NHP members  will be reliable long term,  repeat purchasers of bulk
packaged product.  The distribution chain will include also retail
outlets already  selling NHPs as well as existing independent  medical
and alternative medical practitioners and herbalists.  The linking of
primary production to pure science , product development and finished
product sales  is critical.  To do all of this  this cost effectively is
the difference between a  good idea  and something that can survive in
the real world.

Ownership of this NHP coop will be a joint venture between EAV and
member-shareholder-investors.  The NHP coop will also be the primary
source of secure long term revenue to expand EAV past the Canadian
boundaries into the USA by its 4th year of operation.

EAV costs include R&D, cost or raw product, manufacturing , packaging
and bulk distribution.
NHP Coop costs include customer service, final distribution and
member/shareholder  contract setup costs.

Scientists have documented  health benefits of the individual food
ingredients.
The consumption of all the ingredients in a Lifespan bar at one sitting
provides  health benefits not available if they are simply consumed
randomly over an extended period of time.  It is now time to create the
kind of proofs the medical establishment needs in order to recommend
that society in general undertake specific diets to increase healthy
lifespan.

Eav currently sells its bars through stores and independent distributors
in western Canada.
EAV will soon begin to solicit outside investment and provide sufficient
shares to investors commensurate with the risks of this business to
underwrite the NHP creation.

-ground flax seed is used for its heart healthy omega 3 oils , and
antioxidant fibers (lignins).
-hemp seed oil  contains antioxidants like olive oil is a source of
omega3 and GLA fats and plant sterols and stanols for cholesterol
management .  Certain cancers appear to be reduced, nerve tissues
healthier and even the calcium in food is absorbed and put into bone
better growth as a result of a generous consumption of omega 3 type
oils.
-Soy germ isoflavones and the accompanying soy germ nutrient package
promote vascular health as well as reducing osteoporosis especially when
combined with omega 3 oils.  There is reported to be a 10 to 10,000 fold
increase in the overall antioxidant effects of certain
phenolic/flavone/anthocyanin/tannin food components when combined with
soy isoflavones.
- buckwheat (specific variety) .  Blood vessel health(ACE inhibition),
promotion of muscle growth, prevention of Type 2 diabetes are among the
many functions of its flavonoids and tannins.
-cranberries are naturally antibacterial, a natural  preservative, a
urinary acidifier, as well as (in combination with certain spice
components) oxidative stabilizer of unsaturated omega 3 oils.
Cranberry contains some of those useful anthocyanin, polyphenol,
flavonoid fytochemicals.
-spices like ginger, cinnamon, cloves and turmeric are all functional
sources of flavonoids and tannins.  As a group they manage blood sugar,
reduce inflammation and reduce DNA mutations.
-Cocoa as of late has been patented for its hair re-growing and cancer
treatment properties which appear to be directly related to its
antioxidant properties.
-Lecithin is a source of functional phospholipids as well as being part
of the glue that helps hold seal , bind and blend all the different food
components into one.
-rice bran and sesame seed share properties found in both flax and
lecithin but have a different antioxidant chemistry.
-mustard and radish and cress are crucifers or members of the cabbage
family.  Their functional components glucosinolates and sulforaphane are
one key to reducing whole body cancer risk and chemical (oxidative)
stress.
-bovine colostrum contains a whole chemistry of its own.  Your gut
contains nearly the same number of microbes living within it as you have
cells in the rest of your body.  Lo and behold recent discoveries
suggest that gut chemistry profoundly effects ....maybe going so far as
to turn on and off genes in distant unrelated parts of the body.
Colostrum stabilizes immune function as well as promoting what is
believed to be a stable positive gut ecosystem.
-buffaloberry berry components have been shown to work together with
colostrum in maintaining gut health as well as being a source of
fytochemicals similar to buckwheat and cranberry.
-hemp seed flour is very high in arginine, an amino acid.  In the USA, a
food bar , the Heartbar promoted to treat or prevent heart disease is
on the market This bar  has only one functional ingredient L-arginine.
-Grape tannins, anthocyanins,flavonoids are the red wine derived
factors promoted as the French heart health diet factor   In this bar
they also interact with the soy isoflavones for added benefits.  Tannins
inhibit cancers, treat glaucoma to name but 2 of their functions.
-Taken together ,  buffaloberry shrub leaves, branch growing parts and
tree bark  has tested as being able to neutralize nearly 100% of all
(ROS) body damaging free radicals.   Buffaloberry form the core
feature of EAVs Agroforestry farming practices which combine annual and
perennial organic crops in narrow strips with trees
-Fenugreek and Stevia together manage both high and low blood sugar and
promote weight loss

Yeah. I forgot about way it's split. OK. I'm not sure is both eyes- glasses
with the left half of each lens covered or the right half of each lens
covered would do the job.

Fashion problems notwithstanding, it does offer a strategy of sorts. It will
be interesting to see if it filters out to the trickpsychlists. It seems
simple enough.

I've found that it's not so good when I'm bad, and not so bad when I'm good.

Extropians aim to get better at being "bad" when that's good, while getting 
worse at being "good" when that's bad.

It's too bad that's what good is sometimes thought to be bad.

Kids with Bombs
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/opinion/05KRIS.html?pagewanted=print&position=top

I'd be interested in the libertarian take on the arguments.
Precisely when is it reasonable to strap bombs ones body
and kill non-military personnel to eliminate the "oppressors"?

After all, aren't the Palestinians simply trying to create an independent
state where they can have "self-direction" (principle 6) and just
opposing "authoritarian social control" that prevents a "open"
society (principle 5)?

Perfect practice makes perfect. Being bad appears to be an ESS (evolutionarily
stable strategy). Not calling it right just because it's "natural"...

"Constantly" is not the same as "instantaneously". I maintain that there might
be something to some of this laterality jazz, even though most of us have
never had Dr. Phibes do a commisurotomy on us.

Dan L., all:

Sorry for the ramble, I'm in a bit of a humor. And I'm asking myself all this,
too. Thanks for the article, Dan L. Passing this along to the usual suspects
and others I would appreciate hearing from, if the spirit moves.

You know the echoes I hear from Palestine? I hear echoes of the French and
Indian wars.
No such thing as a noncombatant--the only good one is a dead one. And so on,
ad miserere (pardon the bastard Latin. I'm not nauseated, my sick feeling goes
to my soul).

Scalp taking was invented, or at the very least enthusiastically prosecuted,
by terrorists--barbarians, in more classical terms: Europeans, with a trapping
(& skinning) background and a practical attitude toward bounties in a day when
travel overland was a chore.

It became the fighting norm for "them stinking savages" in a few short
decades. The extrapolation to today disturbs me greatly, but I don't see it
petering out on its own. The Ghost Shirts didn't have the option of strapping
bombs to their chests.

Sidebar: Modern loose parallel to the trappers' innovation could be the
Claymore mine: Invented by a Scotsman. Probably the source of the lion's share
of MUF (materials-unaccounted-for) C4 high explosive around the world. A human
meat grinder about the size of a canteen that can reliably kill at 60 yards in
open air. Sauce, as they say, for the gander.

A straight line cultural extrapolation (not the only curve, by any means, and
I know you've heard most of it before):

Pressure and encirclement by The Civilized Ones (sarcasm and sincerity
even-steven at 50-50 when I say that) necessitates a new Manifest Destiny of
global reach; overwhelming and implacable force to save the fruits of
civilization and a way of life--blind spots, brain tumors and all. Corporate
camp followers will of course fatten on the opportunities, all with the
sincerest soap inserted in their 90-second sponsorship plugs on PBS, the
avowedly least-fascist network. Hey, they even let Noam Chomsky on, every
couple of years.

Independent of the current US administration's rhetoric about "a time and
place of our choosing", the USA (or Western Civilization, take your pick)
doesn't get to decide when "this" fight is "over" unless it becomes something
even more corruptible and imperial than its worst critics think it is now...
--bomb "them" (fifty thousand? twenty million? one billion? two?) flat and
send their kids to all be raised by Clifford Huxtable?;
--force the tech divide to accelerate so far that the have-nots _can't_ hurt
the haves?;
--high-resolution EEG/ERP "loyalty checkpoints"?
--Half the population watching the other half, aided by videofed neural nets
looking for hincty body language caught by ubiquitous cameras?
...none of which are exactly off-the-shelf from The Sharper Image in AD 2002.

The US homefront is still in Sitzkrieg. Joe and Marge Sixpack have yet to
become John & Mrs. Bull during the Blitz, let alone Yitzakh and Sarah Cohen in
the Negev, or Nguyen and Cai Phung in "French" Indochina...

Paging Winston Smith and Boxer the draft horse. Please go to the nearest white
courtesy telephone.

Kids With Bombs

By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/opinion/05KRIS.html

ABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP,
Gaza Strip

To understand why Ariel Sharon's harsh tactics are self-defeating, come here
to this crowded refugee camp and talk to young Palestinians.

Kids here increasingly do not want to grow up to be firefighters, policemen or
presidents. Instead, they aspire to become shahid, martyrs, and to die blowing
up a few Israelis.

One cute 8-year-old boy showed me a portrait his family had taken of him
clutching an AK-47 rifle. He initially lied and said that his older brother
was a shahid  then he hung his head and admitted that no, his brother is
alive and never did anything so grand.

President Bush made the right moves yesterday, calling for an end to the
Israeli incursion into the West Bank, urging Arab leaders to denounce suicide
attacks and sending Colin Powell to play midwife to a peace process that
refuses to be born. Still, to travel in Gaza is to be reminded that people
here react not so much to speeches by either American or Palestinian leaders,
but rather to their own social dynamic and to Israeli actions.

After lots of surreal conversations with aspiring shahid, I believe they're
living in a delusional universe shaped in part by the gutlessness of
Palestinian leaders and in part by their own rage as Israeli tanks in the West
Bank crunch through Palestinian cars, homes and hopes. Unless Mr. Sharon and
Mr. Powell can outline steps that will lead the Palestinians to statehood, and
thus sprinkle hope in the occupied territories, then I fear that popular
support for shahid is so great among Palestinians that the parade of killings
will continue.

One neighborhood here is celebrating  and that's the right word  the death
of Mahmoud Saleh, 22. On Tuesday night, enraged by television images of
Israeli forces in Ramallah, his family said, he sneaked into Israel and shot
one soldier to death and injured three others before being killed himself.

"We're not sad at his death," said his elder brother, Adnan, a professor of
water resources who earned a Ph.D. in Europe. "We're happy. We are eight
brothers, and we will continue his way."

The mother, Aisha Saleh, at first boasted that she had been thrilled to hear
of her son's death. Then that bold front collapsed. "I was extremely sad," she
admitted. "I cried a lot. But now I see that he died for a purpose. I have
more sons for this cause."

I clapped Adnan on the shoulder, and asked if she would be happy to lose him,
too.

Mrs. Saleh hugged Adnan, the best-educated man in the neighborhood, and shook
her head. "No," she acknowledged. "Not Adnan. I love them all, but Adnan, he
is very dear to me. I will not let him go."

In Gaza City, a dozen high school boys interrupted their soccer game to tell
me that they all wanted to attack Israeli civilians and become shahid. I asked
the boys what kinds of targets they would choose to bomb. For example, would
they feel comfortable blowing up a group of Israeli women?

"That's O.K.," said Motaz Abuleilah, 15. "They all fight in their army.
There's no distinction."

What about bombing an Israeli girls high school?

"Fine, fine," said IbrahimAbudaya, 18. "God knows, the girls will become
fighters."

What about the American Embassy?

"Excellent!"

What about a crowd of Israelis, but with a few Muslims as well?

That prompted disagreement. But in the end the boys agreed that they could
sacrifice a few Arabs in Israel because, as one put it, "They are not living a
proper life there."

What about bombing an Israeli nursery school?

"No, no, no." All the boys drew the line at infants. They beamed in pride at
their humanitarianism, as I ached at their lack of it.

One postscript: I checked the family's story about how Mahmoud Saleh died. The
Israeli Defense Forces said a terrorist was killed that night while attempting
to sneak into a kibbutz, but that he didn't manage to kill anyone. The only
Israeli casualties were two soldiers lightly injured.

I suppose it's good that his family was only lying, trying to bolster his good
name by boasting falsely that he had spilled Jewish blood. But it makes the
mood here seem more absurd, pointless and tragic  and desperately in need of
change. ?

1) Regarding lower procreation how come no one mentions contraception?

We were given a desire for SEX, much more than a desire for BABIES (I
have a constant desire for sex -- not for babies). In the ancestral
environment, they amount to the same. In ours, they don't, and having
babies is deliberate, regardless of sex.

In fact this is another example of disadaptation, though in that case
it's a problem for the genes, and (apparently at least) not for the
individual. We still compete for sex and enjoy it when we get it as we
once did, though it has only accidentally a relationship with
procreation.

2) Another reason for lower procreation I can think of would be an
adaptation that links the number of offspring to how bright the future
(not just the present) looks. While you correctly pointed out that
increasing the wealth of offspring by investing more on less of them
(instead of investing less on more of them) only made sense
genetically if the final number of descendants was increased that way,
it might actually be the case depending on what the future holds.

Providing one or two children with a university education, tons of
love and attention, even financial support through adulthood, may seem
like overkill (in terms of descendance maximisation) in the PRESENT
environment, but it may turn out that it augments their chance of
making it through an extremely difficult FUTURE.

There may be an adaptation that says: if you're worried about the
future in general, restrict the number of offspring an increase the
investment on each. And we may be in such a situation. Think baby-boom
after the war: the future looks bright, people do lots of babies. Now,
though the Extropians are a group with hope, the future looks to most
people like very uncertain.

I'd be interested in the libertarian take on the arguments. Precisely
when is it reasonable to strap bombs ones body and kill non-military
personnel to eliminate the "oppressors"?

After all, aren't the Palestinians simply trying to create an
independent state where they can have "self-direction" (principle 6) and
just opposing "authoritarian social control" that prevents a "open"
society (principle 5)?

-And this chilling little excerpt from:
http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/e-sermons/sermon9.html#glf

"What our critics fail to understand is that the Church is not merely
opposed to technology. This would hardly be news. The Church is opposed to
the primordial "will to manipulate" that gives rise to technology. In short,
from the Church's point of view, the tools-wielding primates are an
evolutionary loose cannon, an accident waiting to happen, and either the
primates must voluntarily return to their rightful role within the organic
food chain of the biosphere, or the experiment must be forcibly terminated.
Because we would rather see the experiment terminated than see even one more
acre of trees cut down in the name of any form of human-defined "progress",
we are called "agents of fear."

Obviously our philosophy forces individual humans into two categories: those
who are willing and capable of returning to their rightful role as the "eyes
of the world," and those who are not. As we have repeatedly pointed out, the
remaining Native Americans tribes are fine examples of humans who have both
the will and the capability to make this transition, largely because they
foresaw it hundreds of years ago, and have been preparing for it ever since.
The vast multitudes who are unwilling and incapable, including myself and
the majority of the followers of this church, are Useless Vermin, and must
be eliminated so that the Earth can heal herself."

They are of course not merely my opinions but those of numerous
Israelis and American diplomats.

I wonder how many of those militants are now in Israeli custody?

The bottom line is that when a peace deal is signed, these
militants will have to be dealt with. The free hand they currently
have under Arafat will be gone...

I think the Israeli government has made some mistakes, the
Palestinians nothing but mistakes, but it was the American
administration I was refering to.

We are attempting to hold the Israelis to a different standard on
dealing with terrorists than the one we practice.

This is wrong.

I am not a card carrying Libertarian, but this fits the definition
of terrorism in my book.

No, not at all. What the Palestinians have been trying to do since
the day Israel was formed is destroy Israel, that's how the
Israelis became occupiers.

Violation of all the principals.

Muslims seem to be culturally required to claim any defeat as a great
victory. Just look at how Saddam claimed he won the Gulf War.

Yes, I do read what the Palestinians are really saying, not just what
comes through the European and American media. Most Palestinians will
not accept just the West Bank and Gaza, they want to drive Israel into
the sea. They have no intent to recognise Israel as a sovereign nation,
which is one reason why the Palestinians launched the latest wave of
suicide attacks, in order to scuttle the Saudi peace proposal (note that
proposal was actually written by Condoleeza Rice). The other reason they
scuttled the deal was because the Palestinians receive backing from
Saddam Hussein, who finances the bounties that the families of suicide
bombers receive. Saddam doesn't want the Palestinian problem solved
because then the US would have the liberty to then go after removing his
regieme.

Ummm... I pay for the research when I buy the car, pay for the medical
care, buy my food, etc.  They amortize research expenses the same way I
do for my businesses.

### The historically low prices for food (in constant dollars, or a
percentage of average income), the highest-ever quality of medical care, the
best ever cars - all include the results of government-sponsored research.
The market price accounts only for a part of their value - the effort their
producers put into their manufacture. The cost of the public investment is
not included, because all of the suppliers had free access to it. Therefore,
taking a shot of penicilline without the willingness to pay for basic
research is equivalent to freeloading.

-----

If your line of thinking is correct, how is it that Americans were so
technologically innovative in the 19th century absent taxation?

### Low lying fruit - a hundred years ago a moderately affluent private
person, out of curiosity or hope of social recognition, could finance a
serious research effort in biology, physics, or chemistry. It was much
easier to be innovative, because there were so many simple things to
discover. The discovery of DNA by Miescher only required a mortar and
pestle, hand-operated centrifuge, some common cheap chemicals. Inventing the
telegraph needed only a brilliant idea, and some wire.

Now the situation is different - if you want to understand the way from DNA
to the function of the brain you need serious cash. Without public support
only a fraction of today's research funds would be available. Work without
immediate uses would remain unpublished, or not be done at all. It would
mean no uploading this century.

There is a difference between being rational and being practical or
pragmatic, as there is a difference between being rational and
rationalizing. Too many color their rationalizing excuses as 'being
rational', being 'practical' or 'pragmatic' or 'reasonable', etc.

It isn't. The Palestinians rationalizations for this are similar to bin
Laden's rationalizations for the WTC attacks: Since all Israelis serve
in the military at some time in life, then all Israelis are lawful
combatants for their entire lives.

Bin Laden said the 911 attacks were lawful because all Americans pay
taxes to the government which oppresses the rest of the world.

The Libertarian take is that the only reasonable use of force is against
those *individuals* who are specifically initiating force against you,
and organizations which do so as specific policy of the organization.

You then run into the problem of distinguishing intiation of force with
weapons versus initiation of force with paperwork, writs, permits, and
bulldozers. The primary justification I can see for Palestinian actions
is when they target Israeli settlements activities, the razing of
Palestinian communities and homes in order to build Israeli settlements.
Aren't these actions an 'initiation of force' that libertarians should
oppose? Of course.

If you accept that such bureaucratic attacks are wrong, you are then
left with a debate as to when exactly is the expiration date on
injustice. The Jews once owned Palestine and were forcibly ejected by
the Muslims, Romans, Crusaders, etc. If the Israeli actions of 1948 are
wrong, why are the Muslim actions of the middle ages not wrong?

As someone else said, there is no such thing as a 'right to a state'.
Moreover, they are hardly opposing authoritarian social control, since
the Palestinian Authority could hardly be less democratic.

As it is, I am amazed that so many Extropians seem uncomfortable with the
(relatively) small imposition that the taxes used for research are, but
somehow nobody addresses the brutal, arrogant attack on liberty that goes on
every day on almost all roads - the highway speed limits, imposed primarily
as a source of income and employment for the enforcers. Such limits grossly
infringe on the right for self-direction, imposing arbitrary limits in the
name of "safety". Whose safety is it, if 95% of all motorists seem not to
care? Yet, instead of rising in righteous anger, they flinch at the sight of
a lurking cop, and lamely beg him for mercy.

Just a little private rant here - I'm one of the victims of the latest
funding drive on the local highway. And I did go to court.

This implies that there's a smorgasbord of countries to choose from,

### This is incorrect - I am one living example that you can choose your

How about the Open Society (#5)? "Preferring...exchange over
compulsion". If citizens are compelled to support the Master Plan run
by the wise and rational Benevolent Dictator, who, after all, just
wants to make things better for everyone, I don't think that's
consistent with Open Society.

Because your plan is obviously best. Uh huh. And since you deem them
irrational, it'd probably be OK to expel them or round them up and,
er, recycle their components, maybe? To tolerate irrationals would be
downright irrational.

### No, luckily most of the time it's best to ignore them.

I don't think the goal is race toward Extropia as fast as possible,
damn the consequences, ignore the collateral damage, etc.

### My goal is not absolute liberty, regardless of the collateral damage
(=innocent lives lost).

-------

 I think we
should proceed deliberately and gradually, following the Principles as
much as possible along the way.

### I think we should proceed as quickly as reasonably possible, because
this best serves my first principle - 

"An innocent life wish may not be thwarted".

Oh, contraception is the #1 means to that end.  The question is, why is that
an end?  Parent-child interaction IMO show that genes can give us the desire
to have and raise children.  Why is that not an obsessive desire,
outweighing all others?

Absolutely!  And that's the way I like it.  People are worth more than
a carbon-based polymer (basically, plastic).  I don't think that plastic
is a match for our minds and culture.  But,

Indeed. In fact there is a very good book on this subject:

The washingtonpost.com site recently tried popup ads. I sent

an e-mail to the web master saying in effect that I was willing
to tolerate the old format, but not the popups, and that I would
implement software to silently suppress the popups and that if I
were forced to go to all that trouble I would also suppress the
in-line ads. Apparently I was not the only objector: the popups
have apparently gone away.

You do not have to put up with popup ads. If they annoy you enough,
do the research to learn how to suppress them. Please note: the
web sites you use need to make money somehow. Apparently, someone
somewhere believes that these popups are worth real dollars. I
don't see it myself. If all of us band together and convince the
advertisers we do not want popups, then the advertisers will quit
using them. But they may also quit paying for web advertising
altogether, and we may begin losing sites.

Right, but I don't think it's Extropian to completely ignore any of
the Principles.

I don't object to funding research, I object to people being forced to
fund research. I also object to unreasonable speed limits and all
sorts of other stupid laws, but, obviously, most people aren't all
that bothered by them. Typical tyranny of the majority.

No, it's not. The current choices pretty much suck. The fact that you,
or even many people, have changed countries doesn't mean that lots of
people aren't stuck where they are or that there are better choices
for everyone.

Good for you, but I didn't say nobody could change countries.

I'm not worried about being punished for advocating freedom, I just
think it's futile to lobby current congressman. For now, my plan is
support those whose ideas are compatible with mine until, hopefully,
people start objecting on a large scale.

So you're willing to save people's lives, whether they want to be

I have no problem with "as quickly as reasonably possible"--I never
said I wanted slow progress, just gradual.

Maybe it's nixed for females, but males still face sexual selection and
low wealth and power do block reproduction for males today.

In the environment of evolutionary adaptation, the only way to delay
reproduction was to not have sex. People don't experience a lower sexual
drive when they encounter somebody more knowledgeable or new fun things to
do, so I don't think your hypothesis is correct.

True, for reproduction outside of committed relationships.  If that kind
of  reproduction became dominant we'd see women evolve to become
baby machines and men evolve to be more appealing for babymaking
flings.  That's still not very nice.  I suspect that would select more 
for sports stars and entertainers rather than professors and CEOs.  
At present most reproduction takes place in the context of a relationship
and the main pressure on men will be becoming more accepting and
encouraging of large families.

People always have seemed able to control their reproduction rates,
judging by the enormous variation in birth spacing in "primitive" 
society (1 to 5 years).  There's extending lactation and non-reproductive
sexual encounters, plus the possibility of some unconcious biological
manipulations.  The demographic revolution antedates modern contraception 
by almost a century; it started in mid-century France.  Granted, 19th
century Frenchwomen had access to vast amounts of knowledge denied
to a Amerindiam tribeswomen, but I think people have always been fairly
sharp about reproduction.

In the wild speculation deparment, I recall studies indicate female 
homosexuality is very labile.  Perhaps that provides one way for women
to control reproduction?

This is absolutely the logical extrapolation of our (USA's) current
trajectory. and
I do not see any other BETTER way to go about it.  I find the talk of "clash
of
civilizations" annoying because I see it as  a clash between civilization
(i.e. the
Western World) and barbarism/terrorism/evil/subhumanism/devolution/etc. I
hope
to help fight terrorism by joining the Dept. of Defense and helping to find
better,
more efficient ways of killing the Evil Ones who tend to be both Arab and
Muslim.

I think it was said best here:

Personally, I would tend to worry more about the effects of evolution on the
moral architecture.  Currently we have, as the emergent result of some
political adaptations plus some new cultural knowledge that was not
environmentally present, the ability to look back at evolution and be
horrified.  We have the ability to use contraceptives.  If, for some
unimaginable reason, evolution continued for another million years, I'd be
worried that we'd end up as Moties - organisms with intelligence almost
completely enslaved to reproductive drives.  Right now we're operating on
momentum; intelligence is a recent innovation to which the rest of the
cognitive architecture has not yet had time to fully adapt, and so
intelligence plus the rest of the architecture yields behaviors that are
interesting and beautiful from our perspective but of no utility or negative
utility to evolution.  Just the fact that we can distinguish our perspective
from evolution's is one such emergent behavior.  Under natural evolution,
I'd worry that we ourselves would lose the complex structure of moral
reasoning that I'd like to transfer to Friendly AIs, and end up as bacterial
intelligences with the single top-level goal of infinite reproduction and no
philosophical complexity.

Of course, evolution is about to be slapped into oblivion, so who cares.

Randal,

I did find "mind uploading" to be a bit too fanciful and fantasy-like until
I read Kurzweil's
The_Age_of_Spiritual_Machines (and part of NanoMedicine).  This was the
first time
that neuro-nanobots and the economic drivers toward this made realistic
sense to me.

Since then, I have found reputable research regarding EEGs hooked up to
quadriplegics,
neural interface design for artificial limbs and, of course, Kevin Warwicks
experiments
detailed at http://www.kevinwarwick.org/.  The nanotech research or
"enabling technology"
that must precede it is heating up in both US gov. funding (www.nano.gov)
and much
private funding.  I do find mind uploading dramatically more realistic and
even fairly
near-term (2020 or 2030). - Bill.

Right, but I don't think it's Extropian to completely ignore any of
the Principles.

### I think I am not ignoreing anything important. See below.

I don't object to funding research, I object to people being forced to
fund research.

### As I said in another post, I am all for allowing everybody to opt out of
paying taxes. For example, those unwilling to pay for the army should be
allowed to keep their cash. Of course, the local territorial protection
service may then choose to inform all parties (e.g. Chinese organ traders,
the Taliban, etc) that the person in question is no longer under the army
protection. If they decide to harvest you, and you just happen to have
insufficient firepower, well, it's deplorable, but as they say, it's no skin
off my nose. 

Same applies to results of scientific research - opt out by switching to
herbal medicines to treat your pneumonia, which in contrast to the
antibiotics used now, were developed with private funds.

------


> My goal is not absolute liberty, regardless of the collateral damage

So you're willing to save people's lives, whether they want to be
saved or not? Do you also support seat belt laws?

### Here is the crux of the matter - I fully agree with you that saving
anybody against his/her will is wrong. The first principle is "An innocent
life WISH may not be thwarted" - it's not the life, it's the wish that
counts. That's why I oppose seat belt laws. But then, on the other hand, the
enforcers might be paid by insurers to investigate and report drivers who do
not use seat belts. Their insurance premiums may be adjusted to reflect the
risk they are.

Almost all of us wish to survive, especially here on the ExI list. Certain
services which greatly enhance our chances of survival (territorial military
protection, basic research, provision of certain types of branding
information) can for technical reasons only to a limited extent be supplied
by the free market. A state, or something similar is needed to provide them,
at least until radically new methods of exchanging information allow other
solutions. I do believe the free market is the fairest way of exchanging
goods and services between humans. But, when I have to choose between
absolute adherence to the free market ideal vs. survival wishes of innocent
people, I choose the latter.

As long as everybody can opt out, and die by their own decision, my
conscience is clear.

Rafal

I'm perplexed as well. I enabled the Google Computing feature in my IE
Google Toolbar by hacking the Windows registry. I look at the stats, and I
have some automagically generated id belonging to the Google team. How do I
switch? Or change id's? Or do I have to download the real client?

cheers,

EEK!   probably all you have to do to keep from paying people to have
children is stop starving single, childless people hwo are on welfare.

So that's how they're getting to be #1--by cheating. :-)

It was a real pain for me to figure out how to join the team--
it wasn't obvious at all from the website or the client program.
I had to manually enter the number "346" when prompted for team
number.

It seems to be working now, and I'm climbing up the ranks quickly
(I have a two fast machines that are always on, always on the net,
and idle for most of the day).

Logical as in one-ply? Linear? I think we agree.

Yes, I hear you. Are you familiar with the "Polesotechnic League" future
history by the writer Poul Anderson? A big part of it concerns the gradual
disillusionment of a career military type who gradually figures out that his
very own galactic empire is doomed to downfall due to overexpansion,
corruption and decadence, but if he does his utmost he might be able to stave
off the fall for a few decades, and extend the quality of a few (billion?)
lives.

Do you appreciate the tragedy?

Item: Willingness to die (and the pumped up '"Go-to-Hell" fighting style') has
been a critical component of Western Civilization since at least the
Athenians. Following your alpha male's lead unquestioningly goes back a lot
further than that.

Item: The ability to blow people up efficiently is a development of Western
Civilization. Alfred Nobel and all that.

Item: The Western World, because it is composed of people, includes a lot of
one-ply-thinking people--_vide_ those French trappers I mentioned. Do you
think they realized they were inventing a fad that would sweep the continent
and contribute, in large measure, to the extermination of the "savage
redskin", as taking scalps became the very acme of _native_ savagery in the
minds of the whites? 

Hell no. They were just inventing a convenient token for body counts.

Item: ...Oh heck, forget it. For values of N greater than 3, there may be no
solution. The margin is too small to contain the rest of my proof.


John Walker (the retired Scrooge McDuck free-entrepreneur, not the
impressionable "American Taliban") designed a bumper sticker after the fall of
the FSU. It has a CCCP and a US flag on it; the red flag has a big X through
it and the catch phrase in the middle is "EVIL EMPIRES: ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO."

Hold tight while you digest that bitter joke. Take the point that a brilliant,
truly civilized capitalist could find it in his heart to make it.

You know those random-dot stereograms, the "there's a sailboat in there"
mosaic pictures that used to be all the rage in malls? The brain's capacity to
find the pattern in those is part of what perceptual researchers call
"camouflage breaking".

We're in for a rough ride. My recent post was to explore that, and the
question of how to keep enough mental parallax to accurately break some of
Western Civilization's camouflage, in order to distinguish between what is
expedient for sharks, parasites and people with mental... ...not myopia,
exactly, more like amblyopia ("Lazy eye")
--versus what I deeply love about my civilization.

Boy, thats one I don't have a clue about.

But I would guess if you can track down where Google/IE are keeping
the Core files and temporary work, you could delete them.  Then
install a standard download package for windows and use that instead.

*Or*, if you can find where the client.cfg file is and change whatever
the line with team=GoogleTeam# to team=346, I suspect it would work
next time it got restarted.  You might have to remove the "userid="
as well so it would assign you a new one.

You could ask on the folding2 group and see if you get a response
as well.

Did anyone see the Frontline tonight on PBS about the Mideast mess?  Very

In Viet Nam, I don't recall network coverage to the Viet Cong, their street

between the BBC and Hitler during WW II.

 Lots of Palestinians talking, showing the conditions they live in,  there 
were suicide bombers talking who had finished their training, and were ready.

To make another data point: being raised on scientific (especially
cybernetics) literature and lots of science fiction (including Stanislaw
Lem) AI and cyborgs made sense to me as a kid already. I figured out that
uploading might be feasible as a teenager, and that it needs molecular

that there were people thinking the same and actually *doing* it, was in
Charles Platt's 1991 novel "The Silicon Man", who mentioned Alcor in
Acknowledgements.

Kevin Warwick is a media stuntman, not a scientist. I'd rather recommend

2020, that's just 18 years. We will certainly slay the mighty worm C.  
elegans by then, and maybe will have progressed as far as the fruit fly,
but I wouldn't even bet on an individually accurate mouse emulation by
2030. (But I wouldn't bet against it, either, at least not on a signficant
sum of money). People by 2020 or 2030, no way. We won't even have the 
hardware ready by 2030.

It only takes me a few seconds to infer that by Spike's lights, WWIII was the
Cold War. In the popular theory, NATO / USA won because the FSU broke up, the
Berlin Wall came down, Germany reunified, etc., etc.

Given that, if you want to figure out which party you were at: Where were you
when Russia started rolling into Poland? When Churchill delivered his "Iron
Curtain" speech? Or when the Wall went up? It was somewhere in there. If you
weren't born yet, I can understand why you might have missed it.

[puts on Daffy Duck act:] Ah-HA! _Article_ trouble! There _is_ no "_the_" US
opinion.

I'd say "It's tragic as hell...[that]...no one [in Palestine] seems to [have
listened] to the last proposed Palestinian statehood proposal." And it's
tragic as hell that things have come to such a pass.

There's a line from some action flick whose title escapes me: "This is a
situation that needs to get UN-fucked RIGHT NOW!" That's the magic of
Hollywood for you.

Out here, this fish soup has a long way to go before it becomes an aquarium.

WW4, already? I must have slept through WW3. But, isn't the earmark of a
WW is that there's the most of the world involved in it? As long as it
stays a purely local conflict, it hardly warrants the term. So the less
external parties are embroiled in it, the less the probability of
delocalization of the conflict. The immediate result from this seems to
suggest to not get embroiled in it (apart from exerting political and
economical pressure on both parties, or fullfilling your troop quota in 
UN missions, if any).

Unfortunately, the U.S. doesn't seem to restrict itself to merely offering
opinion, nor even to political pressure.  I don't know whether Israel
still does have nuclear capabilities, but in case it comes to the worst,
it seems the best strategy is to stay away from where they are used. Even
if none of yours get flash-fried, it would seem to generate enough
political fallout to taint you for many decades.

Errrr, I don't know about you, but I don't consider hordes of grumpy people
outspending each other an a mad arms race until one collapses to be a "war" at
all, and it rather cheapens the whole concept of war, really.

Well, no, I was born in 68.

But either way, it certainly wasn't a war, and if I was old enough to have
been involved in world war 2 I'd be slightly offended at the comparison, I'd
think.

Oh, yes, I agree totally.
I'd also suggest that it's *exactly* the sort of outside meddling we've seen
for years which has allowed it to go on for so long.

It's the curse, too, as people think things can be easily solved by
spectacular action.

then No, here they've stopped listening. If my random conversations

etc are any indication, folks here (Germany, Italy) are pissed with
U.S. govt's present and past actions in the Middle East. They don't
agree with U.S. govt. supporting Sharon's current war on the Palestinians,
that's for sure. It might be interesting for you to look at some
newspapers printed outside of the U.S. You can find some in English

If they don't, they're wasting more than enough money pretending they do:
outfitting their attack planes, maintaining their labs and special weapons
depots, and producing ballistic delivery systems and running laser enrichment
lines. I expect any  real-warfare use of the Jericho missile will be with a
3rd-gen nuclear payload, or maybe some hot-shit ECM/EMP stuff. I can't see
them bothering to throw conventional warheads with it, it's too expensive.

Israel is small and close to its threats, and if a real (/frontal) war
happens, has to win fast... or be exhausted in a time measured in days, and
overrun. This fundamental not having changed, neither will their nuclear
option, I expect.

The only country confirmed to have left the "nuclear club" is South Africa,
and they probably never had anything better than a very few inefficient
gun-type "potato mashers".

So it seems that a country has to be in pretty bad shape before it drops out
of maintaining an extant nuclear capability. Or, conceivably, really
enlightened and/or no longer ostracized. Take your pick for an explanation.

Just for grins, let's look at another "do they need 'em?" Prestige vs. praxis:
Does France really need/can France really afford nuclear weapons? Well, it
thinks so--and I have noted before the curious timing of their Pacific tests
so close to formal German reunification. I think the subtext there was clear
to the parties with ears to hear it. A nice loud but distant clearing of the
Gallic throat. Mentioned by no one.

It's a happening world,

Cheapens, eh? The Cold War was "hordes of grumpy people outspending each
other"?

Tell that to the grunting NVA destroying their backs and knees in mud to their
chests as they pulled WWI field artillery pieces up a mesa to take Dien Bien
Phu. Et cetera.

You appear to have a distorted sense of what happened during the period in
question, 1945-7 through 1986-9. This is understandable given your age; you
think Korea, you think "M*A*S*H" and Alan Alda, I bet--not Chosen Reservoir
and POWs whose hands rotted off when they finally thawed. No offense intended,
but I'll take a shot at putting it in perspective.

You were born in '68. So you missed out on most of the hot parts of the Cold
War, and there were plenty: Poland '45, Mao's China, the bitter Korean
Conflict, Castro's Cuba, Stalin through Krushchev, the paired
"impossibilities" of Soviet H-bombs and Sputnik (ballistic missiles meant no
interceptors--suddenly we were naked), the Berlin Airlift, the erection of the
Wall, Hungary in 1956, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban missile thing. In brief,
plenty of fucked up shit, dog. Word. Vietnam's devastation was at its peak
when you came into the world.

Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

You were less than a year old, if born, during the sickening crushing of
blossoming Poland in '68 (think Tienanmen Square version 0); Jefferson
Airplane lyrics about "gotta revolution" are quaint to you, not the horrifying
call to destroy civilization they were to people like Chicago's Mayor Daley;
you were in preschool or kindergarten when the last American UH-1 chopper was
pushed off a carrier deck at the fall of Saigon.

Later you might have heard that the Khmer Rouge was piling up skulls, but that
didn't seem connected to anything. Neither did Nicaragua or the Senderos or
any of that stuff. Reagan? stuffed shirt city. Etc.

To tell you the truth, I understand where you're coming from; the stuff
post-1973 is much flatter, and it _all_ seems much ado about nothing, kind of
like the WWF. What's the big deal? We made it, it must have been safe all
along; everybody knows governments lie and wrestling is scripted. But please
consider...

I don't usually call the Cold War WWIII, but I do think it was a very near
thing and I do understand and have some respect for the people whose
stewardship (by skill or dumb luck) let it be that we never saw mushroom
clouds over San Francisco. Or Kiev.
And if they want to call it WWIII--and label it anything from a gutter ball to
a strike for the good guys--I let 'em.

So please let yourself think about your position, maybe do a little more
historical reading sometime. OK?

As far as I am concerned uploading C.Elegans was solved by Ferrée
( http://www.csi.uoregon.edu/members/ferree/publications.html ) in 1996 until 
someone explains what's wrong with his solution. The fruit fly is orders of 
magnitude more difficult (200,000 spiking neurons vs 302 graded signal 
neurons). IMO it should be possible to emulate a fruit fly on a PC cluster of 
20-100 processors.

ASCI White is most likely sufficient to emulate a Fruit Fly. Blue Gene (due 
2004) should be sufficient to emulate a mouse. They are general purpose 
computers. If the same effort would be put into a neuro machine then the 
hardware side of emulating a human brain is likely in reach now. I am saying 
most likely because we still don't know if neurons are way more complex as we 
think they are (e.g. Penrose).

Oh GET A GRIP.

I'm *quite* aware of what happened, thank you very much.  Despite your hugely
condescending rant, I *still* maintain that the cold "war" was in no way
comparable to World War 2.  I'm sure you fogeys like to feel all
self-important because you didn't have a decent war to go off and be
slaughtered in droves, but it is the height of condescension to imagine that
people my age have no sense of history. I'd say people nowadays have as much
of a sense of history as those before them, if not more so because we live in
a much freer world, where things can be discussed without anywhere near as
much social and government pressure to not talk about certain things, not to
mention the vastly increased media penetration into the life of people
nowadays. 

I found your tedious listing of police actions, civil wars, botched
revolutions and imperialistic excursions fairly tame besides Barbarossa, the
North African campaign, the horror of the Balkans, the *conquest of most of
europe* for god's sake, etc. etc.

Next time you want to get all huffy, do it on someone else's time, or better
yet, be polite and play nice, because all you are doing is boring me. Pfeh.

i'm assuming you are referring to the paper titled 'Neural network
models of chemotaxis in the nematode C. elegans.' .  Very interesting
stuff, and thanks for the pointer.  I would not, though, consider it an
upload of C. Elegans, but an emulation of one of its functions
(chemotaxing).  I really haven't read anything about C. Elegans'
biology, but i'm assuming they do other things besides chemotaxing

for chemotaxing don't seem 'good enough' (i'm referring to the diagrams
on page 6, they obviously don't pass the nematochemotaxturing test, even
though they get close).  If we are able to spot the difference from this
far away, it doesn't seem correct to me to call it a succesful upload.

In the Cold War, all that was at stake was a means of doing business. We
could afford to let marginal pissant nations like Yugoslavia and
Southwest Scrotum, as well as dead weight basketcases like India to
declare themselves 'nonaligned'. The current conflict is between
civilization itself and ignorant darkness. Spectators are not allowed.

I was born in 68 as well. I served in the US military, saw action, and I
can tell you that it really doesn't matter how big or hot a conflict is.
To the grunts fighting it on the front lines, there is no difference
between 'police actions', 'peacekeeping operations', 'counterinsurgency
advising', and out and out combat. It is your ignorant statements that
cheapen the sacrifices of those who actually gave enough of a damn.

I don't recall any US or UN peacekeeping operations ever initiated in
Palestine, at least in the last several decades, so your statement is
baseless. The only outside meddling going on that hasn't contributed to
peace is the constant financing of terrorist palestinians by the arab
world.

Although the company DOES have plans to market it to hold medical data.
The articles I read on it were rather oddly conflicting over exactly
what is going on.

I presume you refer to the following four publications from 1997 to 1999:

     Journal of Computational Neuroscience6: 263-277.

While certainly interesting papers this doesn't qualify because he's using
a simplified model (sans direct input from neuroanatomy, nor cell models
including input from the genome) explaining one aspect of behaviour. It
doesn't account for the entire behaviour repertoire, it doesn't show
individual variations (as verified by laser ablation in vivo and in
machina plus mutants), in other words is as much a worm upload as a 18th
century android is a human. (I'm overstating my case for sake of an
illustration).

I'm a big boggled by these numbers, I must admit. You got bitten by Ray
Kurzweil, or something? I would put the 10^2..10^3 CPU milestone for the
biologically realistic simulation of a nematode, and at an emulation speed
of 1:10^3..10^4, i.e. thinkably far removed from realtime. Assuming you
knew what you have to emulate, which we don't, currently. And while above
resources would be more than sufficient for a parametrized simulation, you
first need to have a fully detailed simulation before you can start to
abstract.
 
While we have the worm mapped down quite precisely (though no contiguous
data sets of an adult individuum exist), this is not true for any higher
organisms, which are also far less deterministically wired, and have a
much more complex behaviour set and live in far more complex environments
than the lowly worm grazing off a petri dish's bacterial lawn (which is
not exactly its native environment, but one has to start somewhere).

> ASCI White is most likely sufficient to emulate a Fruit Fly. Blue Gene (due

You're confusing computational equivalent and biologically realistic. A
100 kNode Blue Gene filled with the right code and data might be capable
of mighty deeds (we don't know exactly how mighty), but this doesn't
happen as long as we don't have that magic conglomerate of code and data,
which is necessarily a great deal more abstract than just digitized
neuroanatomy. We don't have methods to generate such abstractions yet.  
Which is the whole point of starting low, and generating methods. And the
worm is an pretty amitious first target already.

Penrose is smoking heavy crack here, but biological neurons are not the
caricatures you deem them to be.

Their previous plan was to store the medical information directly in the chip. 
But to not have to wait for FDA review, they've changed that a bit-- storing an 
identification code in the chip, which when scanned can be cross-referenced 
with a database of medical information (or anything else) stored elsewhere. See 
more recent article: http://wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,51575,00.html

this is the point, of course. Without a ***close enough*** approximation of 
the computation every neuron does and the topology of them, Blue Gene doesn't 
help. But you were talking about the hardware!

What exactly do you mean by "biological realistic". To me it's realistic if 
the resulting behavior of the ANN cannot be distinguished from the behaviour 
of the original brain. There are gray areas in that definition, e.g. do you 
need to model the influence of drugs. I'd say this is irrelevant. Virtual 
life might get boring without virtual crack, though ;)

For the nematode - a neuron has less than 20 dendritic neurons and less than 
20 axonal connections. The output can be modeled as a single real number. 
Timing seems irrelevant. So what kind of expensive computation of F would 
give me Axon=F(preNeuron_i)? The are gap junctions. I don't know whether they 
need to be included in the model or not. They probalby should. But I am 
really lacking the imagination of what you intend to compute with less than 
6000 synapses and maybe 400 gap junctions which would require 20,000..1M 
processors for a real time sim. You give every worm neuron up to 3 
TeraOps/s. 

The true bottleneck is not the hardware power of IBMs high end, it's scanning 
and observation technology.

Brian et al.,

I agree with your comments below.  The US is very reluctant to
side with Israel "too much" so as to have some Arab support in 
killing off Saddam Hussein and other terrorists in Iraq/Iran. (Later
Syria and even Libya may be included.)  Also -- and more 
importantly -- the US is unfortunately dependent on Saudi Arabian
petroleum.  Once fuel cell technology or some other energy source
can  be found and implemented to replace petro-fuel, I think that 
we (USA) could act more unilaterally with only European and 
other non-Arab support.  Saudi financing of Palestinian and Iraqi
terror is honestly enough reason to attack the Saudi kingdom once
we have enough economic independence from them to do that.

Actually, though I'm not old enough to remember much, from all I've
seen, heard, and read about the Cold War, the nonalligned nations were
basically looked at by the anti- and pro-Communists as helping the other
side.  The talk about not being nuetral extends to almost every conflict
in history.  People generally for one side or another want to get
everyone else involved and project it as the deciding struggle in
history -- as well as to take the moral high ground.  This seems to be
the case with every war I've studied from the [Second] Peloponnesian War
to the Punic Wars to modern wars.

In fact, I don't recall any modern war where someone said, "Oh, the
outcome really is minor and doesn't matter much and the enemy is not
evil, but we're going to get them anyway.  So let's go!"  Care to
correct me here?

Cheers!

Very good paper. I don't find it supports Eugene's estimate of 3TeraIPS for 
a single neuron with 2x20 synapses, however. Quite contrary. It 
essentially says that you can view a neurons as a leaky integrator of 
incoming spikes. Some parameters of that integration are the concentration of 
certain ions (Na+, Ca+, K+). According to that paper, synapse strength and 
spike timing are the dominant quantities for spiking. Spike timing is the 
dominant influence in Hebbian learning.

This is *exactly* what we're doing with Amygdala. We can now run around 1,000 
neurons/CPU with 1,000 dendritic synapses each in real time. If you think 
that the Koch/Segev paper describes neurons detailed enough and then 1 neuron 
eats roughly 0-5 MIPS, depending on the amount of inputs it gets.

The paper doesn't really cover Nematode neurons which output a steady voltage 
which depends on it's inputs. Mammal neurons as described in the paper are 
considerably more complex because spike timing is the most important measure 
both for processing and for learning.

Americans who only skim foreign "news" sources and don't delve deeper
into the editorial pages and other sources of "public opinion" might not
be aware that the last couple of weeks has seen the European press
establishment come out pretty universally against just about every
aspect of U.S. foreign policy.  The brief hiatus from the usual
anti-Americanism in the European press after 911 is over.  Also as
usual, it will take some time for the majority of US media outlets to
reflect this and for the majority of Americans to become aware of it.

I broadly agree with this except for the assessment of Saddam's motives. I
think that while he has pragmatic reasons for supporting Hamas et al, like
most Arab leaders he will not accept the right of Israel to exist. This is
true for the Arab population in general including countries like Egypt. They
may accept that Israel exists and they can't do anything about it but they
will never accept that is has a right to exist. The ultimate reason in my
view is that they will not accept a non-muslim state in the Middle East ie
one where believers are ruled by infidels. The question is why are the
Palestinians so hot on this current strategy? You can talk quite correctly
about how pissed they are at Israels settlement policy etc (rightly so I
think) but that doesn't explain why they have resorted to violence of this
kind. The usual answer is "because they are desperate and without hope".
This is bull. They are doing it because they have hope - that it will get
them what they want. People do not take up arms and get themselves killed if
they think they have no chance. Hamas and the others seem to believe they
will break Israel's morale. I think they have actually made a huge mistake,
they have resolidified Jewish support for the entire Zionist ideal. When
they realise this in about six months they will give up - for the time
being. Steve Davies

    Dr Roger Sullivan, of the University of Auckland, and Edward Hagen,
    of the University of California at Santa Barbara, say there is
    plenty of evidence that humans have sought out so-called
    psychotropic drugs over millions of years.
    
    [...]
    
    Dr Sullivan and Dr Hagen believe that eating psychotropic plants may
    also have played an important role in helping the brain to function
    properly.
    
    They argue that in some particularly tough environments, people's
    diets may have been so poor that they struggled to produce enough
    chemicals to help the brain function normally.
    
    Consuming plants containing substances that mimic the role of these
    chemicals could have helped make up for the shortfall.

Aha, agriculture causes evil drug use as well via poor diets.  Perhaps
it really was the biggest mistake. :)

It's articles like this that I hope will lead a few more people to have
an "aha" moment wherein they realize that the WoD is utterly doomed to
failure.

Lets clearly separate Saddam from "other terrorists".
Saddam is attempting to develop nuclear weapons -- that is very
differerent from Palestinians attempting to develop rockets
to knock out Israeli tanks or to hurl at Israeli cities.

The similarity between Sadaam and the Palestinian leadership
is that both seem to be very comfortable sacrificing the lives
of their own people to achieve their goals.

Lets also be clear that one can probably not "kill off"
a large body of terrorists in Iraq/Iran.  Our activities
in Afghanistan clearly show that eliminating the people
who choose terrorism as a means of attaining their goals
is not easy.  It would also be useful to separate the two
countries.  Terrorism supported by Iraq is coming in large
part from Hussein himself by paying the families of suicide
bombers.  On the other hand in Iran, terrorism seems to be
supported not by the elected administration but perhaps by
the religious conservatives or other fringe groups.  Two
different cases entirely.

Finally, the population of Iraq is 23 million and Iran
is 66 million.  By taking any action against them,
unless it is against very specific, unpopular leadership,
you run a significant risk of creating more terrorists
than you eliminate unless you intend to nuke the countries
into oblivion.

You are dreaming if you think this is going to happen anytime
within the next decade.  I've worked a lot on this problem and
have a solution but it isn't going to happen quickly.

Saudi financing?  Have you not read the papers that Saddam is paying
the families of the suicide bombers or that organizations in the
U.S. and Europe have channeled funds to mixed-use Palestinian
causes?

The only way out of this mess is to begin to educate Arabs and
muslims (and Christans and Jews) in general to "think rationally".
You have to free the press, then convert the educational systems
and change the governments from monarchies to democracies.

You want to do this by gradual political pressure or by example
(e.g. our economic growth rate in a free society is greater than
yours in a suppressed society) rather than by force.

As an observer to the list, I'm getting a weird sense of double vision
while trying to assimilate the two current main topics of
conversation: (1) the difficulty of simulating the behaviour of a
single neuron and (2) the cause and effects of conflicts present and
past.  It seems to me that if even extraordinarily powerful computers
are having difficulty accomplishing the former, how can we expect any
genuine accuracy to creep into our personal models of the behaviour of
immensely large numbers of neurons far removed from us (i.e.
politicians past and present, from our cultures and others)?  I know
that the brain is a powerful neural net designed, in part, to
recognise emergent properties in other such nets (i.e. the behaviour
of
people around us), but I think it's worth bearing in mind that no
simulation we can run is likely to tease out the motives or
aspirations of anyone in the Palestine/Israeli conflict with any great
accuracy.  It's all guesswork, and getting incensed because someone
else's guesswork disagrees with yours seems no different (to me) to
two neuron modellers bickering over the outputs of their
simulations -- especially when neither model may in fact bear much
resemblance to what occurs in a real neuron itself.

Cheers,
Sean

Strongly agree with all of the above apart from the monarchy->democracy
suggestion.  The countries in the Arab world friendliest to the West are
all monarchies.  Pushing them towards democracy only gives
fundamentalists a tool to [ab]use and discard.  Their societies will
_slowly_ become more democratic as they become more liberal and
wealthy.  You see slow moves in this direction in some of the gulf
states or Tunisia for example.

See the Robert Kaplan article
<http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97dec/democ.htm>.  Also see
<http://mises.org/fullarticle.asp?control=818&month=38&title=A+History+of+Folly+&id=38>.
Note that some of the instability in the Middle East can be traced back
to overthrows of Arab monarchies instigated by the US (opposing
British(!) influence).  This is how Saddam's Baathist party came to
power.

On the contrary, The Kingdom of Jordan and the Emirate of Kuwait both
are as democratic as Britain, with elected parliaments, prime ministers,
and cabinets. It's the countries that are allegedly 'democracies', i.e.
Syria, Egypt, Yemen, etc where presidents are essentially elected for
life, that are the problem with political repression. Kuwait and Jordan
maintain stability the same way Britain does: the monarch has the
emergency ability to dissolve the Parliament (though Britain's is highly
restrained).

Iraq was influenced far more by Russia for far longer than the British
Mandate, and the Baathist Party was itself far more influenced by Soviet
aid than anything else.. as the Baathists were in Syria, a French
mandate. If your theory held, the US would have ousted the Saudis for
being British puppets.

Of course we won't mention Israel which is both currently a 
majorly aggressive state and definitely has nukes and other 
weapons of mass destruction - since we gave them to them.

As opposed to Israel which is more comfortable sacrificing the 
lives of other people to acheive their goal?

If I was Palestinian at this time I would do everything possible 
to strike back at Israel.  If I was Arab I would tend to support 
any means the Palestinians used to fight back, generally 
speaking.  Making Saddam out to be a monster and justifying yet 
more US involvement in the area on such a basis is ridiculous.
Again, what are you calling terrorism?  Is what Israel is 
currently doing terrorism?

I was wondering when that would be mentioned.  Do you know how 
much damage the US did to its reputation when it "leaked" that 
it would consider using nukes in its "war on terror"?  Drop 
nukes anywhere right now and you won't have to wait for attack 
from foreign terrorists.  The people of the US would go ape.

Are you out of your mind?  You want to attack S.A. when they are 
the lynchpin of our support in the area among Arab states?

Perhaps we could start by thinking more rationally, not to 
mention a great deal more compassionately, ourselves.  Much of 
what we are doing is not, imho, either.

Contrary?  I think you're agreeing with me.  Several states where
monarchies remain have become more democratic, while those that have
deposed monarchs are controlled by presidents-for-life or
fundamentalists.

What specifically do you dispute from the following paragraph taken from
the 'A History Of Folly' article I cited above?

    In opposition to the British-client Iraqi regime, and in opposition
    also to Nasser's growing influence in Iraq, the bloodthirsty Colonel
    Kassem spearheads the American-supported military coup to overthrow
    the Iraqi royal family. The king and crown prince and most of the
    royal family are executed, and the prime minister is murdered by a
    mob. Years later, after Kassem has alienated all his allies except
    the Soviet Union and is overthrown and executed in 1963, United
    States support swings to a small group called the Ba'th Socialist
    Party. After many twists and turns, coups and elections, coups and
    revolutions, Saddam Hussein emerges as president of Iraq in 1976
    after leading the coup that, with American insistence, installed
    that regime in 1968.

I believe the US managed to oust British oil interests from Saudi Arabia
without resorting to revolution.

Why take the side of the Palestinians?  I know more about this issue than I
really want to, thanks to my parentage, and you can take it from me that
both sides are raving nuts.  There isn't a "right side" here.  The colonial
powers treated Arab land like a turkey to be carved up, the Jews decided to
establish their glorious homeland on the most fought-over piece of land in
Earth's history because God told them to do it, the Palestinians raised
their hate as high as it would go because God told *them* to do it and
declared war on the civilians, and Israel decided to hate back.  The Jews
aren't going to move to Canada and the Palestinians aren't going to build a
liberal democracy and become software engineers.  They're just going to go
on killing and hating.  End of story.  There isn't a single thing you can do
about it except unleash the Singularity.  So why argue?  Why spread the
hate?

Spike, the point is the *restricted local* versus *global* nature of those
conflicts. It's true that those `police actions' conducted by the US and
several communist nations had the potential to unleash global nuclear
horrors on us all, and were proxies perhaps for the avoided WW3 conflict
between the US and the Soviet Union; still, I don't recall there being any
Italian, German, British, Latvian, Greek, Belgian or even French soldiers
fighting alongside the Yanks. That was left to the poor bloody duped
Aussies (which, you'll recall, is a fact that you'd never heard until I
chanced to mention it to you, which makes even more bitterly ironic the
supposed rationale for Australian involvement: that we were *helping our
friends across the Pacific*, who would *never forget our brotherly
sacrifice*. Sigh.)

Rah rah rah, boy you can be rude when you want to be, and yet we all
play nicely on this list, don't we?

I'll state it again for the peanut parade: police actions, civil wars,
counter-insurgency operations etc. pale into insignificance when you are
talking about the sudden and armed conquest of entire continents,
mobilisation of significant proportions of the population of the planet,
death tolls in the millions, destruction of entire cities and regions,
etc.


You can be as self-important as you like, I just think you're very
funny.

Really? The Israelis don't get any aid or help from any other nation?
The palestinians are entirely self-funded, armed and supplied? They get
no support from surrounding arab nations? The jewish and palestinian
diaspora sit back and watch from a distance?

Ahhhh, so there *is* outside meddling. And yet my statement is baseless? 

I see.

Thank you for your sagely advice.

No it wasn't.
Rant away, but it was nothing at all like a world "War"

Do you actually look at "killing off" parts of 4 countries as 
being a good thing right now?  Is there any reason to believe 
that terrorism can be ended by simply killing anyone likely or 
plausibly involved in whatever we choose to define "terrorism" 
as meaning today?  Is there any reason to believe we could, even 
if it is a good idea, kill the terrorists without also killing, 
injuring and otherwise seriously harming hundreds of thousands 
if not million of non-terrorists?  If so then please explain 
how. I am not getting this.  Is there some reason it is good to 
go in and kill people in Iran when the country has begun to 
settle toward more normal moderate state?

Exactly how does any part of this plan aid our goals as 
Extropians?  To me the attendant war footing and clamping down 
on freedom and economic backlash can do nothing but harm to some 
of our fondest dreams.

So, we will happily right off all Arabs as soon as we know

It is such rhetoric as this that wins hearts all over the globe 
to our obviously superior system and understanding.  NOT.  It is 
rhetoric like this and the actions of those with more power than 
to simply spout the same in email that makes us the great 
uncaring Satan of a country in the eyes of many.

*Bzzt* Damien, mate, the juxtaposition you have made is erroneous. Spike's
comment was addressed specifically to the issue of whether the Cold War was a
"war", not whether it was a "world war". Check your target, please:

Begin quote:

  But either way, it certainly wasn't a war, and if I was old enough to have
  been involved in world war 2 I'd be slightly offended at the comparison, I'd
  think.

Those who fought in Korea and Viet Nam would understand completely.  spike

End guote.

As for the issue of "was 'it' a war", I have a fresh "paranoiac-critical"
(Salvador's name for his style) insight.

It comes down to this: some guy sees an elephant, and some others see a stand
of trees, a snake, a rope and big leaves.

The first guy might have Don Quixote disease or worse; the others might be the
blind guys in the fable; or the tableau might be a Dali painting where both
are true.

M

PS: _I_ know about the Ozzies, and I am not going to bother to look up all the
nationalities that died in Korea.

That would be an interesting discussion.  History is replete 
with examples of some stronger power considering the unorthodox 
tactics of its opponents as being 'terrorism', 'cowardly' and so 
on.  Killing civilians does not distinquish terrorism from 
non-terrorist tactics.  Many officially non-terrorist tactics 
kill civilians galore.  For a while we even held the mutual 
threat to kill some or all of each country's civilians as being 
the doctrine that insured peace.

When you have no other way to fight, what will you do? 

Give up?  Go underground?  Seems I remember the French 
underground also committing acts that we might today call 
terrorism.  If the US was successfully invaded and some of our 
citizens took such means against the oppressors, would your 
opinion be different?

Yes, I think so to some degree.  The old agreements partitioned 
Israel much differently than what Israel has forced.  There is 
good evidence of a campaign in rhetoric and action to drive the 
Palestinians out of their home if not out of the country. 
Israeli rhetoric has dehumanized Palenstians to a very repugnant 
and dangerous degree.  Trying to act as if the Israelis are 
simply victim of irrational Arabs in their midst is pointless.

<after throwing up>  Do you really think that we have a monopoly 
on civilization and on a right to live and on all "good"-ness 
itself?  Do you really think "they" (the particular "they" 
changes from conflict to conflict throughout history) have 
correspondingly no right to live and are actually "subhuman" and 
an example of "devolution"?  If so you are in fine company with 
some of the worst and most deadly monsters of human history.

Well, I never said the Palestinians were alright and I didn't 
"take their side" or such was not my intent.  My intent was to 
point out that it is ridiculous to act as if they are totally in 
the wrong and that what the Israelis are doing is justifiable. 
I certainly agree that there is plenty of nuttiness to go around 
on both sides and on all parts of the sidelines as well.

I don't agree that there is nothing that can be done short of 
Singularity.

I don't know how many people worldwide (or even in GB) think of Gallipoli
before they think of Verdun or Belleau Wood, or even think of WWI at all. I
don't know how insightful a single geocities site operator is supposed to be.
Not to dispute or hassle you; just saying, is all.

Not sure I follow your thinking here.  At what "end" would it be

Well, the US public in it's usual fashion may have forgotten, but do not
think for a minute that the US military has forgotten that Australia is
the only nation to have aided the americans in every military conflict
they were involved in over the last 100 years.

The only nation.

When we needed help for the East Timor jaunt, apparently the US govt was
not overly interested, and they were *told* by the military that the
Australian *will* be helped, and they will be given whatever they need.

The Australian liaison went over to washington (?) with a fairly modest
list of requirements and were apparently shocked that they found
themselves at the catching end of the world's biggest military conveyor
belt.

I was *very* impressed by this, I had assumed that the military was as
short-memoried as the public, but of course the military are undoubtedly
the most traditionalist and long-memoried bunch in a society outside of
the aristocracy, if not more so.

So, don't be disappointed if the US public have not been told about
this, that seems pretty standard. The people who *really* count
certainly remember it.

Well, the obligatory counter to your argument is one of the 
excluded middle.  Clearly government science and science funded 
by the rich for their own amusmement are not the only ways that 
scientific research occurs.  Quite a few investors and companies 
notice that scientific breakthroughs tend to lead (although 
somewhat unpredicatably) to huge payoffs.  At the least 
companies notice that they lose when a competitor funds a 
breakthrough.

Now, I don't belive that this third alternative is optimal 
necessarily but it does have the large advantage of being 
compatible with freedom.

Oh, come on now, Mr Broderick, you're always going to be able to find some ignorant webpages on the internet. 

That is a bad bad bad webpage, the rest of it is similarly misinformed regurgitated common american knowledge(tm). But that doesn't mean on an international level, the australian army's action had no effect. 

That not all american's have a laser-like focus on past military action's their relevance, and the involved parties, or even a basic knowledge of history, yes, but I think that's a seperate point, and probably applies to most peoples in the world.

That's the point. Politics loses more and more control to the capital. 
Western governments become more and more dependend of the decisions of 
management boards. This leads to a future neither democratic nor liberal.

Indochina, Korea, considerable destruction in China and Eastern Europe

cities was still considered uncivilized.

If you check the original post I think you may notice that I 
don't believe that merely having access to spare computational 
capacity is sufficient to create an SI much less to do so with a 
hard-edged transition.

So what? Please show a coherent plan of how these computers can 
be used to force the development of an SI.  I don't see that 
they can so I think the worry of that developing from the unused 
computational capacity merely being tapped is unfounded.

If you are sandboxing to avoid it spontaneously evolving into an 
SI then I think the efforts are a waste of energy as the 
possibility being protected against is impossible to occur in 
such a manner.

Now a really good AI team with a very well thought out SI seed 
architecture might me able to do something with such a net of 
computational power but even then the poor overall latency of 
the system would work against the result being all that 
impressive.  Or do you see something that I am missing?

IMO, there is a "good" and a "bad" side, but the line goes right through 
the people there. I call people wanting to stop killing "good" and those 
wanting to continue killing "bad". This probaly puts most of the 
Israelian government plus(!) most of the Palestine leaders on the "bad" 
side, but many more Israelis and Palestinians on the other. 

It is probably part of the problem, that we give too much attention to the 
military/criminal actions and their leaders and give less support to the 
other side.

Okay. Party A says: This my land, and my land alone, because my ancestors 
have lived here two thousand years ago. Party B says: This is my land, and 
my land alone, because my ancestors have lived here since two thousand 
years.

Your rational solution is?

A very nice synthesis! Fwiw, I haven't seen much on this list that closely resembles 'my' model(s) of geopolitical reality, though

Lurking on this list, and reading most of the posts, I didn't see this
connection. Great!
Anyway, I think that the difficulties with simulating neurons are more on
the knowledge side - the horsepower should be enough for little worm-like
simulations, if we knew what exactly to simulate. On the contrary, even
with a good human model in hand, you would be hard-pressed to find the
hardware to run it.

My response is yes, but--- .The evidence suggests that a very large part of
both populations want things that are mutually exclusive. If they are
prepared to kill to get it or to stop the other side getting what they want,
some level of conflict is bound to continue. If a substantial minority on
both sides think violence will get them what you want then it will go on.
The problem is that in situations like this you don't need both sides to
hate each other or even a majority on each side you only need a substantial
minority. The dynamics of group conflict mean that the peaceful majority (if
there is one) will have to side with one militant minority or the other.
This is made worse by modern political organisation. The doctrine that there
can only be one unitary sovereign power on a given piece of territory, plus
the idea of nationalism, makes many, many conflicts of this kind inevitable.
It's no coincidence that serious trouble in the ME started when a pre-modern
empire (the Ottomans) was replaced by an attempt to create sovereign
'modern' states. Steve Davies.

This argument might be of interest to you.

Sufficient? I don't know. However, Moore's law (intergration density, not
performance, that's something different) is still for real, as is
networking technology (though the transition to purely photonically
networks has been delayed due to dotbomb), the architectures are still
sufficiently all-purpose (in fact, in future the trend towards
increasingly dedicated architectures might reverse with the advent of
embedded RAM, FPGA cores and eventually cellular architectures, which will
turn to molecular scale in 15-20 years), the security is still nonpresent,
there is no trend to address the security issue by means other than
actively supressing exploits and reports on said, and the meme that global
resources are marshallable in a concerted effort is firmly out there.

Though we're currently very probably safe, a trend there is. Bootstrapping
AI is hard, but the longer we wait, the more probable it gets.

You mentioned the capital-F word, though. Since I don't see how you could
define Friendliness today, not to speak of scaling it over so many orders
of magnitude (including indecidedability issues at system scale itself), I
don't believe in Friendliness. (Unless somebody can show me a proof that
Goedel was wrong, plus that you can predict state X at t+N without having
to traverse the trajectory of N states -- Always).

My whole point was that worrying about hidden P2P suite cargo is really

networked hardware out there could do that. I was not saying anything
about what that is good for.

You want a coherent plan? I thought the list archives were lousy of them.  

If I was crazy enough to try to breed an SI I would first map the fitness
space of (spiking) integer automaton networks which map well to existing
hardware base using evolutionary algorithms (there are several ways to do
this). This is embarassingly parallel, so it maps well to loosely coupled
node model of current and mid-future global networks. I would experiment
with methods of iterated pattern generation on said 3d lattice aligned
nodes in CA framework from compact genome seeds. After I got that licked,
I would co-evolve the mutation function on above integer automaton
substrate (i.e. both the substrate mutates, the mutation function mutates
(it's important to make an unconstrained yet self-adjusting framework as
possible), and individua composed from both compete), using simple
problem-solving tasks.  Navigation in 3d space (playing against
themselves, and people occasionally), text, voice and image comprehension,
remote system subversion, and the like.

This is still embarrassingly parallel. What to do next is less clear, but
could involve ramping up task complexity, use free-running co-evolution in
hostile scenarios, and the like.
 
Since I don't think doing above would be a smart idea, I have not pursued
the matter in any detail. (In fact if I knew for certain above would work,
and could be useful to anybody I wouldn't have posted that outline).

There's nothing spontaneous about emergence of an SI. It's a (very) large
scale engineering effort. The stuff I mentioned is about hardening systems
against remote hostile takeover, thus limiting the availability if initial
substrate. Because there's a bootstrap effect, limiting the initial
substrate base is worthwhile.

Of course, no one cares about this currently.

We're comparing apples, oranges and wombats here. First, a lot of the SI
creation bootstrap tasks are embarassingly parallel. Folding@home crunches
for about a day, before making a (brief) connection to the network. Many 
classes of tasks are like that.

Secondly, depending on how much "neurons" you can package within the node,
you can reduce the total bandwidth of exchanges. If we're talking about a
3d network, by varying the surface/volume ratio could can optimize the
network to be utilized optimally (in the U.S. alone there are currently
about 6*10^6 machines on cable modems with up to 40 kByte/s bandwidth and
few 10 ms latency on the local loop).

Thirdly, I was not talking about today's networks, nor today's nodes.  
Residential Ethernet currently being rolled out in few parts of the world
gives you Fast Ethernet (200 MBps full duplex on the local loop) access,
with switches meshed over GBit Ethernet routers. First machines with
onboard GBit Ethernet have been shipping already, simultaneously few-port
GBit switches have dropped in price sufficiently so that you'll see GBit
Ethernt displacing most of current niche occupied by Fast Ethernet over
the course of the next 2-3 years. 10 GBit Ethernet is being prototyped
right now, with deployment anticipated in less than a decade, much earlier
in network backbones. Now 10 GBit doesn't sound like a lot, but you should 
look at the data rate processed by both our retinas. And current systems 
are basically overwhelmed by 1 GBit data rates, and can't even extract 
features from a USB webcam properly, which is a task comparatively 
mappable to current hardware paradigm.

Within the decade (give or take a few years) we should see first samples
of (2d) molecular memory shipped, and conventional CPU clocks ramping up
to well over 10 GHz. Unconventional (cellular) architectures, if indeed
deployed, will be capable of switching at several THz scale. Now if (in a
decade or two) I've got a >>10^9 cell system with native switching speeds
of ~10^12 Hz, connected to ~10^10 GBit/s local-loop network as a *single
node*, while there are ~10^9 of such nodes on the network, that's a
considerable potential resource.

And the generation after that will be 3d molecular circuitry based.

1) get the f*ck out of their line of fire (how did you wind up there in 
   the first place? you crazy?)

2) offer good advice (to follow example 1), plus stop fighting, of 
   course), from a distance, carefully avoiding becoming entangled

   just not let yourself be seen by any party, thus avoided to be 
   associated with by any of them with one of their enemies, similiarly
   as you're avoiding raving looniacs on the street)

3) helping people to move away from there might help, but refugees will be 
   contaminated with traces of fanatics, so most countries would reject 
   them

Not a solution, but relatively rational.

Strange notions you've got there.

What have computers do with it? Do you use mathematical proofs when
crossing a street, while avoiding traffic and smiling absentmindedly at a
little kid on a bike? You're still alive, so I presume you're not. Why
should you starting with it, then?

Reality. You're soaking in it. Whether you want it, or not, you're forced
to do a number of realtime decisions in face of faulty data and faulty
models. Something more precise but too late is wrong. There's no helping
to it, unless you don't want to play anymore.

You tacitly assume a complex system will generate even more complex
phenomena at a higher level (trying to avoid using emergence and not
succeeding). If this was always true, science was impossible. Water is
complex, but it has a single freezing point. Superpersonal phenomena are
nontrivial, but unknowable they're not, orelse you'd be forced to do the
equivalent of a dice roll at each decision. Since you don't, they've
clearly got a structure different from random noise.

> that the brain is a powerful neural net designed, in part, to

The brain is a muscle. A substance very like porridge. An organ to cool 
your blood. Cavity sealant. Ballast. Fnord repellant. A mysterious 
substance to keep you distracted from the truly important issues in life.

Nonlinear systems diverge exponentially. Even in absence of intrinsical
noise (you'd wish) and perfect knowledge (you'd wish) the cost function
raises very steeply. Translation: precise prediction of nonlinear system 
trajectories is impossible. (Disclaimer: assuming you're not God).

The neuron modellers (as any decent modellers) know better than this. If 
you don't validate, you could as well climb back into your virtual navel, 
and make home there.

There is a single thing that can be done now by the US government that
would not need a Singularity and would have an positive impact in the
region.  This would be to disengage totally.  No more taxpayers' money
for Israel.  No more taxpayers' money for the Arabs (Palestinians,
Egyptians, etc.) and Turks.  No more loan guarantees for the Saudis to
buy F-16s.  Etc.  No more bases or troops in the region.  No more naval
task forces.  No more Pentagon-pushed arms sales to the various actors.
I would even recall the embassies AND send the ambassadors and missions
of those groups home.

This way, if they want to kill each other, they can do it on their own
nickel and no side could depend on an outside broker to deal with their
excesses.  They would have to learn to get along with each other.

BTW, as a general fact or factoid, I've read that the US only gets about
10% or 15% of its oil from the Middle East.  This is hardly a big
dependency.  If you bought 15% of your gas from Big Al's Gas 'n Go would
you think you were held hostage by Big Al's political context?

My two cents!

I didn't say there was nothing that could be done.  I said there was nothing
*you* could do.  Our role in settling Mideast conflicts seems perfectly
clear and it has nothing to do with arguing the political issues.

Yet, the Arab Emirates peg their crude oil prices to the dollar.

Non-sequitir.  The US dependency on the Middle East oil being very low
does not imply that no nation there will peg its rate to the dollar.  To
use another example, Argentina was pegged to the dollar until
recently -- and that wasn't because the US imports 80% of its oil from
there.  Does anyone here think that the US economy depends -- or
depended -- heavily on Argentina's?  If Argentina disappeared today
would the US economy fall apart tomorrow or next week or next year
because of it?

In fact, pegging to a foreign currency probably has less to do with
import/export and more to do with internal politics.  I believe
Argentina did the dollar peg at the time to thwart inflation -- big
surprise, it didn't work, but results don't tell us everything about
intentions and vice versa -- and to keep up confidence in its currency
and markets with foreigners.  (As you know, I champion getting
government out of the money supply and banking business all together.
This would definitely make for a money system that self-corrects --
rather than one that's driven by politics.)

I don't know enough about the UAE to say and it's only a de facto peg.
The US, after all, still has the biggest and most influential economy on
the planet, so even a de facto peg is not a surprise.  (I'm not stating
this out of some hypertrophied patriotism.  It's a fact, though I wish
other economies would grow faster so that there was less influence from
Washington, the Fed, and the IMF around the globe.)

Cheers!

"PALESTINIANS UNDER SIEGE"
Compiled by the Indymedia News Blast Team

IMC Palestine: http://jerusalem.indymedia.org
Breaking news - 4 April 2300 GMT:

The week-long siege continues with even more casualties and attacks on
civilians and journalists. Six Palestinian citizens of Israel were
severely beaten by Israeli police at a protest outside the US Embassy in
Israel. Nine injured internationals are missing after leaving in
ambulances from the West Bank to meet embassy officials. A group of
Italian politicians tried to enter Tel Aviv to put pressure on Israel to
let the internationals leave Bethlehem; Israel refused to negotiate and
kicked the delegation out of the country. Israel refused a high-level EU
delegation from any form of mediation with or without Arafat; but the US
envoy will get to meet Arafat on Friday. Israeli helicopters, tanks, and
troops fight with armed Palestinians in Nablus. Israel has taken over
1,000 prisoners. Food and water is running out for everyone under the
occupation. Corpses are rotting in the streets. A newborn baby died at
the
Dheishe UN Medical Clinic today because IDF soldiers would not allow the
ambulance passage to the hospital. All reporters within the seige are
being intentionally targeted by IDF snipers.

------------------------------------------------
1. SUMMARY:

Protests erupted when Ariel Sharon, Israel's most agressive military
leader, came to power in 2000, and then brought 1000 armed Israeli
soldiers to Jerusalem's holiest site. The Israeli military attacked
civilians and Palestinian suicide bombers retaliated. The siege against
the Palestinian people has been accelerating since the breakdown of the
Oslo peace accords two years ago. Over 300 Israeli army officers and
troops are refusing to participate in the occupation. Titular
Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, is under siege in his office; Egypt has suspended
most diplomatic relations with Israel, and other Arab countries might
get
involved following massive Anti-Israel civilian protests.

Media coverage of the Palestinain-Israeli conflict is shockingly
problematic, political, and uneven--especially in the United States. But
hundreds of thousands of international readers are depending on
Indymedia
as a primary source for breaking news -- articles, photographs, audio
and
video -- from the occupied terroritories. Many of our journalists are
being held captive or are under siege, while many other people who have
access to the internet continue to publish to the IMC-Palestine site.
This
newsblast contains essential reading to give those reports context and
balance.

6. THE LAUNCH OF IMC-PALESTINE

The IMC-Palestine website, launched 28 March, 2002, brings Indymedia
innovation to the civil war. Using Indymedia's innovative
"open-publishing"
newswire, journalists and activists on the scene have had the ability to
upload articles, images, audio, and video, directly and immediately to
the
Indymedia newswires, without the filters and controls of most media.
With
very little publicity, the IMC-Palestine site has had phenomenal
traffic, a
testament to the poignancy of immediate, and authentic, grassroots
reporting.

INDEPENDENT MEDIA CENTER

The IMC is a decentralized network of independent media makers,
organizers,
and activists working to increase democracy and social justice by
reporting
events and producing information as acts of autonomy, resistance, and
liberation. This News Blast was compiled by a working group comprised of
individuals throughout the network.

The IMC was established to cover the WTO protests in Seattle in
November,
1999. Hundreds of media activists have since set up nearly sevently
independent media centers around the world, including sites in
Argentina,
Belgium, Brasil, Chiapas, Canada, France, Italy, Nigeria, Palestine,
South
Africa, Sydney, U.S. and many more.

Leading Egyptian Government Cleric Calls For: "Martyrdom Attacks that Strike
Horror into the Hearts of the Enemies of Allah"

http://memri.org/news.html#1018042383

Within the past year, Sheikh Muhammad Sayyed Tantawi, the top Egyptian cleric
of Al-Azhar University, has shifted his position regarding the targeting of
civilians in suicide bombings. While he previously stated that Palestinians
should refrain from targeting civilians,(1) he recently declared that martdyom
(suicide) operations and the killing of civilians are permitted acts and that
more such attacks should be carried out. Tantawi's positions were posted on
www.lailatalqadr.com, a website associated with Al-Azhar. The following are
excerpts from the report:


"The great Imam of Al-Azhar Sheikh Muhammad Sayyed Tantawi, demanded that the
Palestinian people, of all factions, intensify the martyrdom operations [i.e.
suicide attacks] against the Zionist enemy, and described the martyrdom
operations as the highest form of Jihad operations. He says that the young
people executing them have sold Allah the most precious thing of all."


"[Sheikh Tantawi] emphasized that every martyrdom operation against any
Israeli, including children, women, and teenagers, is a legitimate act
according to [Islamic] religious law, and an Islamic commandment, until the
people of Palestine regain their land and cause the cruel Israeli aggression
to retreat"


These words were spoken at a reception held by Sheikh Tantawi for Israeli Arab
Democratic Party leader Abd Al-Wahhab Al-Darawsheh and the delegation that
accompanied him. During the meeting, Al-Darawsheh stressed the depth of
relations between the Palestinian and Egyptian peoples, and stated that the
Palestinian people was steadfast, would not abandon its land and would
continue in its path until it achieved one of two good things: victory or
martyrdom.(2)


Egypts new mufti, Sheikh Dr. Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, also expressed his support for
suicide attacks. Sheikh Al-Tayyeb took office when the term of his
predecessor, Sheikh Nasr Farid Wasil, was not renewed due to his opposition to
Sheikh Tantawis previous religious rulings against suicide attacks.


Until now, in all of his interviews with the Egyptian press since becoming
mufti, Sheikh Al-Tayyeb has avoided discussing suicide bombings. But since
Sheikh Tantawi's call for suicide attacks, Sheikh Al-Tayyeb has declared that
"the solution to the Israeli terror lies in a proliferation of Fidai
[martyrdom] attacks that strike horror into the hearts of the enemies of
Allah. The Islamic countries, peoples and rulers alike, must support these
martyrdom attacks."(3)


It should be noted that a March 18, 2002 demonstration at Al-Azhar University
featured eight students who had been trained to carry out suicide attacks
against Israelis.(4) Volunteering for suicide bombings against Israelis has
become a popular expression in Egypt  so much so that Mahmoud Al-Zahhar, a
Hamas leader in Gaza, told the Israeli Arab weekly Kul Al-Arab, "Two days ago,
in Alexandria, enrolment began for volunteers for martyrdom [operations]. Two
thousand students from the University of Alexandria signed up to die a
martyrs death. This is the real Egyptian people."(5)

Between what you've just posted and the "do you see the elephant" Dali model I
posted, I think the problem/perceptual difference is pretty clearly defined.

I think we can move on to other topics "armed" with this understanding.

Ja.  My inexcusable ignorance of the Australians role in the
VietNam on my part is something for which I blame myself
and the fact that our own country was deeply divided.  Ive
always thought of Australia as one of those countries
like Switzerland and Canada that never gets into it with
anyone.

During the entire conflict, my elementary school years, I
never recall the war or any aspect of it ever being mentioned
in school, even tho many of my fellow students had relatives
involved.  At the peak of the conflict, 68-69 time frame,
we were being fed a pile of info about Samuel Gompers
and how great labor unions were.  Never had we been
told about either of the world wars, who participated,
not a word about what happened in Korea, nothing about
why we were at war in Viet Nam or who participated.

We were eventually taught all about the American Civil
war.  Grant and Lee were politically safe.

Unless a child took some special interest in war, which
I did not, that child was raised in complete ignorance of
twentieth century conflict.  The inexcusable part is that
I had two uncles involved in that and one perished, not
on the battlefield but of cancer a few years later.  spike

Not really.  That was the precise point of my posts on Kazaa DC effort.
You could buy access to sufficient processing capacity ~1 petaflop
by buying a controlling share of the company (currently ~$3 million).
It would most likely be a slower-than real time simulation due to
the fact that many of those computers are probably on dial-ups.
But as soon as the balance shifts in favor of DSL, cable, optic
(company or university), or even 3-4G wireless (wouldn't it be
ironic if the AI emerged from our handhelds and cellphones...)
you are going to have the bandwidth to ratchet up the simulation
clock rate.

I suspect that means that all the AI (or AI's creator) has to do
is hack the Kazaa protocol for downloading new versions of itself
(I assume this is built in though I haven't checked) and all
bets are off.  I don't know how many computers are still infected
with Code Red/Nimda taking the machines via that route is a
second option.  Writing some nifty piece of cool software and
giving it away for free on Tucows is a third.

It is going to become necessary to only install software which
has been vetted by a "reliable" (presumably 3rd party) security
focused organization and only accept licenses where the software
distributor accepts liability for any damage the software might do.

We live in very scary times.

Governments fight using bullets, corporations fight using dollars.  I
prefer the latter.  This whole globe should be ruled by capital, not
by governments.  All tyranny voluntary, all rule systems voluntary.

At which point, with Kazaa taking excessive CPU power (unless the AI
part is rigged only to run in an @home style manner, which would make
parts of the AI run while others did not, basically at random - and
fixing it would slow it to the point of unusability), Kazaa users
simply switch to something that doesn't tie up their box.  Potential
for hacking is one thing, which many people ignore; *actually doing it*
is something else entirely.  (For instance: few people complained about
the possibility of spam in the pre-Cantor-&-Siegel days.)

Kai, I would agree with your definition of good and bad, but it
will not work for the court of world opinion.  Your definition
would put the American government on the good side for its opposition
to the war.  Evidently this is a logical contradiction: in the opinion
of Europe and perhaps much of the rest of the world, US must
automatically be defined as bad, regardless of its actions and regardless
of its opinions.  The US is arrogant, you see, therefor it is bad, no
matter what it actually does, including aiding desperate and starving
populations.

For this reason, the definition of good and bad must remain fluid
enough to always drop the arrogant bastards in the bad category,
no matter who it forces into the good category.  spike

Kai, I would agree with your definition of good and bad, but it<br>

would put the American government on the good side for its opposition<br>
to the war. &nbsp;Evidently this is a logical contradiction: in the opinion<br>

  <br>

Nice wish, but it's not going to happen. There's no way US government would
abandon an area that contains something like 75% of the world's proven oil
reserves.

Because of actions taken in the past (by government, industry, individual
consumers), the US government is  now committed to controlling middle
eastern oil production and distribution to the extent possible. A
significant increase in the price of oil would disrupt EVERY aspect of the
global economy. Survival even at the most basic level of securing calories
to run individual human bodies depends on oil. Agricultural chemicals are
derived from oil, including the fertilizer without which farm yields would
be only a fraction of what they are now (particularly since most modern crop
varieties thrive only with high doses of fertilizer). Modern agribusiness is
also dependent on a wide range of heavy equipment run on fuel derived from
oil.

In a global economy it's misleading to look only at the amount of Middle
Eastern oil imported by the US. If the supply of oil goes down with respect
to any significant participant in the world market, the price of all oil
will tend to rise for all participants.

Keep in mind that the practical issue isn't whether or not the US can import
oil at any price, or whether or not there are alternative energy sources.
The issue is cost of energy. If the price of oil goes up to $50 per barrel,
there will be seriously unpleasant economic consequences.  The present
reality for the US and its trading partners includes a price for past
mistakes that will have to be paid. Judging by human nature, world history,
and current trends, the US will attempt to evade paying the price until all
means of postponement have been exhausted.

Of course, unexpected technologies could change the whole picture (although
introduction of even the most useful technology often involves an upfront
social cost that people will resist paying). Probably the most useful thing
individuals can do is to support the development of new technology that
would decrease the incentive to use oil as an energy source.

People generally don't run task manager to watch what is consuming the
CPU time.  You could easily have the program monitor when someone is
sitting at the terminal and typing, or moving the mouse, then go "inactive"
for some period of time.  Sure you lose some of the concurrency between
parts of the "mind" but it isn't clear precisely how much that matters.
As Eugene pointed out alot of the processing may be asynchronous or
may care nothing about what is going on in another part of the brain.
You solve the problem by timing by accumulating statistics as to when
computers are least used and run the timing critical parts during
those times.  You also do what F@H does and send out multiple identical
"work units" and accept the first returned results.  You can implement
system availablity and network bandwidth statistical monitors so you
can develop local clusters that are "free" at specific periods.

Also, because Kazaa is connected to a P2P network they are going to
expect some level of activity devoted to it.  So long as the AI
doesn't immediately jump into "heavy use" mode and instead "gradually"
consumes greater amounts of CPU, the user will assume its due to
more users joining the net.

True, but spam is just a nuisance.  A self-bootstrapping rogue AI may be

I think that the world is a bit more complex, you see. If I claim that the
US is "good" when it's asking for the end of the war, and "bad" when it's
selling firearms and tanks to the parties involved, I see no contradiction
in my terms. The contradiction should be found in the US behaviour, which
shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, given the sheer size of the nation,
with hundred of millions people each with its own opinion. Saying "the US
wants" is an oversimplification, exactly like "Europe wants". Maybe
narrowing the field to "the US govt." would be better. Note that the
equivalent Europe govt. have virtually no power compared to the
individual nations, for now. This gives Europe an even wider spectrum of
opinions.

The problem is, that business entities only aim to maximize their monetary 
win. This is perfectly okay, because that's what the investors (the 
capitalists) gave their money for. But it is also a positive feedback loop 
without any inbuild self-control regarding social aspects. And any system 
without a self-regulation, i.e. a negative feedback-factor, will finally 
end in a catastrophy.

I sometimes wish, that all humans believe in reincarnation. It would only

Agreed, but only under certain premises. It may be difficult to find detail 
solutions for housing, language, law systems, etc., but they won't find out 
if they are really mutually exclusive until they try. So, the next steps 
have to be (1) to learn that violence won't achieve anything but more 
violence and (2) to make sure that stopping the violence on one side will 
not let the other "win".

AFAIK, this was the first strategy of G.W.Bush's new administration. And if 
I remember correctly, several violent incidents have drawn him back into 
the conflict. 1st law of foreign policy for super-powers: You can't leave 
the game...

But I have to admit, that I'd gladly donate the remains of the Berlin wall 
to enclose the whole area, let everyone out who wants to leave in peace and 
doesn't care where, maybe throw in all collected weapons from Bosnia and 
Afghanistan - and wait until it gets quiet. After that, the UN could make 
that land a theme park, displaying the infinity of human stupidity...

A little bit bitter, hm? There's a proverb in german, "gut gemeint ist oft 
das Gegenteil von gut" - well meant is often the opposite of well done...

You'd be perfectly right - if you'd follow Mr. McCarthy and his folk, and 
term everything "unamerican" that doesn't fit into the arrogant super-power 
scheme. Sorry, but the line goes through the USA as well as through all 
other countries. It is a personal decision, where to stand.

   Kai

P.S. Being "good" on one topic doesn't excuse to be "bad" on another. So, 
justifying "bad" behaviour or demanding following with the "good" deeds of 
the past is not a valid argument.

There are a lot of buried "ifs" in there.  At dialup or even 
ADSL speeds distributed all over the country (or broader) such a 
beast would run so atrociously s-l-o-w as to be useless as far 
as I see.  It is difficult to do decidely mundane computational 
task on such a network with adequate performance.  Just adding 
more computers does not drastically increase the amount of 
useful work accomplished for all types of problems.

Not half so scary as this and certainly not justifying such 
draconian methods.  Please do not give aid and comfort to the 
control freaks at large in position to do considerable damage 
today.  This is a much greater *immediate* danger to all of us 
than the scenario you paint.

Do the King Solomon thing and divide the land in half.  Enforce 
the division.  Consider any non-voluntary changes an act of 
aggression by either party.  Respond appropriately.  This has 
not been done in much of the history of the current conflict. 
Israel has been the agressor against the original and all 
subsequent accords.

Be careful with these kinds of "summaries" from MEMRI.  MEMRI is a 
pro-Israel think tank, and their "Arab Anti-Semitism Documentation 
Project" was deliberately set up to discredit the Arab position.  
Although their individual translations do seem to be accurate, their 
selection process for what articles they provide is anything but 
unbiased.  They seek out the most extreme and violent examples from the 
Arabic media and translate only those to represent the Arab position 
they would like to project on their enemies.  Specific facts from these 
translations are probably as accurate as the original Arabic, but the 
overall survey or summary of these positions is definitely selective and 
nonrepresentative.

Google has MEMRI indexed under 
<http://directory.google.com/Top/News/Current_Events/Global_Politics_and_War/
Current_Conflicts/Middle_East/> with this description:  "Offers 
translations from Arab media, mostly intended to put the Arab world in 
the worst possible light."

A review of this organization can be found at the Online Journalism 
Review <http://www.ojr.org/ojr/reviews/1017788174.php>.

Kai, I agree that there are downsides to capitalism, but capitalism
eventually solves these kinds of problems.  The western world had
child labor until pretty recently.  Now it is a struggle to get enough
half-assed 18 year olds interested in 9 dollar an hour jobs flipping
burgers.  

Capitalism solved that problem, India will solve it, Africa will solve
it.  Besides, our machines will soon be far cheaper than even children
in even the poorest countries.  So the problem of child labor will
very soon be replaced with the problem of child unemployment.

I wonder how the press will spin that?  spike

I was hoping that someone would point to this paradox.  Why is it
always the kids who do this, the ones with the most to lose?  We
have yet to hear of a suicide bomber who is a dying emphasema
patient, with little to look forward to other than an excruciating
slow suffocation, a few more weeks of painful wheezing and
gasping.  Seems like the teens would get a clue.

I suppose all else being equal, people get more peace-loving
as they age?  Hope so.  The average age of people on the
planet is increasing.  spike

It seems very difficult to me to run an AI distributed like this. Massively 
parallelizing neural nets is possible but not as trivial as distributed.net 
stuff. If the NN is a spiking network you need to sync it. It doesn't need to 
be exactly synced but the different part may not vary in simTime speed much 
because timing is what the spiking is all about.

Another issue is latency. The latency requirements to run an Amygdala NN 
massively parallel is around 100us UDP roundtrip. This is achievably on a 1GB 
Ethernet, Myrinet or a bus system like the SP2. The Internet cannot get lower 
than a certain limit because of speed of light limitations. Currently I am 
getting around 650ms roundtrip latency to javien2-3.spots.ab.ca 
(www.extropy.org) over 17 hops in spite of having DSL.

The only way to run an AI distributed on the Net is to have autonomous agents 
which talk to each other with a high level protocol (such as the English 
language or a formalized subset thereof). But then it would really be many 
AI, not only one.

I am not even sure if this is even worthwile to try - the bandwidth 
requirements are quite excessive. The network costs would by far exceed the 
CPU/memory costs.

Stanford University Film Department's Masters Degree candidates Elizabeth 
Witham and Elisabeth James have co-produced a marvelous film titled 
"Precipice". The film explores innovations in science about humans 
upgrading their bodies and attempts to isolate the conflicting emotions 
involved in the debate about genetic engineering and biomedical advances 
though an exploration of man's potential.

It's an evenly paced, yet evocative, point-counter-point between William B. 
Hurlbut (President's Bioethics Committee), and myself discussing "Primo" 
(radical body design) with well-balanced and lucid comments by Aubrey de 
Grey, in my/Primo's court.

I'd like to suggest viewing this documentary if it exhibits in your area.

But what about arms merchants and other military contractors?  They make
money when conflict or the perception of threats exist.

I've nothing against the free market, as all of you know, but it appears
right now that Pentagon-connected businesses are thriving.  There also
seems to be a positive feedback loop between such things as arms sales
and the Pentagon.  Why is and has the US government been pushing arms
sales to nations like Indonesia and Turkey -- where they are used to
terrorize the populace?

I think this is largely because young people are the only people who WILL do it. It's sad, but young people are the easiest to talk into anything. I would like to think it's because we're hotblooded and enthusiastic, but it seems more like we don't have enough meme immunities yet. Plus, if anyone tells us anything, it has a tendency to be a significant fraction of everything we've heard. Just cause we haven't been around much, you understand.

I really dont' think it's much of a paradox. Dying people tend to look at living far more favorably than vigourously alive people who don't really examine what they have. I've known a couple people who have died slow and painfully, and near the end, they always seem to be grateful for whatever time they have.

I think people get better at reacting intelligently in regards to ridiculous actions. I see the average age of people on the planet increasing as a wonderful good. So long as we solve some of the nasty mental side-effects of aging, like being crotchety. ;-)

I think its so that the old pervs want to kill all the young men off, so to
face less competition from the young men for the young girls.

Russian Lab Storing Germs Faces Cutoff of Electricity

By PATRICK E. TYLER

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/international/europe/07RUSS.html

MOSCOW  A large repository of anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria
stored in a high-security laboratory complex 100 miles south of here is facing
a threat never imagined in the Soviet era  the meter man.

An official from the Moscow region's Mosenergo electric utility arrived
recently and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment at the
90-building campus, which served as the secret biological weapons program of
the Soviet era.

A headline in the newspaper Izvestia warned, "Deadly Viruses From a Moscow
Regional Depository Threaten Moscow."

Actually, there are no viruses at the State Scientific Center of Applied
Microbiology in Obolensk, just every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied
for use in the secret biological weapons program of the Soviet Union. (A large
virus repository is in Siberia.)

Russian and Western officials say that while it is unlikely that any public
health threat would result from a power cutoff, there is enough uncertainty
that none were willing to say that categorically.

"We have quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency," Gen.
Nikolai N. Urakov said by telephone. He is the longtime director of the
center, which has been working with Western scientists to convert the complex
into a biomedical manufacturing site.

"But we are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity," he
added, "because it is a kind of psychological pressure on us." In the event of
a shutdown, he said, scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments
under way.

About 3,000 strains of bacteria are stored at the center, many of them in
cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment
by layered enclosures and oversize air-handling systems, and all dependent on
electricity.

The greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power would be the defrosting
of live germs now preserved in a frozen state.

"The main threat is to the organisms themselves rather than that they might
escape," said Raymond Zilinskas, a biological warfare expert at the Monterey
Institute of International Studies. "Under the worst case, these things would
be defrosted from minus 70 degrees, and it would be a real mess to clean it up
afterward because you wouldn't know for sure whether everything was dead."

General Urakov would like the United States and Western countries that have
contributed about $6 million to the transformation of the bioweapons complex
to throw in another $500,000 a year to pay the center's electric bills and
arrears. An American scientist who works closely with the center said the
Russian government was responsible for keeping the lights on.

The confrontation at Obolensk is another example of how the basic capitalist
imperative for enterprises to be self-sustaining can clash, often alarmingly,
with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science.

Two years ago, because of an overdue power bill, the Russian national power
company cut electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on
high alert, though the silos themselves did not lose power. Armed troops
marched to the substations and turned the power back on.

Last January and February, the national utility, United Energy Systems, cut
power to a number of military installations around the country, including the
Russian Space Forces monitoring center on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

In most cases, power has been quickly restored. Often investigations show that
the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds
for electrical power instead of diverting money to to other uses, which at
times have included building country residences for generals.

Western aid for conversion of General Urakov's bioweapons laboratory spiked in
1997, when it was learned that Iran had made overtures to the institute to
purchase its expertise.

Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on Western financing to
destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have been known to
orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing.

But Randall Lee Beatty, an American scientist working on the conversion of the
Obolensk facility, said, "This is a crisis."

Mr. Beatty is a director of the International Science and Technology Center,
which finances about half of General Urakov's budget to support about 350
Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians. "We know they have not paid
their electricity bill for 14 months," he said. "But this is one of the
important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world, and it would be a
shame if it were destroyed for not paying the light bill."

The problem with fuel cells is building up the factories large enough
to produce millions each year.  I doubt that will happen soon.  Then
the second problem is what do you use for fuel?  Methane? -- you are still
dependent on someone's natural gas, perhaps the M.E.; Alcohol? -- you need
to build the fermentors and then watch the price of food go up.  Hydrogen?
You need to build a new pipeline system.

The best solution I've been able to devise thus far is solar ponds with
engineered bacteria that produce methane that you put into the existing
pipeline system and use as fuel directly into the cars and/or reform it
into H2 at the pump (or in the car) and run the fuel cells with that.

But you could switch cars over in the next model year or two to run
on natural gas (because we've been doing it with fleets for many
years), then down the road when you have the fuel cell production
capacity switch to H2.

As pointed out by others, it may be important to democratize
"gradually" so you don't end up with a government run by clerics
as happened in Iran and Afghanistan.

Well, don't I feel like an idiot now.  ;)

I never would have realized that the guy who wrote this article is the
same guy who wrote _Guns, Germs and Steel_

http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/anthro/learning/lifeways/hg_ag/worst_mistake.html

The book, I felt, took pains to avoid making moral claims about the
developments he described.  But maybe I just overlooked them.

This article seems juvenile in comparison.  Like, this is the sort of
article Diamond might have written as a freshman and which would have
developed into an objective book-length thesis years later.

He did tend to slide in editorial comments about how clever
hunter-gatherers can be, but it seemed to me these appeared only to
dispel any arguments from racism as to why things happened one way
rather than another.

Am I crazy?  Does Diamond still think agriculture was such a bad idea?
Is that the hidden political message of his book?

Because they're the most credulous. As the twig is bent, and all that.

True.  It's more common to turn off various things until the computer

After a short, but very noticeable, delay to take care of any current

That's true.  And, in any case, you'd have the neurons care about
whether their neighbors fired at time N-1 anyway.  Just saying this
would slow things down to the point where it wouldn't be all that
practically useful.

Which leaves the system open to forged results (once anyone finds out
what's going on) and to acting improperly on a given user's computer
at some given time.  Statistically, a certain percent of users will
become upset enough to leave - and, once they do, another certain
percent of users will become that upset...

But when the load becomes too high, they'll move to something that,
while it may have less users, also gives them their computer back.
Unlike the classical example, in this case there is, at any given time,
potential for a frog's friend to tell them how great it is outside the
boiling pot, or for the frog to find out for itself.

Those have little to no impact on the system - unless they do, and the
system is at all monitored (like a desktop, not like a server you
stick in a colo and walk away from) in which case they tend to get
noticed.

Seriuosly: nuclear war could also be the end of humanity, yet many fewer
people complain about military solutions when their country is not
actively involved in a war.  Not to mention various plagues (natural or
manmade) whose cures could only be found by an AI - and, given when
they could strike, a self-boostrapping "rogue" AI free of procedural
development constraints may be the only way to get such an AI in time.
In which case, *preventing* self-bootstrapping rogue AIs may mean the
end of humanity.

Frankly, the known harm that your solution would impose far exceeds the
risk times possible danger of a self-bootstrapping rogue AI.

.......................
i'm not a medical person, i just experiment on myself a lot.  i had
always assumed that caloric restriction assisted longevity since when
your body is not processing what you consume, it's organs seem to spend
more time purifying and rejeuvenating the body.    i'm guessing this
based on experiences with fasting:  consistently after 3 or 4 days of
fasting, the body purges itself.  the urine becomes very dark for a
while, the tongue gets coated, sweat stinks, skin feels like guk is
coming out of it (this is documented in ayurvedic texts). this does not
feel like it has anything to do with decreased metabolism, since during
the third day of a fast, there seems to be an experience of highly
increased energy (this is not true at all, the opposite is true during
later stages of longer fasts). there is some documentation that during a
fasting state some organs actually somewhat change function (i'm very
out of date here though maybe)... so maybe general ongoing caloric
restriction has a similar but less drastic and more sustainable effect?

I see on boing-boing.net that list member Charlie Stross has a new
short story collection published, Toast: and Other Rusted Futures.
The boing-boing site has an excerpt from one of the stories, Jury Service,
co-written by Cory Doctorow, which I thought sounded pretty good:

   Welcome to the fractured future, at the dusk of the twenty-first
   century.

   Earth has a population of roughly a billion hominids. For the most
   part, they are happy with their lot, living in a preserve at the bottom
   of a gravity well. Those who are unhappy have emigrated, joining one
   or another of the swarming densethinker clades that fog the inner solar
   system with a dust of molecular machinery so thick that it obscures the
   sun. Except for the solitary lighthouse beam that perpetually tracks
   the Earth in its orbit, the system from outside resembles a spherical
   fogbank radiating in the infrared spectrum; a matrioshke brain, nested
   Dyson orbitals built from the dismantled bones of moons and planets.

   The splintery metaconsciousness of the solar-system has largely sworn
   off its pre-post-human cousins dirtside, but its minds sometimes
   wander nostalgiawise. When that happens, it casually spams Earth's
   RF spectrum with plans for cataclysmically disruptive technologies
   that emulsify whole industries, cultures and spiritual systems.

   A sane species would ignore these get-evolved-quick schemes, but
   there's always *someone* who'll take a bite from the forbidden Cox
   Pippin. There's always someone whom evolution has failed to breed
   the let's-lick-the-frozen-fencepost instinct out of. There's always a
   fucking geek who'll do it because it's a historical goddamned technical
   fucking imperative.

   Whether the enlightened, occulting smartcloud sends out its missives as
   pranks, poison or care-packages is up for debate. Asking it to explain
   its motives roughly as pointful as negotiating with an ant colony to
   get it to abandon your kitchen. Whatever the motive, humanity would
   be much better off if the Cloud would evolve into something so smart
   as to be uninterested in communicating with meatpeople.

   But until that happy day, there's the tech jury service: Defending
   the earth from the scum of the post-singularity patent office.

This scenario is a bit reminiscent of the Ken MacLeod books where SIs
on Jupiter were beaming toxic viral memes towards the earth.  Only here
they are less obviously malicious, perhaps meant to goose the Luddites
on Earth into taking the Big Leap.  The disparaging characterization
of those receptive to these messages seems a little unfair, but perhaps
reasonable from the POV of a culture which has evolved a strong defense
mechanism against the techno utopia which lies just offshore.

I don't know how much of this is Cory and how much Charlie, but the
writing here sounds strong and imaginative.  Charlie has a blog at
http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi, and the book is available
at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1587154137/charlieswebsi-20.

Where does this information come from?  The Arab states broke
the original partition, and started the wars of 56 and 73.  Israel
started 67, but the Arab states were pretty obviously getting ready

a nuclear-armed country's territory, leaving it with hopeless 
indefensible borders.

But in our world the perception of threat *always* exists.  As time goes
on, improved communications and transportation are bringing together
cultures that must clash, cultures which would otherwise be safely
separated by distance.  Military contractors do not start wars,
they stop them.  They have never needed to create a demand for
their products.

Notice that one of the most bloody wars in recent times is one
we dont hear much about: the civil war in Burundi and Rwanda.
They didn't use high tech weaponry, just plain old low-tech
machine guns and machetes.

Do you have a URL for that?  When was the US government
pushing arms sales to Indonesia and Turkey?  Was it advertising
the weapons?  Was it in any way pressuring those governments
to buy weapons?  Was it threatening either Indonesia or Turkey
if they did not buy weapons?

When you say "pushing arms sales", did you mean *allowing*
arms sales?  And if so, is any government that allows arms
sales guilty of pushing arms sales?  What about the governments
that are begging to buy armaments?  Are they pushing?

Unfortunately most governments in this world are so eager
to buy weapons, the only role of the US government is to
just say no to those who have shown themselves untrustworthy.

Adrian, I think this is highly unlikely.  Even an all out nuclear war,
many submerged submarines with nuclear reactors, ships at sea, remote
outposts like the antarctic, etc.

Sure humanity might be knocked back a few decades, but I doubt it
would be more than a century.

[If you want to assert that nuclear war would be the end of humanity,
please point me to a peer-reviewed article (other than Sagan's nuclear
winter proposition which was subsequently found to be deficient).

Ah yes, the Nagata "you mean you allowed the nano to *evolve itself*?"
scenario (in response to alien "unstoppable" nano).

Given the pace of molecular biology, I doubt we are going to encounter
anything we can't relatively rapidly understand and counter within
a few years.

Yes, that possibility does exist but I consider it a case where
people would gladly make their systems available in national/world
emergencies.

What?  Known harm?  All I am asking is that (a) all DC/P2P projects
be open source so the code can be reviewed (the trust but verify
approach can solve the problem of people hacking the code and
breaking things); and (b) that a very determined effort be made
by people to ensure they can "trust" the code (high reputation
suppliers, independent security review, etc.) to make it really
hard for an AI to break into the system and use it for alternate
purposes.

Regarding your comments and Samantha's on the problems of internodal
communication speed.  I thought I had mentioned that initial AIs
might be sub-realtime, I apologize if I forgot to say that.  The
question becomes how fast it can advance to real time (or faster)
on the networks that will be available in a few years.  I refer
you to Eugene's comments regarding plausible development scenarios.
(Though from what he says, I suspect he has better ideas but is
reluctant to disclose them.  Thats fine with me.)

Keep in mind -- there ought to be 3 or 4 Eliezers out there in
the Islamic world.  Not something to be taken lightly if they
choose the dark side.  Just because Eliezer broke his mold
doesn't mean others will be so fortunate.  The Pakistani
nuclear physicist who may have been working with bin Laden
comes to mind.

There is needn't be any "price to pay" for our dependence (or the
worldwide oil market's dependence anyway) on oil from the Middle East. 
The US need not try to control this oil.  Even if one West-hating
government controlled the entire Middle East, they'd sell oil.  If they
didn't sell directly to the US, they'd sell to others, which would of
course impact world oil prices.  Even if embargo by a single fanatical
and ascetic Middle East-spanning government were a threat, attempting to
control the Middle East only increases that threat.

The realistic threats consist of a) US government intervention in the
Middle East, leading to anti-US hatred, instability and increased
opportunities for anti-US governments to arise b) US government
intervention in the economy at home.  In the event of an embargo, price
controls, if enacted, would cause far more disruption than price
increases.

Liability isn't going to protect you from a rouge emergent AI if that's
what you're worried about.  Code is law.

It's trivial to write a program that sucks up nearly all of a computer's
CPU time without the user ever noticing.  Unless the user runs other
constantly CPU-bound programs, the "hidden" program will have use of
most of the CPU time even over very short periods.  To the extent nodes
need to coordinate network delays will present a *much* bigger problem
than intermittent CPU usage by other programs.

Who cares if it runs s-l-o-w?  The big, huge mega-IF/question is what
it will take to create a self-bootstrapping AI.  If you've done that
it doesn't matter whether it "thinks" 1000 times slower than humans.
If it can self-improve, you rapdily have something way beyond human
capabilities, it just responds on a different timescale.  Vinge of course
thought of this possibility many years ago in "True Names".

OTOH, speed does matter.  If "it" runs too slowly, it may not be stable
enough to bootstrap, or by the time it reached an interesting level it
could be overtaken by a later generation entity.

But I don't think speed (cpu or network) is the interesting issue,
software is.  The path to much faster hardware is very clear.  One can
quibble about the year a given level of performance will be available,
but the requisite hardware for "it" will exist in our lifetimes barring
WW#, large asteroid impact or the like.  The path to requisite software
is wide open for debate.

Hi all,

I had some wild'n'crazy ideas over the weekend about some modifications
specifically for singing. Here they are in all their glory.

-----
1 - Visual cue to pitch
-----
Something unique I've noticed about singing is that there is no visual or
tactile cue for pitch. All external instruments have an absoluteness about
them; you put your fingers in a particular place, or move something to
somewhere, press particular keys, etc. Singers, on the other hand, get no
external cue to singing pitch. If you tell an instrumentalist to play an
"A", they can do it. Ask a singer to do that, and it's very unlikely that
they can, without a cue from another instrument, unless they are one of
those marvellous people with perfect pitch (not me!).

Now, I came across an intriguing contraption recently online, the MidiVox...

http://www.healingmusic.net/MidiVoxFrame1Source1.htm

It seems to consist of a throat collar with pickups which contact the skin,
and cables back to the midi device (ie: computer). Apparently it converts
voice to midi signals. For the uninitiated, this means converting sound to
something like sheet music - so it must examine the vocals and decide at any
moment what actual note is being sung.

Now as an instrument, it's all well and good; I imagine the results are
somewhat mixed. However, imagine the utility of a realtime display coming
from this thing, showing a frequency+amplitude curve of the signal it's
picking up. Fantastic! I think that if you trained with something like that
for a few weeks, you'd achieve perfect pitch.

Now add this to a wearable computing rig, including a HUD, which can give
you the same visual feedback as described above, and I think you'd
immediately have a setup which could improve a singer's ability.


-----
2 - Voice mod drugs
-----

I've had a cold over the last couple of weeks, which knocked my voice around
terribly. For a while, I lost the top half of my baritone range, and gained
another half octave below it. I had to perform during this period too, yuck.

More interestly, near the end of the period, the top of my range came back,
albeit a  bit wobbly, and the new bottom stayed. It's gone now that the
cold's cleared up, but for a few days I had almost 2 and a half octaves of
usable range, including the ability to reach to a full basses' range. I'm a
bit miffed in particular to have lost that extra range that I had for those
couple of days. 

Now, during that period something physiological must have happened to modify
my voice. This is a common experience for singers, and basses/baritones in
particular have big vocal drops during colds (also during/after major
hangovers :-).

What was the physiology of this change? Mucus on the vocal folds? I don't
know. However, I am sure it must be repeatable. I am wondering if there is a
way to simulate the effect of a cold on the voice, possibly without the
control difficulties that come with it, to extend ones' vocal range? Could
this be turned into a tablet; "Bass in a capsule"? Pop a pill, and half an
hour later I am a bass for a couple of hours?

Further, I'm sure this principle could be extended. In particular, I know
that my range moves up as well as down depending on all kinds of factors
(hard to pinpoint). I figure that a lot of this is physiological as well.
With a bit of research, it must be possible to track down what governs the
vocal range, and how it can be modified. 

It would be a massive asset to singers to be able to modify the voice using
a selection of drugs. Surely it would require separate training under the
influence of such drugs to learn to properly use your altered voice, but
that's a small price to pay!


-----
3 - External lung
-----

This is my craziest idea, in my opinion. I've been thinking about the need
for singers to breathe. While breath is one of my personal strengths, I
nevertheless look at the ability of other wind instrument players to perform
tricks such as circular breathing, and think "why can't we do that"?

The difficulty with breathing seems to be the fact that there is one channel
both for inhalation and exhalation. As a singer, I only want to exhale; I
can't sing on the inward breath stream. So, if I have to stop exhaling in
order to inhale, that's detrimental. Of course my singing needs to breathe,
interpretatively, but that doesn't require actual breathing.

This leads me to the idea that creating another path into the lungs, into
which air could be pumped, would be an excellent modification for a singer.
It'd have to be as "low-down" as possible, as close to being directly into
the lungs as is feasible. Visualise a one way value being installed into a
singer's chest, which lets air in but not out. Then, you attach some
external device (a small pump? A bagpipe bag with a tube?!?) to this, and
use it to constantly inflate the lungs, at a fairly slow rate. 

Ideally, a singer would then be able to simply sing, and never need to
inhale, as the air going out on the breath stream would be replaced as it
was used. The air being pumped in would need to be at an extremely constant
rate, to ensure that vocal quality is not compromised (singing relies very
strongly on breath support). I imagine that it would require some training
to use such a modification correctly. Also, I think learning not to inhale
might be pretty difficult; maybe you need to actually trick the brain into
not requiring breathing by fooling some receptors with too much CO2 or some
such?

The truly appealing thing about this modification is that it could likely be
done with today's technology. I find the idea quite exciting, actually, and
if it could be carried off safely, might consider it further.

I was unaware of any proof that the nuclear winter proposition had been
found deficient.  Even if it was, there's still radioactive fallout to
consider.  Not to mention that, if all urban areas were to be destroyed,
the resulting knowledge base loss would extend back at least to the
start of the Industrial Revolution - two and a half centuries, as my
history book stated it.

Anthrax.  Sure, we understand it: we *made* the stuff.  But counter?
Not on a meaningful scale before a massive anthrax attack would inflict
significant casualties on its target - which would take a few months,
not years.  Repeat for other forms just as they do adapt, and...

The time to develop AIs to head off a disaster, or any prevention of a
disaster, is not after a disaster, but before.

I recall earlier comments along the lines of untrusted code being made
illegal (in fact, or just in effect)...which would seem to strike
against any such projects that did not have the resources or knowledge
to gain such trust, but did gain wide popularity (ref: Kazaa).  This
might well destroy all practical DC/P2P projects if none that focus on
being trusted just happen to emerge - these projects gain some
popularity, in fact, from their "illegitimacy".

Even on networks that will be available in a few years, it would still
be *far* sub-realtime.  Maybe once everyone has fiber (or wireless
optical) to their homes (which likely won't be this side of 2010), but
maybe not even then.

3 or 4 Eliezers in the Islamic world, vs. *how* many in ours?  Weighing
the risk of harm (times magnitude) that theirs might bring w/out
limitations, versus the chance of benefits (times magnitude) that ours
might bring w/out limitations, the balance is very heavily in favor of
letting ours work unhindered even if it means theirs work unhindered
too.  Including, say, letting a very rich one buy up Kazaa's makers and
try inserting the rogue code you describe, just to see what happens.

Israelis and Arabs disagree on what happened regarding virtually every 
significant event in the Middle East over the past century. Each will be 
glad to explain at length why their version of what happened is right and 
why the other side is wrong, wrong, wrong.

My own assessment is that both sides are at fault, both sides have 
committed unacceptable acts.  But it seems to me that the fault is not 
50/50, as many like to pretend.  Much more lopsided.  Examples: Israelis 
have tortured Arab prisoners and bulldozed people's houses.  Arabs have 
carved babies out of pregnant women in front of their husbands (1929 riots, 
I believe) and taken an elementary school hostage (the PLO, 100 child 
hostages at Maalot, 1974).

Meanwhile, there's self-righteousness from all other quarters.  Look at the 
backstory of their countries.  The British torturing IRA 
prisoners.  American war crimes in Vietnam, including tossing people out of 
helicopters.  Etc.  Every country has an ugly past (or present).

The King Solomon bit was done already, quite a few years back.  1/2 became 
Jordan, which by the way is majority Palestinian.

Putting my Don't Tread on Me libertarian hat on -- Israel should perhaps 
have annexed all the territories taken in each war, instead of giving land 
back after 1956, 1973, et seq. under US pressure.  I think annexation 
combines morality and realpolitik.  It's ludicrous for the Arabs to start 
wars, lose, and then complain about how unfair it all is.

Alternative history question:  what would the history of the past 
half-century in the Middle East have been had there not been any major oil, 
mineralogical, or geographic significance?  I.e., if Saudi Arabia and Iraq 
were no wealthier or important than Chad and Bolivia?  Would the wars have 
occurred?  Would the West have interceded as they did each time?  Would 
Israel be anywhere near as smart, advanced, tough, and inventive if they 
hadn't been afraid of extinction?  Would the Arab countries be more or less 
prosperous and democratic than they are without the wealth and 
international influence?
Maybe I'll write that novel....

Or, a different history:  the British had offered the Jews Uganda instead 
of Palestine.  What if they'd taken it?  What would the history of Africa 
have been, and what would Arabia be like without Jews to blame?


-- David.

The reason singers cant do that is that circular breathing on a sax
requires one to puff ones cheeks, close the throat and inhale quickly
through the nose while keeping the tone playing by collapsing the
cheeks.  Does not apply to singers.

OK tenors, line up here, have a hose punched into your bronchial tube.

Tenors?...

{8-]  Emlyn I have toyed with the idea of having an air tube in
the corner of the mouth while playing the sax, but the problem
is a good player controls the tone by shaping of the resonance
chamber, which is the back of the throat, and controls the pitch
to a certain extent by the pressure of the air column, which is

This one actually has a U.S. patent.
I'm sending it to you prior to my assessment.
I just thought you'd appreciate the puzzle.

Significant flaws were found in the nuclear winter papers.  Basically, 
their models were far too simplistic.  The limitations were first proven by 
subsequent atmospheric modelling on the Crays at Livermore but there are 
also fundamental assumptions Sagan et al made that are untenable in the 
face of what we know about geo-bio-atmo-eco- processes.  One of us can dig 
out our copies of the papers, but you should be able to find this stuff 
easily on the web.

Next.  All-out nuke everything is highly unlikely, and largely wouldn't 
touch the southern hemisphere.  In the north, there would be many cities 
unaffected, or with a high number of survivors.  And lots of people aren't 
anywhere near a target, or the way the wind blows.  Our knowledge base is 
decentralized.  It's in people's brains, in books, and in computers, and 
enough of each would survive.  Radioactivity decays.  It spreads thinly 
over the world.  It is washed out by rain.

My guess is similar to Robert's -- maybe a couple decades delay.

I'm less sanguine about the recovery time after a pandemic bioengineered 
attack.  And I think there might be a multiplier effect if both happened at 
the same time, or the plague just as we're recovering from the nukes.

Have you researched the issue for a moment before commenting? A typical
computer idles 98..99% of the time. A task running at low priority makes
use of those idle cycles. Nice tasks are invisible on OSses with decent
multitasking (NT is not one of them, but then Folding@HOME doesn't even
run nice there). Further, you can measure CPU load dynamically and go to
sleep when high-priority tasks become visible. You could also go to sleep
whenever a user is active (keystrokes and mouse events take zero CPU to
detect), similiarly to a screenblanker (only minus the screenblanker).  
Users typically have to sleep sometime, which is visible that there's been
a time of activity approximating the length of a working day, which then
stops. And if you've got a multi-CPU box, only one will handle the UI, so
you can hog the rest. And scooby-dooby-doo.

Same applies to network load.

You're wrong. The only way you could detect something is going on is from
the network activity on blinkenlights and somewhat higher power bill (a 
computer might draw some 10% more power under full load).

It takes years to develop perfect pitch because we don't have the right
tools. If you could hum a note and see it, you'd be well on your way. You
can learn perfect pitch, it's all about feedback and practice, as far as I
can see.

Maybe a few weeks is a stretch.

Actually, I guess I could try this by setting up a mike and feeding the
signal into something which would visualise it for me, then practising in
front of a monitor. Anyone know any good software for this?

It's ok for sax players, you can just go get an alto sax if you want to play
high. Singers are more restricted.

Ideally I'd like to not use helium; not a healthy choice.

I know that Spike :-) But the key is that the breath stream to the sound
production equipment is continuous; harder to do with singing.

How about a baritone?

I'm (semi) serious about this idea. Wouldn't an automatic air injection

Let me know how you make out with this. 

Can you create a tube with a valve which will open once pressure gets to a
certain level, spilling out excess air?

The hidden assumption here is that you can trust what the task manager is 
displaying you. That's a lot to ask for, as the task manager is just a 
program, and even current rootkits patch the binaries or exchange them to 
not show up in the task list.

None of current @home clients is designed to be stealthy. You might want 
to look at Folding@HOME client's priority. Notice that is uses graphics 
excessively. It's not designed to restrict itself to nonswappable memory.

I don't see my console based Folding@HOME client under Linux (other than
by 98% nice CPU bar), and it doesn't try to be stealthy either.

More precisely a "Clash of Oligarchies".

Money is the non-productive medium of *exchange*, therefore a means and not and end in itself. A good (i.e. "capital") is exchanged
in the present for an expectation of a future good. That expectation is held over time as money.
The myth that businesses seek to maximize monetary gains appears to be an artifact of Socialist metaphysics. It bears little
relation to real life.

A business in a free market can only continue to exist if its clients want what it has to offer. The customers provide the measure
of the business' "social aspects" by voting with their wallets. Its competitors, by offering either lower prices or better quality,
provide the governance- for free.

And any system

Yes, and that is why socialist/statist empires and their fiat currencies always collapse. Something about being able to wave guns in
people's faces without any accountability causes the Statist to lose touch with reality.

And we also give a lot of arms outright to some nations, 
including Israel.  In the middle of this horrific action we just 
shipped a bunch of brand new Black Hawks.  "Stop" says Bush, and 
by the way here are more attack helicopters in case you don't. 
You sure need those to find caches of rifles and shutguns after 
you have blown towns and residences apart.  Yep, makes perfect 
sense - no conflicting mesages here.

Yes, I partially misspoke due to being a bit overwrought by the 
current madness.  But I didn't overstate by much.  At the least 
it is certainly not the case that Israel is mainly in the right 
and the Palestinians and some Arab neighbors mainly in the 
wrong.  My apologies and a bit of history:

1947 Britain gage up mandate to UN which suggested two states.

1948 David Ben-Gurion declared foundation of state of Israel
Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan invaded but were beaten back.

1949: Jews in Isrel had secured an extended the area proposed by 
the UN taking some land set aside for Palestinians

1956 President Nasser came to power in Egypt and integrated its 
armies without those of Syria and nationalized the European 
owned Suez canal.  Israle joined with Britain and France and 
invaded the Sinai peninsula. International pressure forced 
Israelis to give up the Sinai and the UK and France to remove 
their troops from the Suez canal

1964 PLO was founded.  After the 6 day war it reformed under 
Yasser Arafat.  Vowed to recliam their land and destroy the 
state of Israel.

1967 Six day war.  Small scale hostilities between Israel and it 
s neighbors continued.  On June 5 1967 Israel launched a 
preemptive strike against all troops on its borders

During the six day war Israel seized the Sinai (again), the 
Golan Heights from Syria, the West Bank and the Old City of 
Jerusalem from Jordan.  Negotiations have centered around a 
return to pre-67 borders ever since

1973 Yom Kippur war.  Syria and Egypt launched a surprise attack 
on the Israeli held land.  Israel held the territory gained in 
the Six Day War.

1979 Egypt signed mutual recognition pact with Israel and the 
Sinai was returned to Egypt

1981 Israel formally annexed the Golan Heights.  During the 
early 80s establishment of Jewish setlltemnts on Palestinian 
land in the West Bank continued systematically

1982 In response to terrorist attacks on northern towns, Israel 
invaded Lebanon as far north as Beirut.  In 1985 Israel withdrew 
from most of Lebanon but maintained a 'secuirty zone' along the 
border policed by Israeli soldiers.  Syria stationed troops in 
Lebanon

1987 The Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza launched the 
Intfada (popular uprising) against Israeli occupation.

1993 The Oslo Accords were agreed with provided for mutual 
recognition betwe the PLO and state of Israel and limited 
Palestinian self rule in the West Bank and Gaza.  Jordan signed 
a peace deal with Israel

2000 Israel withdrew completely from southern Lebanon ending 
nearly 20 years of occupation.  But the withdrawal turned to 
chaos when Hizbullah guerilla forces harrassed the retreating 
Israelis.

Oct 2000 Violence flares acros West Bank and Gaza after Sharon 
makes provocative visit to a very sacred mosque compound. PA 
police trade fire with Israeli soldiers.  Many killed, hundereds 
injured.  Most of the casualities are Arab.

Feb 2001 Sharon defeats Barak.  Israel responds ever more 
severely to Palestinian attacks.  After 9/11 violence escalated 
as Israeli leaders talked of their own "war on terrorism". A 
wave of Palestinian suicide bombers killed many Israelis.

Mar 2002 Sharon respond with military occupation of the West Bank.

And Sharon and many others in the Israeli cabinet are on record 
as considering the Palestinians to be subhuman and to be run 
completely out of Israel or killed.

What are you talking about? Snitching what country's territory? 
  Is the an accusation against the Palestinians?  What 
indefensible borders?  Israel has not only defended them but on 
several occassions over the above history, drastically extend 
them.

Please point me to a peer-reviewed article that considers the Dr

barely being a blip in the march of progress.

NO.  Too easy for existing powers to maintain control and stifle

It can't advance to faster than realtime on a world-wide net 
unless it cracks lightspeed.  This is a piss-poor and highly 
unlikely scenario for which you seem willing to give up a lot of 
freedom and allow a lot of control to be asserted on the one 
place we can possibly keep much freedom. I will MUCH sooner take 
my chances with an SI somehow coming into existence on 
impossibly spread out hardware than on the certainty of massive 
repression of all of us if the government gets more excuses to 
clamp down on software and on the Net.  Not that the need any 
more excuses apparently.

SIGH.  If it things 1000 times slower than humans then it is not 
a very credible threat.  It can't move fast enough to escape 
detection and extermination.  Vinge did not exactly deal with 
this possibility.  Also, if it runs too slowly it is 
questionable whether certain forms of intelligence will gel at all.

Sure but that hardware will almost certainly not be the entire Net.

It appears from one of the links: http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/megnot01.htm 
that you don't see "gain" unless you use "nonlinear" devices. This fellow 
also mentions "tuning".

Resonant circuits can build up enormous circulating currents, but it's a 
storage effect, not free energy. Too bad - I would dearly like to cut Com

Anthropic Reasons for Non-Zero Flatness and Lambda

     In some cosmological theories with varying constants there are
     anthropic reasons why the expansion of the universe must not be
     too {\it close} to flatness or the cosmological constant too close
     to zero. Using exact theories which incorporate time-variations in
     $\alpha $ and in $G$ we show how the presence of negative spatial
     curvature and a positive cosmological constant play an essential
     role in bringing to an end variations in the scalar fields driving
     time change in these 'constants' during any dust-dominated era of
     a universe's expansion. In spatially flat universes with $\Lambda
     =0$ the fine structure constant grows to a value which makes the
     existence of atoms impossible.

The Future of Artificial Intelligence

Courtesy of New Scientist Magazine

Dr. Mark Humphrys
University of Edinburgh

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a perfect example of how sometimes science
moves more slowly than we would have predicted. In the first flush of
enthusiasm at the invention of computers it was believed that we now finally
had the tools with which to crack the problem of the mind, and within years
we would see a new race of intelligent machines. We are older and wiser now.
The first rush of enthusiasm is gone, the computers that impressed us so
much back then do not impress us now, and we are soberly settling down to
understand how hard the problems of AI really are.

What is AI? In some sense it is engineering inspired by biology. We look at
animals, we look at humans and we want to be able to build machines that do
what they do. We want machines to be able to learn in the way that they
learn, to speak, to reason and eventually to have consciousness. AI is
engineering but, at this stage, is it also science? Is it, for example,
modeling in cognitive science? We would like to think that is both
engineering and science but the contributions that is has made to cognitive
science so far are perhaps weaker than the contributions that biology has
given to the engineering.

The confused history of AI

Looking back at the history of AI, we can see that perhaps it began at the
wrong end of the spectrum. If AI had been tackled logically, it would
perhaps have begun as an artificial biology, looking at living things and
saying "Can we model these with machines?". The working hypothesis would
have been that living things are physical systems so let's try and see where
the modeling takes us and where it breaks down. Artificial biology would
look at the evolution of physical systems in general, development from
infant to adult, self-organization, complexity and so on. Then, as a
subfield of that, a sort of artificial zoology that looks at sensorimotor
behavior, vision and navigation, recognizing, avoiding and manipulating
objects, basic, pre-linguistic learning and planning, and the simplest forms
of internal representations of external objects. And finally, as a further
subfield of this, an artificial psychology that looks at human behavior
where we deal with abstract reasoning, language, speech and social culture,
and all those philosophical conundrums like consciousness, free will and so
forth.

That would have been a logical progression and is what should have happened.
But what did happen was that what people thought of as intelligence was the
stuff that impresses us. Our peers are impressed by things like doing
complex mathematics and playing a good chess game. The ability to walk, in
contrast, doesn't impress anyone. You can't say to your friends, "Look, I
can walk", because your friends can walk too.

So all those problems that toddlers grapple with every day were seen as
unglamorous, boring, and probably pretty easy anyway. The really hard
problems, clearly, were things demanding abstract thought, like chess and
mathematical theorem proving. Everyone ignored the animal and went straight
to the human, and the adult human too, not even the child human. And this is
what `AI' has come to mean - artificial adult human intelligence. But what
has happened over the last 40-50 years - to the disappointment of all those
who made breathless predictions about where AI would go - is that things
such as playing chess have turned out to be incredibly easy for computers,
whereas learning to walk and learning to get around in the world without
falling over has proved to be unbelievably difficult.

And it is not as if we can ignore the latter skills and just carry on with
human-level AI. It has proved very difficult to endow machines with `common
sense', emotions and those other intangibles which seem to drive much
intelligent human behavior, and it does seem that these may come more from
our long history of interactions with the world and other humans than from
any abstract reasoning and logical deduction. That is, the animal and child
levels may be the key to making really convincing, well-rounded forms of
intelligence, rather than the intelligence of chess-playing machines like
Deep Blue, which are too easy to dismiss as `mindless'.

In retrospect, the new view makes sense. It took 3 billion years of
evolution to produce apes, and then only another 2 million years or so for
languages and all the things that we are impressed by to appear. That's
perhaps an indication that once you've got the mobile, tactile monkey, once
you've got the Homo erectus, those human skills can evolve fairly quickly.
It may be a fairly trivial matter for language and reasoning to evolve in a
creature which can already find its way around the world.

The new AI, and the new optimism That's certainly what the history of AI has
served to bear out. As a result, there has been a revolution in the field
which goes by names such as Artificial Life (AL) and Adaptive Behavior,
trying to re-situate AI within the context of an artificial biology and
zoology (respectively). The basic philosophy is that we need much more
understanding of the animal substrates of human behavior before we can
fulfil the dreams of AI in replicating convincing well-rounded intelligence.

(Incidentally, the reader should note that the terminology is in chaos, as
fields re-group and re-define themselves. For example, I work on artificial
zoology but describe myself casually as doing AI. This chaos can, however,
be seen as a healthy sign of a field which has not yet stabilized. Any young
scientist with imagination should realize that these are the kind of fields
to get into. Who wants to be in a field where everything was solved long
ago?)

So AI is not dead, but re-grouping, and is still being driven, as always, by
testable scientific models. Discussions on philosophical questions, such as
`What is life?' or `What is intelligence?', change little over the years.
There have been numerous attempts, from Roger Penrose to Gerald Edelman, to
disprove AI (show that it is impossible) but none of these attempted
revolutions has yet gathered much momentum. This is not just because of lack
of agreement with their philosophical analysis (although there is plenty of
that), but also perhaps because they fail to provide an alternative paradigm
in which we can do science. Progress, as is normal in science, comes from
building things and running experiments, and the flow of new and strange
machines from AI laboratories is not remotely exhausted. On the contrary, it
has been recently invigorated by the new biological approach.

In fact, the old optimism has even been resurrected. Professor Kevin Warwick
of the University of Reading has recently predicted that the new approach
will lead to human-level AI in our lifetimes. But I think we have learned
our lesson on that one. I, and many like me in new AI, imagine that this is
still Physics before Newton, that the field might have a good one or two
hundred years left to run. The reason is that there is no obvious way of
getting from here to there - to human-level intelligence from the rather
useless robots and brittle software programs that we have nowadays. A long
series of conceptual breakthroughs are needed, and this kind of thinking is
very difficult to timetable. What we are trying to do in the next generation
is essentially to find out what are the right questions to ask.

It may never happen (but not for the reasons you think)

I think that people who are worried about robots taking over the world
should go to a robotics conference and watch these things try to walk. They
fall over, bump into walls and end up with their legs thrashing or wheels
spinning in the air. I'm told that in this summer's Robotic Football
competition, the losing player scored all five goals - 2 against the
opposing robot, and 3 against himself. The winner presumably just fell over.

Robots are more helpless than threatening. They are really quite sweet. I
was in the MIT robotics laboratory once looking at Cog, Rodney Brooks'
latest robot. Poor Cog has no legs. He is a sort of humanoid, a torso stuck
on a stand with arms, grippers, binocular vision and so on. I saw Cog on a
Sunday afternoon in a darkened laboratory when everyone had gone home and I
felt sorry for him which I know is mad. But it was Sunday afternoon and no
one was going to come and play with him. If you consider the gulf between
that and what most animals experience in their lives, surrounded by a tribe
of fellow infants and adults, growing up with parents who are constantly
with them and constantly stimulating them, then you understand the
incredibly limited kind of life that artificial systems have.

The argument I am developing is that there may be limits to AI, not because
the hypothesis of `strong AI' is false, but for more mundane reasons. The
argument, which I develop further on my website, is that you can't expect to
build single isolated AI's, alone in laboratories, and get anywhere. Unless
the creatures can have the space in which to evolve a rich culture, with
repeated social interaction with things that are like them, you can't really
expect to get beyond a certain stage. If we work up from insects to dogs to
Homo erectus to humans, the AI project will I claim fall apart somewhere
around the Homo erectus stage because of our inability to provide them with
a real cultural environment. We cannot make millions of these things and
give them the living space in which to develop their own primitive
societies, language and cultures. We can't because the planet is already
full. That's the main argument, and the reason for the title of this talk.

So what will happen?

So what will happen? What will happen over the next thirty years is that
will see new types of animal-inspired machines that are more `messy' and
unpredictable than any we have seen before. These machines will change over
time as a result of their interactions with us and with the world. These
silent, pre-linguistic, animal-like machines will be nothing like humans but
they will gradually come to seem like a strange sort of animal. Machines
that learn, familiar to researchers in labs for many years, will finally
become mainstream and enter the public consciousness.

What category of problems could animal-like machines address? The kind of
problems we are going to see this approach tackle will be problems that are
somewhat noise and error resistant and that do not demand abstract
reasoning. A special focus will be behavior that is easier to learn than to
articulate - most of us know how to walk but we couldn't possibly tell
anyone how we do it. Similarly with grasping objects and other such skills.
These things involve building neural networks, filling in state-spaces and
so on, and cannot be captured as a set of rules that we speak in language.
You must experience the dynamics of your own body in infancy and thrash
about until the changing internal numbers and weights start to converge on
the correct behavior. Different bodies mean different dynamics. And robots
that can learn to walk can learn other sensorimotor skills that we can
neither articulate nor perform ourselves.

What are examples of these type of problems? Well, for example, there are
already autonomous lawnmowers that will wander around gardens all afternoon.
The next step might be autonomous vacuum cleaners inside the house (though
clutter and stairs present immediate problems for wheeled robots). There are
all sorts of other uses for artificial animals in areas where people find
jobs dangerous or tedious - land-mine clearance, toxic waste clearance,
farming, mining, demolition, finding objects and robotic exploration, for
example. Any jobs done currently or traditionally by animals would be a
focus. We are familiar already from the Mars Pathfinder and other examples
that we can send autonomous robots not only to inhospitable places, but also
send them there on cheap one-way `suicide' missions. (Of course, no machine
ever `dies', since we can restore its mind in a new body on earth after the
mission.)

Whether these type of machines may have a future in the home is an
interesting question. If it ever happens, I think it will be because the
robot is treated as a kind of pet, so that a machine roaming the house is
regarded as cute rather than creepy. Machines that learn tend to develop an
individual, unrepeatable character which humans can find quite attractive.
There are already a few games in software - such as the Windows-based game
Creatures, and the little Tamagotchi toys - whose personalities people can
get very attached to. A major part of the appeal is the unique, fragile and
unrepeatable nature of the software beings you interact with. If your
Creature dies, you may never be able to raise another one like it again.
Machines in the future will be similar, and the family robot will after a
few years be, like a pet, literally irreplaceable.

What will hold things up? There are many things that could hold up progress
but hardware is the one that is staring us in the face at the moment. Nobody
is going to buy a robotic vacuum cleaner that costs £5000 no matter how many
big cute eyes are painted on it or even if it has a voice that says, "I love
you". Many conceptual breakthroughs will be needed to create artificial
animals. The major theoretical issue to be solved is probably
representation: what is language and how do we classify the world. We say
`That's a table' and so on for different objects, but what does an insect
do, what is going on in an insect's head when it distinguishes objects in
the world, what information is being passed around inside, what kind of data
structures are they using. Each robot will have to learn an internal
language customized for its sensorimotor system and the particular
environmental niche in which it finds itself. It will have to learn this
internal language on its own, since any representations we attempt to impose
on it, coming from a different sensorimotor world, will probably not work.

Predictions

Finally, what will be the impact on society of animal-like machines? Let's
make a few predictions that I will later look back and laugh at.

First, family robots may be permanently connected to wireless family
intranets, sharing information with those who you want to know where you
are. You may never need to worry if your loved ones are alright when they
are late or far away, because you will be permanently connected to them.
Crime may get difficult if all family homes are full of half-aware, loyal
family machines. In the future, we may never be entirely alone, and if the
controls are in the hands of our loved ones rather than the state, that may
not be such a bad thing.

Slightly further ahead, if some of the intelligence of the horse can be put
back into the automobile, thousands of lives could be saved, as cars become
nervous of their drunk owners, and refuse to get into positions where they
would crash at high speed. We may look back in amazement at the carnage
tolerated in this age, when every western country had road deaths equivalent
to a long, slow-burning war. In the future, drunks will be able to use cars,
which will take them home like loyal horses. And not just drunks, but
children, the old and infirm, the blind, all will be empowered.

Eventually, if cars were all (wireless) networked, and humans stopped
driving altogether, we might scrap the vast amount of clutter all over our
road system - signposts, markings, traffic lights, roundabouts, central
reservations - and return our roads to a soft, sparse, eighteenth-century
look. All the information - negotiation with other cars, traffic and route
updates - would come over the network invisibly. And our towns and
countryside would look so much sparser and more peaceful.

Conclusion

I've been trying to give an idea of how artificial animals could be useful,
but the reason that I'm interested in them is the hope that artificial
animals will provide the route to artificial humans. But the latter is not
going to happen in our lifetimes (and indeed may never happen, at least not
in any straightforward way).

In the coming decades, we shouldn't expect that the human race will become
extinct and be replaced by robots. We can expect that classical AI will go
on producing more and more sophisticated applications in restricted
domains - expert systems, chess programs, Internet agents - but any time we
expect common sense we will continue to be disappointed as we have been in
the past. At vulnerable points these will continue to be exposed as `blind
automata'. Whereas animal-based AI or AL will go on producing stranger and
stranger machines, less rationally intelligent but more rounded and whole,
in which we will start to feel that there is somebody at home, in a strange
animal kind of way. In conclusion, we won't see full AI in our lives, but we
should live to get a good feel for whether or not it is possible, and how it
could be achieved by our descendants.

True, more deaths, but some will survive and the subsequent

within a few years if current efforts with Deinococcus radiodurans

trials' solution for radiation exposure.]

That isn't clear.  I'm sure nuclear submarines come with complete
operating manuals.  Its questionable whether you would lose every
chip fab.  [A more interesting question is *where* are the chip
fabs of the CIA/NSA and other intelligence agencies...?]

You also probably need to consider whether various governments
in light of the really paranoid days of the cold war didn't
start archiving a significant amount of the human "body of knowledge"
someplace where a nuclear war wouldn't touch it.  I know I certainly
would if I were convinced it might happen.  [Yet another thing
we ought to know -- I suspect an FOI request could turn up the
answer to this.]

> Anthrax.  Sure, we understand it: we *made* the stuff.  But counter?
 [snip]

Actually, scientists at Harvard developed an Anthrax toxin anti-toxin
last year.  I expect its undergoing accelerated trials now.
I've got a paper written on how the technologies my new company
would develop would significantly accelerate the development of
novel anti-toxins (from months to a week or two) if a plan
were in place for the rapid response to novel bioweapons.

True, but this gets into the big debate about the difficulty
of developing defenses without first developing what they
are designed to defend against.

For responding to the bio- and chemico-weapons technologies
one key element is robust methods for molecular modeling,
DC proteing folding projects, tightly integrated massively
parallel computers like Blue Gene, etc.  Many of those we
already have or will soon.

To solve the problem of nuclear bombs or dirty bombs we
are going to need autonomous insect-bots capable of detecting
radioactivity.  And we are going to need *very* large numbers
of them.  [I don't see having those very soon.]

I may have said that.  Given the risks that software like Kazaa might
hold, it isn't unreasonable to require that it be open source.
The government could also make people aware of the risks that
such software poses if it hasn't been "verified" (Underwriters
Laboratory, Consumer Reports, models might work best here.
Then the ability in a national emergency to shutdown computers
known to use such software.  We almost got to this with the ISPs
with the viruses last summer/fall without any intervention by
the government.

I would expect that "reasonable" people, corporations, institutions,
etc. that are concerned about security issues would gravitate towards
DC/P2P projects that were "verified".  In turn, grant agencies such
as NSF or NIH (that support projects like Folding/SETI@Home) would
require verification to be part of the grant proposals because they
understand the risks involved.  Stockholders wouldn't invest in
companies that were aware of the risks but didn't bother to do
the verification.

As Harvey says, its a tough sell, but we have to start someplace.

It would only take an act of congress in the U.S. to push this
forward *much* faster.  I think there are bills being written
along these lines.  Infoaware politicians are viewing this
as a competitive infrastructure, jobs, economic growth issue.

I'm assuming that IQ's high are a function of simple population size.

roughly balance the Islamic population.

The business costs of even *very* simple viruses doing nothing more
than scanning your hard drive for financial information (how do
we know the first application to hack Kazaa will not to be to send
your Quicken records back to the Russian mob?) argue strongly
against allowing "unhindered access".

Fortunately, I think our fingers will probably get burnt a few
more times and then people and the government will "wake up".

The neighbours are in this case nodes on the local network loop, neighbour
ports on a switch. The latency profile for those nodes is good even now.
Furthermore, the bootstrap stages are not realtime-bound. Plus, we're
talking about networking and hardware of next decades. Plus, once you're
post-bootstrap stage you'll find the system will very soon design and
build its own hardware. The point is to make the bootstrap bottleneck as 
narrow as possible.

You're assuming loss of service, because the system is doing something 
else at the time? If the system cares about keeping up appearances, it 
certainly can provide you with a much superior service using a fraction of 
initial resources.

Keeping pulling hardware from under your feet is a selection pressure
which will result in less intrusive, more stealthy agents.

Do you watch your box 24 h/day? Do you run a packet sniffer on your local 
network, and regularly look through the logs? Which system is keeping the 
logs?

The point is that all current systems are swiss cheese. With a library of 
about 10 (preferably hitherto undisclosed) vulnerabilities you can own 90% 
of all machines on the global network, backbone infrastructure included, 
if you have a competent team and do it in a concerted manner.

While nuclear war would be definitely extremely nasty, it would not kill 
even the bulk of humanity. But, it is definitely one of the blips on the 
global threat screen. I don't see how we can afford to ignore even a 
single blip of many.

There is no solution save for making networked computers more secure on 
all levels. Secure systems do not have a higher market fitness so far.

Carl Sagan was not the originator of the nuclear winter hypothesis.

The study, first referred to as TTAP: Authors: Turco, R.P., Toon, O.B.,
Ackerman, A., Pollack, J.B. (deceased). Sagan was added later, based
on his experience of Mars dust in the Martian atmosphere, and because
of his prominence as a public spokesman, so then: "TTAPS".

The TTAPS study wasn't the most sophisticated model of atmospheric
physics, but it was a good start.

TTAPS was not 'debunked', nor did the authors retract their
hypothesis. That 'debunking' seems to be the stuff of urban legend,
perhaps because some people wanted to discredit Carl Sagan.  What
followed the TTAPS study was simply more sophisticated models that
still supported the original study, but gave more details for the
atmospheric phenomena (so my atmospheric science friends tell me).


This is called the "TTAPS2" study:

the closing paragraph: "The constellation of physical effects -
attenuation of sunlight, surface cooling, upper-level heating and
stabilization, and enhanced interhemispheric transport - proposed in
the original nuclear winter hypothesis have been reaffirmed through
increasingly sophisticated theoretical and experimental
analyses. Specific physical parameters have undergone substantial
revision, buth these adjustments have been mutually compensating and
have not led to changes exceeding a factor of 2 in ther magnitude of
predicted effects.  Although important uncertainties persist and more
work remains to be carried out, the basic physics of nuclear winter
appear firmly established. With regard to the long-term, widepread
consequences of nuclear war, the existing data indicate that, should
substantial urban areas or fuel stocks be exposed to nuclear ignition,
severe environmental anomalies - possibly leading to more human
casualties globally"

While the British installed one of the Hashemite princes in Iraq in the
early part of the 20th century when the Hashemites were deposed from
control of Mecca and Medina by the Sauds and their Wahabbi followers, by
the 1950's the Hussein of Iraq was entirely within the orbit of the
Soviet Union, partly due to being turned by British traitors of the
Cambridge-nik group, partly because the Soviets made better and cheaper
weapons than Britain. However, Hussein did oppose socialist reforms
within his own country outside of nationalizing the oil industry.

I think you are assuming that there was some sort of rivalry between the
US and Britain in the postwar period. This isn't so, the US assumed
control of a lot of British assets as a matter of Britain paying off its
Lend/Lease, wartime, and reconstruction debts, all of which was agreed
to years before by Roosevelt and Churchill.

Responding to more Samantha-ganda:
a) we didn't 'give' them to them, they built them themselves, and,
b) unlike Saddam, Israel has not used them, while Saddam uses his
against his own people, not just foreign enemies, and
c) responding to terrorist attacks doesn't make you a 'majorly agressive
state'.

What? Sacrificing the lives of terrorists who already have bombs

Terrorism is very plainly defined in the Laws of War, which I've
detailed here, to YOU repeatedly. The fact that you choose, like the
Palestinians, to ignore these definitions which are accepted by 99% of
the human race that lives in real civilization demonstrates how far out
in left field you really are.

On the contrary, a large percent of the people I know would prefer just
nuking the bastards and getting it over with. You don't see many
Japanese terrorist groups attacking the US these days, do you?

They are hardly the lynchpin. It is their poor proxy-colonization of
Afghanistan in concert with Pakistan which has caused this whole mess.

It looks like the controversy may have gotten started by
Tony Rothman in "Science a la Mode: Physical Fashions and Fictions"
Review: http://www.bullatomsci.org/issues/1990/j90/j90reviews.html
The essay was "A Memoir of Nuclear Winter".
The reviewer found it problematic but didn't say it was
completely without merit.  However the BAS isn't where I'd
expect to find an unbiased review.

An even older academic work is:
Nuclear Winter: THe State of the Science, by George F. Carrier
http://books.nap.edu/books/0309036925/html/136.html

Then of course there is "Nuclear War Survival Skills"
http://www.oism.org/nwss/
that discusses some of the myths here:
http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm
and lists Nuclear Winter as discredited (but they also may
have a biased agenda).

A paper I suspect is peer reviewed is:
Published in Science and Public Policy, Vol. 15, No. 5, October 1988, pp. 321-334.
Nuclear winter: science and politics by Brian Martin
http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/88spp.html
It appears to be an extensive review circa 1988.

One of the more recent articles
NUCLEAR WINTER REVISITED   by Dr. Alan Phillips, October 2000
http://www.peace.ca/nuclearwinterrevisited.htm
seems to suggest that more studies are needed.

The Google Directory seems to have at one time had a Nuclear Winter
page but I can't find it now.  You might be able to find it
in the web page archival system.

Yes, for some.  But I know they are testing certain anti-virals against
smallpox currently (that hasn't been done extensively previously) because
the bug had been "eradicated".  We do seem to have an effective anthrax
toxin anti-toxin.  And history shows that with modern medical knowledge
and epidemiology is fairly effective at containing the bugs we have
encountered to date (I'll note that Bush has put the Russians on notice
today that they aren't living up to their commitments under the bio/chemico-
weapons treaties).

One should carefully differentiate between existing bioagents, bioagents
terrorists might develop, and nanoagents.  At least for existing bioagents
Nature seems to have done a moderately good job of giving us a fighting
chance.  The development of novel agents is something that requires
more technology and information than is available to most terrorist
organizations.  Though the gap is shrinking.

> Declared by whom?

Presumably the leaders of a country can declare a national emergency
and coopt the resources.  I'm not completely sure but I suspect that
the laws in most countries allow officials to take your car, house,
etc. in national emergencies.  (Someone correct me if this is way
off base -- it may vary from country to country).

If its open source code it isn't stifling innovation.
If it comes down to trusting a communist government or a rogue AI,
I'll take the communist government thank you.

We may be misunderstanding each other.  It can advace at greater
than real-time speed if it has more computing capacity than the
human brain, better algorithms for increasing its intelligence
or better protocols for reducing the communications bandwidth
requirements (the human brain is *very* chatty).

One of the interesting things about this discussion has been
that different animals may use different neuronal protocols
to get the job done.  How do we know that timed spikes of various
amplitudes are the *best* communication protocol for "intelligence"?
More likely they are highly specific to the bandwidth capacity
of axons themselves.

I'm not suggesting the government outlaw Kazaa, I'm suggesting it
adopt policies that promote it being *more* open and *more* secure
for relatively clueless citizens.  I might also accept a regulation
that requires companies like BDE get a safety approval from the
government before they allow an application to be run on their network.
That is little different from what a biotech lab has to go through
to be allowed to handle radioactive materials.

If something represents a potential risk to society, you *should*
have to demonstrate you can handle it responsibly before you are
allowed to operate it.

Any economy which does't depend entirely on the management and boards of
directors (two different things entirely, shows what you know about
capitalism) is neither democratic nor liberal.

Anybody who thinks that targeting and killing civilians specifically is
NOT an acceptable tactic of a conflict. Note that since the Qur'an
specifically says that killing civilians is wrong, this DOES include any
muslim who actually follows what the Qur'an actually says on this
matter.

You've done what?  Provided sufficient advice to the rest of the planet to be
able to pass such judgement on whether or not everyone should listen to the
opinion of the US?

Like I said.

You are quite plainly taking a side here, and completely accepting the
inhumane use of terrorism against civilians as an acceptable military
tactic.

I will defer to Amara's references that nuclear winter may
remain a serious threat to humanity.  It is interesting that
in 2000, they were still calling for more studies.

Currently I believe it is policy for Russia and the U.S.
not to have the missles targeted at each others cities
(someone correct me if they know otherwise).  So that would
prevent any accidental launch from escalating us into
a nuclear winter situation.  So nuclear winter only seems
to be a risk if the U.S. and Russia get back to a situation
where they are playing MAD.  I don't see that happening
anytime soon (in part because NW does seem to be a risk).

It seems to make sense that an extropic goal could be to
get the actual number of weapons down to a level that
could not cause a nuclear winter.  We do seem to be
headed in that direction which is good.

That still doesn't deal with the question of whether
humanity could survive a nuclear winter.  Presumably
it would have some months to prepare and arrange
survival centers (presumably clustered around any
remaining nuclear reactors) and as was pointed out
the southern hemisphere would likely be much less
affected.

It is interesting though that having nuclear reactors,
fuel supplies for several years and sufficient materials
to construct large areas of greenhouses with artificial
lighting would seem to be essential components for countries
that wish to survive *either* a large nuclear exchange or
a large NEO impact.

Well, the book was primarily about the comparative prevalence of plant
and animal species capable of being effectively domesticated on the
various continents and how migration of domesticated species tended to
stay within latitudinal zones, but the title of the book "Guns, Germs,
and Steel" had nothing to do with that research, and seems to reference
the three ingredients of the European decimation of the New World
cultures. So the left wing leap of logic from "european predominance was
foreordained by evolution in the context of agriculture" to the
conclusion that, therefore, "agriculture is bad because it is the cause
of imperialism" isn't that hard to figure out.

I'd love to hear the British perspective on this.
My understanding is that Keynes bitterly opposed the american terms during the
post war repayment negotiations, as he realised it would bankrupt britain and
collapse the empire. But I got this from a review of Keyne's works, as opposed
to reading those works themselves.

"Sharon's war on the Palestinians?"

Excuse me but some people have their facts all kittywhumpus.

The current cycle of violence began when Arafat walked out of the
peace process (itself possibly an act of war) back in Sept of 2000
after refusing to sign a plan that he negotiated, a plan that
encompassed something like 97%+ of what the Palestinians claimed to
have ever wanted. Ahud Barak had stuck his political neck way out
on that one, and then Arafat cut it off for him. Arafat then re-
initiated the intifada.

This led to the Israelis electing Sharon, but in effect it was the
Palestinians, in particular Arafat, who elected Sharon.

The intifada then culiminated in a series of acts of war, the most
important of which was the passover massacre.

When Arafat refused to deal properly deal with these attacks (as we
now know he was behind them) the Israelis had no choice left but to
put an end to these attacks themselves.

This is statecraft 101.

I saw the author of this book on MSNBC this weekend and he seemed
to make the most sense I've heard on this issue yet.

So far an excellent book.

The only bad point so far is that it was published in 1999 which
gives it almost an air of prophecy...

Oh, would you please go and tell this the military officers of various 
armies, who used terror bombings against civilians? The German Wehrmacht, 
"Bomber Harris", US airforce spraying biocides in Vietnam, Pol Pots killing 
fields and countless other slayings in Asia and Africa? Do you really think 
that _any_ "civilized" country, cornered in a brutal conflict, would 
refrain from using this last instrument? Are the families of the Palestine 
leaders, killed by Israelian missiles, no civilians? What is "collateral 
damage", after all, but calculated killed civilians? There is no 
"civilization" in war.

I'm sorry, Sir, in the business world I live and work, the companies try 
everything to maximize the profit, because that is what their share holders 
demand from them. It is at least the thruth for corporations like 
DaimlerChrysler (my personal experience). Your local drug store may still 
maintain an altruistic way of doing business; megacorps certainly don't.

This would leave the social responsibility totally on the consumers side. 
Okay, but how will the consumers be correctly informed about safety, 
working conditions in far away countries, etc. without any official 
controls? This would be the same situation as Saddam and his bio weapons.

And do you really think, that any Time-Warner branch would feature critical 
reports about AOL? Would Microsoft ever sponsor Linux?

The alleged "socialist" countries are perfect role models for megacorp 
driven economies, where individual entrepreneurship has no room to develop.

Maybe you'd care to explain exactly when and where this "random
bombing of cities" occured...

No doubt about that (last sentence). That's why we adopted the
technology we adopted after all. We WERE living there, and we selected
technology that brought us HERE, where we have more of what we wanted
THERE (food aplenty including chocolate, running water, malls,
entertainment, more knowledge than we can assimilate, contraception,
pornography, and endless massive audio-visual stimulation that gives
our brain the impression that we're doing so many things while lying
on a couch).

Let me say that I am *not* a primitivist (though I understand why some
people are and I respect that). I don't regret the hunter-gatherer
lifestyle. In the ancestral tribe, I am the guy who looks at the
trees, the animals, the children, the girls, my fellow hunters and my
own hands with amazement and tenderness, wondering what it all means,
and how we came to be what we are, why we always want to have sex, why
we die and what life is worth given that we'll die, and how we could
be more than what we are.

My point is to acknowledge "disadaptation", because it appears to me
as an obvious trend, which I feel in my bones, too, and to reflect
about how we can leave our archaic and disadapted old skin and adapt
to the potential we are starting to imagine.

All that being said, now I answer directly your question.

There are several rather obvious ways to answer it. One is to focus on
certain unattractive lifestyles common in our cities. I won't
elaborate on that: the huge French gray towers, the poverty, the
insecurity, the unemployment, the socio-ethnical problems (France has
the Arab-origin community, demographically explosive, mostly on
welfare, and that is kept apart by the rest of the community), the
huge proportion of dumb jobs, the boredom, the social stress...

Switch to something completely different: Microsoft Windows. Many
(otherwise priviledged) people struggle with it. I am appalled at how
much time of their life is wasted at trying to master something to
which they are so unadapted (and which is intrinsically dysfunctional,
too). Friends stay on the phone for hours discussing the problems
they've had. They amass a knowledge that will be worth nothing one
year later.

Turn to television. It's dangerously adapted to our cognitive
apparatus. Such a stream of moving images is just too seducive to
resist. A huge proportion of people just sits behinds it several hours
a day, bombarded by advertisment, and watching silly programs (often
with some illusory promise of sex) to keep them behind their set when
the next ads will come. Pretty humiliating again.

Go to the supermarket. Can you trust your desires? Can you follow them
joyfuly and taste the pleasure of their satisfaction? Nope. If you do,
you will eat only junk food (which by essence is designed to please
you), as many people in fact do, and your health will suffer. You have
to learn that "all that is good is not healthy" (why is it good then
for christ sake? because of disadaptation), and re-educate yourself
and get to learn that lettuce IS good, contrary to what you first
thought. You have to actually read books about the ancestral
environment to understand what your desires actually mean in terms of
diet. (See the URL given here by someone about "paleodiet".)

Never mind, what you really like in this world is learning, reading,
writing, thinking, etc., so this world is really made for you. But can
you keep learning all the time, and stay behind your screen connected
to the Internet in all of your leisure time? Neither. You have to
exercise. You have to run in loops to stay fit. Or even to sweat on a
fake bicycle in your apartment. How idiotic is that? Very! But you
have to, because your body is made to walk and run a lot, and if you
don't you run out of order. You may be in love with your brain, but it
was only designed to coordinate your body to walk, hunt, protect
yourself, and it is your body that sustains your brain. Focus on your
brain too much, and over time your body will get sick, then your brain
will get sick in turn.

Or think of the quantity of anxiety generated by Septembre 11, for
example. People who already have enough to cope with day to day, now
worry about guys thousands of km away who want to kill them, and about
whom they can do nothing. Great. The hunter-gatherer way of life was
precarious? Of course it was. But at least you knew what to focus on.
And every single thing in your body was designed to help you to cope
with it, including your arms, legs, sight, desires, instincts...

I think anyone could go on for hours about such things. They are all
examples of disadaptation. Every paragraph above describes one obvious
advantage...

- welfare and modern life represent a comfort and security
  unimaginable in the ancestral environment

- so are personal computers, that allow to make many things
  unthinkable before

- television is an incredible source of value, as an infinite yet
  almost free source of education, entertainment and quasi-experience

- the supermarket is a huge convenience, you can find everything at
  the same place, and get all what you need for one full week in one
  hour, at a very low price (fruits from the other part of the world
  for a few euros, or very complex industrial preparations)

- for those who like learning and "knowing stuff", it's obviously now
  the best time ever

- knowing about what happens everywhere in the world in real time is
  also arguably great

...but they nonetheless all bring a change of environment that makes
us more and more disadapted on the whole. This is a world where we can
do more and more; but we are less and less adapted to it.

This is not to say that SOME of us don't manage to live fulfilling
lifes. You're attractive, so you have lots of sex, and can arrange it
better than ever with your cellular phone. You're not poor, so you can
travel conveniently by airplane. You go scuba diving one day,
windsurfing the other day, then skiing for a change. You can't believe
how much fun you have. Your work is extremely exciting and
interesting, it pays a lot, and you live in a great, protected suburb.
You have re-educated yourself about diet, you don't eat junk food (in
fact they don't even please you anymore), you bought Harvey's 75 $
book on nutrients among many others, and you spend hours to measure
what you eat (or better yet you have someone else do it for you). You
just love lettuce and ginseng (they taste so excellent !), and eat
lots of fish. You love running in loops, too. You have no time left to
watch television, having more interesting things to do. You have a
computer, know how to use it (in fact part of your work is related to
computing, which is why it pays so good, as no one else is able to
cope with it), possibly you even run Linux and your last system crash
or accidental data loss was several years ago. You are connected to
the Internet, know how to use it, too, in fact you identified folks
with whom you share many interests, and you're having long discussions
with them, in which you have fun in your free time, learning and
trying to win arguments.

Whatever the value we personaly ascribe to such a lifestyle, I don't
see it as a desirable general target. My argument is not that it is
not "generally sustainable". It is that much of it really consists in
cultural tricks meant to readapt oneself, and somehow I feel that this
should not take so much room in one's life. It seems like one is one's
own child, and has to care about oneself as such.

While environment changes and you stay essentially the same, you can
rely less and less on internal guidance (desire, instinct), and you
must rely more and more on external guidance, other cultural
constructs. It all becomes complicated and artifical. Your body (which
is yourself in an important sense) becomes less and less of an
adequate tool for the simple job of your life, and more and more of a
bizarre baggage that you have to take care of while pursuing fancy
goals. You may of course focus on activities that exploit your
primitive faculties, sport and money accumulation being two primary
examples; disadaptation produces the market for such activities and
they naturally flourish as a remedy to frustration. But such
activities are disconnected from what really matters in your life (if
anything !). Which makes deep satisfaction elusive.

This is a problem that "primitivists" tend to stress (the way I
imagine them at least), and that "extropians" tend to repress. I don't
like the idea that what you share in a group is a blind spot.

(Note I have left completely aside obviously and massively negative
aspects like pollution, possible self-destruction, government control,
etc.)

Now here's an even more radical idea about disadaptation. Though it
manifests itself quite obviously in such trivial situations as those
given above, where a technology or social innovation has moved our
natural environment away from the ancestral one, the great Disadapter
is something else, which is itself the cause of cultural progress:
it's our imagination.

Our cognition has grown to a point where we can imagine too much
compared to what we are and can be. Our life form seems just bizarre,
one of too many possibilities. A fixed life form and a finite life
span is too tight a dress. Even more than having disadapted to our
environment, our body has disadapted to our mind. (This is how I feel,
at least.)

Seen that way, you could say that all the cultural endeavour is a
product of this imagination that is ahead of the body it inhabits, and
that this necessarily produces more obvious satisfaction (we get what
we wanted) and more disadaptation, until we change ourselves.

And then? One probable outcome (in a relatively peaceful and leisurely
environment) is that we redesign ourselves around our present desires
-- the mere implements of evolution to make us realize gene
replication -- in such a way that we can healthily focus on them only,
without having to take care of chores. And from this modest starting
point, we go on to explore further (think of Plato's idea that sexual
desire leads us to beauty).

And then? Mm, maybe we expand our imagination until we hit another
limit to change and start disadapting again by dreaming of being
something else, which we then proceed to bring to existence, etc.? Or,
we just stabilize, like oysters. Homo sapiens is intrinsically
unstable, because individuals are instrumental to their genes, which
combined to a superior cognition creates a tension that the individual
has to solve. But once it's solved, maybe we get happy for good and
stay there?

Yet another approach would be to say that the moment we start changing
ourselves is another "prediction wall" (but not linked per se to the
increase of intelligence). It may not be logically unpredictable, but
it definitely becomes much more difficult to predict than when we're
able to count on human nature.

Simply because it didn't have to be in the ancestral environment due
to the link sex -> procreation. I don't know about you, but personaly
my sexual fantasies and desires don't focus on procreating and having
babies...

It's back to mammalian asymetry. Males try to fecund as many females
as possible ; females try to select a good male for fecundation, and
try to keep one male (same or other) to invest on herself and the
offspring.

Women do seem to have a clear specific desire for babies in many
cases, which is to be expected from said asymetry: they have to plan
the whole thing from the beginning, including the raising; while men
don't really need to care about the raising.

Of course once the baby is here and the man has the possibility of
helping it, what is predicted is a trade-off between investing on the
baby or going on to other prospects. If the pair-bond is strong, then
he will gladly stay, care about the baby and possibly make a few
others with the same partner.

Except in extraordinary circumstances, the plastic is moving at the
speed of tectonic plates while culture is moving like a falling stone.

You argued elsewhere that as our environment had changed and we were
not adapted to it, that meant we would keep evolving. But you're
turning things upside down. What it shows is precisely the opposite:
it shows that we didn't catch up with cultural change, that we didn't
evolve (fast enough). The fact that cultural change not only
continues, but continues to accelerate (and possibly to accelerate its
acceleration) means that we can discard biological evolution for all
practical matters.

By the very definition of "market", it is a negative feedback loop.
Businesses only make money by /persuading/ people to give it to them.
Feedback is precise, immediate, and accurate: every time I buy brand A
instead of brand B, I am saying that company A better serves /my/
goals.  Now those goals might be a simple a effectively cleaning my
dishes, but they might also be for more what you would call socially
responsible reasons (and I would call simple ethics)--people can and
do buy products that pollute less, or from companies that support
causes they like, for example.  I buy products made in China, for
example, and I don't rent John Travolta or Rene Zellweger movies on
the outside chance that some of my pennies might make their way to the
Church of Scientology.

Government, on the other hand, I only get to provide feedback to
every couple of years or so, and my feedback doesn't count at all
unless I happen to be aligned with the majority.

Whether or not that suggestion is reasonable can be argued.
The plain, bald-faced, outright lie of your last sentence can't
be.  If you honestly believe this, then your opinions on this
matter are not worthy to be heard.

Look up the history to determine the actual extent this 
stretches the truth.  The Palestinians have been disowned and 
oppressed for decades now.  My opinions are at least as "worthy 
to be heard" as most on this list on this subject.

Excuse me.  I am saying that the Palestinians have every reason 
to be fighting mad and that they have been done dirty.  I am not 
saying every tactic they use is ok.  Although I would point out 
that they don't have a lot of alternatives.  Your 
characterisation of what I am saying is highly suspect.  Stop 
seeing me as an emeny or "irrational" and perhaps we can have a 
decent conversation for once.

They may have built their first nukes themselves although it can 
be asked where the expertise came from.  But we have certainly 
provided them with significant amounts of military hardware over 
the decades, much of it free of charge or very heavily 
subsidized.  It is a bit of an embarrassment when they use 
weaponry we provided to commit cold-blooded assasinations.

Responding to terrorist attacks you caused and provoked by your 
own policies with near genocide and destruction of a people and 
all their works does make you a 'majorly aggressive state'. 
Check the rhetoric also if you don't believe my claims on 
Israeli intention.

Absolutely!  That's why it's so infuriating to sit through
idiotic nonsense imparting total blame to one side or the
other, or grossly oversimplifying the situation along
ideological lines.  This is a problem that deserves some
serious rational thought; and the foundation of rationality
is simple honesty.  Eli's right on target: both sides are
completely nuts, and straightening it out requires setting
some tough standards of sane, rational, honest discourse
and reportage.

Yes, it's a bit rude; but I have no hope of persuading her
of anything--I want to point out idiotic rhetoric to the rest
of the group and hope they use that appropriately to judge the
credibility of its source.  Samantha's a tough case--she's
obviously quite bright and has her heart in the right place;
but that's no excuse to hold her to a lower standard of
honest discourse.

Nobody's arguing that a Palestinian has every right to be hopping
mad when an Israeli bureaucrat spits on his land deed, but the idea
that there are "no alternatives" to blowing up innocent civilians
is clearly contradicted by the experience of _hundreds_ of peoples
far more opressed than them, who chose means of resistance that
didn't cause decent people everywhere to revile them, hurting their
cause.  Even a man horribly wronged /can/ and /should/ be judged by
the moral choices he makes.  Oppression justifies resistance; it
does not justify barbarity, especially when other means have proven
to be more effective throughout history.

Sure; Isreal bombed (actually often shelled) Palestinian cities in response
to most terror bombings over the past intifada.  In no bombing case was there
any connection to the bombing itself.  In cases of various attacks on the
settlements, they often - but not always - attacked the neighborhood from
which the attack originated.  But everywhere here is in on the idea that
you don't attack people because they live where a crime was committed,
right?

I agree in many ways were are psychologically and physically suboptimal
for living in our current environment as happy, fulfulled, long-lived, etc.
individuals.  No disagreement there.

I would say we should rely less on genetic guidance and more on memetic 
guidance.  I'd say they are equivalently internal/external to me - both
are physically inside me, but derive from elsewhere and elsewhen.

>But such
>activities are disconnected from what really matters in your life (if
>anything !). Which makes deep satisfaction elusive.

This I don't agree with.  I don't see why deep satistifaction must rely
on genetic goals with our current getup.  In the abstract, our genes
lay out what satisfies us but in the past I don't think they've had reason
to devalue memetic drives.   Indeed, since that's what made us so successful
as a species they might overvalue it.  Only now is there a strong reason
for genes to devalue memetic input; I expect we will evolve that way
but you and I will not have done so much.

I think the quest for "deep satisfaction" is quixotic.  We are constructed
by an array of replicators with conflicting goals; you can't make them all
happy at once.  Further, I think happiness is a motivator and perfect, 
unimprovable
situations are rarity at best in the past.  So, you are always programmed
to be somewhat disatisfied to keep you looking for the improvements which
are always there.

They do stress it, but I think a) they're chasing a chimera and b) they 
don't realize how nasty the biologically driven desires can be.

I perceive a similar disadaptation, but I put a different spin on it.  I
think our minds have developed into marvelous things that are increasingly
held back by the body.  The body's not disadapting (which sounds 
like an active process), just left behind.

This would be my view.  But I think  we can improve the odds by considering
what encourages cooperative behavior and programming ourselves for that-
e.g., division of labor, need to cooperate, high positive externalities (= 
poorly enforced intellectual property), secure property.  I certainly don't
want to interfere with the tremendous potential of transhuman development
for the sake of stupid callous pieces of plastic, which is all a gene is.
To a large extend, we are means to their ends, but their ends are not 
particularly
nice and I'm happy to change the situation.

No; you want sex because that produced babies for the genes; no need
for you to know why.  But, if most people are given a baby, they want
to watch out for it, take care of it, play with it, etc., and this is 
particularly
true for people involved with gestation or birth.  So you have additional,
nonsexual, desires for children.  If those become overwhelming enough,
the genes can count on your mind to figure out ways around contraception,
etc.  Potentially the desire for sex per se could go out the window and
the genes could rely on concious intent to procreate to serve that purpose.
More likely, the old way will stick around as a backup plan.

Genes can evolve quite rapidly if there's selection pressure.  There's not
much selection pressure for them to make us happy, so they don't much
bother.  Heart attacks at 60 carry small reproductive losses, so
we're not heading away from apolipoprotien E4 (linked to heart disease,
alzheimer's and stroke, yet predomimant in human populations) very 
quickly.  But if something affects reproduction, things can change rather
fast - you could get a noticeable effect in one human lifetime.  If we
have a Singularity in 2020, of course it's moot, but I don't believe
in counting unhatched chickens.  Further, one thing relevant to future
transhuman development is restraining the renunciationists, and I think
pointing out their goal (stasis, basically) is impossible will help control
them.

We can see some specific human genetic adaptations in skin color, adult
lactose tolerance, and body shape variation.  It does happen when it 
matters.

But *why* was there an intifada and *why* were their terrorist bombings?

It seems you assume that assaults on innocent civilians is a valid
response relative to political solutions.

If terrorists assault civilians, is not an equal response on civilians
justified?  [There are two choices -- you can clean your own house
or I can clean it for you.]

If you have no police authority over the state in question, how else
do you impress upon the people of that settlement that originating
terrorist attacks has consequences.  [I'll note that the Israelis
have uncovered something like a dozen clandestine explosives
manufacturing labs.]

> But everywhere here is in on the idea that you don't attack

It comes down to your "moral" duty as a citizen.  If I were to
discover that my next door neighbor were assembling a nuclear
weapon in his basement, could I claim lack of responsibility
if I failed to inform the authorities and it happened to end
up killing thousands of people?  I'll notice that a number
of Palestinian deaths over the last few weeks have been because
Palestinians have been assasinating individuals suspected of
collaborating.  The street demonstrations of Palestinians
have clearly shown that they favor the terrorist approach.
What ye sow, so shall ye reap.

If your goal is "peace", then the selective removal
of the terrorists should promote that.  Individuals who
provide information to accomplish that should be held
up as heros and not be considered traitors and suffer
for that.

Robert

The rhetoric was not "idiotic" and I already apologized for 
where it was a bit over-the-top and put out the timeline.  So I 
did not appreciate your own rhetoric directed toward me at all.

Carbon Nanotubes Grow Up, Out, and In All Three Dimensions. 
Rensselaer Researchers Achieve Unprecedented Control over Nanotube 
Growth. Next-generation computer chips, integrated circuits, and the 
microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices that power them depend upon 
carbon nanotubes that can be grown up, down, sideways, and in all 
three dimensions. Researchers at Rensselaer are the first to achieve 
this unprecedented, specific, and controlled nanotube growth. Their 
research, reported in the April 4 issue of the journal Nature, paves 
the way for Lilliputian devices that depend on tiny networks and 
architectures.

Correspondingly, the world of research has grown more minute, a realm

the nanoscale (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter) scientists 
may develop chemical and biological sensors that will be far more

I find myself inclining more and more to the view that people fall into the
worst disagreements because they allow themselves to confuse assertions of
the moderate, partial form `Some A is B' with the universal claim `All A is
B'. However, only in mathematics or logic--abstract constructs--is the `All
is' form even likely to be true, because out here in the real world
everything is composite, rimose, concatenated, transitional... There's
something to be said for the late Sir Isaiah Berlin's view of pluralism,
here cited from his final essay, published in the New York Review of Books,
Vol XLV, Number 8 (1998):

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/berlin.html

===========


I came to the conclusion that there is a plurality of ideals, as there is a
plurality of cultures and of
temperaments. I am not a relativist; I do not say "I like my coffee with
milk and you like it without; I am
in favor of kindness and you prefer concentration camps" -- each of us with
his own values, which
cannot be overcome or integrated. This I believe to be false. But I do
believe that there is a plurality of
values which men can and do seek, and that these values differ. There is
not an infinity of them: the
number of human values, of values that I can pursue while maintaining my
human semblance, my
human character, is finite -- let us say 74, or perhaps 122, or 26, but
finite, whatever it may be. And the
difference it makes is that if a man pursues one of these values, I, who do
not, am able to understand
why he pursues it or what it would be like, in his circumstances, for me to
be induced to pursue it. Hence
the possibility of human understanding.

I think these values are objective -- that is to say, their nature, the
pursuit of them, is part of what it is to
be a human being, and this is an objective given. The fact that men are men
and women are women and
not dogs or cats or tables or chairs is an objective fact; and part of this
objective fact is that there are
certain values, and only those values, which men, while remaining men, can
pursue. If I am a man or a
woman with sufficient imagination (and this I do need), I can enter into a
value system which is not my
own, but which is nevertheless something I can conceive of men pursuing
while remaining human, while
remaining creatures with whom I can communicate, with whom I have some
common values -- for all
human beings must have some common values or they cease to be human, and
also some different
values else they cease to differ, as in fact they do.

That is why pluralism is not relativism -- the multiple values are
objective, part of the essence of
humanity rather than arbitrary creations of men's subjective fancies.
Nevertheless, of course, if I pursue
one set of values I may detest another, and may think it is damaging to the
only form of life that I am able
to live or tolerate, for myself and others; in which case I may attack it,
I may even -- in extreme cases --
have to go to war against it. [etc]

No, you don't respond to attacks on civilians by killing civilians.  Attacking
*the responsible people* can be justified and civilian casualties may be
an inevitable effect of that.  Shelling apartment buildings more-or-less at
random is not justified.  IMO if you kill an innocent in the process of 
killing
somebody guilty you're at least partially responsible for the death and
due to make recompense, just as if you smack up somebody's car by 
accident.

The *current* Israeli campaign is in the abstract justified - they've invaded,
and are seizing arms and militants from a wanted list or with cause, and
they apparently intend to leave after the current incursion.  A lot of 
specifics
- unnecessary violence, a judge/jury/executioner problem, etc. - create
some ethical problems.  OTOH, I think something like this is necessary -
somebody has to get at the militants and the PLO obviously isn't going to.
Unfortunately, I don't expect the Israeli government to then act against
the Jewish nuts, especially the settlers, who are mostly on stolen land.

Attacking innocents is exactly what the terror bombers are doing.
Attacking innocent Palestinians is just as counterproductive as attacking
innocent Israelis, and no more justified.

>of the terrorists should promote that.  

Yes, but Israeli has been doing anything but selective removal until 
recently.  It's still probably not very selective.

Companies, megacorps, and so on do not engage in cognitive processes, such as profit-seeking, this is solely the realm of individual
human beings.
The primary concern of a shareholder, as part-owner, is return _of_  principle (the protection of their private property), not
return _on_ prinicple. Without preservation of capital (the physical resources of the company), there is no need to entertain
profit-maximizing schemes. The owners of capital, whether they are associated with private groups or a State, most assuredly do have
to realize a profit to be able to continue to operate their enterprise. Without a profit, there is no surplus of goods to exchange
for the other things the people involved value, hence no motivation to continue. (I think profit would revert to the originary
interest rate in a noiseless information exchange regime.)

I would guess that most of the people associated with the collection of time-evolving relationships referred to as DaimlerChrysler
often have their attentional spotlights focused on how to build and sell a car. Possibly a large percentage of them went into their
fields because they found that kind of work interesting. An employee that is not a part-owner may or may not think he is adaquately
compensated for his labor/focus. This is a subjective value. In a deception and violence-free market the objective exchange value
(the money-price) of that labor is discovered through the time-evolving processes of billions of dyadic transactions- a massively
parallel search algorithm if you will. (Incidently, DaimlerChrysler is a case-in-point of mis-management causing a loss in capital
value. Picking up Chrysler appears to have been a poor business decision.)

The subjective value theory (called goal-directed behavior in some circles)- the basis of all human action- does not require
decompositional artifices such as:

altruistic/selfish
socialist/capitalist
right wing/left wing
friendly/unfriendly
rational/irrational

Uh, no, nor did I write such. Monopolist outfits such as the aforementioned three would cease to exist in a violence-free market.
They are the spawn of regulatory agencies, old-boy networks, etc. Labling it crony socialism is just as useful as calling it
fascism, neo-mercantilism or crony capatalism.

>From the first chapter of his biography, a pleasingly extropian touch:

http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/i/ignatieff-berlin.html
==================

It is often said that his equanimity, together with his liberalism, are the
products of privilege. He has had a lucky and privileged life -- parents
who adored him, an exile that did not scar him, election to All Souls at
twenty-three, marriage to a gifted, supportive and wealthy woman -- these
have enabled him to make manifest what is often frustrated in others. But
make it manifest he did, when others might have thrown their advantages
away. There is in his temperament some impalpable source of health and
well-being. He is well in his skin, at home in the world, at ease even with
the advancing prospect of his own death. This cool, even cold serenity
seems mysterious, unapproachable, unavailable to me; and in all our
afternoons together, it is this that I most wish to understand. To be an
intellectual is often to be unhappy: his happiness is an achievement worth
seeking to explain. 
     `Do you wish you could live for ever?' he once asked me. His mother
lived until she was ninety-four. I told him the idea filled me with horror.
He heard me out, then said, `All of my friends think the same. But I do
not. I wish it would continue indefinitely. Why not?' Albert Einstein met
him once and remarked afterwards that he seemed like `a kind of spectator
in God's big but mostly not very attractive theatre'. He has never tired of
life's theatre and he imagines himself watching its lighted stage for ever.

Which timeline, incidently, corrected a mistake of mine.  
Even when personal attacks are true they don't seem to produce
useful discussion - and opinions of other people forged in the heat
of bitter dispute aren't often particularly accurate.  It's possible
to post on this list, even on controversial topics, without getting
into flamewars.  Our calls for "reasonable behavior" on the part
of the Israelis and Palestinians rings a bit hollow when we degenerate
into personal attacks.  It's really offtopic for this list to discuss
the Palestinian topic, but I think it would be on topic if we could
demonstrate how people with deeply held, emotionally important
opinions could have civil and productive discussion.  It's a skill
we need to be widespread for our own goals, no?

I think that statement is quite true, equally true is the statement "the
Israelis have
every reason to be fighting mad and have been done dirty". One side kills a
child
because the other side killed a child because one side stole some property a
hundred
years ago from the other side that stole it a thousand years ago; anybody
looking for
the good guy in this ridiculous religious conflict will be looking forever.
Perhaps the
only solution is for Martians to blow up every mosque temple and church in
the mid east,
then everybody would be so mad at them they'd forget to fight each other.

Interesting.  Then why exactly are corporations treated as a 
legal entity, a separate extra-biological being with intent and 
liability as such?  Corporations are collections of human beings 
and thus exhibit collective cognitive processes.  And yet they 
are considered an entity in their own right beyond the 
individuals that are at any time employees or investors.

If the overriding concernin is simply ROI then by definition 
corporations are at best amoral entitites.  It is certainly not 
generally true that any all things are kosher if they maximize 
profits.  As a person likely to start a new company eventually, 
I certainly am not interested only or foremost in how much 
profit it makes.  I am first of all interested in what kind of 
difference it can make in the world.

So you are claiming that an absolutely unfettered, unregulated 
market would produce nothing but good?  On what evidence?  I 
know the theory but theory wears thin by itself. If the purpose 
of business enterprises is fundamentally ROI then the theory 
amounts to saying that unregulated pursuit-of-profit will always 
lead to a good outcome.

=========================================

    STANDARD FOR PEAS

    I. DEFINITION OF PRODUCE
This standard applies to peas of varieties 
(cultivars) grown from Pisum sativum L. 
to be supplied fresh to the consumer,
peas for industrial processing being excluded.
According to the type of consumption, peas 
are classified in two groups:
- shelling peas (round peas, wrinkled peas) 
intended for consumption without the pod,
- mangetout peas and sugar snap peas intended 
for consumption with the pod.

    II. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY
The purpose of the standard is to define 
the quality requirements for peas after 
preparation and packaging.
A. Minimum requirements
In all classes, subject to the special provisions 
for each class and the tolerances allowed:
(i) the pods must be:
- intact; however mangetout and sugar snap 
peas that have had their ends removed are allowed,
- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration 
such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,
- clean, practically free of any visible foreign 
matter (including parts of the flowers),
- free from hard filaments or films in mangetout 
peas and sugar snap peas,
- practically free from pests,
- practically free from damage caused by pests,
- free of abnormal external moisture,
- free of any foreign smell and/or taste,
(ii) the seeds must be:
- fresh,
- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration 
such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,
- practically free from pests,
- practically free from damage caused by pests,
- free of any foreign smell and/or taste,
- normally developed in shelling peas.
The development and condition of peas must be such 
as to enable them:
- to withstand transport and handling, and
- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place 
of destination.
B. Classification
Peas are classified in two classes defined below:
(i) Class I
Peas in this class must be of good quality. 
They must be characteristic of the variety and/or 
the commercial type.
The pods must be:
- fresh and turgid,
- free from damage caused by hail,
- free from damage caused by heating.
For shelling peas:
- the pods must be:
- with peduncles attached,
- well filled, containing at least five seeds;
- the seeds must be:
- well formed,
- tender,
- succulent and sufficiently firm, i.e., when squeezed 
between two fingers they should become flat without 
disintegrating,
- at least half the full-grown size but not full grown,
- non-farinaceous,
- undamaged, without cracks in the skin of the seeds;
- the following slight defects of the pod, however, 
may be allowed, provided these do not affect 
the general appearance of the produce, the quality, 
the keeping quality and presentation in the package:
- slight skin defects, injuries and bruises,
- slight defects in shape.
- slight defects in colouring.
For mangetout peas and sugar snap peas:
- the seeds if present must be small and underdeveloped,
- the following very slight defects of the pod, however, 
may be allowed, provided these do not affect the general 
appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping 
quality and presentation in the package:
- very slight skin defects, injuries and bruises,
- very slight defects in shape,
- very slight defects in colouring.
(ii) Class II
This class includes peas which do not qualify for 
inclusion in class I but satisfy the minimum requirements 
specified above.
For shelling peas:
- the pods must contain at least three seeds,
- they may be riper than those in class I, but 
over-mature peas are excluded,
- the following defects may be allowed provided 
the peas retain their essential characteristics 
as regards the quality, the
keeping quality and presentation:
- defects of the pods:
- skin defects, injuries and bruises provided they are 
not progressive and there is no risk of the seeds being 
affected,
- defects in shape,
- defects in colouring,
- some loss of freshness, excluding wilted pods;
- defects of the seeds:
- a slight defect in shape,
- a slight defect in colouring,
- be slightly harder,
- be slightly damaged.
For mangetout peas and sugar snap peas:
- the seeds if present can be slightly more developed 
than in class I,
- the following defects of the pods may be allowed 
provided the peas retain their essential characteristics 
as regards the quality, the keeping quality and presentation:
- slight skin defects, injuries and bruises,
- slight defects in shape, including those due to 
the seed formation,
- slight defects in colouring,
- some loss of freshness, excluding wilted and 
uncoloured pods.

    III. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING 
Sizing is not compulsory for peas.

    IV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES
Tolerances in respect of quality shall be allowed 
in each package for produce not satisfying the 
requirements of the class indicated.
(i) Class I
10 % by weight of peas not satisfying the requirements 
of the class, but meeting those of class II or, 
exceptionally, coming within the tolerances of that class.
(ii) Class II
10 % by weight of peas satisfying neither the requirements 
of the class nor the minimum requirements, with the exception 
of produce affected by rotting, progressive diseases or 
any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.

    V. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION
A. Uniformity
The contents of each package must be uniform and 
contain only peas of the same origin, variety or 
commercial type, and quality.
The visible part of the contents of the package 
must be representative of the entire contents.
B. Packaging
Peas must be packed in such a way as to protect 
the produce properly.
The materials used inside the package must be new, 
clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing 
any external or internal damage to the produce. 
The use of materials, particularly of paper or 
stamps bearing trade specifications is allowed
provided the printing or labelling has been done 
with non-toxic ink or glue.
Packages must be free of all foreign matter.
VI. PROVISIONS CONCERNING MARKING
Each package must bear the following particulars, 
in letters grouped on the same side, legibly and 
indelibly marked, and visible from the outside:
(A) Identification
Packer and/or dispatcher: name and address or 
officially issued or accepted code mark. 
However, where a code mark is used,
the reference "packer and/or dispatcher 
(or equivalent abbreviations)" has to be 
indicated in close proximity to the code
mark.
(B) Nature of produce
- "shelling peas", "mangetout peas", "sugar snap peas", 
or equivalent denominations if the contents are not 
visible from the outside,
- "trimmed", "topped and tailed" or other indications, 
for mangetout or sugar snap peas that have their 
peduncle and/or blossom end removed, where appropriate.
(C) Origin of produce
- Country of origin and, optionally, district 
where grown, or national, regional or local 
place name.
(D) Commercial specifications
- Class.
(E) Official control mark (optional)

Maybe you guys saw something I didn't.  But I didn't come away with the 
impression that it's a white power site.  One of the qualities that "they" 
list as desirable for their members is a willingness to frankly discuss 
issues of race.  That, in my mind, does not a racist make.  Most of what I 
saw at the site actually made sense to me.  In fact if it weren't for the 
fact that I just don't the have time to follow yet another mailing list, I'd 
think seriously about subscribing.  And, for those who don't know, I'm a 
black guy.

Did any of you actually see anything at the site that was explicitly racist, 
or did you just assume such from the subject line of this thread?

Zero, let me ask you. If you did find these transhumanists to be neonazis, 
what would you do? Would you send them a nasty note, or warn other extropians 
to watch out for them because of their deceit (assuming they are deceitful) ? 


Basically, if they happen to be peddling White Power, however softly, you and 
I know what they are. Rain is usually quite wet, and snow is typically white 
(minus dog waterings), and so forth. Why give the benefit of the doubt to a 
bunch of people whose world-view is so anathema to transhumanism?

For what its worth, I have tried reading a bit about Isaiah Berlin a few 
years back (consolation of philosophy and all that) and found his philosophy 
too tenuous for me. But each to their own :)

have enabled him to make manifest what is often frustrated in others. But
make it manifest he did, when others might have thrown their advantages
away. There is in his temperament some impalpable source of health and
well-being. He is well in his skin, at home in the world, at ease even with
the advancing prospect of his own death.>>

Hi folks,

For the first time in 6 years, I woke up to no spam in my email box.
This is a minor victory for me, as spam had reached levels of
80 per day, and during travels, it was hopelessly choking my ability
to use my own domain for email. (Perhaps solutions are obvious to
you techno-whizkids, but I needed to go through a trial-and-error
to discover it).

The solution to removing spam (if you have access to the Unix shell
for your email) is procmail plus spambouncer. The spambouncer
people provide excellent tutorials for how to set up the two, even for
people like me who are not Unix wizards.

This is a legal "theory" that apparently started with the 1898 US Bankruptcy Act ( a pivotal year in the overseas extension of the
American Empire). The word "person" was redefined to include such fictious entites. This is an ex post facto "law" as the word
"person" is already employed in the US Constitution. That Act of Congress, along with the Federal Reserve Act (Dec 23, 1913), the
Trading With the Enemy Act (1917, amended 1933), the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (1935), the Buck Act (1940), several
Executive Orders (e.g. #6102, 1933), the un-ratified 16th Amendment, and a few others, form the basic "theory" behind the unlawful,
unconstitutional corporate State and its Administrative Code (e.g USC, WAC). This is just of the top of my head, some of the dates
might not be precise.

Sure, everybody here remembers all the pictures on T.V. of Israeli
artillery lobbying shells randomly all over the West Bank and
Gaza...

Absolute utter nonsense...

Israelis targets are always related to the act involved, in the one
apartment attack I remember recently, the Israelis fired a missile
into an apartment building specifically targeting the home of an
attacker. The message: enemies of Israel are not safe anywhere. I
never saw a more surgical strike.

As regards attacks on the Palestinians if they use a shell it comes
from a tank, which as anyone with military experience can tell you
is completely different from an artillery shell.

The Israelis routinely use guided missiles, but they are known to
use artillery in Lebanon. (where they battle the Syrian army)

It is the terrorists (Palestinians) who use mortars and unguided
rockets.

The current Israeli sweep through the West Bank is using an
absolute minimum of heavy armor and is house to house in hostile
neighborhoods, yet the civilian causalities are by far the lowest
ever for such an operation. As anyone with military experience can
tell you this is usually where the highest rate of civilian
causalities occur.

Same here. I checked out the site and didn't see anything to indicate such 
a nasty view, though I didn't scan everything. I thought it was disturbing 
for other reasons. I would appreciate a pointer to any real indicators of 
white power/racism.

Thanks,

>Amara or Greg urged us to go read European opinion pieces. [...]

Another news source is the International Herald Tribune. About 1 year
ago they started publishing a section interior to their main paper
which is a translation of a newspaper specific to that country.  I
think that it's a great idea.

I've only read the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (Germany) and
Rizzoli Corriere della Sera (Italy) versions so far, but I thought
both were really helpful for giving the reader a 'sense' of the
important issues important for the region's people as well as the
"mood". If you don't have the access or language skills or time to
read the original language/full newspaper versions, then this is at
least some good information.

International Herald Tribune Publishing Partners: 
Ha'aretz, Kathimerini, Italy Daily (Rizzoli Corriere della Sera),
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, JoongAng Ilbo, The Daily Star

-------------------------------------------------------
Info from their Web site:
http://www.iht.com/global.htm

"In Israel, Greece, Italy, Germany, South Korea, Japan, Lebanon,
Spain, and The Netherlands, the International Herald Tribune is in
partnership with nine high profile, quality newspapers to provide a
special supplement of local news, in English.

This page is updated throughout the day to incorporate the most recent
PDFs from each newspaper.
                              
All newspapers are generally available by midday GMT, on the date of
publication, if not sooner.

PDF versions of El Pais and Het Financieele Dagblad will appear
shortly."

It sounds from the comments like he was an individual that
managed to discover his own path to self-enlightenment.
That is something that doesn't occur very often and is
very difficult to communicate to those that haven't
also discovered the trick.

Yeah, I may have to watch "Vanilla Sky" at my sister's house
or something; it's getting pretty hard to avoid them these days.
The other one that I have a hard time avoiding is Nancy Cartwright,
the voice of Bart Simpson.  I still watch the television show,
but I don't have any merchandise.

Agreed. Part of that skill, which you did not follow in the posting that 
directly preceded that one, is to avoid inflammatory language. Which not 
only encourages the discussion to devolve into flames but is usually an 
inaccurate way of expressing what you mean to say.

In an attempt to both shed light on the Middle East conflict and get more 
on-topic, I'd like us to pull back to discuss issues that relate to the 
societal end-state and dispute resolution we're after and how we get there 
from here.

What is your factual basis for asserting that a majority of Jewish West 
Bank settlements are built on stolen land? What makes land stolen -- under 
current laws, or in Anarchotopia or Libertopia?

If Arab residents were voluntarily compensated for the land, it is not 
stealing. But if the land was unclaimed, is it stealing?  If the Arab 
residents were involuntarily compensated, is it stealing?

The Arab residents of the West Bank were citizens of Jordan in 
1967.  Jordan fought a war against Israel and lost the West Bank.

If A initiates violence against B, B is justified in defending themself 
against A.  If in the course of defense, A obtains the property of B, is A 
justified in keeping that property?

If A and B are states, and B obtains the property of citizens of A in the 
course of a lawful defense against aggression initiated by A, what should 
happen?  Should B have to give back private property?  Should B get to keep 
it but A has to compensate its citizens for their loses?  Does it matter 
whether A is a dictatorship, a democracy, a voluntary association, or 
private contracted protective services?

How imminent and incontrovertible must a threat of violence be before you 
are justified in taking preemptive action?  Israel launched preemptive 
attacks against Jordan and other Arab nations in 1967 based on their claims 
of proof that those nations were days away from initiating attacks against 
Israel.

Is there a time limit on assertions of property rights?

If Mike robs Spike and gives the signed, first edition of _Engines of 
Creation_ to Gina, who sells it to Russell, we might hold Gina and Russell 
harmless and even compensate them, but Spike gets his book back.

What if Mike robbed Spike, and then Perry robbed Mike?  Is it a crime to 
rob a robber?  Then Spike took a vow of poverty, turned himself into an 
M-brain, and disappeared without a trace.  What should happen to Mike, 
Perry, and to the book?

There is not a clear personal provenance for any of the West Bank (or 
really, for nearly all of the planet). We know that it was part of Jordan, 
which was given it by the British, who took it in the course of prosecuting 
WW I.  We can trace back through the Ottoman Empire ultimately to the 
eviction of Jews from the provinces of Judea and Samaria.  If we continue 
the story through the Bible, the Jews obtained the land from the original 
inhabitants through divinely-sanctioned warfare.  However, recent 
archaeological research casts doubt on certain of the stories.

So how far do we go back?  When do we decide the historical record is too 
uncertain, and stop?  What rights do the descendents of the original 
landowners have?  Is there such a thing as tribal rights?  If you assume 
that the Jews *were* forcibly evicted from Israel, and that they had a bona 
fide claim to the land there, do people who assert an ethnic, racial, or 
religious identity with them have any rights?  (Similar to the question of 
slavery reparations:  who has a valid claim against whom?)

A side issue: Jordan is a fairly strong monarchy.  I'm guessing that, as 
such, all the land technically belonged to King Hussein, not to the 
inhabitants of the West Bank.

Are you sure you guys are behaving rationally here? Suppose the movie is
worth $10 to you, you only have to pay $7 to see it, and the marginal cost
of showing the movie to an additional person is $3, then you're spending
$3 of your money and $4 of other people's money to prevent some pennies
going to the Church of Scientology.  Wouldn't it be better to see the
movie and donate $3 to an anti-Scientology organization or some other
worthy cause? 

And what's the deal with not buying products made in China? What cause
does that serve?

I get it from the newspaper.  But, yes, after most suicide bombings,
I recall an Israeli attack on a Palestinian residential community

Considering that the suicide bombers are dead by the time this
happens, no strike could possibly be considered "surgical".  I suppose
you would suggest seizing my assets to cover my brother's
near-bankruptcy?

It goes "boom" and kills nearby people regardless of guilt.  I consider
these the relevant factors.

While the current sweep could certainly be worse, I've seen many
reports, including from foreign correspondants, of trigger-happy
soldiers and tragic *possibly* accidental deaths.  Yes, the correspondants
tend to be Pallestinian-leaning since the Israelis are trying to exclude
reporters - but that very exclusion inclines me to believe the other
side.  You don't cover up unless you've something to hide.

Anti-Trustworthy computing
Microsoft's new security drive aims to appease Hollywood, comfort consumers
and reinvigorate the PC. But will the price for such safety be too high?

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Paul Boutin

April 9, 2002



 Would you trust your life to Microsoft?

That's the challenge the company's "Trustworthy Computing" initiative is
throwing down. First hinted at publicly in one of Bill Gates' rare
companywide e-mails earlier this year, the sweeping concept was explained in
detail in a white paper written by CTO Craig Mundie for January's World
Economic Forum summit in New York.

"Computers helped transport people to the moon and back, they control
critical aircraft systems for millions of flights every year, and they move
trillions of dollars around the globe daily, [but] they generally haven't
reached the point where people are willing to entrust them with their lives,
implicitly or explicitly," Mundie wrote. "We will have to make the computing
ecosystem sufficiently trustworthy that people don't worry about its
fallibility or unreliability the way they do today ... It may take us ten to
15 years to get there."

Microsoft is making a big play on its new push: In a wager detailed in the
May issue of Wired magazine, Mundie has bet Google CEO Eric Schmidt that by
2030, passengers will routinely board commercial airline flights without a
pilot. That is, United and American flights will be flown entirely by
computers. 

Six months after Sept. 11, you have to wonder: Is he nuts?

Those who've followed the company's escapades the past few years are asking
a different question: What's the spin here? What does Microsoft stand to
gain by planting in our minds the image of computer systems so reliable
we'll leave more fallible human pilots on the ground?

Perhaps, if we'll trust computers with our lives, we'll also trust them with
our credit cards. And maybe, even more important, Hollywood will trust them
with its movies. The Trustworthy Computing initiative is as much about
securing intellectual property control as it is about "safety."

Technically I shouldn't claim a "majority" since I haven't done the studies.
But I've seem many,many reports of evicted Palestinians.  I suspect rather
few have sold their land voluntarily.

>What makes land stolen -- under 
>current laws, or in Anarchotopia or Libertopia?

If somebody's using the land and nobody else has a claim to have been using
it in the last, oh, 400, years, I'd say it's theirs.  If they are then 
deprived
of the land or it's use, it's stolen.

Convention in wars of conquest is that the law used is now that of
the conquering nation but ownership remains with individuals.  Of course,
if the new nation's laws are unjust they're unjust.

>If Arab residents were voluntarily compensated for the land, it is not 
>stealing. But if the land was unclaimed, is it stealing?  If the Arab 
>residents were involuntarily compensated, is it stealing?

Yes.  If an independent, unbiased judge determines the compensation
is fair, I'm willing to let it go.  But the Israelis haven't done that.  
I would think much more highly of their policies if they went to something
like the Hague court and said "We've taken this land but for security
reasons we simply cannot give it back.  What's a fair compensation 
for this?"  But they haven't.

>How imminent and incontrovertible must a threat of violence be before you

A sticky issue.  Under the circumstances, I'm willing  to give Israel the 
benefit
of the doubt on security issues.  Plopping settlements all over the West Bank
and Gaza Strip (of all the stupid places for a settlement!) is not enhancing
their security.

>Is there a time limit on assertions of property rights?

Yes, it makes no sense to try to compensate for thousand-year-old wrongs.
But the benefit of the doubt goes to the current survivors with the oldest
claim or their immediate family.  And the *assertions* have been going on
continuously.  I'd say it goes beyond that, although
the exact demarcation isn't clear.  The US is going back centuries with
Indian claims and I think they're pretty reasonable.

Mike and Perry: petty theft punishments.  Book - dispose of as Spike's
abandoned property.  Kinda moot though: how many dispossed Palestinians
have joined M-brains along with all of their descendants and heirs?

(discussion of complex history of which countries have ruled the West
Bank)

We're not discussing Israeli taking the Bank from Jordan.  We're discussing
settlers taking land from residents and farmers.  The history of which
gangs of crooks have been robbing the residents is moot.

>So how far do we go back?  When do we decide the historical record is too 
>uncertain, and stop?  What rights do the descendents of the original 
>landowners have? 

Any Israeli who can demonstrate descent from a Palestinian resident of
2000 years ago could make a claim for his/her portion of that resident's
land.  Otherwise, let it be.  Such claims might be too much (due to their
age) - but they are certainly not too little.  More is inappropriate.

>A side issue: Jordan is a fairly strong monarchy.  I'm guessing that, as 
>such, all the land technically belonged to King Hussein, not to the 
>inhabitants of the West Bank.

Quite possibly; there have been some discussions here on Hernando 
de Soto's ideas that denial of proper title to residents underlies much
of the limitations to growth.  In that case, Hussein stole it from the
residents and now Israel stole it from him.  Ethically Israel should
give it to the proper owners.  IMO if Israel had gone into the West Bank
in 1967 and straightened out ownership, giving it to the families who've
been there for years in a modern legal way, they would be *vastly*
more secure than they are now.

RIO DE JANEIRO - City tourism officials plan to sue the producers of
the animated sitcom "The Simpsons" over its depiction of Rio de
Janeiro in a recent episode, according to a report in O Globo, a
daily.

In the episode, "Blame it on Lisa," broadcast March 31 in the United
States, the family travels to Rio to find a missing orphan that
middle child Lisa Simpson sponsors from a distance.

Brazilian critics decried the use of cliches and stereotypes in the
episode, as well as the mixing of Brazilian elements with broader
Latin American themes.

For example, the Brazilians on the show danced conga, had Spanish
accents and wore mustaches.

In the episode the Simpson father, Homer, is kidnapped by a taxi
driver, the family is assaulted by begging Brazilian children on a
beach, and the family visits Rio slums infested by violent monkeys.

Tourism Secretary Jose Eduardo Guinle asked the lawyer for Rio's
tourism agency, Riotur, to file suit in U.S. courts for damages
caused to the city's image.

Riotur has invested $18 million to promote the city around the
world, officials said.

Brazil is not the first foreign nation to be the target of the zany
satire that has made "The Simpsons" the longest-running animated
series on U.S. television.

Earlier this season, "clean, bland" Canada and its ingrained
insecurities were riffed and ridiculed by the yellow-skinned Simpson
family, while Australia, Britain, Japan and France have been
targeted in past episodes.

That's actually a very good point.  Maybe I'll change my strategy
to sending a donation to Operation Clambake when I rent one of those
movies.

Slave labor.  As long a China tolerates slavery, the U.S. should
not be trading with them.  I don't buy that cultural relativist
nonsense--slavery is wrong, always has been wrong, and always will
be wrong, and must not be supported or tolerated.

I like this response.  But why on earth would the marginal cost be as high

Hmmm. The homepage has a symbol that looks like a variation of the Nazi 
symbol to me. They also seem to have a very elitist view on things:
<QUOTE>
So what's the moral of the story here? Well, make sure that you're one of the 
first Powers, obviously, but more on that later.
</QUOTE>

But that quote raises an interesting question I have never thought about yet:

Could the Singularity happen as a paranoid arms race of augmentation devices 
where everybody tries to stay on top of the development because all those who 
fall back will not perform well enough to make enough money or so to get into 
the lext level? And whoever falls back too much will simply be trampled down?

Hope you have some good points against that!

I already have a simple filter that works to block almost all spam.  My 
e-mail filter simply makes sure that mail coming into my mailbox is 
actually addressed to me.  Spammers usually don't reveal their address 
list so that other spammers can't see them.  As a result, most spam 
appears in my mailbox, but doesn't actually show a "To:" field with my 
address in it.  Mail that is specifically addressed to me gets through, 
while mail that goes to a mailing list does not.

This is not a perfect system.  E-mail lists have to be put in a special 
exception filter, or they get blocked as a mass mailing.  This filter 
also sometimes catches regular people who create their own mailing list 
to use.  But it does block everything except simple mail addressed to me 
by name.  Since I do not want to miss these, I divert them into a 
probably-spam folder for review before I delete them.  But it allows me 
to read my real mail first, and then quickly scan through the spam.  
This method blocks almost all spam and only rarely blocks a real message 
intended for me.

Unfortunately, I find that most of the "new" spam blocking ideas don't 
work for long.  Spammers quickly retool their spam tools to get around 
these blockers.  They randomize their mail sending program, or forge it 
into showing a home user.  They randomize their mail address, forge 
their mail address, or relay it through some unsuspecting company that 
has nothing to do with the spam.  They look at the spam blockers and 
adjust their message to avoid any blocked words or phrases.  They 
actually test their spam to see what gets through and then start using 
that.

I have seen pure evil, and it is spam.

If you have a referrence I'd like to see it. 

By the way terrorists live specifically in "residential"
communities and the Israelis are finding loads of illegal arms
caches and numerous illegal bomb and rocket factories in these same
residential communities.

Even suicide bombers don't act alone, in the case of the apartment
attack another member of the team was targeted.

Sorry to hear about your brother's near-bankruptcy.

A tank round will generally hit close to where it is aimed, an
artillery shell will land (hopefully) within the general area.
Completely different, and targeting something specific is
completely different from punishing fire.

This isn't a police action, this is war! Although darn humane as
war goes. (that's a good thing)

These soldiers are after the people who've murdered their
countrymen, possibly relatives, and would murder them if they get
the chance. If the Palestinians hadn't commited acts of war against
the Israelis, they wouldn't even be there.

You exclude reporters because they might give away vital
information, like your position and strength. They do it all the
time...

I like your idea about trying to keep this about facts.

Reporters leak vital information to the other side just by being on
the air, especially in this day and age. This is vital information
that is extremely valuable.

We call it indirect intelligence. For most opponents it's more
information then they get from their own people.

Maybe no clean hands but some are a lot cleaner than others...

I think so, but I can't call it up just now either. Maybe Central P. R. Co. vs Board, 60 Cal 35.
When we follow the money, names like J. D. Rockefeller, Union Tank Co., and J. P. Morgan show up on a recurring basis.
Another research topic is the particular legal "theory" that the military dictator Abraham Lincoln conjured up in his
unconstitutional, total-war conquest of the Confederation. Somewhere in the papers from the Lincoln Administration we may find an
incorporation document for the corporate United States. These papers were going to be released a couple years ago from the National
Archives, unfortunately, somebody changed sombody's mind. So they still remain sealed national security secrets one hundred thirty
seven years later. Hmmmm.

And I doubt that they are equal, in most biologically quantitative senses.  
For example, there are many general biologically measurable differences btw 
races. Africans have higher serum testosterone levels.  Their ear wax is 
different.  Europeans in general have hair colors markedly different from 
any other race. Amerinds are genetically disposed to diabetes. I would  not 
be at all surprised if there are small IQ differences in the races.  But 
TEMPERAMENT is far more determinative of many types of success. Any great 
ape expert will tell you that the chimp is more intelligent than the 
orangutan, but that the orang is more successful at most tasks b/c of its 
calmer temperament.

I am QUITE SURE that there are significant genetic differences in 
temperament btw the races, but that individual differences are more 
important to..individuals.

Yep, and you can see the deleterious effects of PC right here on this 
mailing list.  It reminds me of a Seinfeld episode where one of the 
characters is dating a man who could be part black, but no one is really 
sure.  One of the tag lines of the episode that arises whenever the 
characters start discussing the issue at hand (whether the man is part 
black) is "Should we be talking about this?" Straight outta _1984_....

They should at least warn reports to leave the area before firing upon 
them or throwing concussion grenades.  They also can confiscate film or 
disrupt broadcasts.  Using potentially deadly force against journalists 
without warning is a little over the line, I think.  I do understand 
that journalists leak information without knowing what they are doing, 
however.

I found the cite.

Navigate to http://www.tourolaw.edu/patch/CaseSummary.html

and search for 1886. You should find two interesting ones: 

Santa Clara County v Southern Pacific Railroad 118 US 394 (1886): Corporations
are  persons under the 14th amendment. That's the one I was thinking of. So
you can push your "starting date" back a bit.

Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Co. v Illinois 118 US 557 (1886): dicta
included that corporations have no obligation to the public good, along the
way to deciding that Illinois couldn't penalize the Wabash line for charging
more for an intrastate shorter trip just because it had the only stop in
Gilman, IL.

       I must be blind to the racist comments aswell. It was the elitist "God 
Wannabe" attitude that really bothers me. Somehow I dont think these guys 
would guide or rule with compassion if they ever reached the position they 
are seeking.
       As for the two comments that have been highlighted as racist, namely:

 all (individual) people are not "created equal", and
neither are racial groups.'

       I can't argue with that. "Not equal" doesn't mean better or worse in 
my interpretation. It just means different and differences should be 
celebrated.

       Im affraid I'd have to agree with the first part, but I wouldn't use 
South Africa as an example. As I can see much more worrying issues here in 
the UK.

I've often thought of that, especially since that's generally how
current humans are and many other social animals I read up on.  I mean
there's a race to stay ahead, to be top dog -- or, at least, not to be
bottom dog.

I've often thought there are two solutions and they're not mutually
exclusive.  One is to be a Power, so that you are not left behind.  That
sounds good on paper, but how likely is it?  The other is to make sure
there are lots of varied Powers, so that no one Power or set of them
winds up enslaving every sentient who is not a Power.  This is sort of
like preventing a unapolar world, such as we have today where the US
basically is the Hegemon of the whole planet.  (There's no equal or near
equal to check US power right now.)

My two cents!

By "slave labor" do you mean prison labor (laogai), people who
voluntarily work for what we consider very low wages, abducting and
selling of women into forced marriages, or something else?

Please explain how buying a product made in China constitutes support or
tolerance for slave labor. I've always felt good about buying products
made in China, thinking that it would help stimulate economic and
political development which will eventually ameliorate the above problems.
If you're saying that increased trade actually hurts China I would
certainly like to know why.

I'm as big an enemy of political correctness as any, but equating
the end of Apartheid with PC is not an idea that shoud be taken

That's true.  It mgiht be, for instance, that the average member of race
X has a higher IQ and is even smarter than the average member of race Y,
but this doesn't mean that particular members of X or Y always fit that
pattern.  These are just aggregates and have all the problems of
aggregates.  It's like average incomes among siblings in different
families.  I know two such families.  One consists of two sisters and
one brother (family A), the other of two brothers (family B).  Family
A's average income is actually higher than family B's, but one member of
family B actually makes almost four times what the other member does and
this is much higher than anyone in family A.  Yeah, if you were pulling
siblings randomly out of a sack, it might be better to pull from family
A (I should also mention their incomes are closer to each others) than
B, but how many social situations amount to such randomness?  What if,
e.g., your goal was to find an investor for your business?  It might be
better to get to know family B better.  Surely, one brother there is
probably not going to give you much more... than the ear of the other!:)

Later!

I agree if you mean differences that don't count in terms of morals,
peacefulness, and the like.  After all, if one individual (or group) is
just a (pack of) murderer(s), bandit(s), rapist(s), and generally not
nice, then I think I'd rather not celebrate her/his/its (their)

       Exactly what I mean. Immoral and unethical behaviours should never be 
celebrated. Cultural difference is the sticky issue. This is where the 
unethical/immoral viewpoint breaks down. Everyone (hopefully) knows that 
murder is wrong, regardless of culture, but there are some remarkable 
differences where one could view the actions of another as downright immoral 
even evil.
       One of the most shocking examples I heard of many years ago. Was 
regarding certain remote tribes in Africa. Where it is the duty of parents to 
masterbate their children untill they are old enough to do it themselves !

My instinct and cultural bias makes me scream Nooooooooo to both these

It is my personal opinion that both prison labor as practiced in
China (where most prisoners are confined without even the most
basic rights to a fair trial), and widespread child labor by children
far too young to give meaningful consent, and even some "free"
laborers in the government-planned economy are essentially slaves,
and I further believe that most of the money received from abroad
for Chinese goods goes to support the government, not independent
businessmen.  I understand that no country is blameless here: even
American businessmen have to deal with heavy regulation and taxation
when they deal abroad; but their profits are still /their/ profits,
and benefit theith employees and shareholders.  I believe that China
does not rise to even the most basic level of civilized, free, and
open society, and until they show some basic respect for human rights
I will avoid sending my money there.

I happen to agree with the notion that all crimes require at least two 
people, so if there is no person or group claiming the land, there is only 
the taker involved, and no crime is possible. Of course, if there were 
people there, they have the right not to sell, and any sort of compensation 
would get bogged down in the subjectivity of the values of things.  This 
doesn't mean that there are never extenuating circumstances, just that it 
is stealing.

Sure, especially in this case, where A was trying to seize *all* of B's 
property.  Of course, it isn't true in all cases; if I give you a paper 
cut, you can't seize everything I own.  I'm not sure where the boundary 
should be.

If all of A's citizen were responsible for the invasion (maybe A was 
created specifically so invade B or something) then I think it would be OK 
for B to seize their property (though they might be partially compensated 
by the rest of A to spread the pain evenly, maybe if they agreed to that 
earlier).  If they were under a dictatorship, however, they should be given 
at least as much protection of their property as A gave them.  If you had 
taken a lease from B with only six years remaining, it would be unnecessary 
for B to make it yours until you decided to sell it.  I suppose B isn't 
under any obligation to give you more property rights than its own citizens 
either, though it should let you sell your land to it, if you wish.

It had sufficient proof for me.


>Is there a time limit on assertions of property rights?

Yes, only people who have been wronged can claim compensation (not their 
descendants).  There is really no other reasonable line you could 
have.  Consider all claims valid and incomplete records will ensure that 
everything is always in a state of flux, as would letting claims extend 
back to what we have "good records" of.  Any mechanic in which claims can 
last for more than one generation also is open to the possibility that 
there will be people descended from both sides.  There are other 
complications too.  Should descendants of emigrants have to pay 
compensation?  Abolitionists (to use the US struggle with slavery as an 
example)?  Non-slave owners?  Union soldiers?  Non-slave owners who fought 
for the confederates?  People who didn't inherit anything form their evil 
ancestors?  Actually I think that a case can be made for people who have 
done wrong to pay back the descendants of those they hurt, but not the 
other way around.

Agreed.

If Spike left instructions for the disposition of his property, the book 
should be given away in accordance with those.  Otherwise, I'd be inclined 
to let Perry keep it, not that I have any real justification.

I would say that the Jews definitely don't have a valid claim to that land 
(though they can buy it, if they want and can find sellers).  I'm not 
familiar enough with how they got their land under the British to have an 
opinion of whether it was valid, but if any criminals are dead, their 
descendants don't owe the land back.  As to the state of Israel, I suppose 
its as justified in existing as most other governments.

Unless all land in Israel belongs to the Prime Minister, it should revert 
to the people who have been effectively owning it.

I don't think we know the truth about everything involving treatment of 
journalists but a few things are known.  Virtually every major news outlet 
in the world has a Jerusalem office and it's not unusual for there to be 
hundreds of reporters anywhere something is happening.  Quite apart from 
reporting sensitive information, they're just plain in the way.  In 
Bethlehem, I believe, they were warned away.  When they ignored this, the 
Israelis fired tear gas at the reporters.  There was also an incident where 
snipers tried to scare away other reporters and one was wounded. Also, 
there have been occasions when terrorists impersonated reporters.

This last is an unfortunate development.  Another related one is that in a 
previous Israeli assault, terrorists escaped through Red Crescent 
ambulances.  So now the Israelis won't let ambulances through.  The press 
reports that Israel is blocking the ambulances without reporting the prior 
problems that led to the policy.

Justification aside, the press -- particularly big-name American press -- 
act like they have an absolute right to go anywhere and write about 
anything.  And by and large they get away with it.  The consequences are 
all-too-often deaths or ruined lives.

To take a specific situation, police, military, EMS workers, doctors, and 
intelligence case officers are often engaged in vital or life-critical tasks.
If the press ignores a legitimate warning, I have no problem with them 
being arrested and charged with a felony.  If no reasonable alternatives 
exist, force, up to deadly force, is justifiable.  Example:  a hostage 
rescue mission is being compromised by a news helicopter.  If they refuse 
to veer off, send marshals to arrest the news director back at the 
station.  If that doesn't do it, or there isn't time to do that, what else 
can you do but disable the copter?  The press doesn't have a right to 
endanger lives any more than anyone else does.

Of course, a suitable mechanism must exist for reviewing any actions.  And 
any personnel who abuse their authority to block, arrest, or harm reporters 
must be punished very harshly.

Checks and balances.  For both officials and press.


-- David.

Check out this one:

It has a pitch detector mode and provides realtime feedback.

The problem here, and pretty much the reason to have a First Amendment,
is because any checks and balances on the media are going to be enforced
by...  The government!  I'd rather have reporters getting in the way and
put up with that nuisance than with governments having a free hand to do
what they want and then give press conferences afterward to tell us how
they did the right thing and fought the good fight.  That sort of lapdog
media is what totalitarian regimes have and what almost all
nontotalitarian regimes aspire to.

I'm surprised how the September 11th attacks have turned so many people
against freedom, making them favor increase government power.  Maybe I
shouldn't be surprised.  Maybe those people were just silent all along
or they were just latent statists.  After all, the groundwork for
tyranny has been in place for decades.  I guess now the superstructure
is being erected.  Orwell was only off by a few years...

Later!

Agreed.  But this is not what we have been seeing this past week.  The 
Israelis declared the city of Ramallah to be a closed military zone, and 
ordered all journalists to vacate the area.  Reporters from various 
countries are reporting that they have been shot at, had stun grenades 
thrown at them, and even had tanks advance upon them, all without 
warning.  Several journalists have been injured, and all say they were 
not given any prior warnings.  The Israelis claim that the expulsion of 
journalists from the area was their prior warning, and that any 
journalists not obeying that order are now legitimate targets of the 
military.

The U.S. military uses similar tactics, but they just arrest 
journalists, take them into custody, and confiscate their film.  I don't 
know of any instances of the U.S. military attacking unarmed journalists 
without warning.

We have zero experience detecting or exterminating rouge AIs, nor is
anyone watching, or even theorizing about what should be watched for
AFAIK.  Speed is only one means of avoiding detection and extermination.

A very slow distributed AI could also have a goal to get faster --
insinuate itself into low-latency/high-cpu networks, move work requiring
such there.  A few datacenters stealthily used, the thing starts running
closer to human timescales and can interact more effectively with "our"
world.

Apart from its relevance to the potential for an [ab]useful distributed
AI, I think the roles speed and intelligence play in terms of getting
"intelligent work" done is an interesting question.  An uploaded rat
running at many times the speed of a physical rat presumably won't get
any more intelligent work done.  How much work could a IQ300-equivalent
AI that runs at 1/1000 human speed get done?  Perhaps not much, but it
might be extremely interesting work.

The consequences of military action without public/press supervision is
also all-too-often deaths or ruined lives.

Damien, I can only speak for myself, but I've finally reached the point
where I trust the press less than the military - whether it's US or Israeli.

I don't agree with John that it is primarily a religious 
conflict.  The fight of the Palestinians is over land and 
freedom they have lost continuously over the last five or six 
decades up to the present time.  I do agree that once conflicts 
like this start they take on a momentum of their own.  What I 
don't understand is why we don't take more of an attitude as in 
Yugoslavia and demand an end to hostilities, enforce it by UN 
troops where necessary, and partition the land and resources in 
question equitably.  Both sides have more than adequately proved 
they cannot settle this conflict in any reasonable manner (to 
say the least).

I think you're assuming there was no rivarly.  Did lend/lease agreements
include post-colonial spheres of influence?  Try googling on
"british-american rivalry", you'll find plenty relevant to the post-WWII
Middle East.

Quoting from a cite posted to the CR list today:

         Initial theories that CR acted mainly through retarding growth
    and development, reducing the metabolic rate and body fat have not
    been born out.  CR seems to modify biologic activities at every
    level, affecting physiologic, molecular, and genomic processes
    [45].  More specifically, CR reduces insulin-like growth factor 1
    levels [46], reduces oxidative stress [47] and bolsters DNA repair
    and genomic stability [48, 49]. Regarding the latter, Guarente's
    group [50] have just identified a mechanism in yeast through which
    CR might mediate its effects.  CR boosts Sir2, a protein needed for
    a phenomenon called silencing which turns genes off at particular
    chromosomal regions.

CR doesn't appear to work by slowing down metabolism, though it is
systemic, details unknown as noted.

No, I would simply ignore them.

No, *you* may know what they are.  I do not.  Granted the consensus here 
seems to be that they are racists.  I don't know that they're not.  But 
until I see evidence of it myself I won't assume they are just because you, 
or anybody else, says so.

a) Because I have seen no evidence that their "world-view is so anathema to 
transhumanism" and

b) Because it is my nature to give everyone the benefit of the doubt until 
they give me reason not to.

I don't know that I'd describe it as an "arms race" but, without doubt, if 
you don't keep up you will get left behind.  I already see it happening.  
There are people in my profession (heck, even in my own office) who are 
technophobes.  I, on the other hand, copiously incorporate technology into 
my practice and, as a result, I am *much* more efficient than my techophobic 
colleagues.

I think it only makes sense to have a working knowlege of existing 
technology and a basic understanding of technological trends.  If nothing 
else having such an understanding (and particularly having in advance 
thought through the potential pros and cons of adopting a given "advanced" 
technology) will make one more willing and able to be an early adopter, 
while others delay trying to figure out, say, whether or not being a 
disembodied uploaded intelligence is a good thing.

I wouldn't go so far as to say "be among the first or get left behind."  In 
fact I tend to believe that the more people are included the better it will 
be for all.  Try as I might I can't imagine post-Singularity life as a zero 
sum game.  But regardless, the better informed you are, and the more 
resources at your disposal (financial, informational, technological, etc.) 
the better off you'll be.  These principles seem to be at the heart of the 
"racist" site which prompted this thread.  To that extent I can only say I 
agree with them.

Transhumanism without good-intentions is like handing out nuclear weapons to 
everyone in the world.  If you give these Kluxers a pass, then you will have 
appeared to the undertanding of many, to have made common-cause with them. 
Nazism is a philosophy which, by their own design, has no middle ground. 


But you are a free thinker and should make up your own mind. Everyone has a 
right to an opinion, but not all opinions are right.

Which put me to mind of an old 3d shooter game called Retun to Castle 
Wolfenstein (Spear od Destiny). Some of the Level Bosses were mutant fighters 
with an extra couple of arms and a whole lot of body mass. I believe I had to 
use 3 magazines of 32 round MP-40 Schmeisser ammo to subdue these ubermen. 
Hitler used his super-duper occult powers to data mine the future for wonder 
weapons, according to this archaic game literature. I believe the top weapon 
was the BFG, later used in Doom 1 &  2.    

Perhaps Damien B. can work up a novellte based on this theme? Zu Bufehl!

<<I've often thought there are two solutions and they're not mutually
exclusive.  One is to be a Power, so that you are not left behind.  That
sounds good on paper, but how likely is it?  The other is to make sure
there are lots of varied Powers, so that no one Power or set of them
winds up enslaving every sentient who is not a Power.  This is sort of
like preventing a unapolar world, such as we have today where the US
basically is the Hegemon of the whole planet.  (There's no equal or near
equal to check US power right now.)

My two cents!

This a a poll of "What's Real?"  My question to you, fellow Extropian 
philosophers is how does this survey, match up with your own views?

http://physicsweb.org/article/world/15/4/2

<<Why philosophy shouldn't be avoided
I've often heard scientists call philosophical attention to their field 
irrelevant at best, and confusing and destructive at worst. Indeed, many 
scientists advise that philosophy should be avoided altogether. Steven 
Weinberg, for example, named a chapter in his book Dreams of a Final Theory 
"Against the philosophers". Murray Gell-Mann, meanwhile, has remarked that 
philosophy "muddies the waters and obscures [the theoretical physicist's] 
principal task, which is to find a coherent structure that works". He then 
added that having a philosophical bias may cause a physicist "to reject a 
good idea". 

But such reactions misconstrue philosophy, however much they may have been 
triggered by the excesses of philosophers themselves. Scientists cannot avoid 
making judgements about what is real and what is not, and philosophical 
analysis seeks to expose and clarify this process. I've also heard that 
science inclines its practitioners towards a specific philosophical position. 
Scientists, it is said, tend towards realism because it makes them better 
scientists - a conviction that has also influenced philosophers. 

When Ian Hacking, for example, once asked a physics colleague what he was 
doing, the physicist replied that he was "spraying photons". Impressed, 
Hacking wrote: "From that day forth I've been a scientific realist. As far as 
I'm concerned, if you can spray them, then they are real." In his book Faith, 
Science and Understanding, physicist-turned-Anglican-priest John Polkinghorne 
remarked that "virtually all scientists" - including himself - adhere to a 
brand of realism known as critical realism. 

A reviewer in Physics World, who doubted Polkinghorne's bold assertion, later 
suggested that I poll readers, hoping to elicit information to settle the 
issue. I therefore carried out a survey in which I listed a number of 
different items and asked readers to say whether or not they considered them 
to be real things, or whether they were unsure (Physics World October 2001 
p18). Having received more than 500 replies, the statistics (see <A HREF="http://physicsweb.org/article/world/15/4/#t">tables</A>) do 
indeed cast doubt on Polkinghorne's claim.  >>

Thank you so much! A very interesting case indeed. I haven't worked on this particular aspect for awhile (Samantha's query touched
it off), it's a little far afield from what I 'm doing now.

This surprises me.

There are hundreds of examples where military claims were later shown to 
be false by the press.  I can't think of any examples where a press 
story was fabricated and shown to be false by the military, although 
there may be some.  Do you extend this trust of the military up to the 
President and to the Government in general?

I've missed where the 1:1000 time base was coming from. It is a completely 
off-the-wall number, especially if not linked to a specific technology, 
and specific stage of development.

There's a considerable gap between what even current hardware can do in 
principle, and what we are able to do with it with current methods. This 
gap is unlikely to become any narrower, so there's definitely a 
phase-change scenario involved here. A lot of early-stage embarassingly 
parallel tasks are about finding out how to utilize those dormant 
resources. And the network bandwidth becomes an increasingly less 
important issue as the node size goes up.

I agree, maybe not surprised, but it makes my stomach feel very sick.
We lost large ground in our freedoms the last months. The 'War on
Terrorism' rhetoric gives a blank check to governments to behave in
whatever manner they please.

People are more skeptical outside of the US regarding the rhetoric,
but other governments are usually not as easily responsive to their
citizens as the U.S. government is to theirs. I fervently hope that
more U.S. citizens pay close attention to what their government is
doing and reset their bullshit detector threshold level to a low
value.

>Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Maybe those people were just
>silent all along or they were just latent statists. 

The rhetoric plays on people's fears (that's why I think it's
successful).

Looks like there will be an interesting clash in the future
between militaries and press with insect sized observer
drones.  Its much easier to stop a human than a swarm of locusts.

I'd disagree.  I'm moderately certain that its been shown in
multiple studies, including primate studies, that CR lowers
body temperature (and so therefore metabolism must be lower).
I suppose one could split hairs here and propose that only
disposal of excess mitochondrial hydrogen ion gradient
(that contributes to heat production) is lower and not
actual "metabolism", but thats a very fine distinction.

In either case the result is lower free radical production
which would contribute to lower DNA damage.

The gene silencing mechanism would imply that the genes are
likely to be wrapped around histones which would shelter the
DNA to some extent from free radical damage.  Of course there
will be a big hurdle in extrapolating the yeast work to higher
organisms because single celled organisms will want to carry
on even in the presence or DNA damage while multi-cellular
organisms may want to eliminate cells with such damage to
reduce the chance that they will become cancerous.

[Mike, if you have the full post to the CR list with references,
I'd appreciate a copy of it.  Thanks.]

 Define "race" in a rigorous manner, then maybe we can tell.  Short of

I'm not just talking about military action; I gave a long list of other 
groups who are engaged in vital work that is often stymied or disrupted by 
press.

I'm a big fan of the First Amendment but it shouldn't be blanket immunity.

How many private citizens have had their lives tossed upside-down because 
of a press story?  Your right to privacy is trampled, and your remedies for 
libel are virtually non-existent.

And how many lives have been lost, in war, in intelligence, in hostage 
situations, in undercover investigations, etc., because the press revealed 
something that got people killed.

I'm a big believer in the power of feedback.  My father argued in his book 
_Why Washington Is Always Wrong_ that if you look at something that's not 
working properly, it's usually because the feedback mechanism is screwed 
up.  Either there's no feedback, or the feedback acts to amplify the 
problem, or the wrong signal is amplified or suppressed, or feedback is 
delayed.

A reasonable approach to reining in both government and press run amuck is 
to hold everyone to the same standard that we hold private citizens.  Do 
not shield bureaucrats, politicians, or press from the consequences of 
their actions.  If *my* interference delayed an accident victim from 
getting medical attention or compromised a rescue operation, I would be 
held criminally liable.  Why should people with a badge, press pass, or 
title be granted ex officio immunity?

They were given plenty of warning, they were told deliberately not
to come, but they did anyway.

I was surfing through channels the other day when I stopped on
MSNBC, I watched how Ashleigh Banfield was explaining how even
though they had been told to stay away they were about to try to
get into the areas anyway.

They were sticking tape all over themselves and their vehicles
spelling out T.V. like it would somehow save them.

If I was a terrorist watching, I'd lean over to my men and say 

" Get some tape..."

The land and freedoms the Palestinians have lost they have lost as
a result of a number of wars where they tried to destroy Israel.

The land was partitioned in a Solomonic fashion by the U.N. in
1948, the Arabs rejected the U.N. partition, and the day after
Israel declared it's independence 5 Arab armies attacked (Egypt,
Syria, TransJordan, Lebanon, and Iraq) along with the Arabs living
in Palestine. (there were no defined Palestinians at that time.)
The Israelis won, as they have the subsequent attacks resulting in
the "occupation" of now disputed territories.

The Israelis have demonstrated time and again a willingness to
negotiate on this, always rejected by the Arabs.

The U.N. does not of course have troops of it's own, it gets them
temporarily from member states, and none have shown a willingness
to get in the middle of this potential disaster.

We most certainly should not send troops there, it's a suicide
mission.

Not found false by the military necessarily, but there have been dozens of 
instances where the press has been proven to have fabricated a story and 
countless cases where their editing of quotations, or their choice of 
words, or who they go to for comments, or how a photograph is cropped, etc. 
has the effect of distorting the reality of the story.

One thing that gives me enormous pause is that EVERY time I have known the 
truth behind a newspaper story, ranging from local coverage of my 
daughter's work in historic preservation, to media coverage of science or 
technology, to the reporting on a double rape/murder of neighbors of mine 
back when I was at Livermore, I have spotted significant factual errors in 
what appeared in print.

Yet I then read the rest of the paper, and tacitly assume that all the 
other articles are accurate.

.. which is why they are used by such groups.

For what it's worth, the symbol on the front page reminded me quite a bit of
the AWB logo, and the phrase "the future will set you free" certainly started
bells ringing in my head.

But who knows? I'll have a read of their various screeds, but time will tell,
I guess. I tend to assume people are nice until proven otherwise. This might
be a flaw on my part :)

It's so old, though, Dwayne.

(from their own literature)
http://www.stormfront.org/whitehistory/hwr5d.htm

The symbol existed far longer than the Nazis and white supremists
existed, and in cultures all over the world. It would be a shame if
every (large and small) variation of it triggered a knee-jerk response
in folks of 'Nazi'. That symbol has more examples of peaceful
interpretations through the last 3000 years than the meaning behind
the swastika during the last 100 years.

Not just the government.  Think libertarian.  Checks and balances on both 
officials and press can be through civil litigation.  Unleash the dogs of 
war -- lawyers on contingency, the ACLU, Gun Owners of America, the LP, 
NORML., Amnesty International, Consumers Union, Judicial Watch, CAMERA, 
Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, Institute for Justice....

And encourage the press to feed on themselves.  Give them incentives to 
keep each other honest.

Sorry for the delayed response. I can't let this pass without
comment. I'm old (42), too, but I listen to lots of new music. The
thought of listening to the same old tunes for the rest of my
hopefully long life is unbearable. Yeah, I like to trot out the oldies
once in a while, but I can't listen to them exclusively. I've *got* to
have a steady fix of new music.

When you say you "don't ... care for the latest stuff", do you just
mean that you don't like the current popular styles/artists/songs? I
suspect that whatever style of music you do like is still being
produced in good quality today, but that it's probably not popular
enough to make the Billboard charts. I think if you look for it,
you'll find it. Tell me what you like and maybe I can give you a few
pointers.

Very true.  There have been a lot of false stories.  But they are 
usually exposed by other journalists.  That is the beauty of the 
capitalist system.  There is no single press monopoly.  Competing 
journalists from different organizations all cover the same event.  If 
you don't like or believe the news from one, you switch to another.  I 
can't imagine anyone preferring a government-sponsored military monopoly 
on the news to our current system of journalism.  If you think the press 
is biased, switch brands.

I find this in technical and scientific reporting as well.  But there is 
no reason to attribute it to a great liberal conspiracy, or theorize 
that all Western media is secretly owned and operated by a small 
cartel.  However, we know that the military is a monopoly that is bought 
and paid for by government agendas.

What is the alternative?  Abolish the free press and let the government 
tell us what is true, and let the military enforce this truth by 
shooting anyone who would question the party line?

How does that give the military the right to shoot at them?  Initiating 
force against an unarmed person who is not trying to harm you is 
unwarranted.  Cases of self-defense or warfare are one thing.  Attacking 
unarmed civilians is another.

How is this any different than military wearing uniforms?  They are 
simply trying to identify which side they are on.  When they are clearly 
identifiable and the military attacks them, it is clear what the agenda 
is.  Stop the press from reporting the story.

This is free enterprise at its best.  Most partisans don't realize that 
all of the above groups are doing the same thing.  They each focus on a 
specific area of freedom that they watch out for.

And how many decades has it been since Keynes wasn't considered an
idiot? Hayek (Keynes primary rival) has proven him wrong for quite a
while now.

I agree with this 100%.  I also firmly believe that virtually all 
problems can be traced back to this principle.  Free market problems 
only occur where a person is somehow shielded from the costs of their 
decision.  Environmental problems only occur where the costs of cleanup 
are somehow borne by someone else.  Bad products are produced only where 
the reward is based on short-term achievements and ignores long-term 
consequences.  This is true in technical, social, and personal realms.

I know of no such immunity for press.  If there is such an immunity, it 
should be abolished.  Another faulty feedback mechanism that I advocate 
abolishing is the idea that evidence gathered illegally has to be thrown 
out of court.  I say, go ahead and use the evidence to prosecute the 
criminal, and then also prosecute the person who illegally gathered the 
evidence.  One crime shouldn't absolve another crime.

There is a distinct difference between targeting civilians specifically
(as I said) and killing civilians as collateral damage from an attack
targeted at military assets. While Bomber Harris was certainly a war
criminal, the spraying  of pesticides on Vietnam was not a war crime,
since its target was the military supply trail called the Ho Chi Minh
Trail.
There is also a caveat to killing civilians in the Laws of War which say
that if a military asset is hidden or shielded by civilians or civilian
assets, those civilians and assets are considered combatants, and those
military people so hidden are illegal combatants and are themselves war
criminals. By this definition EVERY Palestinian combatant is an illegal
combatant and war criminal, and ANY Palestinian who these criminals hide
with are themselves combatants. Moreover, they can be tried and executed
summarily on the battlefield, legally, under the Laws of War.

One thing that perhaps some people can explain is why black pride is
simply an expression of multiculturalism but white pride is
automatically racism? Anybody been following the news out of Zimbabwe

Making your movie buying decisions based on the Scientological leanings
of cast members is a really dumb idea, unless you don't mind ever
watching another US made movie ever again (which might not be a bad
idea). It would be like avoiding movies with cast members that have been
in movies with anyone from a Kevin Bacon movie. Very difficult to do.

Scientology is so huge in Hollywood that if you aren't a Hubbardite or
Jewish, or from an old Hollywood family, you really have a tough time
developing any kind of contact network in the business.

Actually, the West Bank was originally part of Palestine under the
British Mandate and was distinctly separate from Jordan. It was Jordan
which illegally seized the West Bank and forced all residents to become
Jordanian citizens.

The issue here is the lack of fair trials rather than prison labor
(which exists in the U.S. as well). Even though it has very far to go, I
think China is improving on that front. Here's a quote from Amnesty
International's 2001 report on China:

Although implementation of the law continued to be arbitrary in many
cases, the government renewed efforts to encourage implementation of 1997
legal changes, including some aimed at improving the fairness of trials.
Further legal reform was debated with reference to international human
rights treaties which China had signed but not yet ratified. In November,
the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, designed to set up a program of technical
cooperation in the field of human rights.

Presumably their parents consented because all of the other available

by making China wealthier.

I guess you don't agree with the libertarian analysis that shows trade
improves human rights. Please take a look at
http://www.cato.org/dailys/11-15-96.html and
http://www.mises.org/freemarket_detail.asp?control=119, and let me know
why you disagree with them. I think this paragraph from the Cato article
is especially relevent: 

Finally, a positive program should recognize that free markets foster
economic development and provide individuals with the means to liberate
themselves from the state. A growing middle class will have a strong
economic stake in determining their own political fate. As Taiwan's newly
elected President Lee Teng-hui stated, "Vigorous economic development
leads to independent thinking. People hope to be able to fully satisfy
their free will and see their rights fully protected. And then demand
ensues for political reform."

It's actually a twist on the yin/yang symbol, only with three commas

The only reason that one should consider the first Powers to be a
problem is if one has an inherently high level of distrust for their
fellow man, and a pessimistic view of humanity in general. That isn't an
extropic POV, but it is rather common, especially among europeans, and
considering the large disparity of capability an emergent SI would have
compared to a baseline human, it might not be terribly unreasonable to
seek to insure against inimical personalities attaining such power.
Eli's Freindly AI project is one answer to such a threat.

However, consider the situation logically: is humane behavior inherently
logical, rational, or is it irrational? If it is inherently logical or
rational (and considering the politics of individuals relative to their
intelligence, it is) then we really have nothing to fear from SI, unless
we are inhumane ourselves and fear being told by an SI to behave
ourselves.

It is for this reason that I consider most luddites against AI and SI
development to have inhernetly fascist agendas. They wouldn't fear these
technologies if they didn't fear being told to behave themselves, to
stop forcing others.

I tend to agree that (academic) Philosophy is a form of intellectual
masturbation
that scientists would do well to avoid. One philosopher invents a word then
the rest of them sit around arguing what it means. Philosophical analysis is
so
sterile and long-winded that it sucks any energy out of a new idea or
concept.

On www.att.ac (academic reform) site I am starting a "Philosophers into the
Community" campaign to close Philosophy Dpts. and force their denizens into
the real world of pubs and shopping malls to give any "benefit" of their
knowledge
to the public, ala Socrates. Plato was a traitor to real Philosophical
debate by
ghettoising it and making the debate remote and pointless to everyone except
for
professional philosophers.

The problem is that a TV camera lens and shroud, seen from a distance,
looks like a shoulder fired anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapon. If the
cameraman hides himself to avoid Palestinian sniper fire, only showing
the camera lense, he will attract gunfire from Israelis by doing so.

The largest employer in China is the Peoples Liberation Army, which owns
most industrial concerns, and runs the prison system, which it uses to
supply no cost labor to its manufacturing enterprises. Profits earned by
this conglomerate do not go toward increasing democracy, they go toward
financing an industrial system which has a state mandate to use force
against its employees as a matter of daily labor managment, not just
breaking strikes or killing off labor organizers. 

Furthermore, PLA profits pay for the modernization of the PLA weaponry
targeted at Taiwan, Japan, and the US, including its nuclear ballistic
missile program, which can now target multi-megaton nukes at every major
city in the US.

The PLA produces most export goods, so the odds are that money you spend
on Chinese made goods goes directly to the current enslavement of the
Chinese people and the future enslavement of the US.

First, there *is* an effective press monopoly, or small 'polyopoly', in 
many markets, where there are only one or two news suppliers because 
there's no perceived revenue potential for more.  We have that where I live 
now, a city of 80,000.  One newspaper and two tv stations (in 20- second 
segments) are responsible for virtually all news coverage.  Only the 
largest stories get attention from media in other cities.  In practice, 
many misrepresentations in the newspaper go unchecked.  I've seen the same 
kind of thing everywhere I've lived.

Even in a big market, it's only big stories whose coverage gets scrutinized 
by other reporters.

In any case, I am very skeptical of professions that police themselves.  If 
you look at others that do, like doctors, police, teachers, clergy, 
lawyers, and judges, you have to be pretty damn bad before anything happens 
to you.  They all have the equivalent of the police's "cops don't rat on 
other cops."

And notice that the ones I've listed are *all* professions that function as 
guilds (or, if you like, cartels), strictly controlling who can enter their 
ranks.

Play fair, Harvey.  (a) I said nothing about *why* reporting is so bad, and 
certainly did not attribute it to any coordinated effort. Personally, I 
think it's a combination of Sturgeon's and Gresham's Laws.  The mechanisms 
to punish incompetence or malice are broken. (b) I made it clear that I'm 
talking about general problems in the media, not just military reporting.

Although, focusing on the military, I think they're no more or less a 
monopoly than the press is.  There are so many competing 
voices.  Interservice rivalries.  Competition between defense contractors 
rippling to Congress and to senior officers who hope to work for those 
contractors when they leave the service.  Individual officers bucking for 
promotion.  CYA at all levels.  (It's amazing -- but not surprising -- how 
much classified material is classified to avoid embarrassment or consequences.)

If you read what I posted, the alternative is to hold the press responsible 
civilly and criminally for what they write or how they pursue a story -- to 
the exact degree that you or I would be held responsible for our 
actions.  Liberty is freedom plus responsibility.  I don't want a 'free' 
press; I want an, er, libertine press.  A liberal press?  A liberated 
press?  A libated press?  No, that's not right....

Another part of the answer, eventually, is the sort of Internet-based 
reputation system we used to dabble with on extropians.

As a former military man, I can say with conviction that there is rarely
a time when the press actually gets anything to do with the military
right. I must say that they have gotten better in recent years, but they
are still generally woefully ignorant and beset by their own preexisting
agendas which colors how they write about a story. I think reporting on
the military has gotten better only because military press liason
officers have gotten better, and the press is more willing to hire
retired military officers to interpret and analyse situations for them.

One big story I can say the press screwed up on is the US bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The press completely ignored the fact that
the Chinese were using the embassy to collect and disseminate satellite
and radio intelligence to the Serbian military, and was the largest
source of encoded radio traffic during the war there. Our 'oops' bombing
of the embassy was specifically to take out that illegal use of
diplomatic facilities.

Similarly, the press presentation of the E-3 forced landing in China was
similarly botched and biased in favor of the Chinese.

Military claims later shown to be false are easy to come by because
military reports are usually based on initial reporting on the ground in
chaotic conditions. 20/20 hindsight and all that. You'd think with 20/20
hindsight that the press would do a better job than it actually does.

No, it's the post-reconciliation state of South Africa which is the
problem. Things are very bad there, crime is the highest in the
industrialized world (higher than the US by far), looting by blacks in
government is incredibly high, and I would not be surprised if SA became
another Zimbabwe within a few years. Those whites who see the writing on
the wall (or spraypainted on their front steps) are getting out now.

If you go back farther, all of Jordan was part of pre-WW 1 Palestine.

You might be right, but here's another take just for the sake of pancrit:

It's a bit more complicated than that. What the media were being told is that
there is no free passage in a given area, and that the rules of engagement are
shifted from "assured threat" to "suspected threat". Like a curfew.

"Clearly identifiable?" Bad guys can print "TV" on themselves with duct tape,
too, you know.

This isn't a stroll down the street, this is war. When a military
force declares an area closed there are two groups there,
themselves and the enemy.

Reporters get soldiers killed all the time, usually by giving their
position away. The fact they were were not trying to cause harm is
irrelevant. Their very presence causes harm. 

At the very least they can be considered spies.

Because then the terrorists put tape on themselves saying "T.V."
and by this deception get close enough to kill.

The reporters can do what they want, but the soldiers have every
right to treat them as the enemy (in this situation) they are.

Yes, and the USSR was a signor of the Helsinki Accords while at the same
time they kept 10-20 million of its citizens in labor camps, and left
wing groups like Amnesty International touted it as great progress when
the number dropped to only 9 million, while at the same time reserving
far more press release space for rants against the US government for
minor things like the incarceration of would-be presidental assasin John
Hinckley.

People get the government they deserve. The USSR didn't collapse because
we opened trade with them, we didn't and they collapsed under their own
weight. We've coddled China because we needed them against the USSR.
That need is obsolescent now, so we should abandon the kid gloves
treatement of China.

I'm not interested in making the Chinese Government wealthier, I'm
interested in making the average Chinese-on-the-street wealthier.

If it uses its guns and tanks to repress labor unionization activities,
when companies in the west are not able to use such measures, then the
Chinese government holds a more competetive position than industry in
the rest of the world.

There is, in effect, because the standards for proving a case of libel are 
so high.  And most officials are afraid to go after reporters who interfere 
with police or rescue workers; there's an old saying -- don't mess with

Absolutely!  I've promoted the same exact position myself for years and 
almost everyone I've mentioned it to has been horrified.  And, by the way, 
one of the most common objections I hear is the one I raised in my last 
email -- they don't believe that the police or prosecutors would in fact be 
punished.  They think that ranks would close, and they would protect their own.

The Palestinian and Israeli might have disagreements, but
if it weren't for Muslim fundamentalists, there wouldn't  be
any suicide bombers and Israeli would not be having military
operations right now.  It would all be going on at the negotiating
table.  Likewise one of the biggest grievances, the settlements,
would likely not have happened if it weren't for Jewish 
fundamentalists.  The only non-religiously derived grievance is
the right of return issues due to the 1948 war, and I'm confident
they would have long ago been hashed out if religion weren't 
cluttering up the principal's minds.

Philosophy 101: A crime can not be justified by another. Guilt is always 
individual.

### Depends how you define your crimes. And it's also useful to ponder the
meaning of guilt.

I think that most of us will agree that a crime should be defined as a type
of reprehensible behavior, which deserves inescapable and possibly violent
punishment by the society. Not all types of reprehensible behavior deserve
punishment - some of them are not serious enough. The status of others as
reprehensible might be uncertain, especially if there is disagreement within
the society, so for the sake of peace, punishment is not meted out.
Therefore, the idea of crime is a highly evolved social construct.

But how do we come to form this idea in the first place? If you agree that
blowing up young girls in discos is a crime, then  punishment (by the
definition of a crime) is in order. The justification for the punishment is
twofold: diminishing the likelihood of further crimes, and extracting a
revenge, satisfying the deeply ingrained, evolutionarily favored need to
maim or otherwise inconvenience those who are felt to be responsible. The
revenge motif can be in an evolutionary psychology framework derived from
the same source - the need to reduce the incidence of undesirable actions. 

Guilt is both a state of mind and an attribute of a person, related to vis
acceptability of being the target of punishment. Let's talk only about the
latter meaning. Since the primary reason for punishment is the need to
favorably influence future behaviors, the attribution of guilt should
reflect that. Under most circumstances this is achieved by targeting the
perpetrator of a crime. However, sometimes other targets may be chosen, with
good control of behavior. If the perpetrator is principally unavailable (as
in being dead), punishment may target his associates, or family. This
approach was frequently taken in historical times, with the killing of
families of political opponents - the threat of destruction of one's kin may
stop even the young males who are willing to sacrifice their own lives. The
threat of being the target of punitive action may induce family members to
exert control over their relatives. It is only relatively recently in human
history that guilt became an individual affair. This is related to the
relaxation of the bounds of family, with most of seeing ourselves as
individuals, rather than primarily members of a clan. Another reason is the
refinement of social control, with the wielders of power being able to
deliver punishment more reliably against specific persons (who can less
easily escape in this world of huge police forces and nation-states), with
less inducement to target larger groups. Again, guilt is a highly evolved
concept, dependent on many factors, including the physical capabilities of
enforcers. It is however always needed for the functioning of a society, in
one form or another.

So, the meme complex of crime, punishment, and guilt evolved to safeguard
the efficient functioning of societies.

A crime may not justify another. But, it does justify punishment, if the
punishment results in the reduction of future incidence of crime. Sometimes
there is no way of delivering individual justice without hurting bystanders.
As long as the number of collateral damage victims is significantly smaller
than the number of innocent persons saved from future crimes, the action is
acceptable. If killing of supporters, even the proud (and therefore guilty)
families of suicide bombers turns out to be the only way of reducing the
number of 16-year-olds smeared on cafe walls, then such killing is not a
crime - it's a just way of defending the innocent. Long-term effects on the
survival of innocent persons are the only basis for judging the desirability
of an action. Simple dictums about guilt, and the folk psychology of crime
won't do.

So much for my "philosophy 101"

Rafal

  Then one would have to refrain from purchasing products made by income-tax slaves as well. Total tax on the natural person
(income, sales, B&O, and so on) in the US is somewhere north of 40%. It's even worse in Europe. Debt-servitude -paying back real
labor for fictious fiat-currency loans- adds perhaps another 20-30%, leaviing the producer with maybe 20-30% of his initial
purchasing power. By comparison, the taxation rates in the most despotic feudal regimes never rose above ~30%; anything higher would
cause the serfs to either starve or overthrow the despot. A slave on a cotton plantation in the American South was 'taxed' at about
10%, i.e. 90% of his product had to be returned as slave-upkeep (hence the practice died out).

What is the income-tax rate in China? I think I heard 13% flat, as in the reconstituted Soviet Union. By this measure, they are more
advanced than the US.

That's an excellent idea - but there would have to be some mechanism making
sure that the people who illegally gathered the evidence were really
convicted.  For example, a law stating that when evidence has been shown to
be contaminated under a low standard of proof, then that evidence cannot be
used in court unless the person who gathered it is actually *convicted*,
*sentenced*, and *actually punished* under whatever higher standard of proof
is required for conviction.

The military itself, discounting the point where it interfaces with
bureaucrats and political appointees, is a more trustworthy organization
than the press by far. I think a lot of the lies of the military you are
referring to are eminating largely from bureaucrats and politicians
associated with the military, not the military itself.

A distinguishing factor between the two is the intent and motivation.
When the U.S. military lies, it is almost always for operational
purposes.  On the other hand, the press has few valid operational
reasons to lie, yet frequently engages in the intentional re-shaping of
the facts to meet a myriad of political and social agendas. The military
has as its sole purpose the competent execution of military matters, and
operational lies are just one of the many tools it uses to get the job
done well.  The press claims to deliver unbiased news and "truth", yet
routinely contradict their stated mission with their actions.  The
military makes no claims that it will always tell the truth, and it is
not entirely relevant to its mission.  The press does.

Beyond that, the officer corps of the US military has a long history of
having a strong commitment to honesty and personal responsibility within
its ranks. You cannot have a strong and cohesive military culture if
deception and incompetence are a integral part of that culture, as is
evidenced by the militaries in many other countries. Unless one has been
in the US military it may be difficult to really understand, but the US
military is a deeply apolitical organization that is dedicated to the
service of the people and Constitution of the country to its very core,
tolerating politicians, bureaucrats, and other flavors of the month only
to the extent that it has to.

Therefore, knowing nothing else, if I had to choose between trusting a
representative of the press and a US military officer on a given matter,
I would be far more inclined to accept the word of the military officer.
The motivations that would lead a US military officer to lie are simpler
and less sinister.

The problem with this is that it still allows the "spam" to be accepted
from the sender.  Much better would be to make the slugs pay for their
crime in real time.  This requires the installation of a mail recepient
(sendmail, etc.) that recognizes spam line-by-line as it is received,
rejects it, does a traceback to the ISP for said sender and sends a
note to their abuse managers.  A limited DoS attack on the sender's
IP address probably wouldn't be a bad idea either.

All the solution Amara proposes does is keep the SPAM from her eyes.
It doesn't prevent the spammers from sending it and degrading the
network with it in the first place.

Its My Computer.
Its Our Network.
I reject completely corporate attempts to hijack these for their purposes.

In the world I envision you have to say "May I?"!

It still remains IMHO a criminal act that the MathML development effort more or
less completely ignored a long-existing, widely known, massively used, totally
standardized, free, totally multi-platform, and technically superb standard for
coding and displaying math on the web and anywhere else -- that is to say, TeX.

Very large portions of the entire scientific and engineering 
community have made
massive investments in TeX:

*  massive investments by individual workers in learning to use TeX as a syntax
for expressing complex math in ASCII form, and in generating zillions of
documents now saved as TeX source files on their hard disks;

*  massive investments by  publishers and professional societies in setting up
arrangements for electronic submission of documents in TeX form and 
in educating
their authors to use these;

*  massive investments by software vendors in developing TeX macro packages
along with excellent WYSIWYG and real-time implementations of TeX for various
operating systems.

In other words, TeX is both a widely known *syntax* for users, and a 
widely used
*system* for displaying technical documents, especially math, not just
"properly" but extraordinarily well.

The developers of MathML apparently believe that all of this investment and all
of these working systems should be scrapped, and replaced by equally expensive
world-wide replacement investments in setting up and learning MathML.

There are, of course, situations where old technology should be ditched and
replaced by new and better technology.  This is not, however, one of them.  TeX
is *not* an obsolete technology, that needs to be replaced; and MathML is not a
"better" replacement (it's alleged improvements, so far as I can see, are
neither wanted nor needed by the world-wide TeX community).

If the MathML community wants to provide TeX users with simple tools, operable
on all significant platforms, to convert TeX source files into MathML source
files, that will at least preserve all the investment that individual TeX users
worldwide have made in learning TeX syntax.  Does the MathML community have any
plans to do this? -- I'm not aware of them.

If the XML/HTML/MathML community would put effort into developing
straightforward browser plugins that would permit a major subset of TeX math
syntax to be simply incorporated and then displayed within HTML documents, with
a syntax something like

       <TEX> ------(TeX math coding)--------- </TEX>

(where the TeX coding might be a short math expression, a single display
equation, or a longer segment or document), then large fractions of the world
could put their technical documents on the web without ever worrying about
MathML.

The existence of compact but excellent TeX implementations for innumerable
operating systems ("Textures" for the Mac, for example), or of PDF plugins for
numerous browsers -- or of MathPlayer for that matter -- makes it unarguable
that this *could* be done.  But, is it *being* done?

Sorry, I can't welcome MathPlayer, however "high-performance" it may be.  I
don't believe it's what's really needed for the real underlying task.

According to CIA's World Factbook 1998, China's exports in 1997 was $182.7
billion. This article http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/1998/06/03/p8s1.htm
quotes an estimate made in 1997 that PLA's annual revenue from its
businesses was $10 billion (I think this includes domestic revenue as well
as exports). This was before the PLA was ordered out of commerce in 1998
(see http://asia.news.yahoo.com/020305/reuters/asia-93066.html).

a few more thoughts, re: spammers.

It's educational (and entertaining) to read the sb-* filter files,
unpacked in the tar file: about 35 filter files for different kinds
of spam,  through which each incoming mail passes. You learn alot
about spammers: their techniques, names, and their spamming history.

For example, from the spambouncer "sb-rogue.rc" filter file:

The problem with this proposal is that it removes the institutional
incentives to observe the law.  If a criminal is caught and convicted as
a result of illegally gathered evidence, it is unlikely that society will
turn against the police agencies that made a mistake.  People will tend to
look the other way, to ignore or forgive the problem.  Few juries would
convict a policeman who overstepped the bounds of his search warrant,
if it helped him convict a violent criminal.

In contrast, under the present system, illegally gathered evidence cannot
be used.  In many cases this will make the difference between success
and failure in prosecution.  People will be furious with police agencies
who make this kind of mistake!  The D.A. will be voted out of office,
the police chief fired.

The current policies align society's long-term interests with
the self-interest of the people charged with enforcing the laws.
It provides much better and more immediate feedback to the police
agencies.  Relying on unpopular prosecutions of heroic police officers
will never work as well.

That's way too fuzzy. It depends almost entirely upon the definition
of reprehensible. I define crime as a non-defensive act that deprives
others of their health, freedom, or property, where "act" can include
planning, conspiring, or failing to report evidence of a crime.

I don't think crime should be so subjective. One shouldn't have to
take a poll to determine if some act was criminal--if it meets the
definition, it's a crime.

I'd prefer that punishment be mandated by law, not definition. And by
my definition, that *is* a crime--no agreement necessary.

How about rehabilition and prevention? Incarceration serves not only
to punish the offender and possibly deter other would-be offenders,
but also to reduce the risk to the public from a likely repeat
offender. And, of course, rehabilitation would also reduce the risk to
the public.

Revenge should not be part of crime and punishment, in my opinion.

Warning: slippery slope. This same argument can be used to rationalize
the prosecution of innocents, which should *never* be acceptable.
Preventing injustice is as important as delivering justice, if not
more so.

Further up the slippery slope. Regardless of whether it's effective or
not, innocent associates of a criminal must not be punished.

If relatives were aware of a criminal's actions but didn't report
them, they're guilty of a different crime.

Or the likelihood thereof.

In such cases, punishment should probably be delayed. It's not OK to
nuke the city block where you know the convicted murderer is hiding.
Of course, if you're talking about less direct damage such as that
caused by incarcerating a head-of-household, thereby causing financial
hardship to the family, then I'd agree that it's necessary.

I could see shooting down a jumbo jet bearing down on a key target,
but in most cases, collateral damage should be unacceptable. Raise
your hand if you're willing to be collateral damage.

Of a different crime...

No, that's just state-sponsored crime. Of *course* there are other
ways to stop suicide bombers.

The ends justify the means? That sounds great in theory, but in
practise it's not that straightforward. In theory, you can easily
tally up the numbers of innocent victims that would result from
various actions. In practice there'd be lots of guesswork, and
probably lots of wrong guesses. I don't get a particulary good feeling
about trusting the typical elected official to make such decisions
wisely.

TMDA (http://software.libertine.org/tmda/) is immune to all of those
spammer adaptations. Incoming messages that aren't from a known sender
are quarantined until the sender confirms their message. Since almost
all spam has a bogus sender, they never receive the confirmation
request. If a spammer did happen to use a replyable address, the
victim could simply add that address to their blacklist.

If you want to test it, send a message to dave@sill.org.

If you do a cost-benefit analysis to the world as a whole, it's going to come 
out overwhelmingly
in favor of the press.  How many soldiers die as a result of press?  Not many 
in any current
Westeern society, not manny soldiers die, period, and certainly in only a

press activity even be partly at fault.  OTOH

None of that has anything to do with preventing messages from being
received by your mail server. Procmail, and hence Spam Bouncer, are
mail delivery agents, and can only operate on messages that have been
delivered to your system.

BTW, I mentioned Spam Bouncer in the spam chapter of my qmail book.

OTOH, modern military organizations can, and in both the US and Israeli 
cases, do, produce phenomenal
amounts of death and destruction.  Even a wafer-thin increase in unjust 
actions by the military is
going to outweigh anything done to them.  In a true military crisis, you can 
delay the reports for
a bit and everyone's going to be fine with that.  In this kind of police 
action, by the time the report
makes it through the print cycle it's old battlefield news.

True. Dan Bernstein's IM2000 would fix, though, by having senders
store messages locally until recipients accept them. See:

Recognizing spam is practically impossible. Any heuristic that's
easily implemented is also easily worked-around by spammers once
people start using it.

Tracing spam back to the originating ISP is tricky. Most spammers use
an open relay, so DoS'ing them could get you trouble.

That's IM2000. In the meantime, try TMDA.

Whups, didn't see this reply before, sorry.
We had a brief exchange on this topic in December, 2000 re: my UN "State of the Future" response in which I made several economic
and psychohistorical predictions, e.g. "Civil unrest and martial law in the US, a large war(s) abroad within three years". Remember?

and http://christianparty.net/lawyersindex.htm
Hadn't seen this particular site before, it's a little over the top. My reference to Magee is secondhand, from:

Phillips, Kevin
*Arrogant Capital (Washington, Wall Street, and the Frustration of American Politics0*
Little, Brown and Company, 1994

excerpt from Chapter 2, "Imperial Washington...":
   "Economists Donald Laband, Robert Tollison, Gordon Tullock, and Stephen Magee are four pioneers in studies of the cost of
transfer seeking in general- transferring rather than creating wealth is clearly on of Washington's leading pursuits- and of
lawyering, a particular staple of the nation's capital.(3) Academic attempts to calculate the annual cost to the overall U.S.
economy of transfer seeking generally put it in the 5 percent to 12 percent range, which comes to roughly 4300 billion to $700
billion [1993 stats and $-FB]. ... " [pp 46]

"...Jonathan Rauch is a young writer who, at least as much as anyone else, has made the discoveries of the transfer measurers and
lawyer watchers come alive in publications like *National Journal*. Rauch's credits include such phrases like "*parasitemia
economicus*" (the parasite economy), "*demosclerosis*" as a capsule of Mancur Olsons's interest-group thesis, a pithy description of
lawyers as "a good proxy for the size of the nation's noncriminal parasite class," and a straight-faced discourse on the
correlations between capital-city status and an unusually high ratios of golf courses and sit-down restaurants..." [pp 47]

[note] 3. 'The essense of "transfer seeking", as pursued by lawyers, lobbyists, brokers and professional organizations, is to gain
by transferring wealth rather than creating it, sometimes retaining the amount transferred but more often gaining a fee or
commision.
   The data about the rise in the number of professional organizations [i.e. guilds, cartels- FB], as well as the percentage
choosing to locate in Washington, comes from Jonathan Rauch's article "The Parasite Economy" in the April 25, 1992, *National
Journal*...." [pp216]

Mr. Phillips goes on to propose moving the capital from Blight-Upon-Mankind, D.C. to someplace like North Dakota.

   This would depend on the nature of the contract and the economic (praxological) calculation. So far in my life the sundry private
con-artists that have ripped me off have kept the amounts just small enough that the lawsuit would be more expensive than the
write-off.
   The public (government employees) con-artists are quite another matter. Dealing with organized-crime syndicates entails a risk of
of death and dismemberment not generally found in the private venue. My current traffic court issue illustrates the problem:
   A city cop pulls me over (on private property out of her jusrisdiction) after running my plate for no reason. The car title was
not transferred with sufficient rapidity (and fees paid) for Her Majesty's pleasure. I receive a summons for this heinous Criminal
Offense (penalty $1000, 90 days in the clink). I plead not guilty. For defense, I could point out the jurisdiction issue, and risk
having the cop lie in court. Or, I could go into the fundamental violations of the US Constitution, such as Amendnment 4, Amendment
14, and, most especially, Article 1, Sections 8 and 10. Or, I could argue from common-law right of free passage, but of course this
is not a common-law court anymore, is it?. If I do hire an attorney, he will be considered an officer of the court, and will
probably not be willing to entertain these kinds of defenses, nor suggest to the jury that they nullify this law. Alternatively, I
could file a UCC-1 security interest, a writ of habeus corpus, and so on.
  However, all of these strategies run into a really visceral problem: the risk of robbery, torture, death threats and murder at the
hands of the police. Being very familiar with these kinds of  "law enforcement" activites directed against various friends,
acquaintances and family members over the years, as well as reviewing other people's stories, I do not think this is a viable
alternative. So no, I'm not going to call a lawyer, it's a waste of my time and money.

I think that paired convictions is an interesting idea. Use bad evidence to
get a felony conviction, earn a felony conviction of your own. "Good
intentions" or not.

 Excluding those which seemed to be not on this topic, most, but not all were 
from Palestinian sources but those supporting the Palestinian side are all 
apparently quite credible.  Although they are overwhelmingly case studies, 
all save two support the claim that the settlement are stealing the land by 
any normal standard.  Those two used Bible quotation and the claim that 
nobody's had title to the land for 2000 years since it was nobody's

Nice refinement.

We also need to distinguish between categories of evidence that is 
currently inadmissible.

In our new world, if Dirty Harry searches a perp without probable cause and 
finds the murder weapon, the weapon is admissible, and Harry is 
punished.  But if Harry dangles a perp over the side of a building and he 
confesses, the confession is not admissible.

Only to some extent (I believe).

The normal configuration on my Linux box is:

  sendmail --> procmail --> user mailbox

I'm under the impression that what Amara is suggesting is:

  sendmail --> procmail --> spambouncer --> user mailbox

My point was that after the sendmail step, you have "received"
the SPAM, and are simply determining how to dispose of it.

In contrast, the support for the MAPS Realtime Black Hole List
and Relay Spam Stopper (which were free before Aug. 1, 2001)
could be "built into" the "sendmail" step which would allow
it to reject the messages as they were received.

I'd have to go through the sendmail configs in a little more
detail to be sure.  It may be true that the sendmail filtering
may not have been much better than the spambouncer filtering
(in that it still may have "accepted" the message).  What one
really wants is a real-time filter that recognizes spam on
packet-by-packet basis as it is received from the sender (as
well as recognizes known SPAM senders up-front and rejects
them before they can even send packets).

The filtering mechanism needs to be pushed as far
upstream as possible (ultimately one wants to push
it back to "responsible" backbones providers).
The spam messages should be recognized on a source
basis or a content basis and rejected with a harsh
message (indicating that spam filters are in place
and further attempts will be rejected) or presented
with DoS attacks to reduce the amount of spam such
systems can contribute to the net.

The problem is that the local post office has already "accepted"
the message at this point.  It is likely that the reply-to: or
From: address have been "forged" or are dummy accounts on free
systems (yahoo, excite, etc.).  So the bounce message is ignored.
(The bounce message actually contributes to useless network
overhead in this situation.)

Again, if the originating system is an intentional spammer then
complaints to that system's postmaster will be ignored.  I'd have
to look in detail at whether the "upstream" sites complaint
process is useful.  If they use the transmission path contained
in the headers of the email message it is probably of less use
than if they do an actual traceroute back to the originating
system (some providers now block these) so they can complain
to everyone along the chain of transmission.

Spudboy100@aol.com wrote........
I've often heard scientists call philosophical attention to  their field
irrelevant at best, and confusing and destructive at worst.  Indeed, many
scientists advise that philosophy should be avoided  altogether. Steven
Weinberg, for example, named a chapter in his book Dreams of  a Final Theory
"Against the philosophers". Murray Gell-Mann, meanwhile, has  remarked that
philosophy "muddies the waters and obscures [the theoretical  physicist's]
principal task, which is to find a coherent structure that  works". He then
added that having a philosophical bias may cause a physicist  "to reject a
good idea".

I tend to agree that (academic) Philosophy is a form of intellectual
masturbation that scientists would do well to avoid. One philosopher
invents a word then the rest of them sit around arguing what it means.
Philosophical analysis is so sterile and long-winded that it sucks any
energy out of a new idea or concept.

On www.att.ac (academic reform) site I am starting a  "Philosophers into the
Community" campaign to close Philosophy Dpts. and force their  denizens into
the real world of pubs and shopping malls to give any  "benefit" of their
knowledge to the public, ala Socrates. Plato was a traitor to real
Philosophical debate by ghettoising it and making the debate remote and
pointless to  everyone except for professional philosophers.
==============================================

It was an interesting article. I confess a similar degree of frustration
with philosophical discussion in the area of consciousness studies. The
amount of verbiage is massive and almost always goes nowhere useful from a
practical standpoint. Quite often it ends up feeding on itself in a
categorisation quest of doubtful utility. Every now and then one will find a
reasonable set of thought experiments that are helpful. Eg: Chalmers' Qualia
paper. A nice reductio argument. Even then, however, the practical use is
hard to see, except in the overall 'big picture' of philosophical
categorisation, although it may support a practical position taken in
modelling.

The PhysicsWeb article author proposes: "Why philosophy shouldn't be
avoided". Physicists, apparently, have differences of 'calibration' in their
mind of what reality is. The argument goes that "Because physicists haven't
labelled/categorised every flavour of any one (1st person) view of reality,
therefore Philosophy is required". The logic says: alphabetical sorting by
colour of socks is necessary before you can wear them. Not very convincing.

At the end of the article if find I may be a "Hermeneutical realist". If I
cared enough to delineate myself into the various realist flavours...then
what? Will that change my approach to anything? I can now identify myself to
other philosophers, but that appears to be the only tangible outcome.  Isn't
it more useful to realise that the great 'grounder' of all cognition: actual
reality (whatever you think it is), where all these people (physicists) do
their work, really what matters? Tangible, repoducable 'things' that predict
other things?

At the end of the article:
"By articulating the relationship between scientific practice to other kinds
of human activities, a fully articulated philosophical position would make
scientific judgements and decisions appear less abstract, strange and
arbitrary to outsiders"

_Less abstract_? Eh? Not from any reading of philosophy I've ever done. The
whole point of philosophy is abstraction.
To me this says:
	Invent categories
	Map reality into them
	show it to J. Public
	Ergo: all shall be clear for all Joe Publics

I'd have thought:
	State plainly what you can really do.
	explain plainly what may be possible as a result.
	Let J. Public map it into their own internal truth buckets.

The existence of a set of calibrated buckets imposed by the first procedure
does not necessarily improve J. Public's position and assumes J.Public is
interested in the process. I say: Do something useful and explain it plainly
and you'll get listened to!

What makes these folks racist is that they thought
this was *important* enough to put on their
"Enlightenment test".

Why worry about genetics... it takes a very long time
for natural reproduction to have a large effect on
anything... while we are rapidly approaching
technology that makes all racial differences moot.  To
know this and yet still use the best, most logical
arguments in existence (e.g. the link to Miller's web
site) to argue for your bias against blacks *and make
it part of your groups central tenets* is to make your
group racist.

Please note Mike... racists don't have to have invalid
arguments to BE racist.

And Damien's reply to Zero was to show that the site
was racist, not that it was in error.

Our behavior is dictated by our personalities which have been formed when we 
grow up. It keeps changing, but slower and slower. If the environment is 
threatening we develop paranoid behavior. If people feel secure they develop

I was thinking of employees (wage slaves) who are forced to play a tech catch 
up game with brain gadgets to increase their **efficiency**, not their 
(trans)humanistic education, in order not to get fired in an economy where 
the GDP is falling and the unemployment rate is rising and approaching 100%. 
This would be a deflation scenario, I guess.

This setting assumes that we **fail** to get the Singularity to really take 
off, maybe because strong SI is __much harder than we think or maybe because 
luddites or Bill Joy get international laws passed to suppress strong AI or 
maybe because strong SIs run away from Earth as fast as they can, leaving us 
behind. 

The tech growth curve would not take the shape of a spike, but rather a 
sigmoidal curve. We would get stuck with weak SI (e.g. being directly hooked 
up to computers) for those who can afford it. What appears to support such a 
scenario is that most of us, particularly in the US have a blind faith in 
capitalism after we "won" the cold war. Could it result in Manchester 
Capitalism v2.0?

No, I don't intend to spread FUD. It might just be worthwile to think about 
solutions for extreme unemployment rates and not just leaving that to the 
market. The free market system works great for traditional goods like cars. 
It fails badly for software (an abundant good). Why else are lobyists trying 
to create artificial scarcity on software these days e.g. by trying to 
indirectly outlaw OpenSource? The free market system will also fail to deal 
well with strong nano. The free market system just cannot handle abundance 
well. It's time to think of alternatives, preferrably alternatives that are 
compatible to the free market so there can coexist different economic models 
for different industries.

Nice.  I have a phone system that does this.  It silently answers the 
phone and tells solicitors that I am not interested in their phone call 
and to please take me off their list.  If they are not a solicitor, they 
are told to hold on while the phone rings for me.  I get dozens of 
solicitors per day, but none have come through this device in over a 
year.

That may be a problem, but it is not the problem that I am referencing.

If Bob Mathews dislikes this so much why doesn't he simply write the 
appropriate style sheets or SAX parser to transform MathML->TeX or a TeX 
module that outputs MathML instead of ranting?

Or even easier: Check out
http://www.webeq.com/mathml/resources.html

and download what's needed.

All of these hypothetical situations are missing the point.  Israel has 
authorized the use of deadly force against reporters to enforce their 
news blackout.  This is not a case of mistaken identity, collateral 
damage, or inadvertent damage being done by the reporters.  The Israeli 
government admits and defends their use of deadly force to force 
reporters out of the area.

I suspect however that one could develop an adaptive algorithm.
I've got 1.5 million lines of SPAM and 0.7 million lines of personal
email stored here (from the last couple of years).   I find it
difficult to believe that there is not an algorithm that could not
come up with 2-3-4 word phrases indicitive of "SPAM" vs. real
email.  Ok, so "young girls" mutates into "immature women" mutates
into "nubile youngthangs".  Pretty soon the database becomes
robust enough to block anything remotely related to the concept
you are trying to express.  The faster the spamers invent new
ideas, the faster they are blocked (becuase people sending "normal"
email have no incentive to invent such creative expressions.
You could run the filters against "validated" conversation lists,
e.g. sci.nanotech, the extropian archives, etc. to discover unusual
phrases that are not "common" but again not "spam" to vet them.

I mean really, how many ways are there to say "lower interest rates"
or "pre-approved credit cards"???

That is why I placed an emphasis on limited DoS'ing.  You create
an annoyance/degradation problem for the admins hosting such insecure
systems.  It will cause them to become aware of the problem while
realizing that attempting to make a claim against thousands or
millions of people may be futile (esp. since they are the source
of the problem in the first place).  One could adopt a ratio
that each SPAM message should generate 10-100x the amount of
reverse traffic.  That sould be sufficient incentive to get
the ISPs to deal with it responsibly and aggressively.

One could even make it a configuration option -- how much
junk you dump on them in response to how much junk they
dump on you.  That way when you go to court you could claim
very precise damage ratios.  Only theirs was unsolicited
and yours was in direct response to theirs.  [Alternatively,
instead of DoS attacks, multiple emails to their postmaster,
abuse manager, reply-to addresses might be justified.  A
rejection of any of these emails is reason to reject the
incoming message.  I've noticed that SPAM reply mailboxes
fill up very quickly.]  A combination of logging reply-to
addresses, domains or IP addresses to central SPAM
detection servers should be able to provide almost
instantaneous alerts as to when a message has been
sent to 70 million names.

> > In the world I envision you have to say "May I?"!

Thanks Dave, I'll investigate these.  But as I've suggested the
solutions for this problem have to start as far upstream as possible
and produce negative consequences on the originating systems or their
ISPs for this to stop.  The users have to create a culture among the
ISPs that SPAM is simply not an "acceptable" use.  And the mail
servers/routers have to detect this the instant it occurs and respond
forcefully to it.

Since I doubt that spammers will anytime soon be sending messages
in personal key encrypted format, I do not think this is a
really difficult problem to solve.

Warning:  Microsoft silently changes security patches.  Even if you 
think you have installed the recommended security patch from Microsoft, 
they may have changed its contents since you downloaded it.
The e-mail below notes two such occurrences.

We have also received similar reports from people who have tried to 
automate a notification system to tell them when Microsoft releases a 
new patch.  They began getting notifications for old patches that had 
already been released.  Further investigation showed that Microsoft had 
edited the contents of older patches without documenting the change.

Similar instances have plagued people who try to detect when websites 
change.  The online links and descriptions of Microsoft patches changes 
without warning for older patches.

A comparison of these changes with the original downloads show that the 
changes can occur in the content, instructions or description of the 
patch.  Microsoft never documents the changes, or warns that a different 
version of the patch has been released.  It is almost as if they are 
trying to edit files historically, so that it appears that the old 
patches always contained their present contents.

Now we have the confusing situation where any given download of a 
Microsoft patch may or may not match other downloads of the same patch.  
A company that downloads and patches all their computers may end up with 
different software on different machines.  A technician who tests a 
patch in one environment and then goes to implement it into production 
may not implement the same patch as tested.  Reviewers who report 
success or problems with a patch may not be describing the same patch 
that their customers later receive.  It may even become necessary to 
re-download and re-try patches that fail on the off-chance that 
Microsoft has changed them without warning or documentation.

Hi,
         Just thought I'd pass this along.  Microsoft has silently changed
the patch in MS02-008 (at least the MSXML 3.0 version).  The old patch I
downloaded on 2/22/02 had version 8.20.9307.0 of msxml3.dll.  The 
version I
downloaded today has version 8.20.9415.0.  There is no indication in the
security bulletin that anything has changed.  HFNetChk alerted me that 
the
file version did not match.
         The same thing happened last month with MS02-009.  The patch
silently changed, although the bulletin did get updated later.  It's
possible that this is simply due to a delay in the revised bulletin 
getting
propagated to all the web servers.  I hope this is the case.
         On a semi-related note, does anyone know why HFNetChk complains 
that
MS02-016 is not applied to a Win2K server that is not a domain 
controller?
Is it just because it can't identify DC's, or is there some reason to 
apply
it?

hmm.

Harvey, have you got an authentic cite for that? E.g., "Yes, we will shoot
reporters on sight", rather than "any reporters who get shot, roughed up or
detained were previously warned to get out"?

No, the existing laws don't (at least not here in the US). Existing laws
have a three part standard, a) that the information is actually false,
b) that it was intentionally falsified, and c) that the intention was
malicious. The third standard is impossible to prove in a court of law
unless you have a smoking gun memo by the slanderer expressing such
malice.

Yes, the same algorithms that are used to spot non-randomness in
encrypted messages can be adapted to this purpose, analysing various
categories of spam (primarly by product sold) for word frequency
patterns as fingerprints depending on how spam messages differ
semantically from normal email text.

I've seen several stories of such shootings on the news, and in every
case, it was a situation of a cameraman trying to get a shot of street
action by peeking the camera out a window or over the edge of a
building. If I were a soldier driving down a street where door to door
guerilla fighting was going on, and my life was on the line, you can bet
that anything that resembled an infrared missile seekerhead in a tube
would get my immediate and highly negative attention. I'd rather be
wrong than dead.

For those who have no military experience, look at it from the grunt
Israeli soldiers perspective (rather than automatically bleeding your
heart all over the poor downtrodden Palestinians). For an American,
think of Vietnam. Imagine you find an American reporter is traveling
with a Viet Cong regiment you come into combat against. First off, you
and your buddies are gonna be pissed in an "Ain't Fonda Jane" kinda way,
and secondly, if the Viet Cong guys decide the American reporter is
really a spy for the US forces and shoot him, then can still claim the
reporter was shot by American troops, and no amount of denial by the US
military will be believed by the left wingers back home in the US.

Black Blade (04/10/02; 18:42:48MT - usagold.com msg#: 73107)
Japan - Is It just The Banks That Are Insolvent - Or Is It The Whole Damn Country?

Recently George "Dubya" Bush went to China and on his way he stopped over in Japan for a "courtesy call" on Japanese Prime Minister
Junichero Koizumi. The problem it seems is that this was no ordinary "courtesy call" or just a couple of chums yukking it up over a
few cases of sake. It seems that the problem of Japan's insolvent banks and failing currency are very likely to drag the rest of the
world into a deep Global Depression and the Japanese aren't doing much to stop it.

Japan is the world's second largest economy and it also has the world's largest level of public debt to the tune of 140% of GDP.
That's a colossal load of debt. Across this Island nation bankruptcies and unemployment are rising to new record levels never seen
before. The Nikkei 225 has recently hit new lows, consumer confidence is nearly nonexistent, and consumer prices are falling fast.
In fact housing prices are falling to levels not seen since 1982. Many properties are priced far below the mortgage values creating
some major concerns for the insolvent Japanese banks (more on this later).

Joblessness, bankruptcy, crime, and suicide were once almost unheard of in Japan, and now these problems are so common that they
rarely even make it to the back pages of Japanese newspapers. These days it is not uncommon to see middle-age educated men and even
some women walking about in Japan's cities begging for money with signs around their necks that read "Restructured" - that's
Japanese for fired or shuffled off to the "Bone Pile".

Actually the biggest crisis may be the failed Japanese Yen. The Bank of Japan is hard pressed to keep the printing presses running
24 hours a day to offset the growing liquidity crisis. The Yen recently hit about 135 Yen to the US Dollar. This of course is a
major concern to US manufacturers who depend on exports as a chief source of income and the increased competition from a weakened
Yen is resulting in much of the US "Bone Pile" growth. But it is actually much worse than that - this crisis will likely trigger
currency devaluations throughout the Asian community. This may very well result in "Asian Contagion - Part II".

The Japanese have even forsaken the Yen in some quarters. The massive "run for the Gold" is partial evidence of this falling
confidence in the country's currency. In fact a new currency is circulating now. This script is called "Yufu". Actually it is more
of a barter script. People contribute their skills (under the table of course) for Yufu that they can exchange for goods and
services. Japan is in the beginning stages of a growing currency crisis and it is no wonder that the Japanese people are "going for
the Gold" (or platinum, or almost any hard asset).

The Insolvent Japanese banking sector is not a pretty sight either. Here Japanese banks have over $5 Trillion in debt that they are
not willing to (or can't) write off. They are trying to collect on these bad debts. The result is that suicide and bankruptcy rates
are accelerating and Japanese bankers are going so far as to hire armed martial arts experts to collect from some unsavory
characters (such as members of the Japanese mob - Yakuza). The banks are being forced to write off bad loans while the rate of bad
loans are growing even faster. That results in a loss of confidence that leads to even more bad loans (a death spiral).

It appears that it is now up to Koizumi to drum up yet another bailout for Japan's banks (the fifth since 1998). If anyone here
thinks that the US S&L crisis in the 1980's was bad, this Japanese banking crisis makes that look rather insignificant. This crisis
will sink Japan and its economy to the point of total collapse and in the process take many of the world's economies with it. So
what has the Japanese government done? So far they have changed regulations that allow for guaranteeing only the first $75,000 in
time deposits beginning on April Fools Day. Next year this restriction carries over to all Japanese savings deposits. There is a lot
of Yen to steal when the banks collapse.

There is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide for many Japanese. Many Japanese are making the decision to get hard assets like Gold
and Platinum rather than take their chances on a failed government and a failing banking sector. As more Japanese end up on the
growing "Bone Pile" and the Yen becomes worthless they simply do not want to end up as those poor people in Argentina who were lied
to and screwed by their government. People in Japan still have fresh in their memories news reports of survivors of the Kobe
earthquake digging through their ruined homes and pulling out Gold bullion that survived while their currency and possessions burned
in the resulting fires. The growing crisis in Japan's insolvent banking sector and crumbling currency are fanning the flames of a
different fire that threatens to consume the wealth of most Japanese. Therefore it is a foregone conclusion that the "Japanese Gold
Rush" will continue for quite some time to come.

[Japanese gold demand shot up 600% last month. The flight from the Yen appears to be on- FB]

What really killed Argentina?
By Hugo Salinas Price

   MEXICO CITY - "So the Argentine economy has collapsed and social and financial chaos reigns.
   We have read a great deal about it, but very few analysts have mentioned the actual and fundamental cause of this disaster. To do
so is too horrifying, for what has destroyed Argentina is the same cause at work all over the world today. Argentina's fate is the
world's fate - and that is too drastic a conclusion for any analyst who wants to be paid for his work. ..."

Most of us don't hear things straight from a military officer, in
private or in the chain of command.  We see high level officers in press
conferences.  I don't think you can avoid bureaucrats at political
appointees at that level.

And... I'm not sure that I see that officers aren't bureaucrats.  They
have a more tight bonding to results than your average middle manager,
what with the guns and life and death and all that.  But immunity from
CYA, and trying to keep knowledge of mistakes from leaking out, not to
mention sheer ability to screw up by accident?  I don't see it.

Anyway, we weren't talking about the US military.  We were talking about
the Israeli military in occupation of people whom it's not clear they
always see as people.  Not a situation I want to see restricted press
in.

Atrocities happen in the dark.  Ask the Jews.  Oh, wait...

Mathematica and Scientific Workplace are expensive 'converters',

There's a lot more that spambouncer provides regarding MAPS support
and checking for IPs with Open Relays. I haven't tried any of that,
yet. Maybe that goes part-way to answer what you want too.

Is it really a flaw of yours?? : )  I remember you giving poor Olaf Henny a very hard time for having been "taken in" by Nazism as a very young child(along with his family).  To me Olaf was heroic for later on as a teenage boy standing up to Communist party officials who wanted him to knuckle under and be a good youth party member!  His post which shared these rememberances really impressed me.

Have you changed your view of him since that time?  Olaf is the one who deserves a break, and not these folks.

Subject: Message #18258 from Mike Darwin
References: <20020101100001.63313.qmail@rho.pair.com>

I am responding to Mike Darwin's posting concerning the
significant achievements of Leni Riefenstahl in cinematic opinion
forming, without the benefit of having read any of the books
about her.  However I have personally been exposed to the
euphoric atmosphere her film productions created among the German
public.  Even though I was just a small child at the time, I
sensed the powerful, uplifting impact they had on the adults in
my life.

While the architect Albert Speer designed the monumental setting
of the parade grounds featured in "Triumph of the Will", he was
not the founder of the propaganda technique used in her films.
That was clearly the creation of 'Reichspropagandaminister Dr.
Joseph Goebbels', an unequalled genius in mass manipulation.  His
technique was later also widely used by the communist leadership.
I was exposed to it on both sides, as an enthusiastic and willing
target by the Nazis* and later as a hostile exposed to communist
propaganda.  The power of it is enormous.

Just a quick introduction to my situation at the time: In 1950 I
was one of only seven students in my school, who were still
refusing to join the FDJ, the communist youth organization, and
found myself under immense pressure to do so.  Instead I changed
schools and ended up in a class, where there were 6 of us still
on the outside.  Only a couple of month thereafter I was again
the lone resisting student in my class.  I was clearly no friend
of the system.
On occasion of the May 1st 1951 Workers Day
parade, we were marching in true totalitarian style, ten or
fifteen abreast, past a stage occupied the then president of the
GDR, Wilhelm Pieck, and his entourage. Chanting all around us,
the loudspeaker proclaimed: "The president of the German
Democratic Republic salutes the students of the Goethe Schule
(our school)".  Around me everybody was clapping with hands
raised above their heads.  It was mass frenzy and although I
resented the guy, as I have resented few in my life, my impulse
at the time was to raise my hands and join in the clapping.  I
resisted and clenched my briefcase instead, but I realized then
how profound the impact of mass manipulation can be.

It does not work in our present situation, because the profound
 building of a new world by a new generation  concept is missing
or no longer credible as a mass movement setting.  In communism
it was the  new world, where everybody has equal rights and
shares in the wealth for a better and brighter future.  With the
Nazis it was the  prosperous future achieved through healthy
living and strengthening of body and mind in order to evolve into
a stronger people .

Those, who were not there, and know of Nazi atrocities will have
difficulty understanding the mind set of the German people of the
time.  The 6 or 7 % of the population, who were directly exposed
to those atrocities mostly disappeared quietly over night and
faded from the memories of the general population.  99% of the
rest of us had absolutely no idea, what was happening to them
afterwards and the fraction of one percent, who were directly
involved in those atrocities, did well for themselves by not
talking about it, unless they wanted to share the fate of their
victims.

*The rest of us (the then adults anyway) have experienced in the
years prior to Hitler s election in 1932: 60 to 70% unemployment,
galloping inflation, during which you started in the morning after
negotiating a wage, which would feed the family for a day, and in
the evening, when you got paid, it was barely enough to buy one
cigarette.  Tumults in the streets fist fights between Nazis and
Communists, the Weimar Republic out of control.  Then in just six
short years Germany rose from being the economically most
devastated industrialized country to the one with the highest
living standard with full employment.  That was the foundation
for the fanatic enthusiasm, with which the people supported the
Nazis, and why their believe in the final victory of Germany was
unwavering for so long.


Albert Speer, Hitlers architect, is also credited with bringing
the German war production into high gear and condemned for using
slave labour to achieve that.  In 1942, when he took over and
when the bombing of industrial plants in the from Britain easy to
reach Rhein/Rhur areas by the Allies started in earnest, the monthly
production of tanks (the smallish P4) was under 100.  By 1944 it
had risen to 400 of the much bigger Koenigstiger, despite the
relentless bombing.

Best,
Olaf

Truth be told we all have race-based prejudices.  We are hardwired to 
prejudge people and situations.  It's a necessary intellectual shortcut 
which permits one to make decisions in life when given less than all the 
facts.

That's not to say that I suffer supremacists or unjust oppressors of any 
stripe.  But I'd rather interact with an honest racist than an insincere 
anti-racist.

One of the sad parts of this is that 12 years ago Japan had the *lowest* level
of debt amongst Western countries.  IMO it just shows how off the beam
Keynes was with his claim that burying money (ie any way for the gov't
to spend it) will help revive a depressed economy.  Japan has spent many
trillions on stimulatory measures, dubious public works, and probably a
lot of corruption, and has nothing to show for it but crushing debt.  
Wasted is wasted.

Ja, Im just not keeping up with the top 40.  And yes, my rant was partly
in reference to rap and hip hop.  At the risk of sounding like my 
grandfather,
this musical artform simply invites ridicule.  I dont understand the words,
and when I do, I dont understand the point of view, it doesnt translate to
horns, it is hard to sing, if that is the proper term.  Can you imagine 
playing
Name That Tune with rap?  Alex, I can name that tune in one note.
Sounds more like Morse code than music.

I like music with a positive outlook on life, an outlook which
matches my own view of life.

Nowthen, your point is well taken that there is good new music being
developed all the time.  But my tastes have diverged far from the
commercially viable.  I just returned from a business trip, during which
I searched the radio dial.  I still like the melodic sophistication of
the past eras, some way past, before my time.  Such as the Beatles. {8-]

This started out as an intellectual property discussion and the
ethical dilemmas it  presents.  I havent been tempted to napster
music.  (Is napster still around?)  But Ive ripped a number of
my own discs, most of which are at least 15 yrs old now.  spike

Robert, it's been done: http://spamassassin.taint.org/ and works
very well.

The spam-identification tactics used include: 

       header analysis: spammers use a number of tricks to mask their 
identities, fool you into thinking they've sent a valid
       mail, or fool you into thinking you must have subscribed at some 
stage. SpamAssassin tries to spot these. 
       text analysis: again, spam mails often have a characteristic style 
(to put it politely), and some characteristic disclaimers
       and CYA text. SpamAssassin can spot these, too. 
       blacklists: SpamAssassin supports many useful existing blacklists, 
such as mail-abuse.org, ordb.org or others. 
       Razor: Vipul's Razor is a collaborative spam-tracking database, 
which works by taking a signature of spam messages.
       Since spam typically operates by sending an identical message to 
hundreds of people, Razor short-circuits this by
       allowing the first person to receive a spam to add it to the 
database -- at which point everyone else will automatically
       block it. 

  Once identified, the mail can then be optionally tagged as spam for 
later filtering using the user's own mail user-agent
  application. 

  SpamAssassin requires very little configuration; you do not need to 
continually update it with details of your mail accounts,
  mailing list memberships, etc. It accomplishes filtering without this 
knowledge, as much as possible. 

  The distribution provides a command line tool to perform filtering, 
along with Mail::SpamAssassin, a set of perl modules
  which implement a Mail::Audit plugin, allowing SpamAssassin to be used 
in a Mail::Audit filter, or (possibly at some point) in
  a spam-protection proxy POP/IMAP server. 

  SpamAssassin lives at http://spamassassin.org/ or in CPAN, and is 
distributed under Perl's Artistic license. 

  Features

       Wide-spectrum: SpamAssassin uses a wide variety of local and 
network tests to identify spam signatures. This makes it
       harder for spammers to identify one aspect which they can craft 
their messages to work around. 
       Free software: it is distributed under the same terms and 
conditions as Perl itself. 
       Easy to extend: Rules, weights and user-visible text are stored in 
text configuration files as much as possible, which the
       user (or sysadmin) can edit to modify or add new rules. 
       Flexible: SpamAssassin encapsulates its logic in a well-designed, 
abstract API. As a result, it's not limited to the
       traditional local-delivery-to-spool case; using the 
Mail::SpamAssassin classes, it can be used in a wide variety of setups.
       This means that SpamAssassin support is available for a variety of 
mail systems -- traditional procmail, a Mail::Audit
       plugin, qmail, MIMEDefang, Postfix, and many others.

The term lie and false may not be perfectly applicable to
either the military or the press.  Is camoflage a lie?  It
makes something look like bushes.  The Confederates
held off a division of union troops with a Quaker cannon:
a log painted black to look like an artillery piece.  Lee
had a few men start a large number of camp fires then
walk round all night so that observing union troops would
see the fires wink off for a second, and thus assume a
large number of rebs were camped there.  Was
General Lee a liar?  In Desert Storm, a small force
feigned an attack, distracting the Iraqi forces, and placed
a solid punch elsewhere.  Lie?

Is the term lie even applicable here? We have bluffing
in a poker match, fake left run right in football, feigns
in boxing, gambits in chess.  These kinds of maneuvers
are all fair game.  In war one must use all resources at
one's disposal, including keeping the opponent in
doubt as to ones intentions.

With the press, I see what appears not so much
out and out lying as a more or less constant spinning
of the news to favor one's political viewpoint.  It is not
clear that this is lying exactly, more like campaigning.  

Treat news reporting as a political advertisement, treat
the words of military leaders as a battle tactic, and
always keep the bullshit filters set on high.  spike

The Goldilocks zone.

I wonder if the 3 bears are home somewhere on the other 999,999,999,999

I have Adobe Acrobat 5.0. I have a pdf document that I have open and need to
edit.

I want to put a space (empty) between two rows. (like I just did between the
top line
and this one) How do I do this? I see under: Tools, Touch Up Text, insert,
Line Break.
However no matter which tool I select, as I choose these options, it does
nothing but add
a space or a prolonged line until the text disappears. I'm sure I'm missing
something and
this is very simple, but I am new to the program............and need to get
this work done,
please save me! Thanx.

One reason I lurk on some of these very good groups is after I post
something to a usnet group or mailing list, my spam exponent increments
by "i".

Running my own SMTP mail server seems to be the only solution.
I tried spamcop and such, but it was like spitting into the wind.

I will look at Spambouncer (or have my students do it) when we setup our
own little domain for real.

But, I do read this group, and I use some of this material in my classes
(I teach bioinformatics).

There's a lot more that spambouncer provides regarding MAPS support and
checking for IPs with Open Relays. I haven't tried any of that, yet.
Maybe that goes part-way to answer what you want too.

The trouble with this is you potentially throwout freedom from 
arbitrary search and seizure and security in one's persons and 
effects if you aren't careful.  Much illegal evidence is illegal 
precisely because it is a threat to this freedom.  I don't think 
catch and prosecuting more crimes is worth that for a minute. 
It is even less worth it considering the very questionable and 
huge assortment of things that are now called 'crimes'.

Yes.  It is one of many utterly reprehensible things that Israel 
is doing.  If these things were being done by any other country 
(besides ourselves) we would be in a major uproar.

Either you live in a society that protects you from arbitrary 
search and seizure and other illegal means or you don't.  The 
few violent criminals (and many non-violent ones a lot of which 
are not rationally designatable as criminals) who are caught by 
such means are victims of an abrogation of the very rights we in 
the US are supposed to protect.  Their victimization victimizes 
us all.  We don't gain in security and certainly not freedom 
thereby.

Ease of prosecution is NOT the primary goal of the legal system 
or of the political system of which it is a part.  I will not 
live in or support a country that does not understand that.

Sigh.  Never mind that science is firmly based on certain 
philosophical near-axioms and conclusions.  Does anyone taking 
the above position know enough about philosophy to understand 
that making statements about what constitutes knowledge, what 
sorts of knowledge are possible in what conditions, and how to 
verify knowledge ARE philosophical positions?

Or are our geeky blinders on way too tight?

Well, yeah, as I have trusted people in the past when I should not have, and
it has been kind of tragic.
It's something I am aware of and trying to be a tad meaner in my dealings with
people, but I suspect I still suck at looking at people objectively.

Well, as I recall, you *could* look at it from that perspective.
Or, you could see him as an unreconstructed nazi, which I think is what I
called him.

Was he standing up against totalitarianism, or was he a true believer? he
succumbed once before, had he made a decision not to be taken in again, and
resisted their nefarious attempts at brainwashing, or did he seriously believe
in german racial superiority and all the rest of it?

Beats me. Calling someone a nazi is pretty mean, I guess, but if he was a nazi
I guess he'd not be too worried about it.  If he wasn't a nazi I'd like to
think he'd understand my suspicion, but I guess it might upset him a tad.

> Have you changed your view of him since that time? 
> Olaf is the one who deserves a break, and not these folks.

Well, like any human being, he certainly deserves the benefit of the doubt.
I'm not sure if he deserves a *break* or not, as I'm not aware of all of the
circumstances.

Ah, cool, I see you appended his post.

Well, yup, reading over it again, I stand by what I said. He comes across as
an unreconstructed nazi.
I'll retract that if convinced otherwise (ie: his writing "the nazis were bad
and wrong and I am sorry I believed their garbage" somewhere will do) but on
the strength of those words, that's what he sounds like to me.  Got any more
quotes?

This will still make the punisher guilty of hurting other people, including 
the assumedly criminal. This is what I mean: No one can escape his 
responsibility - and/or guilt. A hurts B, B hurts A, both A and B are 
guilty and responsible for everything they do or do not.

Even police officers and judges are responsible for their deeds and so are 
politicians and soldiers. They get absolution for it from their society as 
long as they stay to the common and the written moral (the law), but they 
are still responsible. A cop who kills a criminal is still a killer, a 
soldier who kill an "enemy" is still a killer. He personally is responsible 
for pulling the trigger or dropping the bomb.

(NB, English is not my native tongue and I fear I have a problem to explain 
properly what I mean with guilt and responsibility...)

This position is clearly outside the humanist philosophy, preventive 
killing of potential(!) criminals or even their relatives. Think about it: 
you and your family executed, because your brother is a political 
extremist. This is the policy of fascist or other extremist "state over 
people" regimes. It's also military thinking, to calculate human beings 
like cattle without rights and dignity - collateral damage means dead 
innocent people. As I've said: there is no civilization in war. And it 
doesn't relieve soldiers or politicians - or you - of their guilt and 
responsibility.

Adobe Acrobat PDF is not a format that is designed to be edited. (Adobe
will be probably happy to sell you a tool to munge it, though. It's their
business model: free readers, everything else a premium). Notice that
blacking out text passages in PDF files is fraught with danger, as the
original info still remains in there (ditto with .MS Word .DOC documents,
which have versioning switched on).

I'm pretty much against this, for the following reasons. The transport
layer should be content-agnostic. As soon as you try to make the transport
layer play the role of filters, it introduces inefficiencies, and -- much
more importantly -- breaks transport in many interesting and unanticipated
ways. Fixing brokenness introduced by initial attempts to fix it is hard.

It's okay to introduce friction/throttling at the transport layer, though,
which is what hashcash does. It's an attempt on the spam side to invest
CPU resources at message delivery, making bulk email prohibitively
expensive. (A mix of hashcash and cryptographically authenticated 
whitelisting alone could kill spam quite easily).

I personally feel my current needs to be adequately addresed by
SpamAssassin. I pore through the spam folder once a day or two, and this
allows me a highly efficient way of dealing with it (usually I don't even
have to look at message body, as headers and subject usually say it all).

Haven't read it, but Bernsteinware typically doesn't play well with

Spam = bulk email. As long as you don't start rewriting each message body
for each recipient (or small groups of recipients), simple statistical
analysis on P2P systems will tag such messages with a high probability.

Open relays are typically blocked at transport layer.

I used to answer and help on Usenet groups in the past. It was a good
way for me to gain more practice writing, teaching, keeping my
knowledge fresh or learning new things. What finally killed that for
me was that spam increased by orders of magnitude every time I wrote
something on Usenet.

For a while, my solution was to put a fake address in my return, but
the last time I did that, a group of German sysadmins jumped on me
publically saying that putting a fake address was extremely
anti-social and accused me of contributing to the garbage over
Internet. So I stopped contributing to Usenet groups.

Problem with response challenging is that people hate it. The argument 
you'll hear most often is "you're not that f*cking important".

I'm perfectly happy missing e-mail from people who don't consider me
important enough to warrant a one-time confirmation.

However, I do keep a copy of unconfirmed messages that I scan
periodically, and I haven't seen many non-spam messages that were
never confirmed.

Yes, you can, if you can get "there" to claim it! I wonder, however, how many

That's not true. qmail and djbdns work very well with other mailers

and Samantha joined in with

and went on to say that if we "victimize" the few violent
criminals we don't really gain in security (or freedom).

But many of us would agree to some moderation here, because we
in the U.S. indeed have lost a great deal of security.  It's
hard to credit, but when I was a boy, people in the U.S. didn't
generally lock their doors at night.  Why do we do so now?
Mainly because "it is better that a thousand guilty men go free
than one innocent man be sent to jail", and we all have a very
bad feeling about what those thousand guilty men may be doing
tonight.

When Hal writes

> Few juries would convict a policeman who overstepped the

> a violent criminal.

I think that the judicial system would deter such policemen,
though not one-hundred percent.  Sometimes a given cop (or
department) would be  willing to face fines or imprisonment
themselves, such being their great desire to put some people
away---and yes, that's unfortunate.

Still, I agree with Harvey:

> I say, go ahead and use the evidence to prosecute the criminal
> and then also prosecute the person who illegally gathered the
> evidence.  One crime shouldn't absolve another crime.

Some modern countries, notably the U.S., desperately need
to reinvigorate a public perception that crime does not pay
and that it is *very* important to society that wrongdoers
are caught and punished (technicalities be damned).

And just so that the previous sentence won't be misinterpreted,
I'm saying that the public's perception of crime and the
likelihood of punishment is important too.

This is not hypothetical, this is war, where one mistake gets you
killed.

I have no problems with "journalists will be shot on site."

But that's because I've actually been there, and until you've
actually faced the result of a bad policy you're not likely to
understand why.

The first commandment of a grunt is:

"Thou shall not give away thy position"

The second is:

"That which giveth away thy position is thy enemy"


Brian's corollary: "If you deliberately or through carelessness put
me in danger, I am going to put YOU in danger"

You want to see whats going on? 

Enlist.

You have a system that does this?

I be curious to know the make and model.

In 1991 the day we launched Caller-ID I had an idea based on the
fact that we were forced to offer Call-ID blocking. I could see the
potential for abuse and so submitted the idea for "call blocking
refusal". They gave me a polite " We don't see the use for it" but
seven years later brought out the same exact idea as "Privacy
Manager" which was International Telecom Product of the year.

Patented by the company of course.

All kids I've tested under four years of age seem to have perfect pitch
(that is, if you play them a note and tell them what it's called, they'll
find it again amongst other notes, or if you just play the note, they'll
tell you what it's called.If you ask them to sing it, this takes practice=

but they knbow when it's wrong and when they've got it right.) This abili=

alternative data, anyone? Maybe the bit of the brain being used in perfec=

With the recent software upgrade, I think the ExI BBS is ready for prime time. (famous last words :)) The URL is http://www.extropy.org/bbs and a BBS registration FAQ can be found here:
http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=62&action=display&threadid=51472

The BBS contains a complete archive of the ExI mailing list messages from July 96 on. If you have ever posted to the list you already have an automatically generated BBS account (read the FAQ to see how to login).

I\'ve customized the BBS software to add a gateway to the mailing lists so that messages posted to the BBS (like this one) are sent to the list and vice versa. I have also built in an interface to the ExI chat forums which is a great way to meet your fellow Extropians in [i]realtime[/i]!  ;D

Please give it a try and let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.

David

You ever take one of those pre employment tests that
are supposed to measure how ethical an employee you'll
make?

The reason I ask is that there are questions on there
that resemble your statement above.  

"True or false:

Everybody takes a little something from their place of
work."

The point being that if you both believe that AND felt
comfortable agreeing with it, there was a significant
chance that you would steal from your employer.  After
all, everybody does it.

Of course there were hundreds of questions... many of
them similar to the one above... and no one would
judge anybody on just one answer.

That I don't get... would you rather hire an "honest"
thief who feels no compunction or remorse about
stealing from you or someone who has high enough
personal ethical standards to struggle over it?

Calling an anti-racist insincere because they can't
possibly have rooted out all personal racial prejudice
is a trick... a bit of verbal sleight of hand... to
cast the good guys in a bad light while putting a
white hat on the assh*les (he may be a racist, but at
least he's an honest one!).  I doubt that was your
intent, but that is the effect of your post.

Honestly, truly... racists do NOT need apologists. 
Not even black apologists :)

Loree

It is generally not possible to edit in Acrobat unless you are just
x-ing out content or adding 'post-it' notes. PDF is not meant to be an
editable format, it is meant to be a fixed format, which is why it is a
format used in scholarly papers as a final published format. The purpose
of Acrobat is essentially to add notes, indices and tables of contents,
make them hot linkable to the content they reference, and to generate a
search index for the Reader's search engine.

You might edit a PDF document, but only if you learn the PDF postscript
language and edit the raw code of the document file.

I found Loree's response rather interesting, though, that even if a
person has valid arguments and facts for their opinions, they are still
automatically wrong because their conclusions resemble those of racists
of the past.

As I've written in the past, racism, even in mild subconcious form, is a
hardwired result of our evolved mechanisms for trust evaluation
on-the-fly. The only alternative is to have an all seeing Big Brother
state that controlls all trust evaluations, so people don't have to and
individuals are not allowed to show any sort of bias or judgement from
their own inbuilt trust evaluators.

Lets look at some real insincere racists: rich liberal democrats. They
support multi-generational welfare, affirmative action, race based
quotas and set-asides, etc. yet refuse to send their kids to public
schools, move out of communities that become increasingly integrated
(the phenomenon called 'white flight') and if their kids fall in love
with a minority person, they are either disowned, or the future spouse
is forced to sign prenupital agreements. 

While the public policies they espouse APPEAR to be anti-racist, they
are in fact rather deviously racist in that they enforce the ghetto life
on minorities, perpetuating economic disparities and segregation.

When accused of being racist, they say "I'm not racist, all of my
servants are minorities."

Are you saying I can't make a simple row space?
What about the line break option I saw?

Mike, the current events are getting captured on film.  The reporters 
film themselves under attack.  I see no reason to think that they are 
faking it, or that these are being faked by terrorists to discredit the 
military.  This is especially true since the military doesn't deny the 
events, but agrees they happen and claim that they should happen.

I have not seen any example of this.  The reporters say they are 
traveling in the open in large groups to make it extremely clear that 
they are not hiding.  I doubt anyone would blame the military for a 
hidden reporter who gets shot because of mistaken identity.  This 
happens all the time in war.

It is a Pre-Fone Filter at <www.prefonefilter.com/>.  We love it.  We

It has been on CNN and ABC evening news all week.  The worst example was 
the group of reporters who showed up to cover the Arafat meeting.  They 
suddenly were hit with stun grenades, gunfire, and then a tank was 
turned toward their position.  The reporters actually yelled at the the 
soldiers and asked what they were doing, and they replied that reporters 
are not allowed here.

I think Samantha is exactly right here.  A little history shows that my 
"proposal" is the way things used to be.  As people conjectured, the 
police never did seem to get around to arresting their own.  The courts 
therefore ruled such evidence as inadmissible as a way to keep the 
police honest.  They reasoned that the consistent use of unfair evidence 
gathering and the consistent refusal to punish those (on the police 
side) who broke the law constituted unfair search and seizure.  They 
declared that this was in violation.

This is a typical example of why those who don't know history are doomed 
to repeat it.  I "proposed" a solution that had already been tried.  It 
apparently had already failed in the exact way that Samantha and others 
proposed.  A little research on my part showed that.  I now believe that 
my "new" idea will not work, because it already failed in the past.  I 
can think of no better solution to make people follow the rules than to 
deny them the fruits of their illegal efforts.  This also fits in well 
with some other legal tenets that criminals cannot keep the benefits of 
their crimes.  Police who gather evidence illegally cannot keep it or 
benefit from it.  Although this is a more convoluted and complicated 
system, in the long run it seems to make sense and seems to work better.

Samantha, you and others have convinced me that my proposal is faulty 
and will fail.  I have now changed my mind after a little research.  
Like many ideas, it sounded good on paper, but fails miserably in the 
real world.

This is a straw-man argument.  No one is talking about reporters putting 
soldiers in danger.  We are talking about soldiers trying to cover the 
Arafat meeting being driven away under gunfire.  There was no enemy or 
battle going on.  Israel knows where Arafat lives.  There was no danger 
of any kind.  Except the danger of reporters putting Israel in a bad 
light.

All of these other stories of traitors, spies, mistaken identity, etc. 
are fictional examples that might justify the military action, but have 
nothing to do with the current debate.

Oh come on spike, how do you know that's the *real* Lee Corbin?
I mean after all anyone can join the list and claim that they
are Lee Corbin.  For that matter, I assert that at least 57%
of the content posted by Robert Bradbury over the last 4
months has been created by 17,129 monkeys sitting in a monastery
high in the Himalayas run through a pattern matching filter
that selects only those messages that in some way resemble
content that I've posted to the list since 1999.

Furthermore, I have it on good authority that Damien dropped
off the list last fall to focus on writing a new book.
It figures a prominent Australian molecular biologist who
in the process of attempting to use gene therapies to
extend the lifespan of mice discovers that the upregulation
of a certain gene produces mice that dig rap music.
(The dancing gerbil on the Blockbuster Video commercial
comes to mind.)  Said researcher immediately dropped
his longevity research and contracted (under the table
of course) to the RIAA to develop the gene therapy
for covert use on humans.

I'm not sure who has been filling in for Damien since
then, one can only speculate.

Robert

I don't see how this is on topic.  Nobody is claiming that camoflage is

Every news organization seems to be biased toward their political 
viewpoint.  Some are merely slanted, whereas others seem to deliberately 
manufacture the news.  However, I do not believe that they are all 
coordinated into a single conspiracy.  I believe that anybody can get 
the truth if they want to.  Those who latch on to their one slanted news 
source do so because it agrees with their own slant.

This took place in the middle of a war, most certainly a battle,
and Arafat is indeed the enemy.

I was discussing this in the context of reporters trying to follow
Israeli troops around during the West Bank actions, so this
argument is no straw-man.

As to Arafats compound, the Israelis told the press it was a closed
military zone, this means use of deadly force authorized, and the
press chose to try and ignore it.

The Israelis used considerable discretion in running the reporters
off.

Despite their insistance to the contrary the press didn't belong
there, and the Israelis broke no law.

In conducting sensitive operations even on a military base we'd put
a 2000' warning line out clearly marked:

                            Warning:
                       Use of Deadly Force
                           Authorized

Responsibility merely describes the causal relationships between a person

prevailing convention (which of course could change), B is not guilty of

Even police officers and judges are responsible for their deeds and so are 
politicians and soldiers. They get absolution for it from their society as

are still responsible. A cop who kills a criminal is still a killer, a 
soldier who kill an "enemy" is still a killer. He personally is responsible 
for pulling the trigger or dropping the bomb.

This position is clearly outside the humanist philosophy, preventive 
killing of potential(!) criminals or even their relatives. Think about it: 
you and your family executed, because your brother is a political 
extremist.

### If my brother was the Unabomber, I would call the FBI, just like Mr
Kaczynski did when he read his brother's manifesto. If I knew that my family
member planned to kill innocent people, I'd rather kill him myself than be
sullied by his act. Those who boast about their brother or sister being a
suicide bomber, and take the 25 000$ reward from Saddam Hussein, are forever
tainted by the blood spilled in their name, and as a last resort can be
targeted, if needed to stop others from even greater atrocities. 
----- 

 This is the policy of fascist or other extremist "state over 
people" regimes. It's also military thinking, to calculate human beings 
like cattle without rights and dignity - collateral damage means dead 
innocent people. As I've said: there is no civilization in war. And it 
doesn't relieve soldiers or politicians - or you - of their guilt and 
responsibility.

### I recognize no rights and no dignity in the guilty ones - they gave it
away by murdering innocents, or actively supporting such acts. Sure, it's
just my private attitude, but then so is yours. The main difference is that
adoption of your ideas will mean a lot more dead innocent people, with their
murderers happily enjoying their "rights" and "dignity".

Declan,

This might be something that both you and the Politech list would be 
interested in:

My predecessor at Reason, Virginia Postrel, has founded a network called 
the Franklin Society, whose current project is an pro-therapeutic cloning 
petition. As you know, George W. Bush is urging the Senate to follow the 
House of Representative's lead and ban all human cloning, so the time to 
speak is now.

The document is online at 
<http://www.franklinsociety.org/petition.html>http://www.franklinsociety.org/petition.<http://www.franklinsociety.org/petition.html>html

I encourage you to check it out and add your name to the list, and to the 
network, too.

Thanks,

Nick

That's way too fuzzy. It depends almost entirely upon the definition
of reprehensible. I define crime as a non-defensive act that deprives
others of their health, freedom, or property, where "act" can include
planning, conspiring, or failing to report evidence of a crime.

### I would roughly agree with you what "crime" means, in a specific
libertarian context, where human wishes to live, to know and to be free are
paramount. However, aside from our private beliefs, the concept of crime has
a more general meaning, applicable to any society, and that is the meaning I
defined above.

I don't think crime should be so subjective. One shouldn't have to
take a poll to determine if some act was criminal--if it meets the
definition, it's a crime.

### There is a town in the US where eating garlic before having sex is a
crime. In Incan Peru, priests flayed the POW's and danced wearing their
skins. Probably both of us would agree which one should be a crime in the
society where we wield power (because we are similar), but then in faraway
places strangers will insist on their own definitions.

How about rehabilition and prevention? Incarceration serves not only
to punish the offender and possibly deter other would-be offenders,
but also to reduce the risk to the public from a likely repeat
offender. And, of course, rehabilitation would also reduce the risk to
the public.

### I am all for it. Even bad people should be given a chance.

----

Revenge should not be part of crime and punishment, in my opinion.
It's emotional, not rational.

### But it does a good job - it helps scare the would-be molesters from
molesting, and the would-be thieves from thieving.

Warning: slippery slope. This same argument can be used to rationalize
the prosecution of innocents, which should *never* be acceptable.
Preventing injustice is as important as delivering justice, if not
more so.

### Agreed. It's much better to have a high-quality legal system, which can
precisely target the correct persons, rather than rely on blunt force
applied against whole populations. But if no legal system exists, this might
be your last recourse. Mutually Assured Destruction (which saved the world)
was exactly this kind of situation - targeting of whole cities full of
innocent people just to inconvenience the few bad ones among them.

--------
Further up the slippery slope. Regardless of whether it's effective or
not, innocent associates of a criminal must not be punished.

### Say, there is a bad guy with a nuke. He doesn't care about his own life
but does love his mother. Will you say "You nuke the city, I kill your mama"
or just wait for the shockwave? What if you know there are lots more
family-loving guys getting their nukes ready?

-----

> The threat of being the target of punitive action may induce family
> members to exert control over their relatives.

If relatives were aware of a criminal's actions but didn't report
them, they're guilty of a different crime.

### Yes, exactly. They are guilty too, especially if they accept Saddam's
money.

-----

In such cases, punishment should probably be delayed. It's not OK to
nuke the city block where you know the convicted murderer is hiding.
Of course, if you're talking about less direct damage such as that
caused by incarcerating a head-of-household, thereby causing financial
hardship to the family, then I'd agree that it's necessary.

### Agreed.
-----

> As long as the number of collateral damage victims is significantly

> crimes, the action is acceptable.

I could see shooting down a jumbo jet bearing down on a key target,
but in most cases, collateral damage should be unacceptable. Raise
your hand if you're willing to be collateral damage.

### <raising my hand> Yes, if I have to choose between a 1/3 chance of being
the target of unopposed violent crime (as in some savage South American
tribes), and a 1/1000 chance of being shot accidentally by cops fighting
bank robbers, I take the latter. You can't have perfect goodness, and
absolute security, but you can reduce total risk, sometimes at the cost of
another, but smaller risk.

-----

No, that's just state-sponsored crime. Of *course* there are other
ways to stop suicide bombers.

### Such as?

-----

> Long-term effects on the survival of innocent persons are

The ends justify the means? That sounds great in theory, but in
practise it's not that straightforward. In theory, you can easily
tally up the numbers of innocent victims that would result from
various actions. In practice there'd be lots of guesswork, and
probably lots of wrong guesses. I don't get a particulary good feeling
about trusting the typical elected official to make such decisions
wisely.

### I fully agree with you. In practice we should err on the side of
caution. Only if you are *absolutely* sure that there is no other way you
may agree to an action with substantial risk of collateral damage.

Rafal

Pancritically seeking clarity, not controversy:

OK, but I am asking for a policy statement that any reporters are to be
killed.

I can't tell from your description exactly what the gunfire was: warning
shots, "rubber bullets", or what. I do know that flash-bangs are far from
harmless, and I don't dispute they should only be used against concentrations
of presumed unfriendlies.

It does sound as if the Israelis are, at a minimum, treating concentrations of
people who are acting like news teams as one might expect rioters or threats
to the peace to be treated. 

So far, I deduce it is because they don't want wolves (Hamas, suicide bombers,
etc.) among the lambs, and the lambs refuse to get the message and go back to
the pen. You figure it is because they want to cover up other atrocities? Or
that it automatically counts as an atrocity on its face?

Does this state something like our respective positions correctly?

I'm not familiar with Israeli law. If something resembling martial law is in
effect in the areas in question, I would not be surprised if in fact the
actions of the Israeli forces you describe above were 100% legal, especially
use of "nonlethals" (so called--more accurately "not optimized for lethality")
like concussion grenades or plastic projectiles. Not defending that, but not
sure that it qualifies as an atrocity on its face.

Atrocities by military forces are routine.  Their
discovery is rare, and punishment even rarer. 
Certainly, for the effective completion of any
legitimate mission, and for the safety of the soldiers
conducting themselves lawfully, there is a case to be
made for secrecy in the conduct of military
activities.  I for one want to swarm the planet with
independent internationally-unlimited "all-press"
observer drones.  If it inconveniences the military,
so be it.  In balance, the world's gonna be a better
place.

I've got a better idea... let's not do that.  Partisan
US politics don't really belong on this list and I for
one will not be drawn into a debate about which flavor
of statists is worse.

Politics isn't going to solve poverty, crime, racism,
hunger, homelessness, illegal imigration, violence,
drug usage or any other real or imagined ill in our
current society.

Superabundance will solve most of thst (and create
it's own problems) so lets ignore the partisan
politics unless they impact on our striving for
perpetual progress... 

Deal?

That is a mistatement of what I said.

They are racist because they choose to place heavy
emphasis on race.

In a trunshumanist world view, race is unimportant...

They call it "enlightenment" to worry that dumb black
folk will outbreed smart white folk... and thus
decrease the overall intelligence of humans.  I am not
at all sure of their sources, but even if their
sources are 100% accurate, breeding by the traditional
method isn't what will determine the intelligence
of whatever humans become in the next 100 years.

So yeah... they are wrong, even if they are right (and
I wouldn't bet on their being right), but not because
of any "big brother" super statist meme... but because
they are letting their monkey brains overcome their
intelligence.

It has nothing to do with "PC" and everything to do
with misplaced energy and effort.

Dear Extropes,

In the process of digging through some U.S. INS legal definitions, I
heard a story regarding Kurt Gödel's bid for U.S. citizenship.
Hilarious, and true.

Gödel, at the time at Princeton, was convinced by Einstein to become
a U.S citizen.  So he applied for U.S. citizenship. For the required
examination, Gödel studied the U.S. Constitution and several other
texts for a week. Einstein and O. Morgenstern were sponsors for the
citizenship.

On the day before the interview, Gödel told Morgenstern that he had
discovered a logical-legal possibility of transforming the United
States into a dictatorship. Morgenstern saw that the hypothetical
possibility and its likely remedy involved a complex chain of
reasoning and was clearly not suitable for consideration at the
interview. He urged Gödel to keep quiet about his discovery.

Ah well... not to be. The official in charge at the office in
Trenton was Judge Philip Forman, who had inducted Einstein in 1940
and struck up a friendship with him. He greeted them warmly and
invited them both to attend the (normally private) examination of
Gödel.

The judge began, 'You have German citizenship up to now.' Gödel
interrupted him, 'Excuse me sir, Austrian.' 'Anyhow, the wicked
dictator! but fortunately that is not possible in America.' 'On the
contrary,' Gödel interjected, 'I know how that can happen.' The
judge, however, indicated that he was not interested, and Einstein
and Morgenstern succeeded in quieting the examinee down. A few
months later, Gödel took his oath of citizenship.

What was the logical flaw that Gödel saw? It's not known for sure,
but you can learn more here:

They were given plenty of warning, they were told deliberately not
to come, but they did anyway.

I was surfing through channels the other day when I stopped on
MSNBC, I watched how Ashleigh Banfield was explaining how even
though they had been told to stay away they were about to try to
get into the areas anyway.

They were sticking tape all over themselves and their vehicles
spelling out T.V. like it would somehow save them.

If I was a terrorist watching, I'd lean over to my men and say

" Get some tape..."

Greetings from South America.

Dear Brian:
Following your reasoning, I guess suspicion would be a valid reason to shot
someone.
It may sound corky, but my country went through two decades of killing and
violence just because the state suspected you were a possible "terrorist";
so, as a result of what I experienced here, I don't think suspicion is a
valid basis to conduct any business. Not even war against terrorism.

By the way, the joke about the NY police, seems to fit perfectly to your
staement: "Shoot first, ask later".

Do not despair in my case, Samantha. I chew, chisel , gnaw through all
manner of philosopher-speak as best I can. There are gems buried between all
the retentive categorisations. An example: "Meaning and Representation" by
Cummins. Up to his armpits in categorisations until about 3/4 of the way
through. At least Cummins managed to make it only a couple of hundred pages.

I find it really hard to adopt the categorisations, follow the reasoning in
real/reasonable-time and then re-code it from my own perspective so that it
maps onto my AI ideas. I'm just a bit thick I suppose. The thing is I could
get there with a <10 pages of nice diagrams. It's when I realise this fact
that I get a bit edgy.

What I also find I am getting better at is real-time-skim-to-juicy-bits and
see if the categorisations and historical thought calibrations I skimmed get
in the way.  I also try to get the work recommended in some way. Because I
value my time so highly, I get really agro when I follow tantalising tidbit
into the waffle zone. Unfortunately there seems to be far more waffle than
juicy bits, which is what seems to irritate more than just me, if you go by
the critical zeal in the thread.

speaking of waffle....I hope I haven't wasted your time waffling you to this
point.

cheers

Colin

LOS ALAMOS, N.M., April 9, 2002 -- Researchers at the U.S. Department of
Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory are studying a simple, cost
effective method for extracting carbon dioxide directly from the air 
which
could allow sustained use of fossil fuels while avoiding potential
global
climate change.

The method would allow researchers to harvest carbon dioxide from the
air,
reducing buildup of the so-called "greenhouse gas" in the atmosphere and
allowing it to be converted into fuel. A Los Alamos-led research team
today
presented the topic at the 223rd annual meeting of the American Chemical
Society in Orlando, Fla.

"Fossil fuel supplies are plentiful, and what will limit the usage of
fossil
fuels is the potential climatic and ecosystem changes you may see as a
result of rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere," said Los Alamos
researcher
Manvendra Dubey. "If you can capture atmospheric carbon dioxide, then
you
limit the environmental impact of fossil fuels and you can continue to
use
them. We have come up with a way to capture and sequester the carbon
dioxide
that we are putting in the atmosphere. Our approach is particularly well
suited to capturing CO2 from numerous small sources such as automobiles
that
are largely being ignored."

While many scientists are working on capturing or sequestering carbon,
Dubey
and his colleagues' method differs because it works on a dilute stream
of
CO2 in the atmosphere as opposed to capturing more concentrated forms
found
in power plant exhausts. The method uses ordinary air with its average
carbon dioxide concentration of about 370 parts per million.

It utilizes the wind and natural atmospheric mixing to transport CO2 to
a
removal site, and it is the only means available to capture CO2
generated
from transportation sources and small, dispersed sources that account
for
nearly half of all carbon dioxide emissions.

The air is passed over an extraction agent, for example a solution of
quicklime, the active agent in some cement. As the air passes over the
extraction structure, the carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the
quicklime and becomes converted to calcium carbonate (limestone), a
solid
that forms and falls to the bottom of the extractor.

The calcium carbonate is then heated to yield pure carbon dioxide and
quicklime, which is recycled back into the extractor. The purified and
liberated carbon dioxide can then be sequestered as a gas by direct
injection into the ground or it could be reacted with minerals to form a
solid. Carbon dioxide gas also can be sold commercially to the
petrochemical
industry, which uses large quantities of it to extract fossil fuels. Of
course, because the process uses existing air, it does not need to be
located near any particular elevated source of carbon dioxide. It
captures
carbon dioxide from all sources by harnessing wind as a no-cost
transportation vector.

"The carbon dioxide comes to the facility on its own," Dubey said. "And
because treated air is discharged, the overall concentration of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere gradually decreases over time. Using this
method
on a large enough scale, it may be possible to return atmospheric carbon
dioxide levels to pre-Industrial-Age concentrations. Given the
possibility
our climate system can change abruptly, this possibility is very
exciting."

Cost of the entire process is equivalent to about 20 cents per gallon of
gasoline  a nominal cost when one considers the recent price
fluctuations
at gasoline pumps across the nation, Dubey said.

A typical extraction facility that could extract all current carbon
dioxide
emissions would require only an area of one square yard per person in
the
developed world. A facility of sufficient size could be located in arid
regions, since discharged air that is deficient in carbon dioxide could
have
consequences on nearby plant life.

Large expanses of desert would not be affected by the CO2 deficit
however,
and could provide the wide-open spaces necessary both for the facility
and
to allow the discharged air to become well mixed with the atmosphere
again.

The next step for Dubey and his colleagues is to use intense computer
models
to optimize the configuration of the extractor as well as design
alternative
chemicals for extraction.

Dubey's research colleagues include Hans Ziock, Scott Elliott and
William S.
Smith of Los Alamos; Klaus Lackner, formerly of Los Alamos and now also
at
Columbia University; and Pat Grimes of Grimes Associates of Scotch
Plains,
N.J.

Los Alamos National Laboratory is operated by the University of
California
for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S.
Department of Energy and works in partnership with NNSA's Sandia and
Lawrence Livermore national laboratories to support NNSA in its mission.

Los Alamos enhances global security by ensuring the safety and
reliability
of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, developing technologies to reduce threats
from weapons of mass destruction, and solving problems related to
energy,
environment, infrastructure, health and national security concerns.

When I was reading how they were proposing to do the extraction, one
rather obvious kink popped into mind:  How are they going to power the
extraction process?  The process they are talking about will result in a
rather vast net consumption of energy, most of which is currently
generated by fossil fuels.  You would need nukes or similar to make it effective.

Maybe you can get Mommies Against Nukes to sign off on it if you explain
that it is "for the environment/stops global warming".  But then, why
not just eliminate the middleman and use nuke power to begin with; you
can just tell them you are removing the CO2 from the air, when you are
really "removing it" by not generating it to begin with.

Welp, that's the claim. One could hide an elephant in ir. Infrastructure,
system scaling, disposal of the eventual sludge (which is at best a salt)...
Remember "electricity too cheap to measure". And remember that cars are not
the predominant cause of CO2 emissions.

A more interesting question is "What does it cost per ton of coal?"

<shrugs>  Legilslative laws are not formal logical laws, no matter how
much people want them to be.  President Bush could, if he wanted to,
enact martial law on the entire USA and force passage of a
constitutional amendment that declared him dictator for life - *if* the
only laws were logic, meaning one could do anything the letter of the
law permitted.

Those who wrote the Constitution and set up the USA's basic institutions
were well aware of that possibility, however, and took steps to not only
make such measures practically impossible, but also make sure such a
reign would soon be cut short in favor of a return to business as normal
- most notably, make sure the stakeholders with guns know they have a
vested interest in keeping the country free.  That being the case, were
he to seriously try such a thing, Bush would likely find himself
arrested for treason within a month...

Just because something's legal doesn't mean you can get away with it in
real life.  It just removes one (usually serious, granted) obstacle to
doing so.

Thanks.  I was hoping someone knowledgable would swat my bio-ignoramous
gleanings.  Two ideas/questions: Could metabolism be more efficient
rather than lower?  Could lower metabolism be an effect of CR, but not
a/the life extension mechanism?  Human metabolism varies quite a bit
among individuals (and individuals "practicing CR", though there's no
rigorous definition that), but I haven't heard of any correlation with
longevity.

Many situtations around the world _could_ turn out to be important. 
Most don't.  Not all are bad.  Some very encouraging news from Senegal,
the westernmost country in Africa:

<http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/10/international/africa/10WADE.html>

    "I've never seen a country develop itself through aid or credit,"
    said Mr. Wade, who was trained as an economist in Senegal and at the
    Sorbonne. "Countries that have developed  in Europe, America,
    Japan, Asian countries like Taiwan, Korea and Singapore  have all
    believed in free markets. There is no mystery there. Africa took the
    wrong road after independence."
    
    Most of Africa's post-independence leaders believed in strong
    federal governments and vaguely socialist economic policies. In
    Senegal, Mr. Wade was known as the only intellectual of his
    generation to be staunchly anti-socialist and a strong supporter of
    a free-market economy. He was a pan-Africanist, believing as the
    revered Ghanaian statesman Kwame Nkrumah did in the eventual unity
    of Africa  but a capitalist one.

Wade is now president of Senegal after decades in opposition and has
emerged as one of the three most prominent African leaders on the world
stage.  In the runup to Wade's election I recall reading (probably in
the Economist) that Senegal is one of the few or perhaps only African
country with an effective independent judiciary.

The emergence of one or more "tiger" economies in Africa would be a
major boon to the world economy and totally unexpected in most
quarters.  It can happen:  South Korea was poorer than most African
countries immediately after the Korean war.  Singapore's first
paternalistic leader originally stated a goal of emulating Sri Lanka's
success.

Senegal is also the location of Touba, a city run by an Islamic sect
entirely on donations.  See the article "No Politics Here, Thank You"
from the 2000.02.26 Economist (no free online copy).

Protecting you and I from the State rummaging through our 
property and removing any and all privacy whenever the bloody 
well feel like it is NOT a "technicality"!

Punishment is not the only or most important thing either.  It 
is certainly not more important than the very freedom to live 
our lives in peace and security that we cherish.  Criminals are 
not the only jeopardy to our security.  Government intrusion is 
a larger jeopardy and much more difficult to defend against.

For real crime (not breaking braindead laws that should never 
have been passed) finding the causes of criminal behavior and 
removing whichever ones are reasonably fixable is every bit as 
important as punishment.  So why are we focusing on surety of 
punishment being such a good as to ignore "technicalities"?

I made it up, in response to discounting of distributed AI because it'd
be S-L-O-W.  So I threw a number out there in an attempt scare up some
thoughts along the lines of "Ok, distributed AI running over existing
networks can't happen, but if speed is the issue, at some point our
networks are no longer too S-L-O-W.  What is that point?"

I see software ("what we are able to do with [hardware]") as by far the
biggest challenge, one reason I don't think protesting that current
hardware is too slow is very useful.  If we had hardware 1000x faster
than current hardware right now what could we do with it (along a
critical path to AI) that we _can't_ do with current hardware.  NB: we
now have hardware 1000x faster than that available during the mid-80s AI
hypelet.

When I was reading how they were proposing to do the extraction, one
rather obvious kink popped into mind:  How are they going to power the
extraction process?  The process they are talking about will result in a
rather vast net consumption of energy, most of which is currently
generated by fossil fuels.

Maybe you can get Mommies Against Nukes to sign off on it if you explain
that it is "for the environment/stops global warming".  But then, why
not just eliminate the middleman and use nuke power to begin with; you
can just tell them you are removing the CO2 from the air, when you are
really "removing it" by not generating it to begin with.

Isn't this the same as the article in SCIAM some time back? (couldn't find
it). The idea was you build the equivalent of forests using pseudo trees
that maximise the exposure area to the atmosphere. It is possible to out-do
trees in this regard. According to that article, quite a small forest could
scrub the air for the whole planet. Really neat. Why aren't we doing it
already!

BTW. I checked out the BBS.......... you seem to be the most prodigious
poster!
close to 7000 posts!!! Have you managed to squeeze a life in betwen them
all?

Found it! FYI

Surely if you were a bit clever about what is used to power the beast it
becomes a nice neat relatively closed system solution. I want the Aussie

What usually happens, when the thugs in blue can't
easilly stumble across necessary evidence, is that the
illegal means are used and then either some other
source for the evidence is claimed or invented, or
charges are piled on, intimidating the victim into
copping a plea.  The recent news - this past week -
out of Texas, where hundreds of innocent Mexican
nationals were apparently frightened into pleading to
crimes they never committed, is really not that
unusual.  You've never experienced it?  RU by any
chance white? ... affluent?

Of course, the recent Supreme Court decisions re
search and seizure have pretty well opened the barn
doors for every horse of police intimidation and
terror, so that, who knows?, much of the illegal
manufacturing of evidence may foregone as it is so
easy to justify going through anyone's possessions now
with a fine-tooth comb.

Around my private office in Santa Ana, vandalism is
virtually an everyday affair, and stripped vehicles
are dumped by the local car thieves in the back
parking lot every so often.  Naturally, I park my
motorcycle on the concrete landing right in front of
my door.  Even so, it - or its predecessor - has been
knocked over or otherwise vandalized on average about
every couple months over the past ten years.

Not only are the cops of no use whatsoever in stopping
this, but now these useless jerks are starting to yell
at me to get my bike off the sidewalk as I'm moving it
to the street.  I've already gotten one ticket for a
brief period when we had high winds locally and I laid
the bike down deliberately across my steps to keep it
from being blown over.

Only a couple inches of the bike projected over the
wide sidewalk, and the foot traffic is very light, but
I was ticketed nonetheless.  However, I suspect that
this latest round of harrassment - suddenly cops are
circling the building through the parking lot and
pointedly studying my every move as I shoot the bull
with my printer neighbor from an adjoining unit - is
probably due to something else.

I contacted a friend who is an avid Green last week. 
In fact, she was listed as one of the ten most
dangerous people in Orange County a few years back by
the irreverent "OC Weekly."  My reason for contacting
her was not political, but I gave her my various
addresses, and last weekend solicitations from
organizations like "Doctors Without Borders" showed up
in my box at Anthony L. Hargis & Co., a free market
trust offering accounts in gold, similar to a bank.

Paranoia?  Maybe that's a good idea.  Check out
thelaw.com and their story on mail cover.  Seems that
the bludgies have stepped up their reading and
collating of addresses - to and from - off your mail.

ALH&Co, BTW, has been in business for 27 years with
hundreds of libertarian and patriot customers
worldwide, and has successful defeated the BATF and
IRS repeatedly.  So, here I am, a known troublemaker,
receiving letters from subversive organizations like
Doctors.. and the organization fighting child sexual
slavery, etc., at the headquarters of a major thorn in
the bludgies side.  I expect that my van will be towed
and impounded again on some pretext next, and then
maybe the Fire Dept. will decide to "inspect," etc.
before this is over.

Pass enough laws and remove all the oversight and this
is what you get.

This would probably be useful if we had a very powerful, cheap, 
non-portable method of generating energy, like Tokamak fusion, and still 
don't have good enough batteries for electrical cars and such.  Removing 
CO2 from the atmosphere could be worthwhile, but I don't see it being made 
into fossil fuel in any other scenario.

Yes, but Aussie winds mostly blow W to E, and E is where most of the crops
are grown. They won't be happy with less CO2.

Luckily, the world will now be able to put vast CO2 reclamation plants in
the deserts of the Middle East. Oh, wait.

Ahh. OK so you didn't find that old story amusing. I must have
a warped sense of humor. Goedel's approach to life is so ... Goedel.

BTW, (seriously  now) has anyone here taken a look lately at the INS
definition of domicile? Some things changed in 1997. A large class
of US citizens living abroad with their families would not be
permitted to bring their (nonUS citizen) spouse and children to
live with them in the U.S. based on the current domicile rules. They
are effectively in exile (perhaps are not even aware of that fact).

"Domicile" is a dicey issue, more determined case by case.  It's a
wrong assumption to think that being born in the U.S. and/or
spending most of your life in the U.S. automatically gives you legal
status to have your (nonUS citiizen) spouse and children live with
you in the U.S. If you are a U.S. citizen living abroad and
building your life outside of the U.S., you should probably be aware
of INS domicile definition(s).

See: INS Meaning(s) of domicile.

[One aspect I found interesting was the section
"In the employment of"]

And: Lynne Marie Stockman's case (I learned about this
domicile issue from her)

Plants may be stoo-pid but Mr. Lorrey's article is top-notch. It seems to me 
that this technology might be adapted to extract heavy oil from already 
existing well in the USA. I am talking Tertiary type oil, which exists as oil 
contaminated by sulfer and metalic particulates. One essential recovery 
method is to use CO² as a super-critical fluid to extract this petroleum. 
Also any CO² released in such a process could immediately be recycled. This 
may also free-up Oil Shale which exists in the tera-barrel range in the 
Western USA.

In other words, even if they prove their theories right, they are still 
racists.  Even if racist theories are proven correct, they would still 
be called racist theories.

Many people make this logical fallacy:

1.  Belief in idea "A" is "racist"
2.  "Racist" ideas are "wrong"
3.  Idea "B" is not "wrong"
4.  Therefore, idea "B" is not "racist"

This is faulty logic.  The conclusion is not supportable by logic.  
Truth is not a defence to point 1.  Truth would be a defense of point 
2.  That is, racists can argue that racism is correct.  It is silly to 
argue that they aren't racist.  That would be like Darwin arguing that 
evolution is really religion because its "right."

Yeah, they need more political clout.....not! They hand us the oil to screw
up the air with and then charge us to clean up the air? What a deal!!!

I was actually thinking mid WA, around Wiluna. I bet the CSIRO could provide
air remix stats for points east of there (where there is serious nothing  -
I know - I lived out there once)that would calm the skeptic (+ put CO2
monitoring at misc weather stations and use it to to closed loop control of
the reaction rates based on a weather model).

If you could set it up as a prototype that allowed it to produce the raw
materials to construct more of itself, then you could kind of 'grow it', one
truckload of quicklime at a time over years. After all, most of it would be
a 3D system of fluid channels - yes? A nice fractal layout could put a
delivery/receival node in a nice single central location and allow control
of flow rates throught the system. Put in a gas link to the NW shelf
oilfields for the re-processing or dual it an put CO2 in there an back feed
reserves to ships or whatever......seems plausible.

I'd love someone to pay me to do a feasibility study....any offers out
there???? I'm cheap? anybody...? ...oh, well.

I guess I am missing some major point here.  Why does advance warning 
give them the right to murder unarmed civilians?  Has the Geneva 
Convention or War Crimes treaties suddenly changed when I wasn't looking?

There are specific rules of engagement that are defined and recognized 
by civilized countries.  You can't shoot non-combatants.  You can't 
shoot unarmed people.  You can't shoot people who surrendered.  You 
can't shoot people that you have not declared war against.  You can't 
shoot reporters, medical personnel, relief efforts, or other non-engaged 
parties.

Do extropians really support the death penalty for disobeying a news 
blackout?  Do extropians really support monopoly sources of information 
in any situation?  Do extropians really support armed agents of state 
governments?  I am really surprised at the response I am getting here.  
It is not at all what I would have expected.

The UI is unusable. We don't have searchable hypermail list archives

In case we don't, I'll be happy to set them up, provided somebody points

There is a big difference between white pride and white supremacy.  Most 
white pride groups actually preach white supremacy.  Very few black 
pride groups actually preach black supremacy.

Most black pride groups are merely trying to prove that blacks are as 
good as whites.  I don't know of any white pride groups that are trying 
to prove that whites are as good as blacks.

You are seeing statistical racial profiling at its worst.  If most white 
pride groups are really white supremacists, some people will assume they 
all are.  If most black pride groups are equal rights groups, some 
people will assume they all are.

We have two bottlenecks: hardware, and what we can do with it. If there's
no hardware, we clearly can't do anything. If there is hardware, but no
methods, we don't look too hot, either. Only if there's both we are
golden.

Memory bandwidth went up by 10^3 since 1985? Wow. I must have missed more 
than just WW3.

As to hardware being irrelevant to real-world problem solving, you'll
notice that the top500.org list growth shows no signs of slacking. If I
indeed had a 1000-node cluster in a desktop volume I could go to places I
couldn't with my current setup. If every Jane and Joe had such machines on
the network, I would consider the SI scenario a lot more probable, as at 
least the hardware base would be closer to the requirements.

The first use of a lot of big boxes is to find out how to use them
efficiently. This is a very big, embarassingly parallel task. The more
power you have to burn, the more stupid brute-force approaches we can
afford, as smart approaches are limited by the human resource bottleneck,
which is not getting any wider. Hardware helps a lot here.

You can order crowds to disperse, and if they fail to do so, what?
You can declare a curfew, and if you find people not obeying it, what?

I don't support it, but I'm not convinced it's about a news blackout, nor
about killing reporters. To recap my current impression: from the one
prominent case you've mentioned, it sounds to me like it's about "no crowds of
putatively privileged sheep" in a difficult urban ("MOUT") combat environment.

Gedanken: What would you have said if there had turned out to be a
"TV"-labeled suicide bomber, or a team of them, at the gate at an inopportune
time? I know what the Knesset would have said.

I don't particularly like it, but I don't have enough data to agree with your
assessment of it. This might change.

The story, about Goedel citizenship, is also told
by Solomon Feferman in his biographical essay,
'Gödel's Life and Work' in Solomon Feferman et al.
(eds.), Kurt Gödel: Collected Works, Vol. 1:
Publications 1929-1936, Oxford University Press,
1986, p. 12, and retold by Ed Regis in his
'Who Got Einstein's Office?', Addison-Wesley, 1987,
pp. 57-58. Feferman traces the story to Oskar
Morgenstern's reminiscences as told in Heinz Zemanek,
'Oskar Morgenstern (1902-1977) - Kurt Gödel (1906-1978)'
Elektronische Rechenanlagen, 20 (1978) 209-11, p. 210.

Anyway the story is very amusing and, about the so called
'logica vaga' (vague logic), which applies to legal arguments,
look at:  http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/sec16.htm
which also tells that story.

'Law, unlike science, is concerned not only
with getting the right result but also
with stability, to which it will frequently

And so...so many other people I've known.  It's amusing the first few
times, perhaps, but this is at least the hundredth such case I've heard
of.  (Then again, working as I do at a place that basically makes its
money from lawyers' egos, I've heard a few incidents of those who try to
twist the law to suit their needs, assume it's right and absolutely
enforceable no matter what common sense says 'cause it's the law, only
to be shocked when a judge or jury disagrees with them.  Lately, a lot
of those cases have been corporations, even corporations that think
they've bought laws and thus licenses to bully their competition...)

Sorry.  Short version: it's not you.  It's life.  -_-

If you need to do any reasonably fast, or even as fast as 
neurons propagate information (200hz), exchange of much 
information with systems as far away as the other side of the 
world (or even more than about a thousand miles) then you have 
problems due to speed of light limits.  You might have local 
units and drones that far away but I don't see how you can make 
a mind a million times faster than human minds distributed over 
that kind of area.  But perhaps the flu bug attempting to bite 
me tonight is addling my wits.  What am I missing?

Those scams about not having to pay taxes fall into this category.  The 
people who promulgate them really believe in them and logically argue 
how the law "proves" their case.  They ignore the fact that no lawyer, 
judge, jury, or IRS agent reads the law the same way.

It will be instructive to look up how quicklime is produced. Hint: it is 
not a mineral. It can be recycled, but this is far from being energy 
efficient, and it leaves you none the wiser.

What an idiotic highschool-grade scheme. It non-solves a non-problem.

In my misspent youth I was quite poor and a flower child doing a 
lot of peace protests.  So I saw my share of cops that really 
deserved the word "pig".  Enough that I still get a bit tense 
around them even now that I a model high-tech nerd citizen.

Yes.  And the problem is particularly worrisom for we who have 
much of our knowledge and livelihood tied up in computer 
systems.  Those can be and sometimes are confiscated for 
examination and when they are it is *extremely* difficult to 
reclaim them even when all charges are dropped (if any are 
actually even made).

Aw hell, I get mail from some of these folks too.  And also from 
various Libertarian rags and I've been known to order very odd 
books about dropping out of the system and such.  I can either 
be paranoid and get very weird or brave it out more or less in

Hi - my first post to the list.

I am fairly new to the extropy game and was hoping somone could point me to
any online recources that deal with the green vs technogaian "debate" (on
the side of the technogaians, of course)? I followed a similar thread a few
weeks ago and was looking for more 'flesh'...

replies offlist perhaps???

thanks,
L sid.

Invalid premise, I'm afraid: A "civil war" is anything but "civilized". As 
far as I am informed, every war party in the ME has left the ground of 
"civilized countries".

You can. It's easy. Just forget that those targets are human beings with 
families, children, human rights and human dignity... Just think

OK. I'd better tell the Los Alamos folks that there's no real CO2 emission
problem and that they can all stop work. They'll be pleased you sorted it
out for them. Pity about the years the've spent on it already, though.

Once again, a modern PC system can't handle GBit/s bitrates. Not just
processing, just receiving or sending it will max out the CPU. (Marginally
better architectures could reduce the load considerably, but the basic
problem still stands: current networking to processing capabilities relate
to trying to drink from a waterhose (or, rather, a high-pressure
pipeline)).

Current ballpark figures of residental WANs is 40 kBytes/s (and about 15
ms latency) is sure not GBit rates, but 40 kBytes/s of a tight code
communication is not something that can be shrugged off. 

You can do a lot if you're being smart about the constraints of the
medium. (Inversely, you can piss away orders of magnitude ineffectively if
you're being dumb about it). For instance, Ruediger mentioned the temporal
jitter ruining spiking code precision, which doesn't occur if you put
timing info into the packets (clocks precision is the limiting factor, not
the ping timing distribution), and it doesn't have to be a spiking
encoding on internode comm, if the medium is adverse to it. Spiking codes
don't even map to current computers efficiently, which can do high-speed
arithmetic operations on 32 and 64 bit data types at each clock cycle
essentialy for free (it's a stupid way to use transistors, but since the
architecture is hardwired at the foundry, you have to live with it).

Your hidden assumption is that global communication is required, always.  
This is not true for the biological CNS. Your second hidden assumption is
that the system is a singleton. Instead, it will be most likely a
hierarchical architecture, a swarm intelligence, or a diverse population.

> limits.  You might have local units and drones that far away but I

The problem is not the speed of light, at least not as long as we don't
have purely photonic cut-through networks. Current latency is dominated by
the store-and-forward paradigm. Having this said, mammalian CNS does about
120 m/s vs. 299792458 m/s. That's a size scaling factor of roughly 10^6,
if you can do relativistic speed cut-through.

Hope you'll get better soon.

As to 10^6 speedup, of course you wouldn't want a distributed system. But
we're talking about bootstrap here. The 10^6 speedup is reserved for the
time when the system designs and builds its own hardware, which is a 
distinctly superhuman stage of development.

The problem is usually data, not hardware. Loss of hardware is nasty, but 
not fatal.

It is a good idea to store your data off-site. (A server hidden in the
closet, in the cellar, at the neighbour (WiFi), peering arrangement with
some other parties -- overnight rsync cable modem is your friend, a colo
box somewhere, etc).

For any given hardware requirement it'll be here relatively/predictably
soon, which Moravec and Kurzweil make much hay of.  The path to
removing/widening hardware bottleneck after bottleneck is exceedingly
clear.  AFAICT the path to adequate software is nearly as murky as the

I was referring to cpu speed.  As measured by the STREAM benchmark
memory bandwidth has improved by 10^2, not shabby.  See historical plots

Of course hardware is relevant to real-world problem solving, that's the
economic engine that promotes investment in ever faster computers.  How
much of that hardware is being used to tackle problems on a critical
path towards AI?

Sure, though designing even stupid brute-force approaches isn't a walk
in the park if you're going to do anything other than generate excess
heat.

Okay, I better explain why this thing is bogus. First, it's a nonsolution.  

Quicklime is made by thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate. It's a
low efficiency (since conducted at a high temperature) process, it
consumes (currently, as nuke reactors are not hot enough and solar ovens
is way too expensive, and don't scale) fossil fuels, and it generates
exactly the amount of CO2 it is supposed to bind later, not to count the
Joules you spent roasting it in a hulking big oven. Here's actually a
recipe how to run around, wave you hands, make a lot of noise, and make
the problem actually *worse*. Things would have been different, if they
had figured out a way to enrich and bound atmospheric CO2 with a cheap,
low-energy process (similiar to oxygen enrichment with molecular sieves,
which is bound to take air rectification out of business sooner or later).
But, as soon as they mentioned "quicklime", their fate was sealed.

Here's a solution, for a difference: try to bind atmospheric carbon
dioxide in land biomass (planting and maintaining forest ecologies -- it
looks pretty, and makes nice microclimate, too, and there's timber to be
had there) and sea biomass (e.g. using iron for fertilizer, which allows
you high-productivity aquafarming, or alleviate the overfishing problem).  
Secondly, fill up cavities created during (surface) mining with plant
biomass and seal them up, taking bound CO2 out of circulation. Here's
another solution: use hydrogen rich fuel, such as methane, resulting the %
of CO2 produced by Joule burned. Here's another: don't burn at all, but
use fuel cells, not Carnot processes.  Here's another: use photovoltaics,
and solar hydrogen. Here's another: save energy, by using it more
efficiently (Gosh, whodathunkit?). There are others, but this short list 
will do.

Why is that a nonproblem? 

Even if the worst happens, and the Antarctic melts (not exactly overnight,
though, last time it happened it took 0.5 kYears), and the sea level goes
up by 20-something meters, and even if there's a frigging climate flip,
putting further heavy casualties amongst reinsurers, this is not something
which will even hurt us badly. And energy production landscape *will* look
lots different in 30-40 years, delaying the problem further. I'm not a big
Singularity believer, but things will look up lots different by the time
the Dutch and most of Oceania get seriously wet feet. (I wouldn't invest
in seafront property, either, but then, that's always a lousy investment).

Yes and yes. Doesn't need to be anything like an individual human
intelligence, doesn't need to start out faster.  If it can self-improve
over relatively unconstrained domains we've got something very special.

The technically naive public tends to assume that integration density and
switching speed automatically translates into performance, specifically
all-purpose performance. Unfortunately, the naive public is mistaken. The
only true way to find out is running a benchmark, and the only really
relevant benchmark is your code. (Strangely, you won't see this basic fact
mentioned on glossy marketing brochures selling the latest and greatest in
hardware).

The hardware path is pretty clear, unfortunately the architectural baggage
prevents us from significant progresses on it. Recent narrow margins
(earmarks of a mature industry), and high and rising prototyping costs
result in a pronounced risk aversion in R&D. I don't see this changing
until we abandon photolithography, and turn to self-assembling molecular
devices. We *might* get cellular hardware before, though. And we will 
certainly get embedded memory.

The software path is somewhat less clear, but here the orthodoxy is even
more stifling. (It's a mature industry indeed, the smell is at times
overpowering).

Okay, let's see why benchmarks don't translate into real-world all purpose
performance. STREAM does the following four tests:

``Copy'' measures transfer rates in the absence of arithmetic.
``Scale'' adds a simple arithmetic operation.
``Sum'' adds a third operand to allow multiple load/store ports on vector 
  machines to be tested.
``Triad'' allows chained/overlapped/fused multiply/add operations.
  
As the name implies, it is a streaming benchmark. It streams through
memory in sequential order. As such, it measures and exercises one aspect
of the memory subystem. In mid-80s, RAM was RAM, as access latency was
flat across address space, regardless of access pattern. This is lots 
different now.

In terms of access latency, it was ballpark 120 ns then, and it's ballpark
50 ns now (the costs for an access might have actually increased, because
of elaborate mechanisms in the CPU, the memory interface, and within the
memory itself). That's a factor of two, and since we've got broder buses
now (a factor of eight), all I see is a factor of 16 for nonstreaming
memory access. Which is obviously not 100. It would be actually
interesting to write a NONSTREAM benchmark, and to run it on a number of
systems, vintage and modern. I think the results would be surprisingly 
dismal, because so much hardware must be engaged before you can get at the 
contents of a remote memory location.

Not much. And partly, it's a good thing. Insect-grade AI would do *lots* 
for industrial automation, though, including self-replicating systems, 
which ramp up very quickly, and are very cheap.

yes, but what kind of problem would generate close to zero contiguous
access?  most problems have some locality, and in that case you'll get
cache hits, and cache access takes a couple of clock-cycles (3-4 ns). 
Note also that since cache sizes nowadays are almost as big as main
memory was a decade and a half ago, for problems that would have fit in
main memory then, you'll probably get quite a large memory bandwith
gain, even in problems requiring random access patterns.  The picture is
even more favourable for modern cpus if you consider that while memory
access was a relatively fast 120ns back then, the CPU couldn't handle it
that fast. eg the 8088 would take 5 to 12 clockcycles to access memory
which at 4Mhz translates to at least 1.2 microsecs, and that, as you
mentioned, for only 8 bits.  So in the nonstream benchmark, i'd guess
that an Athlon 1.4 Ghz would be at least 100 times faster than an
8088@4Mhz.

You are missing at least one major point, the Geneva convention
does not apply here. The current Israeli war is probably the most
humane in history.

Who was murdered? We could do without the rhetoric.

You cannot approach a closed military zone without permission, if
you do you can be shot. As I've already said the Geneva convention
does not apply here. Reporters do not have rights in military
zones.

Who was killed? What news blackout? What death penalty? This isn't
a criminal case.

No, but existing networks do.

For now I do YMMV.

This is really just a simple case. The Israelis are at war and
declared Arafats compound a closed military zone. Reporters decided
to ignore the Israelis warning, acting as if they had some right to
intrude, which they did not. The Israelis humanely chased them off
with stun grenades and rubber bullets.

They'll (the reporters) know better next time.

Sure.  There seem to be indications that when electron
transport chain in the mitochondria gets overloaded,
i.e. blocked in the downstream components because
they are already "working", that the upstream components
may start to produce more free radicals.

So a more "efficient" metabolism is one where the
overall flux never overloads the chain.  I.e. when
you have to hand off your "product" to someone there
is always someone available to take it.

In contrast a "lower" metabolism is one where the
overall transport of energy through the system is
less.  What would really seem to matter is the
electron flux/protein.  You could make it more
efficient by simply having more mitochondria
available so that there is a lower probability
that individual mitochondria will develop traffic
jams that lead to free radical production.  Of
course since the production and breakdown of
mitochondria consumes energy there has to be
"optimal" production point in this system.

Perhaps, but things seem to be leaning in the direction
that metabolism produces free radicals, free radicals
damage DNA, damaged DNA decreases longevity. 

> Human metabolism varies quite a bit among individuals

In terms of whether you store or burn calories yes,
but not in terms of absolute body temperature.
The core "metabolism" seems to be relatively fixed.

You want to consider that several very long lived species
are not homeotherms.  These include tortoises, lobsters,
giant clams and perhaps rockfish.

There is definately evidence that as you raise the
operating temperature of the species, it becomes
increasingly difficult to preserve the genome in
a reliable state.  One can compensate for this
by increasing the G-C content of the genome over
evolutionary time but this is something that only
occurs gradually and has definate limits (running
into the constraints of the genetic code).

I've pointed out a few solutions. They're unpopular, becase they'll cost
you money, at least on the short run. As far as I'm concerned, if you're
not ready to pay for a solution, you obviously don't have a problem, or at
least one that is not pressing enough. What you *think* it's not pressing
enough, that is.

If you're asking for an affordable solution which the marketplace will 
embrace readily, and all lobbies will welcome, no, I don't have any such 
solutions. (If I did you'd read it in the news, not on this list).

http://www.lanl.gov/worldview/news/releases/archive/02-028.shtml

LOS ALAMOS, N.M., April 9, 2002 -- Researchers at the U.S. Department of
Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory are studying a simple, cost
effective method for extracting carbon dioxide directly from the air  which
could allow sustained use of fossil fuels while avoiding potential global
climate change.

   -----------------------------

The sabatier reaction seems to me to be a much better Idea.  If you run CO2
and Hydrogen over a heated catalyst (such as ruthenium) out comes CH4
(methane) and Water vapor.  The water vapor can be condensed and
electrolysed and the hydrogen recycled out of it, and run over the catalyst
with more CO2.  The methane could then been used again as fuel, the whole
system is powered by either solar panel or a nuclear plant.  Such a system
would effectively relegating fossil fuels to recyclable and effecient
batteries, which is what they should be used for.  As you 'battery' is used
up, it goes into the air.  'Recharging' it constitutes taking the CO2 back
out and putting it in a burnable form again using an effecient (nuclear) or
renewable (solar) energy source.  Problem solved.

Sabatier Process

The CO2 in the Martian Atmosphere will be used to produce methane by the
so-called Sabatier process (discovered by the French chemist Paul Sabatier
in the nineteenth century). The reaction converts carbon dioxide with
hydrogen at elevated temperatures into methane and water (Stephen J.
Hoffman, David I. Kaplan,1997):

4H2 + CO2 ---> CH4 + 2H2O

Since no hydrogen is found in the Martian atmosphere, the hydrogen has to be
imported from Earth or from the Moon and NEOs. CH4/O2 rocket propellant only
consists of 16% hydrogen by mass. Therefore, the reduction in mass that has
to be brought from Earth to Mars is still substantial. A quick calculation
shows that about 0.222 kg of H2 and 1.222 kg of CO2 are needed to produce 1
kg of water and 0.444 kg of CH4.

Methane and the oxygen can be used for several applications. The most
obvious is probably the use as propellants for spacecraft and rovers. The
feasibility and applicability of methane as rocket fuel can be assumed given
the fact that a Russian company (Makeyev) is currently developing a launcher
with liquid methane engines in order to decrease launch cost. The use of
methane as rover fuel on the other side could eliminate the need for RTG or
reactor powered rovers, and also avoids the limited range of battery powered
rovers. If cryogenic methane and oxygen are used, than the rover could be
propelled by a piston engine. Since no compression is required (the two
liquids just have to be brought together and ignited), the engine would be
very simple and robust. In a case of a complete failure of all life support
systems and/or loss of the power system, the rovers and their propellants
could be used as a survival cache for the crew. The crew will breathe the
oxygen, and together with methane it can be used to produce power (for
example in fuel cells). Apart from carbon dioxide, water would be a product
of this reaction, which again can be consumed or be used otherwise by the
crew in an open loop "survival" system. All these benefits can be achieved
without the necessity of bringing huge quantities of consumables from Earth
(Pauly, 1998).

I never said anyone was murdered.  I am questioning Israel's claim to be 
able to use deadly force, and this list's defense of killing reporters.  
I am asking if it is OK to kill an unarmed reporter.  You seem to say 
"yes".  I want to know why.

You keep repeating this mantra without answering the question.  That 
doesn't answer my question of "why?"  I thought we stood for no 
initiation of force, especially not death, unless absolutely necessary.  
Is it really so vital that reporters not cover the middle-east that we 
shoot them?

Even in a war, there has to be a pretty clear and present danger before 
the military is allowed to fire upon unarmed civilians.  I really can't 
believe I am the only one who believes this.

I guess I am going to drop this thread.  I apparently am the only person 
who is disturbed by the idea that we should kill reporters to keep bad 
press from being reported.

Not rubber bullets.  Real bullets.  I seem to be in a twilight zone 
where everyone is hearing the news they want to hear.  I am not 
objecting to rubber bullets or dispersal.  I am objecting to real 
bullets being shot at unarmed civilians not involved in the conflict.

Forget it.  Sometimes this list really scares me.  Everyone talks a good 
game about people's rights and less power to the government.  But as 
soon as the real world comes along, they throw out all that "useless" 
theory and go back to government militias enforcing thought control over 
the people under threat of death.

And here :

http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/

Now that http://www.extropy.org/bbs/ has been officially adopted,
maybe we could (officially, too) drop the Yahoo thing, and organize
the lateral socializing around the new place ? The presence of the two
is confusing, and I wonder if people are not reluctant to contribute
in one place, not knowing which one is the real one.

The new software has polls, too, you can have forums for job related
discussion, etc. And of course if something is missing (photo album,
whatever) you can just plug more PHP GPL software.

With the new place and people like David, ExI doesn't need to force
his members and friends to cope with Yahoo offensive ads and spamming
any more.

I did not say it was okay to kill an unarmed reporter, I said it
was okay to kill anyone (including reporters) who violate a closed
military zone.

In the case of war violence has already been initiated.

Non-military personnal are often a threat to military personnal,
reporters especially, that is why they are excluded.

In the current conflict the Israelis obviously perceive the
presence of the press to be of no benefit.

This is true, but violating a closed military zone means you
present a clear and present danger.

Actually I think the debate is good.

I did not see any reports involving real bullets, but as I've
already said this is allowed under accepted convention. The second
the reporters violated a closed military zone they were no longer
innocent civilians.

This debate is about whether reporters should have unfettered
access to anything they want.

I vote no.

In fairness to the list I seem to be the only one arguing the
point.

I'm not a soldier, Harvey, but from what I know about war, if you
deliberately wander into a combat zone, anything that happens to you is your
own damn fault - it is not reasonable to ask soldiers to wait five seconds
before pulling the trigger.

As far as I can tell, the situation boils down to:  Reporters are playing
"heroic investigator" in order to milk the story for all the drama it will
bear, and as part of this they are deliberately wandering into combat
zones.  The Israeli military can adopt a policy wherein the reporters pay
for this with their lives, or Israeli soldiers pay for it with their lives. 
They have chosen to make the reporters bear the cost.  I think this is the
correct decision.

Not the only one. If it was possible, I would put a TV-camera on the
helmet of every soldier, broadcast it worldwide, and record on tape. Then,
after the war, review them and hold the shooter liable for any
misconducts.

After all, a human being is not infinetely reliable, moreso
with a rifle in his hands in split-haired situations like the ones that
he will encounter in the battle field. We think "guilty" about people who
kill other people in car accidents, usually due to some errors in their
driving. I don't see why during a war these rules should be changed.

That's not a very good logical analysis: the syllogism above is
actually quite logically correct. It fails simply because premise
#2 is false.  Depending on one's definitions of "racist" and "wrong",
one may or may not be a strict subset of the other.

There arent any resources and little debate.  I invented the term 
technogaian in
a light-hearted article for last month's exponent.  It refers the notion 
that the
earth goddess gaia has evolved humanity, a technologically advanced
species, to rescue her delicate biota from starvation and freezing due
to loss of carbon, phosphorus and calcium.  Homo Sapiens mine the
stuff in order to grow things for food and profit, and thus form a win-win
situation for life on earth.

My notion is that the whole idea of runaway greenhouse effect is fatally
flawed.  This climate under which this planet first evolved life was not so
different from today.  It had a reducing atmosphere, composed mostly of
carbon dioxide and methane, no oil or coal at all, yet it was still 
hospitable
enough to evolve life in the first place.  I suspect we will find this 
planet
is not nearly as delicate as we have been led to believe, and we have
had far less impact on its climate than some gaians think.  

Search the archives under technogaian.  spike

But who decides? The Southern Poverty Law Center? If you ask them, all
extropians are racists, members of a cult. Does that mean they are
right?

Groups like Nation of Islam, the Black Panthers, and even Jesse
Jackson's Rainbow PUSH group all believe a mythology that civilization
is an invention of the black race which has been stolen from them by
northern white barbarians who trod them down and enslaved them. If that
isn't a racist mythology, I don't know what is.

With the current slavery reparations movement, the common mythology is
that it was the slaves who built America, and the rest of us honkeys
just sat around watching, so we owe them ownership of everything we
have. This is similarly a racist mythology.

I'd say instead that the guilty rich liberal elites that control the
media and DNC politics have programmed society into looking at these
groups this way.

I don't think so.  The word 'racist' implies prejudice beyond 
any facts.  It does not simply mean 'emphasis' on race.  If it 
did then even the word 'caucasian' would be a 'racist' term. 
Which would be incredibly silly and meaningless.   Racism, real 
racism, is very ugly.  We should not define it away into triviality.

Speaking of 'oh, wait...' I'll note the 20 cent per gallon of gas
extraction cost and compare that with the ~$0.50-1.00 per liter tax
imposed by most industrialized socialist mobocracies, taxes imposed to
pay for sequestration, but mostly diverted to pay for welfare state
bureaucracies. The rest of the world is getting overtaxed by a factor of
20-40 times.

No, I just don't think you've read them thoroughly. An individual
engaging in espionage for the enemy is not considered a civilian, even
if they are unarmed, they are an illegal combatant and subject to
summary execution on the battlefield. Since the news media is generally
sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and acts as a propaganda front for
Palestinian terrorists, then journalists who are thus engaged in the
combat zone can be considered illegal combatants.

As the main driving force behind the ExI-Community on Yahoo, I think 
this is a wonderful idea.  I, too, am getting tired of Yahoo's unethical 
practices, deceptive representations, and constantly changing policies.  
Some of them are bordering on security and privacy threats that may 
violate the ethical codes of conduct if many professional organizations 
to which I belong.  I would love to see ExI gain more control over our 
lists, present a more professional image to the public, and provide a 
safer environment for our members.

Sea level going up by 20-something meters will lose us much 
current coastal real-estate.  Look at how many major cities that 
involves and then tell me their loss will not hurt us much. 
Also, we are talking potential thermal run-away here, not simply 
  changes to coastline.  And there is the small additional 
problem of the ozone layer holes getting bad enough to dose us 
with (more) unhealthy levels of UV.  This things are not 
something I think we can screw around with because we think it 
will not "even hurt us badly".

Watch out for your astrologically minded associates to be hyping this
alignment relative to current events in the world and their lives. From
April 14-18th, the Moon will align with the four brightest planets on
successive nights, an event which only occurs once every few decades.
All are extremely close to the plane of the ecliptic right now and in
position to be very close from the earth's perspective.

Prepare for it to be blamed for everything from toothaches and cramps to
the middle east conflict...

Methane fuel cells are certainly NOT undoable.  Neither is 
planting trees or aquaculture.  If the global warming reports 
are even half-right the cost of not doing something helpful is 
high enough to justify even things that otherwise would not be 
economically optimal.

Atomic power, done more rationally and with the overkill regs 
and litigation removed, is extremely viable.  Globalism as 
currently practiced (rather than the preaching) has some serious 
problems so I wouldn't be in a hurry to sneer at those who point 
them out.

"Most asteroids live the main asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter. A
few get booted to the inner solar system, often by the gravitational
effects of Jupiter. 

Because at least some asteroid are expected to be less like solid rock
and more like rubble piles, the gravity of Earth or Mars might easily
split one asteroid into two, Margot and his colleagues say. They figure
the asteroid's rate of spin is increased until it simply flies apart.

Each of the five binaries examined in the new study had passed near
Earth or Mars in the past. None had made close approaches to Mercury or
Venus.

In one of the newly studied binaries, called 2000 DP107, the larger rock
is about 874 yards (800 meters) in diameter and the smaller one is
roughly the size of three football fields. They are separated by about
1.9 miles (3 kilometers). They orbit each other and can even create
eclipses of the Sun's light."

I find this rather interesting because a year or so ago I recall working
outside one day with a cloudless sky when a rather large shadow passed
through the valley and over me. Looking up I saw no aircraft or clouds
anywhere near the sun at all, which I though was rather strange. Could
this shadow have been from an NEA eclipse?

We are addressing different things.  My line comes out of the SI 
over the networked computers scenario rather than biological 
CNS.  On the latter I would agree.

Never put rules and laws at a higher priority than people. People make
the rules and laws.  It is the reponsibility of those people to study
and re-evaluate (and change, if necessary) those laws as often as
possible, especially when those rules and laws are found to be lacking
(irrelevant, not based on commonsense, not applicable, harmful,
etc. etc.).

Try living in a culture where the rules are more important than people
and you will see, around you, the psychological result (*).

Please go to the Progress Action Coalition (Pro-Act network) Website at http://www.progressaction.com and then link to the PowerPoint presentation.  This should give you some information about some of the areas in which Extropians and other transhumanists take issue with in regards to Greens, and other organizations opposed to smart use of technology.

Pro-Act is now a part of Extropy Institute.

Thanks,

It is more likely that your contention that firing upon unarmed civilians is 
being challenged. For example, in the early months of Arafat's war, he used 
young boys for the camera action, (against tanks) and the world press 
generally ignored these youngsters as deliberate distractions, in order to 
provide cover for Arafat's snipers.

Well, generally rubber bullets have been used to disperse rioters 
(rubber-coated bullets) and assuredly that is something the PLO snipers never 
bothered with. Secondly, while there was (I emphasize, was) a divergence of 
public opinion in Israel regarding the Palestinians To their credit the vast 
majority of Palestinians have been emphatic in their wish to eliminate 
Israel. You can't fault them for inconsistancy, and dedication to their 
cause. However, there has never been a Peace Now movement on the Islamic side 
of the ledger, which might tell you something.

As far as the reporters go, Harvey, it was reported by Fox and MSNBC to have 
been rubber bullets and stun grenades. During the riots at Over The Rhine 
area in Cincinnati , Ohio, last summer, people were beaten by police for less 
a violation then the reporters, committed (not to mention the cincy rioters). 
I rejoice in any attacks on the press, which have been tenacious in being 
assholes, and not using their asshole powers for the benefit of human kind

The flip will be nonlinear according to most models, but this is still not 
TEOTWAWKI. Things will become in fact colder and wetter where I sit. 
Incidence of floods and storms in other places will greatly increase, 
that much looks probable.

Yes, that's a problem, but here carbon dioxide is innocent, for a change. 

Since we're talking about greenhouse gases, how come we only focus on a 
minor contributor (carbon dioxide) and ignore methane, and fluorocarbons?

I agree that we shouldn't screw around with it without dire need, but I 
see a problem enforcing it in the real world (industralization is much 
desired in many still undeveloped places, and in developed part of the 
world the diverse lobbies are very interested in opening new export 
markets).

Why is being a "closed military zone" of any ethical relevance?  
If the Chinese declared their re-education camps "closed military
zones" should we stop investigating them?  Is that any ethical
(as opposed to practical) reason to stop?  The Israeli army lacks

Don't worry, Harvey, you're not, you're just doing a great job so there's
no need for me-toos.

Relevant to the whole discussion; accusations are being delivered that the
Israelis committed some massacres in Jenin, in addition to killing armed
militants.  The fighting is over, yet the Israelis *still* won't allow in 
reporters.  Hmmm.

That's not the issue.  The Israelis are *deliberately* firing at people they
*know* to be reporters.  They are excluding reporters who are fully
aware of the risks and ready to take them.  On a separate issue, I think
it's fully reasonable for a soldier in an area with both hostiles and innocent
to consider before pulling the trigger.  Hazard to yourself doesn't justify
blowing away people arbitrarily.  If there *might* be a home invader in
my apartment I can't just grab a submachine gun and fire away, regardless
of what happens to the people next door protected by plasterboard.

ethnic hatred is even less deadly then racism. For example, the Hutu's versus

Just for the record, if nobody is joining the melee with Brian and Mike, 
it's not becase we all agree in here. Quite the opposite, if anything.

It's just I fail to see utility of such discussions. Current politics 
should be by rights off-topic on extropians@, and be it merely because it 
tends to generate noise instead of signal.

Mike, when are you going to give up these simplistic unified conspiracy 
theories?  Most people are idiots.  You don't need a massive conspiracy 
and cover-up to explain how they got that way.  Most people are 
self-centered uncaring clods who are too busy watching Jerry Springer to 
investigate what is really going on.  They aren't savvy thinkers who 
have been mass-brain-washed in some massive global conspiracy.  They 
fail to meet your lofty expectations, so you concoct an elaborate 
unlikely conspiracy to explain the failure.  A sadder but simpler 
explanation is more likely.

If you want to make a difference to the world:

1)  Don't bother with anything that is not an existential risk.
2)  Don't bother with anything that already has dozens of billion-dollar
foundations devoted to it.

OK, I concede.  I had not realized that CNN was really just a front for 
a Palestinian terrorist organization.  You are right.  All reporters 
should be rounded up and shot for terrorism.  I wonder when Bush will 
start rounding up American journalists and shipping them to Camp X-ray.  
Thanks for setting things straight.

By the way...  Where do you get all your "facts" since you can't trust 
the media?

I'm also looking for practical solutions -- but the process as described
is compleat bogus. As quite a few processes proposed recently. I wonder
what does make them pass even minor scrutiny, probably the press being
clueless about physics.

Anyway, the easiest solutions are the least spectacular. Insulate your
home (and address the ventilation issue, orelse you'll marinate in radon
and accumulated volatiles). Use high-efficiency burners.  Switch from oil
to gas. Buy more energy efficient home gadgetry. Buy a smaller, more
energy-efficient car instead of a yet another SUV. Team up with your
neighbours to buy a small-scale methane-drive power/heat coupling engine.

Guess what? No one is doing this. Even if it would save money on the long
run. Instead, people go for idiotic schemes like that Los Alamos thing. I
don't see the point for going expensive hi-tech as long as the low tech
options haven't been exhausted.

Um, please don't compare apples with wombats here. Fusion is not round the
corner. (Unless you're factoring the Singularity in). Solar is one of the
renewables, and renewables are all very different, and depend on where you
are. Aquapower is best (if the location is good), but maxed out in most
places already. Wind is second, and requires good locations, coast or
mountain regions. Aeolian turbines are the biggest growth market in
renewables right now. Solar trend is doing nicely, and break-even to
fossil is quite near, actually, even for single home settings. Hot-rock
geothermal is viable only in a few places (because the reservoir gets
depleted very rapidly due to low rock heat conductivity, and if it's steam
you're looking at hydrothermal/salt-born corrosion).

Do you expect me to research the options available to you in your specific

With all due respect, this is utterly naive. I have grave doubts that a
camera will give adequate context for any analysis of possible criminal
behavior in a combat environment, particularly if evaluated by
individuals who have never been in combat themselves. And I suspect the
well-meaning civilians who want these cameras in the first place would
not be happy with the analysis of combat vets who were qualified to make
the evaluation.

What most people are not aware of, though it has been well-documented,
is that serious combat causes sensory overload that modifies the
cognitive and perception characteristics of the individual.  This
manifests in a number of ways, such as sensory exclusion and a loss of
high-level cognitive abilities. Sensory exclusion is where the brain
starts "muting" normal sensory signals and dumps all its resources on
processing the center of your field of vision.  One of the first things
to go is your hearing; the better war movies capture this well by muting
the audio when the camera is capturing the perspective of a combatant.
You also can lose your peripheral vision, as well as general feeling in
your limbs (hence why soldiers frequently won't even notice a serious
flesh wound during the heat of battle).  An interesting thing about
sensory exclusion is that you regain limited memory of some of your
other senses after the fact even though they were not available to your
cognitive processor in realtime.

The loss of high-level cognitive ability is the reason repetitive
training is so important.  There are lots of documented cases of people
engaging in bizarre and ridiculous behaviors in battle that mirror the
habits they have learned in other places.  A famous observed behavior is
people who will collect their expended brass in a firefight and put it
in their pockets, because cranky rangemasters at some firearm training
facilities make people do the exact same thing. Most military combat
training operates under the *assumption* that you will lose your ability
to make high-level decisions under adverse conditions.

So while you are sitting back in your comfy chair reviewing the video of
the soldier's actions in battle, you have to take into consideration
that the soldier may have no sensory perception beyond the center of his
field of vision and that his high-level decision making functions may be
completely offline at that moment, and that this is an involuntary
condition.  These involuntary changes in brain function are in response
to extreme environmental conditions and it is difficult to hold a
soldier fully responsible for their actions when sent into these types
of situations unless they obviously and willfully step outside the
intent of the mission. Note that it is also hard to predict exactly how
an individual will react in extreme situations without putting them into
it in the first place.  It is instructive to see what "crimes" on the
field of combat the military actually punishes and which they do not,
since the military justice system is far stricter than the civilian
justice system. The civilian justice system is not likely to have
adequate context for making a fair judgement against a soldier's actions
in combat, which is among the reasons a separate military justice system
exists in most countries. In most developed countries, the military
justice system works quite well.

Actually Eugene, I can get 50-60 kBytes/sec on my DSL line and it
isn't configured for the highest speeds.  I think the max rates
may be 2-4 times greater than that (though I'd have to pay more
for it).

I think the install base for DSL is currently 4-6 million homes
and that's certainly going to grow.

A 50+ kB continuous transfer in using the HTTP protocol in Netscape
(not the most efficient) consumes less than 10% of the available CPU
of a dual 200 MHz Pentium Pro machine.  The communications bottleneck,
at least for now, is the limiting factor.  I don't see that changing
until people get into a mode of video/TV on demand.  There isn't
anything else that humans do that would seem to demand higher
bandwidth.

As you point out -- it comes down to a question of how clever
the neural communications protocol designers are as to whether
they can compress significant amounts of useful information
into that bandwidth for offsite delivery.

I'm too lazy to do the calculation right now, but if we
assume a brain is a petaflop machine and has 40 billion
neurons, we ought to be able to figure out what the number
of neurons/PC would be their associated bandwidth requirements
are.

We could stop the handwaving and work with some real data.

I wish I felt like I was doing a good job, but lately I feel like it is 
a losing battle.  I seriously think I see more anti-freedom, 
anti-rights, anti-speech rheteric here than calls for freedom.  I see 
more support for initiating force at the slightest imagined wrong rather 
than calls for evenhandedness.  There is more classism, nationalism, 
pro-government, pro-military, anti-individual support than I ever 
imagined could survive here.  I even see more pseudo-science and 
religious faith in unverified conjecture than real technical 
possibilities.  People seem to be just making up ideas for propaganda 
value rather than concerning themselves with real research, validation 
and facts.  It is getting harder and harder to justify putting any 
energy into this movement when is seems to becoming more destructive and 
less scientific.  This discussion list seems to have little to do with 
the Extropian Principles, the Scientific Method, or even logical 
thought.  Politics and propaganda seem to have become the primary 
purpose for most participants.

I didn't say it was of ethical relevance, but it sure as hell is of
practical relevance.

When you approach a closed military zone without permission, your
status changes from "unarmed reporter" to "unarmed unauthorized
intruder" not that being unarmed makes any difference.

Closed military zone means intruders shot on sight.

Really? Sounds like personnal opinion, no comment necessary.

Speaking of ethics, why was it that all those who try to pin the
Geneva convention on everything didn't say a word about the
Palestinians obvious violations?

Double standard?

There does seem to be a lot of pseudoscience lately, even on this list.  
People just don't have enough basic science to evaluate whether 
something makes sense or not.  Most people just jump on an idea based on 
their own desire for it to be true.  I worry that most of our own pet 
technologies promoted on this list are really bogus.  We seem to have 
more hype than real research.  So many people are assured that this 
stuff is inevitable that I wonder if we are really slowing down 
progress.  Most of what gets posted as "science" to this list is really 
just armchair conjecture.  Maybe real scientists don't have time to 
participate.  I'm not sure how to address this problem, but I am 
beginning to believe that pseudoscience from within our own ranks is the 
biggest threat to our future.

I believe this attitude is the root cause of the problem above.  People 
are so convinced that this stuff is already happening, that they don't 
see any need to actually do any work themselves.  There is an alarming 
trend on this group to dismiss real solutions on the theory that the 
Singularity will save us.  I have seen people discount their own health, 
space travel, cancer research, scientific experimentation, and other 
"good things" on the theory that the Singularity will arrive first and 
do those things for us faster than we could do it ourselves.  They then 
prefer to sit and do nothing and actively discourage these real advances 
in favor of a faith-based future that may never materialize.  This 
really scares me, because it is the same religious attitude that 
prevents cult-members for taking control of their own lives.  They 
expect the apocalypse or revolution to come before any realistic goals 
could be met.  To hear the old religious fallacies being repeated from 
our own people is disturbing.

Slightest imagined wrong????

There were almost daily targeted terrorist attacks against
civilians, hundreds are dead, and the leader of the other side is
talking out of both sides of his mouth.

The press and the NGO's like the Geneva convention folks and
supporters are showing clear bias. No sign of evenhandedness.

When the press shows evenhandedness we'll talk about better access.

Maybe not all threads are "pure" but that doesn't mean they're not
relevant. We have to survive today before we can survive tomorrow.

Politics and government is how human society is currently run, and
until we find a better alternative we have to work with what we've
got.

A journey of a thousand miles.........

Well, of course it's naive. And it's also a practical impossibility, and I
presented it as such. Still, I think that the human being -> combat
machine trasformation that a soldier undergoes should not be an excuse for
misbehaving. When you are on a battlefield you have high ideals (save your
country from the "enemy"), high power (license to kill), high dangers (be
killed), maybe high resposabilities (if you fail, something really bad can
happen). Therefore, I require high standards from the people there. I
refused the semi-obligatory military training here precisely because I
wouldn't trust *myself* in any combat situation.

This is exactly what I don't like: the concept of right and wrongdoing are
different in war than in peace, due to the different way of working of the
brain. The military bodies know that, and reward and punish their soldiers
accordingly. Killing someone (military or civilian) because he dares to
open a window is self defense. Then, the war ends, and suddenly killing
anybody is wrong unless he already shot you.
Hopefully, a singularity in the following decades will stop this mess.
(and maybe there will be different types of conflict...)

I routinely got 100 KB/s on my DSL, and that was the cheap one. After
the dot-com bomb (some effects also here), I have a 30 KB/s line and
I'm hitting the limiter all the time, so there's no bandwith shortage.

Chin up, Harvey. As several noted, most of this thread is armchair generals discussing which nut-case has the more just cause.
Americans go through regular psychohistoric cycles of 'national psychoses', sometimes called Jubilee, Kondratieff Winter, or Fourth
Turning. We are in such a period; this too will pass.
As a side note, I did consider compiling some portion of my "real research, validation and fact" on the 'tax scam' issue for your
information, as this is a field(s) I have devoted considerable resources to. Maybe a different day.

No.  If  a shadow passed over you, then the object would have had
to be large enough to eclipse a large part of the sun.  Recall that the
sun is half a degree or close enough to a hundredth of a radian.  If
you saw nothing, no contrail, it would need to be well outside of the
atmosphere, perhaps a good 200 km up, in which case it would need
to be 2 km across.  Anything that big would set off radar all over the
globe.

When you were working outside, could it be you were working
close to the ground, having had no food for some time and stood
up suddenly, causing your eyes to do something funny?  Ive done
that.  spike

All that this current thread has shown is that the press and the military
have incommensurate values.

Whilst the Israeli military wish to control all information flows within the
area of conflict in order to maximise their strategy, the international
press will want to obtain as much information as possible in order to
satisfy their audience's thirst for news, expand their circulation and
increase their profit. This is a very simple model but clearly indicates
that the two have differing and conflicting objectives.

However, a warzone is a chaotic area where information flows are very
difficult to control and Israel has decided upon strict supervision within
certain defined areas in order to manipulate external perceptions of this
incursion. (A goal which they seem to have failed to achieve in recent
days). The Israeli army sees its duty as defending the state from terrorist
acts and if this involves invasion of refugee camps, then that is the tactic
utilised. The decline in suicide  bombings since Passover would support the
effectiveness of this strategy in the short-term.

However, a reporter has a duty to investigate stories that have a political
and moral bearing on the current situation in the West Bank. If he hears
about possible massacres in Jenin, and he understands the risks that s/he
could face by undertaking such a task, then he is also right. If there have
been dreadful violations of human rights, then these violations should be
brought to our attention.

Both sides would argue for the moral validity of their respective actions
with some justification. If any here has a clear view of this conflict and
knows what is right, then they are luckier or more decided than most of the
people that I know.

Perhaps we could arrange for robots to wander around in a
battle zone carrying cameras, transmitting in real time for
anyone to see.  Then it not only takes human reporters out
of harm's way, but it also would project a balanced view
by its inherent randomness.

A soldier might not want to shoot and destroy the
robo-reporters, for then the world would have images
of that side always turning toward the viewer and firing,
causing that side to appear as the agressor.  A more
savvy soldier might turn to the robo-reporter and try
to explain to the world why she is fighting, thus winning
public opinion to her side.

In countries that cannot afford robots, perhaps a cheap
camera could be strapped to animals.  Choose a species
that it not cute, that no one cares much about, such as
armadillos or porcupines or aardvarks.

This solution works on many levels.  I myself have always
been an openness advocate and have opposed war and
favored accountability.  Wouldnt the robo-cams cover
most of the bases?  spike

No, for a NEA, a few kilometers wide at most, to eclipse the sun would
mean to be veeeery close to Earth, to the point that all astronomers would
shout "run away!" and begin lining up at the Shuttle base :-)
Most likely, the "eclipses of the Sun's light" are relative to the pair of
asteroids. Orbiting around each other, they block the light of the Sun for
the other asteroid. But nothing that you could see from Earth.

I think you need to check your geometry there, Spike.  The critial
measurement is not the angle subtended by the disk of the sun, but
the overwhelmingly large distance from Earth to Sun; the former would
determine the sharpness of the shadow, but not the size.  To a first
approximation, the Sun's distance can be treated as infinity, and so
the size of a shadow on the Earth's surface is equal to the size of
the object for object altitudes less than millions of miles.  We
don't generally see shadows of objects that high because they would
be overwhelmed by atmospheric light scattering and light pollution.
But under good conditions, one does occasionally notice the passing
shadow of an airliner, which is about the size of an ailiner,
regardless of its altitude.  I don't think it's unreasonable to think
one might be able to catch a NEA shadow, but I don't know what other
factors (like speed) might get in the way of that.

No No No! WOMBATS are *way* cool.

WOMBATS n. "WOmen's Mountain Biking And Tea Society", a Marin-based
organization founded by writer and former MTB racer Jacquie Phelan.

[Have you seen that photo (no, not on the Web) of the founding members
naked, covered head-to-toe  with mud, and serving tea? It was in one of
the local S.F. Bay area sports freebee mags 10 years ago.  Inspiring!]

I suggest that people willing to debate current politics at length
with fellow Extropians create forums on Exi BBS to that effect.

Exi BBS is at

http://www.extropy.org/bbs

You just need a standard compliant browser and off you go. As
everything new it requires getting used to it a little, but it's not
hard.

And from time to time someone could post a message on the main list
saying: we are talking about this, so do join if interested, and give
the discussion's URL. Thus, we could choose. It would also animate the
BBS, and encourage people to start threads about other lateral
subjects. And the extropians@extropy.org list would keep some focus.

The harsh reality of environment change and species extinction. Those
NS 4.x bugs and features just don't replicate fast enough anymore :-)

Based on recent stats, I estimate to 1 out of 30 the users of NS 4.x.

Consequently, web designers don't make it a priority anymore to fiddle
with correct code just to adapt to NS 4.x bugs and incomplete
implementation of standards.

I just tried to connect with w3m (command line UNIX web browser), and
it works fine. Believe it or not, you can login, browse the forums,
login, etc., with an understandable and usable interface. (Not that I
would advise doing that. But I see that YaBB claims to be HTML 4.01
compliant, and it may even be true.)

I totally agree.  Anyone who thinks that allowing the State
to rummage through our property and remove any and all
whenever they feel like it must love totalitarianism!

Yes, I would like to see many attempt to find the causes
of criminal behavior.  It may be in the genes, or in
people's early childhood experiences, or (possibly)
due to exploitation and constant haranguing from TV
shows, pundits, and politicians.  Yes, it will
be very nice when we "find the causes".

Meanwhile, punishment is a resort used by almost all 
entities in history, be they parents, friends, enemies,
nations, States, communities, or religious figures.
Punishment, or rather the desire to punish, has even
been built into the nervous systems of most animals,
including human beings.  I'm sure that you would agree
that it would be unwise to discontinue the practice
entirely, even if it were possible.

Sensible people, even on the Extropian list, will also
agree to moderation on most questions, and I submit 
that pursuance of technicalities within the legal
system in order to allow criminals to evade punishment
has often been carried too far, although it's possible
that it's just been that too much publicity has attended
certain cases in which murderers and other miscreants
have evaded punishment on ridiculous technicalities.
But the perception commonly exists that criminals don't
really have that much to fear from the judicial system.

I don't know about "usually", but at the present moment
I myself am in more fear of the police than I am of
criminals.  (And if they manufacture evidence, no
relaxation on the "technicalities" is going to save
me.)  While the chance of being victimized by a 
criminal is still slightly greater, my pain and
sorrow if the police decided to find narcotics or
child pornography in my house, not to mention
confiscating my computers, is vastly, vastly
greater.

How do we fix this?   Well, that's actually a very bad
question.  We can't fix that.  Either your culture has
the traditions and strength to resist such corruption,
or it doesn't.  You either live in a society that has
fairly high trust, or you don't.

Of course, it's fascinating (and in the old days used to
be very important) to try to figure out how some societies
were able to evolve high trust, and how the rest are 
still working on it.  

Phil went on to say:

> Around my private office in Santa Ana, vandalism is

In many small communities this doesn't happen.  In many
other times and places in American history it didn't
happen.  It's very interesting, like I said, to see
how this mess evolved.  (Naturally, I think that liberals
had a lot to do with some of the ways things have
degenerated.)

But it's probably more important to ask "why cannot the
police stop the vandalism?"  After all, as we are all
evidently agreed here, they'll stop at nothing
to prosecute innocent people like us.

So I wonder what they'd say.  Hmm.  This is just a guess,
but they might complain that if they arrest a vandal,
nothing really happens to him.  Me, I'd prefer to live
in a society that banished or imprisoned for a very
long time lawbreaking hoodlums and criminals.  But I
think that most people here, like Phil, would rather
just put up with the vandalism.  Better to let a thousand
guilty men go free, after all, than imprison even one
innocent.

Who has a problem with judging soldiers fairly?  The fact that people
can and do go haywire in combat further increases the value of recording
as much as possible of the situation so that we can figure out how to
improve functioning in difficult situations, and alter conflicts so that
all participants act as constructively as possilble.  Recording actions 
doesn't require unjust use of the data.

Actually the pro-Israelis rant about pro-Arab bias and the pro-Arabs
rant about pro-Israli bias.  To me, this indicates the press is in
the neighborhood of evenhandedness.

>When the press shows evenhandedness we'll talk about better access.

You mean when Palestinian deaths get as many column-lines as Israeli
ones?  I've seen much more on the suicide bomber victims that the
Isreali military operation victims, even though there's three times
as many of the latter.

Anyway, as Harvey pointed out, the press isn't monolithic.  If you think
the reporting isn't fair, grab your camera and head in to give the real
story!  Nobody's stopping you - except the Israelis.

Robocams would be a great idea.  Post mortems on the Rwanda 
massacre commented on how the mass murderers were unwilling
to do much if there was the slightest presence of foreigners.
They weren't willing to do much of anything when press or UN
observers were around.  Of course, for actual military operations
you should probably have a time-delay.  You could have a trusted
agent supply a public-key encryptation every day, have the
robocam transmit encrypted video, and the release the private
key the next day.  One day should be enough for military operations
while providing perfectly reasonable accountability and usable 
news data.

I don't have a problem with this either.  What I was objecting to was
the idea that a soldier should have to justify every pull of the trigger
in a firefight to ordinary civilian standards after the fact.  In
practice I think you would see a lot of soldiers getting crucified by a
population that is completely disconnected from what combat is actually
like. Quite frankly, most people in the Western world suffer from a
total disconnect with reality when faced with the brutal truths that
much of the rest of the world faces on a regular basis. This is the same
population that will chow down on a steak one minute and then reel in
disgust and horror the next at the idea that anyone would kill animals.

The other problem that I have is that the same people that are judging
the soldiers are in all probability the same people who are directly or
indirectly responsible for giving them their mission and training.  It
should reflect as much on the judges as the judgees when the military
exhibits systematic criminal behavior.

My concerns are more pragmatic than theoretical in nature.

I am sick off this thread so far. I have heard arguements that X is right Y 
is wrong and Z is racist becuase of semantic arguements etc etc......
       I dont care if  X is black, white, green or purple. I do believe that 
IN GENERAL there are differences between races, be it physical, pyscological, 
Intelectual or what ever. This comes down to basic FACT and TRUTH. Now if the 
facts we have read are wrong then it needs to be shown that this is the case.
       I beleieve that in general the jewish population or desendents from 
this area are on average more inteligent than people from say the UK, and on 
average, black people or people from African desendence are less inteligent 
but have far more athletic ability.
       This is based on the scientific test data that I have seen, The TV 
programs I hav e seen (Which face it, is the most evidence most people see) 
and based on my own experience. Now you could easily argue that the 
difference is cultural, financial etc and I would agree 100% so the arguement 
is purely based on your point of view.
        Now does this make me a racist ????

I wouldn't judge a person on their race, I would evaluate them on how they 
appear to me on their ability. For example, In an interview, if person X is 
black and comes across as being less able to do the job than person Y who 
happens to be white. Am I a racist if I offer person Y the Job. I dont think 
so. Likewise, If I offer person X the job simple because I am under presure 
to meet the ethnic minority quota. Am I being racist to person to person Y ?.
       I think even making an issue of this subject just proves that racism 
is still along way from being settled. 

       My view on the subject is simple:
Judge everyone on their own merits.
Other cultural views are not automatically wrong just becuase they differ 
from yours.

       I believe this is the Extropian Way.

perhaps i'm just being a naysayer, but wouldn't the first thing to do be to develop armed versions of the cam-bots that look like all the others, allowing you to kill with impunity, until they figure it out and start killing all the bots?

Perhaps we could arrange for robots to wander around in a
battle zone carrying cameras, transmitting in real time for
anyone to see.  Then it not only takes human reporters out
of harm's way, but it also would project a balanced view
by its inherent randomness.

A soldier might not want to shoot and destroy the
robo-reporters, for then the world would have images
of that side always turning toward the viewer and firing,
causing that side to appear as the agressor.  A more
savvy soldier might turn to the robo-reporter and try
to explain to the world why she is fighting, thus winning
public opinion to her side.

In countries that cannot afford robots, perhaps a cheap
camera could be strapped to animals.  Choose a species
that it not cute, that no one cares much about, such as
armadillos or porcupines or aardvarks.

This solution works on many levels.  I myself have always
been an openness advocate and have opposed war and
favored accountability.  Wouldnt the robo-cams cover
most of the bases?  spike

My personal problem with CO2, methane is less about absolute levels than the
_rate of change_ of levels. The trees can't grow/evolve fast enough to
outrun the changing tree line. Coastal areas, sea life and land animals
would have to have the same problem in a different form. Australian humans,
85% of whom live in a thin coastal strip of a very low lying continent, have
a grim outlook in the face of rising sea level impacting within 1 lifetime.
The effect is, I think, unprecedented, except in previous extinction
events - meteor collisions and volcanic activity.

No matter how I look at it, it doesn't look like a non-problem and I'm
personally not willing to let the notional 'singularity' (which I think
we're probably in already) take care of it. It's a boyscout thing. "Leave
the campsite as good or in better shape than you found it". Currently I
can't say I'm doing that. When I think of what I bequeath my 3 kids
(potential immortality notwithstanding), it bites.

Back on the CO2 highschool fantasy thing...
Millions of years ago there were Wombats here as big as a small Buffalo.
Nowadays they're cute little guys that really love apples, will happily bite
your fingers off to get at said apple and make huge dints in your car when
doing 100k's. :)   The mega-Wombats wandered our section of what was a chunk
of Gondwana and was, I think, largely under the sea. In Aus. huge areas of
desert land sit on top of nothing else but limestone that was once sea
floor. I thought this may suit the Los Alamos Scrubber-Forrest manufacture
and operation when suitably connected to a nearby gigantic natural gas
supply and massive mining expertise already in situ. It just needs someone
to put all the pieces together, assuming it is not a non-problem, of course.

Having spent the last 20 years doing real time control systems in mining,
material handling, machines, robots, car manufacture, water treatment,
sewage treatment, conveyor systems, pharmaceuticals, food manufacturing,
confectionary, packing, warehousing, blah blah blah, some involving huge
telemetry networks over vast areas, WAN and satellite links and whatever,
the rest of my proposal seems eminently doable- far from any schoolboy
dream/armchair musing - .ie. been there, done it already for real.

My little bit of 'highschool' conjecture went to a good place
discussion-wise - hopefully to negate Harvey's feelings about the list
recently (a little). I can't speak for anyone else, but this list is very
unusual in that the personality type and interests of the group, brought
together by a 'philosophical' net, means that the list goes into a huge
range of areas to a useful level of competency and has a sharing, acceptance
& tolerance level of thinking that is admirable, in spite of the various
emotional blurts that naturally occur from time to time (guilty, your
honour). Where are you Mr Hack! Come back, all is forgiven. Anders?

I subscribe to what would be delicately described as a 'shitload' of special
interest and very technically specific lists, but this one is the only one
that has that wide range that suits generally. It's kind of like
grand-central station for all tech-head journeys with vitual signposts
popping up and disappearing, journeys branching unexpectedly. I can donate
expertise to the group in matters of my training and professional backgound,
and learn heaps from others with different backgrounds. I now know more
about the CO2 sequestration process than I did - for example. It seems a
worthwhile thing, on balance.

OK scratch the wombats.  Too bad too, the wordplay potential alone
was worth the price of the ticket:  "Shall we go in sir?"  "No, too 
dangerous.
Get the combat wombat."  etc.  Is there an aardvark preservation society?
Or how about using bunyips instead.

Oh how I long to see that photo.  Sounds like a true collectors item.  

Actually, battle zones are far too dangerous for even bunyips or
aardvarks.  All battle should be done by machines.  Observation of battle
should be done by machines.  They are cheap, expendable, easily
replaceable, they have no mothers to mourn their passing.  War is
absurd.  Remove the humans from it, lose the aardvarks and bunyips.  spike

Sure thats a possibility, but of course cameras can be made very small
so that its potential as a bomb is at least minimized.  Ideally, should one
side start to make bomb-bots disguised as cam-bots, another cam-bot would
catch the act on video, demonstrating to the world which side the bad
guys really are.  Transparency has to be both ways.  spike

I searched for extropy, extropian, transhuman and the like at
http://splcenter.org and their outreach site http://tolerance.org and
found nothing.  When did the SPLC declare extropians racist?  They do
keep lists, and we aren't on them.

Wild exaggeration.  I've never heard _anyone_ claim that slaves built
America exclusively or that "we" owe their ancestors everything "we"
have.  URLs please.

I'm no fan of the SPLC or slavery reparations, but I see no reason to
misrepresent either.

Power" about new wind farms delivering power at 0.03 $/kWh, which is pretty
cheap indeed, even if nuclear power didn't have to shoulder so much

Also, they mention that Iceland is working on becoming the first hydrogen

planning to build a system of hydrogen gas stations.

I've been following this thread with interest. Here's another link to a
group that appeared to get all enthused
http://www.cybernetics.demon.co.uk/VBM.html and then did a few sums. They
concluded that they'd need 700 PCs to implement a human brain that operated
at 1/5000th the speed of a human.   After that not much seems to have
happened. It looks like they were overwhelmed.

My own feeling is that the massive interconnectedess (large associative
memories resonating with each other) and learning needs preclude any
realistic widely-distributed WWW type mind (the MURG Amygdala may work, but
it's not doing much cognition) - at least as far as things go at the moment.
If you want to implement a mind then I think it may have to be a monolith at
first.

Risks from AI would stem from a monolithic AI sequestering distributed
resources to embark on self enhancement. Eg someone has a prototype,
non-working nano-assembler shared on the WEB for group research reasons. The
AI uses backgrounded modelling a la folding@home on a million PCs to fix it
up and then uses it to remake itself by pretending to be a human to the
local guy with the machine. Damn wicked these AIs!

Back in the real world - In really don't think any standard CPU will do it.
Being an electrical/electronic Engineer, I see maybe a special board using
supervised FPGAs in dozens of 2000mm high, 19" racks filling rooms initially
(I think, If my calcs are right), connected in as massively parallel way as
possible. One can emulate and debug the boards on a PC, but ultimately it
becomes a hardwired monolith. If desktop PCs evolved from that massive valve
based 'ENIAC' or was it 'UNIVAC' (?) back in the 50's, this FPGA based mind
is 1950's version of a future desktop version that would probably arrive
very much sooner.

Well that's where my brain is at on the issue, FWIW.

cheers
Colin

### Exactly. The global warming is probably real but hardly enough of a
problem to warrant heroic measures at the cost of 10e12 $ or so. The
quicklime process would be a huge public works project for unimaginative
engineers. While the recycling of Ca(OH)2 would allow the capture of huge
amounts of CO2 with a small initial investment of carbonate, this would have
an immense energy cost, the disposal of C02 in the ocean or underground
would pose its own environmental problems and would almost certainly be more
expensive than the options Eugen mentioned.

Australia is as new as the US.  We can move stuff back a few meters if we
have to.  Both continents have plenty of land.  All the other continents 
do too.  
But that may not even be necessary.  If we did water management correctly,
there are ways to store water on land, perhaps on the Antarctic continent.
We can do it with nothing more high tech than dams and pipes.

We could remedy both situations, leaving the campsite better than it

Colin!  Take at least 3 seconds to think about that comment.  Bud, your
three *children* *have* *it* *maaaaaaade.*  They have it totally made
in the shade, pal!  

Think of all the stuff they have that you and I didnt.  Think of all the 
things that
are waaay better now, the computers, the education opportunities, the WEB,
fer cryin out loud!  They have all this stuff that couldnt have been bought
for any price when we were teenagers, yet they can trade for it for a few
weeks slave labor at the local burger barn.  

They have all the improvements, and I can think of *nothing* that is
worse for them, not one damn thing.  We had Israelis and Palestinians
fighting back then.  We had global whining back then, hell 30 years ago.  
And the beach is still in the same place I always remember finding it.
We had teachers assuring us the population bomb would blow up in
our faces back then.  Well, what of that?  Where is the Soylent Green
nightmare scenario?  The bomb was a dud!  This global whining about
greenhouse gas is also a dud.  Assured nuclear destruction: dud. 
 Eradication
of the worlds rain forests: dud.  Massive extinction of wild species: dud.
Choking on car exhaust fumes: dud.  Pollution of all the world's natural
waterways beyond life support: dud.  Universal famine, ecological disaster,
pandemic disease: dud, dud, dud.

None of that ever happened, because even tough problems have solutions.
If anyone had told me when I was 16 how good life would be 25 years
down the road, I would not have dared believe it.  Lets ask your
countryman Damien Broderick, he remembers even further back in
time than I do.  Damien, is it better now?  

I cannot imagine a better time to be a young person, there has *never*
in the history of humanity, been a better time to be a young person, never
mind the possibility they will live to see technologically-supplied 
immortality.  
Dont worry about having bequeathed (what did you call it?) bites(!) to your
kids.  If so, may we all be so bitten.

THE PRE-EMINENCE OF JESUS                    (Hebrews 1:5-14)

by Rod Benson

Novelist Damien Broderick is credited with coining the term
'virtual reality' in 1975.  Writing in the September 1998 issue of
Eureka Street about what he terms our "nanotechnological" future,
Broderick speaks of "the Spike" (something like a J-curve in
economics).

"The accelerating trends in computer science, trends converging
somewhere between 2030 and 2100 to form a barrier of technological
novelties blocking the future from us . . . We can only guess,"
says Broderick, "at what lies ahead of us, up the Spike's slope."

In the final paragraph of his article he reminds us that the future
is a journey we've already long since commenced.  "The Spike, you
see, isn't really some incredible Apocalypse hovering dimly in the
remote future," he says.  "It is the curving gradient which we
already climb, day after day, into an ever-more exotic future.
Start getting ready for it."

As with all change, we have three options.  We may pretend nothing
is happening and live in perpetual denial; we may flee to the hills
and live in secluded bliss; or we may grin and bear it, cushioning
the negative impact of this global social and cultural
transformation, and adapting to the new variables in our world.

People who choose the third option will do so in various ways.
Some will use New Age tools; others will soldier on within a
modernist worldview.

But there are others who will, with spiritual and historic insight,
recognise that their best hope for a smooth ride up the Spike's
slope is to develop a relationship with Jesus Christ, and build a
lifestyle based on his teaching and example.

Why?  Because Jesus Christ is, as the author of Hebrews points out,
"the same yesterday, today, and forever" (Hebrews 13:8).

WHO IS JESUS?

Jesus is the creator, sustainer, redeemer and end of history and
humanity.  He is the one reliable constant and indomitable reality
in a galaxy of uncertainty and vulnerability.

If you're looking for meaning in a meaningless world, look no
further than Christ.  If you're searching for an effective value
system, look no further than his teachings.  If you're seeking help
to live in a changing world, choose Christ.

I think Robocams are a great idea. For any situation where fairness
is in question. Cameras have an interesting psychological effect on
the person who is being filmed, though. Here, I show an interesting
twist.

Have folks here heard the story of the documentary that Kieslowski
wanted to make about martial law in Poland? Since the 'crimes'
committed during that time of martial law were nonsense, Kieslowski
wanted to bring a camera into the courtroom to record the judge's
face and the condemned person's face, as the condemned person was
told his/her sentence for that particular inconsequential crime
(grafitti, things like that).

But then a very strange thing happened in court. When the cameraman
turned the camera onto the judge imposing the sentence, the judge
didn't sentence the accused. That is, he passed some kind of
deferred sentences which weren't, in fact at all painful. Kieslowski
said in his biography (1) that he caught on quickly what was
happening: the judges didn't want to be recorded at the moment of
passing unjust sentences, because they knew that if K.'s cameraman
turned on the camera, then some time in the future, after three, ten
or twenty years, somebody would find this film, see themselves. Of
course, they appeared in all of the documents, they signed papers;
but it's one thing to sign a piece of paper and quite another
physically to appear on screen at the moment of passing an unjust
sentence.

The next thing that occurred in this story is that lawyers and
defendants were all begging K. to film their case in the courtroom,
because then the judge would not pass an unjust sentence.

Well K. was there in the courtroom to film an unjust sentence being
passed, and he didn't get *any* on film! In fact, after a short
time, he didn't even have his cameraman load the camera with film
because there wasn't any need. They became 'dummy cameras', which
were only there so that through plain human fear, the judges
wouldn't pass unjust sentences.

Kieslowski spent about a month or so moving from courtroom to
courtroom with his dummy camera, attending perhaps 80 trials. Not a
single meter of film was recorded.

So that's the story. K. had some unpleasant business afterwards with
the Minister of Arts and Culture because he went through great
effort to get the permits and money to record in the courtroom, and
then ended with nothing, so he had to justify it somehow. He didn't
say what he really did with the camera in the courtroom, though, and
that is: turning *off* the camera.

Costello's debt reduction could leave
          us all in debt

          By Kenneth Davidson
          April 4 2002

          Despite inadequate budget accounts, there is accumulating evidence
          of financial mismanagement by the Howard-Costello government.

          Between 1996 and 2001, the government reduced its debt by $48
          billion, according to the Australian Office of Financial Management
          - $38 billion from the sale of Telstra and Commonwealth Bank
          shares and $10 billion mainly from the sale of airports, property,
          railways and radio and telephone spectrum.

          Over the same period the government ran up a net surplus of $15
          billion, or 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product.

          The government is proud of this record. It was the centrepiece of
its
          claims to superior economic management in the recent federal
          election campaign.

          But, really, how good a record is it?

          Most commentators take the
          government and financial market
          line. They compare the record of
          the Labor government in the first
          half of the 1990s (during the
          downswing in the business cycle)
          with the record of the Coalition
          government in the second half of
          the '90s (during the upswing in
          the business cycle).

          Prudent governments run
          surpluses during the good times,
          and this creates greater scope for running up budget deficits during
          the bad times.

          Thanks to a boom in housing construction, fed by low interest rates
          and $2 billion in subsidies to first home buyers, the domestic
          economy is forecast to grow 4 per cent this financial year - yet the
          cash surplus is expected to be only $500 million.

          In the argot of economics, this suggests the budget is already
          running an underlying deficit of around $200 million to $300
          million, based on an underlying long-term GDP growth rate of 3 to
          3.5 per cent.

          In the previous upswing in the business cycle, in the five years to
          1990-91, the Hawke-Keating government ran up a net budget
          surplus of $12.7 billion, equal to 3.4 per cent of GDP.

          After allowing for the changed size of the economy, the surplus
          built up in the upturn of the last business cycle during the
watch of
          the Hawke-Keating government was more than 50 per cent greater
          than the surplus built up in the first five fat years of the current
          business cycle.

          The Coalition appears to have built in a structural deficit as a
result
          of its privatisation program in which the government has exchanged
          high-yielding assets such as airports, Telstra, the Commonwealth
          Bank and Commonwealth real estate for low-yielding or even
          loss-making assets.

          For instance, it appears that already this financial year the
Australian
          Office of Financial Management has realised losses of $800 million
          on currency swaps.

          (Last week your correspondent put in a series of written questions
          to the Treasury on this issue. The verbal response - that the
          questions would not be answered - I take as unofficial confirmation
          that the claim made in Treasury "Press Release No. 1" to the effect
          that so far this financial year Treasury had made gains of $43
          million on currency swaps is wrong.)

          The former auditor-general of New South Wales, Tony Harris,
          asserted in a recent article in The Australian Financial Review that
          the Commonwealth stood to lose $4.8 billion on currency swaps.
          This has not been denied or challenged officially.

          Interest rates are about to rise; it is now a matter of when, not
if.
          Age financial markets expert Stephen Dabkowski wrote yesterday
          that bond markets have already factored in an interest rate rise of
          1.75 percentage points by the end of the year. This translates
into a
          loss on the $32 billion in interest-rate swaps entered into by the
          Treasury since 1997 of $2.8 billion.

          These losses are all the more galling because they were unnecessary,
          given the government's announced policy of eradicating debt.

          The government's asset eradication program has been undertaken
          utterly heedless of the cost to the commonweal.

          For instance, the government decided to flog off government
          properties worth $1 billion for no better stated purpose than that
          they weren't yielding a rate of return of 15 per cent - even though
          the industry rate of return on property is 9 per cent. According to
          the Australian National Audit Office, 70 per cent of the properties
          were yielding a return to the government of 12 per cent or more.
          The cash from these sales was then put into buying back
          government bonds, yielding 5-6 per cent.

          The government is now renting these properties back at exorbitant
          rents, which still manage to push most of the risks normally
          associated with property ownership on to the government.

          The indulgent financial misadventure embarked upon by the
          Coalition government, if unchecked, will lock Australia into
          substandard, high-cost public services - which will eventually
affect
          every taxpayer.

I wonder what kind of statements could we Extropians put on our car bumpers
(those of us who have any, that is). On www.bumperstatements.com you can
design your own bumper sticker. 

I was thinking about something like "I am extropian, cryonicist,
libertarian, and infidel. To understand go to WWW.EXTROPY.ORG"

Do you have any other ideas for an Extropian bumper?

Actually, it's the uplink bandwidth that matters here, since you're 
sending, not receiving. SDSL has not been rolled out widely, and it's 
mostly cable modems which offer you more or less symmetrical bandwidth.

The current Internet is still largely a producer/consumer model. It's a
tree, not a mesh. The residential links are assymetric, because the
assumption is the residents never generate more outgoing traffic than the
normal download requires (about 1:10).

Old habits die slow.

How does it feel to have your name mixed up in that lot, Damien? I'd be

Hi all,

I've noticed a general trend in recent days for some posters to be posting 
more than eight messages per day.  Please try to throttle back your 
postings if possible, or at least try to incorporate your main points on a 
thread in a single message.

						Thank you,

							E. Shaun Russell

Hmmmmm.
Have you seen 'the land' here? Take a look sometime, more than 100miles
inland - it's arid or desert. The water situation (river systems) here is a
real mess. Melbourne had the cleanest water in the world when I was a kid.
Now a bathful looks brownish and smells of the treatment works. It's an
ecology on a knife edge. Our commercial fisheries are on the way to being
fished out. Species are popping off to limbo weekly. We have a shallow,
fragile topsoil. The U.S. it ain't. And whats that nasty yellowbrown cloud
over the city every day?- worse than ever.

What concerns me is what, as a control engineer, is called 'integral
wind-up'. The cumulative effects of the "out of balance" CO2 jolt from
humanity will have unknown effects down the track for decades, even if we
were to correct it immediately.

Is it "better"? Well kind of.
In Aus the policy of my parents and grandparents and further back was "if it
moves, shoot it" and "if it don't move, burn it down". These generations are
retiring and dieing now and my generation (i'm 47) is getting all the
serious controls. In the city here we've lined the streets with trees and
sidewalk cafes. Galahs and Cockatoos are in the suburbs - we never saw that
as kids. Dolphins are back in our bay and fish are returning to the main
river. My kids will never know what it was like to know your city was
programmed into a nuke somewhere in the U.S.S.R. (may they never know a
USSR). In many ways things are a lot better and I am optimistic - very
optimistic .... always have been really...except where I see fragility and
instabilities and the scars of the past, which are all too obvious here.
Then I get all 'handyman' and want to fix it.

Spike, - time will reveal all, but you've cheered me up with your rah rah
session...thanks. Consider yourself invited over for dinner sometime. I'll
show you a Wombat.

:-)

Very spicy. Mix it with tomato juice, Wodka, Worcestershire sauce and the 
juice of a lemon and drink it at the end of a long party ;)

I've just skimmed over that page. Even not looking at the numbers (which
they've probably copied from Kurzweil or Moravec), they've got a few
things wrong. The most glaring problem I see with their approach is that
they're using rotating magnetic bits for state storage. Even if they would
get the disks to mostly stream (a major assumption), this is many orders
of magnitude away of what modern chipsets achieve to affordable (DDR
SDRAM) memory (and please try to make it stream, at least most of the
time). The rule in numerical application is that once you start to swap
you lose. So, you shouldn't. It is very possible to make a completely
solid-state cluster, using ~1 GHz CPU ~1 GByte RAM, and only use a big
hard drive/100 nodes or so to record the state snapshouts (hourly, or so),
in case there is a power blackout (individual node failure will be caught
by the self-healing nature of a distributed neuronal system).
 
They're using 4 FastEthernet NICs/node. It is very possible to build a 3d
lattice out of this, if using a diamond lattice. It's also very possible
building a cubic primitive lattice if intercalating the nodes with cheap
8-port switches (in fact, one should probably go to higher port numbers by
now, since 16 and 24 porters with full backplane bandwidth have become
very affordable, FNNs might be useful even for such small switches). This
would scale to about 10 kNodes, though here you'll get very high
operational costs due to power and air conditioning requirements, plus a
number of operators. Small shops are restricted to about 64 nodes.

Look at the hardware in your head. It works, doesn't it? Local bandwidth

I'm not a big fan of Grady Booch, but he said "every complex working

April 13th, 2002

The new, first-class mail (over 2 oz.) postage stamp is available now for US57 cents per. An image of it is posted at
http://www.orlingrabbe.com/homepage.html
just above a couple links to articles on Abraham ("White-Supremacist-Statist-Dictator") Lincoln, which may later roll into the
archives. When I saw this, I wasn't sure it was for real, so I went into a US Post Office to check it out for myself.
   This stamp depicts an eagle (representing the State) holding a bundle of sticks (representing the people), called fasces, in its
claws. The fasces represents the 'unbreakable' collective power of the mob. I can still remember learning about this in my very
first year in a public, government-sponsored kindergarten (translation: "children's garden", where the twigs are supposed to be bent
and twisted into the appropriate forms).
   The word "fasces" is Latin, it is the root word of Fascism. The Eagle-Gripping-Fasces was the symbol of Imperial Rome. I think it
was adopted by the military dictator Julius Ceasar after overthrowing the Republic. There is a  nice depiction of it in the recent
film *Gladiator*, about two-thirds of the way through the movie, on the back of the Emperor's throne.
   This symbol was revived in the early 1930's. This is a period I study intensively as a psychohistorian, as it is so similar to
the current period. There were two dictatorial empires back then that nearly simultaneously adopted this ancient symbol of a new
regime: the New-Deal USA and National Socialist (Nazi) Germany. A relic of that period can be found on the reverse of the US
Washington quarter, minted 1932-1998. Maybe you have one in your pocket. That coin was the only example of Eagle-Gripping-Fasces
extant in the US until now. The new design has a sort of Socialist-Realist quality about it, like something from the pre-Great
Patriotic War Soviet Union.
  I am going to afix this stamp to a letter and mail it back with a dated cancellation, so I can have something to pass on to my
grandchildren- whatever they are- to tell them yes, there actually were semi-conscious beings back then, singing songs of freedom
and telling each other fairy tales about the Rule of Law.

Thermal runaway is not possible for Earth unless a significant portion
of the sequestered methane hydrates underlying the ocean floors is
released. Read Fogg's Terraforming text before continuing making such
statements.

The ozone hole is a significant problem, which seems to be healing
slowly as more and more nations enforce the global ban on CFC compounds.
I will predict here that ALL of the phenomenon known as 'global warming'
that has occured in the last 30 years is strictly the result of reduced
sequestration of carbon by oceanic phytoplankton brought about by UV
interference with plankton reproduction, primarly in the southern ocean,
from the ozone hole. Once the ozone hole goes away, so will the recent
slight bump in global temps and the recent spike in CO2 levels.

Prior to the "Massacre", there was reported a few hundred Palestinian
die-hard militants who refused to surrender, pledged to fight to the
death. That they are now dead does not denote a 'massacre' in the war
crimes sense, but in the sense that the Palestinian gun men were wiped
out for refusing to surrender. In other areas of Palestine, militants
have surrendered in droves. Israel now has over 4,000 militants in
prisons as a result of the recent fighting, all of whom surrendered to
Israeli forces when ordered to. 

Of course, the Palestinians will try to lie through their teeth and
claim the Jenin defeat is a 'war crime' just as they are trying to twist
the definitions of terrorism and the Laws of War totally into knots. The
fact they are doing this totally undermines any credibility they may
have once had.

If at all. Let me say once again: Antarctica's ice caps will not
collapse. The ice sheets which are breaking away from the continent now
were already floating in the water. There is a difference between ice
SHEETS and ice CAPS. Greenland's ice cap may collapse, resulting in a
3-9 meter rise in ocean levels, but this will require a rise in global
temperatures exceeding 6-9 degrees celsius.

No, I was fine, and the shadow wasn't everywhere, just about 1/4 mile
across or less, and it wasn't centered on my irises, it passed through
the valley rather quickly and was dark in the center and fuzzier at the
edge.

We need to be careful not to project our own political causes onto the 
Extropian Philosophy.  These ideas are not primary descriptions of 
Extropians.  Some extropians may hold these ideas, but they are not 
definitive.

I even balk at the libertarian label, even though I personally love 
libertarian idea.  The Principles do not require a libertarian 
viewpoint, and the ExI-Community forum poll indicates that less than 
half of us consider ourselves Libertarian.

We can't do that in Florida.  The whole state is flat and only a dozen 
feet above sea level.  Twenty feet would be devastating.  Remember when 
hurricane Andrew was supposedly the worst disaster of all time?  That 
only wiped out a few islands and the tip of the peninsula.  Wiping out 
the majority of the state would be a thousand times worse.  Even 
spreading it out over a thousand years would be like having that level 
of disaster every year for a millennium.  We simply can't face that 
level of disaster.  It actually would be cheaper to take extreme 
measures to dike the whole state or try to change the atmosphere.

I doubt it will come to that, however.  If global warming really exists, 
it will be slow.  There will be no question if the ocean rises a few 
feet that something is really happening.  We won't actually debate this 
issue until it is too late.  Although earlier prevention would be a lot 
easier than later, I doubt we could conceivably procrastinate too long.  
Therefore, I am not worried about having to "prove" it either way.  We 
will figure it out.  (I think most politicians just want to delay a 
decision until their administration is out of office.)

Spike, I can't tell if this is just your sense of humor, of if you 
really believe it.  Do you really think we have a low-temperature 
problem and that we need to raise it?  Do you really think that air 
quality has too much oxygen in it, and we need to push the balance 
toward CO2?

Population explosion was not false.  We changed our breeding habits and 
avoided it.
The cold war was not false.  Democracy won over communism, but would not 
have if we had surrendered.
Pollution was not false.  We changed our air-quality rules and now have 
cleaner air than before.
Epidemics were not false.  We invented medicines and vaccines and 
survived them.
For example, AIDS was not false.  We now have medicine so that patients 
can survive for decades.
Let me add, Y2K was not false.  We fixed 90% of our computers to avoid 
the problem that testing showed they had.

These disasters were not duds because they were false.  We faught these 
threats, and we won.  We need to keep on fighting future threats if we 
are to keep winning.  We can't assume that we will always will and then 
quit fighting.  Do you advocate giving in to Terrorism because they've 
never taken over the West before?  Of course not.  We need to keep 
fighting these threats.  Global warming, if true, could be another big 
battle that we can win.  We can't just avoid fighting expensive wars 
assuming we will always win.

You may be right.  But the big sheet that just collapse was famous.  It 
was on all the maps.  it helped shape the continent as seen from space.  
We now have to change all our maps.  The outline that has remained 
unchanged for tens if not hundreds of thousands of years suddenly is 
gone in a single collapse.  Maybe this won't be doomsday, but it is 
probably the biggest geological event that humans have been around to 
see.  Maybe a volcano covers Pompeii, maybe small islands sink beneath 
the sea, but this was major.  Past warming had never done something like 
this, as far as we know.  Other ice shelves are also now threatened.  I 
agree disaster is not certain, but massive change of some sort is 
certain.  Things are changing now at a rate never done before.

I see no reason to assume that the environment is immune from the 
ever-escalating rate of change we keep talking about.  If humanity, 
society, technology, civilization and everything else is transforming in 
ways never before seen, why is it so difficult to believe that the 
planet itself might be changing in new ways?  Natural processes are no 
more in control of the planet than evolution is still in control of 
human destiny.  We have passed that point.  We are in control of the 
planet now.  We can't ignore it or assume it will take care of itself.  
We have taken the helm and are calling all the shots.  We are steering 
its course.  If it crashes and burns, it will be our own fault.  If it 
survives, it will be because of humanity's will to survive.  There is no 
"nature" left anymore.  We have taken over.

Interesting alternative explanation for recent experimental
results that does not need to invoke the acceleration of the
universe. If true most of the predictions about the ultimate
fate of the universe would turn out to be wrong.

DIMMING SUPERNOVAS WITHOUT COSMIC
ACCELERATION.  Several years ago two different studies of
distant supernovas seemed to suggest that the expansion of the
universe was not slowing but actually accelerating (go to
www.aip.org/physnews/update and see Update 361).  One
implication of this would be the existence of some kind of anti-
gravity or "dark energy" responsible for counteracting the mutual
gravitational attractiveness thought to be operating among all the
galaxies.  But could there be another explanation for the observed
dimness of distant supernovas?  Scientists from Los Alamos and
Stanford say yes, there is.  John Terning
(terning@particle.lanl.gov, 505-665-0437), Csaba Csaki, and
Nemanja say that the dimness might arise when photons from the
supernovas turn into axions on their way to Earth.  Axions are
hypothetical particles which are thought to account for some of the
asymmetries between left-handed and right-handed things in the
universe.   The occasional transformation of a photon into an axion
and back again would be analogous to the oscillation of one
neutrino species into another and back again; in the oscillation
process at least one of the species must have some mass. The
axions would probably have a very low mass, something like 10^-
16 eV.   Terning says that the axion hypothesis nicely recreates the
observed supernova  luminosity actually observed.  A direct search
for axions is underway at the CERN Axion Solar Telescope
(CAST), http://axnd02.cern.ch/CAST/).  (Csaki et al., Physical

Reviving the West
by Hans-Hermann Hoppe

Patrick Buchanan's new book The Death of the West identifies a social
problem of the first order, and it deserves the widest possible
readership.

To identify a problem, even a big one, is not in itself a noteworthy
achievement. What makes Buchanan's contribution remarkable is that he
identifies a problem that the ruling elites tell us does not exist, or
is not a problem but a blessing. In today's intellectual climate, it
requires independence of mind and even courage to say what Buchanan
does. And the book's bestseller status indicates that there are still
plenty of people who have retained their good sense.

For the rest of this article, see
http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe6.html
_____

For the record, I don't agree with most of what Buchanan says or what
Hoppe does either.  I do agree with the latter's take on democracy and
statism -- both as being detrimental to human life, civilization, etc.
However, this doesn't mean I swallow his whole laundry list of cultural
conservatism.  (I do, however, agree that governments have been
promoting certain values or systems of thought over others, but this is
no brand spanking new observation.)

Later!

Smart glass knows when it needs another beer

Reuters
April 04, 2002 07:46:00

LONDON - Drink up that beer - another will soon be whisked to the
table thanks to a hi-tech pint glass that tells bar staff when it
needs refilling.

Developed by a Japanese electronics company, the intelligent glass
is fitted with a radio-frequency coil in its base and emits a signal
to a receiver set in the table when it's empty, New Scientist
magazine reported Thursday.

The iGlassware system works by coating each glass with a clear,
conducting material, enabling it to measure exactly how much liquid
has been sipped or guzzled.

When empty, the glass sends an electronic cry for more beer from the
table to waiters equipped with hand-held computers on frequencies
similar to those used by mobile phones.

A team from the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories working in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, has made the first prototypes, but may
find it hard to sell the idea to Britons.

''It sounds like a fun idea, but I don't think it would work in our
pubs,'' said a spokesman for J.D. Wetherspoon, which runs over 500
pubs in Britain. ''The tradition in Britain is to get up and go to
the bar for a round of drinks, not to have a waiter bring beers to
the table, no matter how quickly,'' he said.

I understand your concern, but I feel that it is misplaced. I think our

difference in perspective derives from a fundamentally different 
evaluations of the likelihood and timing of the singularity. You perceive
my "singularity soon" evaluation as "pseudoscience" and "faith-based."
I perceive your "singularity later or never" evaluation as "luddite" and
"self-deluded" (to use words with a non-objective emotional content
equivalent to the ones you chose.) We should try to work together to
create an evaluation matrix that we can agree on, using words with
higher rational content and lower emotional content. Here's a start.
Please feel free to adjust the terminology if you feel that mine is too
biased, and I'll do the same with any reply. Let's examine the
consequences for the four extreme scenarios:
     1) We act as if the Singularity is late/never, and it is.
     2) We act as if the Singularity is late/never, and it is not.
     3) We act as if the Singularity is soon, and it is.
     4) We act as if the Singularity is soon, and it is not.

Your complaints address scenario 4. If we all sit around doing nothing
and 4 occurs, things could very well get a lot worse until we realized
our mistake: at the extreme, we lose our one chance at saving the 
planet, the race, and/or civilization. I understand and agree that this
extreme approach is a bad thing.

My complaints address scenario 2. If we aggressively allocate resources
to solving long term problems with long-payback solutions, we will waste
resources that could otherwise be used to accelerate the singularity.
Up-front costs are very real, and will not be recovered if the 
investment is technically obsoleted. To the extent that this delays
the singularity the delay extends our vulnerability to pre-singularity
catastrophes: at the extreme, we lose our one chance at saving the
planet, the race, and/or civilization.

(I think there is no major problem with the other two scenarios: the
  advantages are obvious)

Sitting on our thumbs and doing nothing is a certain losing strategy.

You may have the last word on this Dan, because I will not waste a lot of 
time on old PB. I don't take him as a serious analyst, but merely as a racial 
polemicist. Or as the joke went: Hey! No picking on Pat Buchanan, he last an 
uncle at Aushwitz, he fell out of a guard tower.

He was the same fellow I remember seeing who stated on the McGlaughlin Group 
(I no longer ever watch them) that Saddam Hussein's Iraq was like taking on 
North Korea, and the US had better watch out! This was December 1990. I have 
since learned to dismiss every other statement PB has made including the rant 
against the North American Free Trade Agreement. As far as his fellow White 
Christians being overwhelmed by swarthy latino hoardes, I would concurr that 
there is indeed a problem, save that Pat is messing with it. Therefore, based 
on past inaccuracies, it will probably be a solvable problem. Solution: more 
cultural brainwashing by Americans. 

My last word: PB sux. A gestapo-face in wing tips.

How do you do this?
There will be 10 lottery or raffle winners selected to participate with the
training. The individual who trains the best (one out of ten) then receives
the trip on the Russian Soyuz rocket. The nine winners who pass the
miniature cosmonaut training program - yet do not liftoff on the Russian
Soyuz will journey into space via Interorbital Systems Neptune Orbital Space
Liner, TGV Rocket or another RLV.

Just quoted from their FAQ. Are competitions like this one way of promoting
and increasing public awareness of transhumanism?

Have no links to this website and have not bought a ticket as I do not wish
to win this prize.

This is new feature.  Quite different from the climate in '95-'96.
Raises the question of whether or not we ever meet "in person"

any "information" (or threats) that may be exchanged.

Understood.

I don't think of him as a racial polemicist, BUT I agree he's not
"serious analyst."  In fact, he's an extremely sloppy thinker and the
only reason he gets so much press is that he takes stands which many
people find controversial.  (Earlier in his career, I've heard, he was a
much less sloppy thinker.  I'm only going by my exposure to him.)

For example, I heard him talking about his book on, I believe, NPR
several weeks ago.  He mentioned how if Mexican immigration keeps up at
the present rate, Cincho de Mayo will replace the Fourth of July as the
big holiday and he doesn't want to live in an America where that
happens.  (Well, no one is really stopping him from leaving.:)  He
mentioned several other things along these lines, so I didn't take his
Fourth of July thing as if he was just sloganeering.  I thought,
instead, to Buchanan, what American culture means is all the
surface/superficial stuff, such as the Fourth of July as a holiday (we
all know for almost everyone it's just a day off work and a day to see
some fireworks, which are illegal in most of the US throughout most of
the year), the English language (something which doesn't distinguish the
US from Britain, Jamaica, India, or Zimbabwe), and other silly crap like
this.  I.e., NOT individual liberty, NOT the ability to question and
change traditions, NOT the fact that most Americans don't feel locked
into, say, eating or dressing a certain way -- all the stuff I like
about America and which is actually spreading around the globe.

But all that said, one reason to not ignore him is that he has some
influence and he's easy to pounce on.:)

To be fair here, many other pundits didn't think Iraq would be so easily
pushed out of Kuwait in 1990-1.  (We see the same pattern repeated in
regards to the Soviet Union, Serbia, etc.)  In fact, even some US
commanders were surprised at how easily Iraqi resistence crumbled.  Part
of this, no doubt, was due to the fact that the Iraqi war machine really
wasn't all that great.  Remember, this same army pretty much had a
stalemate with Iran for a decade during the Iran-Iraq War.  Another part
was that the US government, no doubt, built up Iraq to be an even bigger
threat than it was.  Recall, the whole Iraqi domino theory at the time?
That if the US allowed Iraqi occupation to go unpunished, the next step
might be for Iraq to take the rest of the Gulf States?

This does bring up a wider issue of these kinds of evaluations and
predictions.  I wonder if anyone here thinks there are any good
predictors of outcomes in war and what these are.  I see a few.
Generally, naval powers tend to be victorious against non-naval powers.
More industrialized nations tend to beat less industrialized ones.
Richer ones tend to beat poorer ones.  There are exceptions to all these
of course.

Later!

I respectfully disagree.  I think discussions of current politics do belong on the list as long as participants focus on extropian solutions to the incredible problems out there.  As Anders has said, we must not stick our heads in the sand as the world goes by.

A secondary spinoff list could be used as suggested, but this would take away somewhat from the present group focus.  

We can all censor the list ourselves by simply not reading those posts not interesting to us.

John

Ya'll already are in debt. Every $AU in 'existence' (a number in a bank ledger or on a piece of currency) was 'created' from thin
air as a claim on someone's assets. The underlying bank reserve 'assets' are in turn further claims on assets (e.g. US dollars &
T-bonds) which are in turn..... This is the largest pyramid scheme ever witnessed.

There is *no way* to avoid financial mismanagement in a fiat-currency regime. Fiat-currency itself captures the essence of
mismanagment: spending money you don't really have. The revelation above is simply a re-evaluation of the nature of those putative
claims. Enronitis and its closely associated Andersonitis are global pandemics, the expected result of central banking.

Ok, sounds like the aforementioned liquidity injections have precipitated out of the stock market and found their way in to the
mortgage market, just like in the US, fueling a real estate boom and concurrent price rise- perhaps the cause of the 9% or 12% rate
of return on property. Physical resources and human talent are being prevented from creating other kinds of capital (physical
structures of production) by being attracted to an area that is over-priced and overproducing. The result will be shortages, which
may be exacerbated by price-controls and rationing. With or without Statist coersion, there will be rapid rises in the real prices
of some goods, and falls in others (i.e. real estate). The general rise in currency-prices may or may not mask this.

Maybe Yen related? Perhaps some Argentine bonds rumaging around in the capital reserve accounts?

Correcttomundo. Having dropped interest rates below the originary rate to flood the market with liquidty, you are now looking at
hyperinflation management. The aforementioned claims on assets exceed the cash price of assets available for claiming. Good luck!

This is an unsustainable real rate of return. No investment can continue to outpace the real growth of an economy. Expect to see a
new number.

This would have acted to contract the money supply, a currency support measure.

Solution: cut the government services associated with these properties. Teach the ex-employees how to start an operate their own
businesses producing thing people will actually want to purchase without being coerced.

"Substandard, high cost public services" is a redundancy.

I was hoping that one of our Australians would comment.

We Americans do not have an understanding of Australian wildlife.
The following may be incorrect. It comes from fuzzy recollections of
a brief trip to Australia in the early '80s.

Wombats are about the size and shape of a medium-sized pig. They
are slow-moving and are not considered to be very smart: calling
someone a wombat is NOT a compliment. Australians on the east
cost run into wombats on the highways approximately as often as
we in the suburban Washington DC area run into deer. However,
since wombats are considerably heavier and more compact than deer,
the damage to vehicles is considerably more severe.

If we are going to use Australian wildlife as battlefield observers,
I thinks wallabies are a better choice.

On a similar line, after viewing the PBS special on
Holocaust Revisionism, I would like to strongly
encourage everyone to maintain a diary, including
expecially what one has personally witnessed.  If you
have any elderly relatives or know anyone who may have
witnessed important events personally - PLEASE try to
get them to record their memoirs.  What seem to be
trivial or unimportant details may prove crucial in
determining the truth later on.

The real proof - one way or another - of the existence
and scope of the holocaust would come the same way
that the police discover the truth via interrogation. 
Two people can agree in advance on a lie, but there
are always more details than they can specify and
memorize.  Thus, you interrogate them separately and
sooner or later you find significant discrepancies -
if they're lying.  

Thus, it would be really nice if someone with the
funds to do it right, and the integrity to be trusted
- George Soros comes to mind - would do just that with
a large enough group of holocaust survivors that no
one could plausibly deny it ten or twenty years later,
when the last witnesses are dead.  I wouldn't care if
the JDL did the investigation, so long as they
permitted professional interrogators - especially
those hired by holocaust deniers - to ask their own
questions and the process was kept informationally
clean, so that no coaching or transmission from one
witness to another was possible.

This is probably the only thing that would really
settle the issue.

A few years ago, I took a big sub-woofer and connected
the input leads to an LED.  Sure enuf, you bang the
speaker and the LED lights up.  Put enough of these
speakers by a freeway with a full-wave bridge
rectifier on each one and you could get some
appreciable power, although it would still be very
inefficient, as the speakers are not optimzed to work
as generators.

Similarly, on at least two independent occasions, I've
met people who invented RF powered radios for their
own use.  One guy was an Air Force Mechanic in the
Czech military.  He disguised his radio as a hearing
aid.  It had two tuning circuits.  First you tuned the
power circuit to the strongest source you could find. 
Then you tuned the listening circuit to whatever you
wanted.  He said he used to listen to BBC and Radio
Free Europe all day long and no one suspected a thing.
 The other guy was a neighbor of mine who repaired
TVs, etc., for a living, back in the early '60's.  He
essentially did the same thing, just to see if it
would work.  In most urban areas there is quite a bit
of broadcast power passing through every cubic meter
that currently dissipates to entropy.

There is quite a lot of sonic vibration out there as
well, man-made or otherwise.  So, how to optimally
design a system that tunes itself to either transient
or continous harmonic vibrations?

Any bets?
Stability? Heat death? Big Crunch?
I always felt the assumption of some sort of 'dark matter' and exotic as yet
unobserved energy a little 'out there' and grasping, although I am willing
to go along in the absence of any other explanation. This new axion theory
feels better from an Occams Razor viewpoint. At least they are particles
already 'on the books', so to speak.

I vote for crunch. Everything I've ever encountered has symmetry: spatial or
temporal or a balance occuring in some other frame of reference. I can't see
this as any different. I'm not so concerned about the big crunch as I was.
By the time we get there we'll probably be pretty good at large scale matter
engineering...Matrioshka Brains everywhere collecting and re-assembling
everything as it slows down. Much more fun than heat death - chasing
decaying protons all over the place - don't you think?

Would it be possible to construct a stable universe out of all the matter in
it? Stabilise the motions of everything and halt a big crunch? I suppose it
will depend on what our 'whole universe' is, infact, in balance with, behind
the scenes - whatever oscillatory event caused our universe in the first
place - and how it decides to behave.

Absolutely. Last time I saw it I drafted a simlar reply and got to the send
button and thought....nah, he's just hit Ctrl-Enter by accident. I decided
to leave it.

It says everything. It says nothing. What more could I add....

I didn't have the idea, which is of course even funnier than
both posting nothing and not posting anything.

Actually, you weren't the one who did not have this idea.  It was someone
else who did not have this idea, but only Damien Broderick and I know who it
is.

Ah yes, the old Re: thread.  We got the joke.  I did the same thing: post
nothing, in a mock serious tone.  By not posting anything, it makes a
hilarious self referencing paradox.  spike

I don't see the big deal about these "new" (to people here) holidays
coming in.  Where did Halloween come from?  Certain it wasn't a Native
American tradition and I doubt the Founding Fathers celebrated it, yet I
don't feel like a foreign invasion is going on when I hand (nutritious)
candy to tricker or treaters.

Buchanan almost sounds like the general who orders the bomber strike on
the USSR in "Dr. Strangeglove" here.  (Not that I'm drinking any
flouridated water.:)

Cheers!

We do not have much understanding of American wildlife either.

Wow, that big?  We could have a single such marsupial carry a
number of these battle-observation robo-cams, and distribute them
randomly along the way.  Perhaps it would be referred to as a
combat cambot wombat.

.
.

Hey, honest, I did *not* start this whole thread just to set myself
up for that!  It was Gene who first mentioned wombats, and he is
a rather serious chap mostly, not one of the notorious punmeisters.
It was just one of those spontaneous order things, I swear.

No, they would never do.  Insufficient potential for wordplay.  spike

When I think of the incredible deafening non-contribution from the entire

It's illegal to keep wild animals as pets in Australia, but members of
wildlife rescue groups take care of orphaned babies and release them into
the wild when they're old enough to take care of themselves. Wombats are
considered endangered species. I've read that their range is now limited to
southern and central Victoria. Damien and I recently made a trip from
Melbourne to Mt. Buller and passed a couple of dead ones on the side of the
road.  We stopped to take a closer look at one of the carcasses, and I was
amazed by the size of the claws and sturdiness of the front legs.

Here's a photo of a baby wombat and baby kangaroo who were raised together.
Caution: this is a geocities site, but the photo's so cute it's worth
putting up with the popup ads.

Barbara,
       Thank you.  I had never paid any attention to the Wombat before.  The 
picture of the Wombat and the Kangaroo were worth looking at even through all 
the delets I had to run on the pop ups.

On the other hand we don't see many Wombats here in Chicago.

I hate to be a non-conformist but really who wants the polar caps.  The
extra water is a reserve which can be converted into air to breathe and
hydrogen for fuel.  More Co2 and higher temps ... isn't that what allowed
those miraculous swamps to grow and make all that oil we now burn.  Sure
short term global warming might mean droughts and some environmental
instability but change always involves transition.

I think that's going too far, both axions and dark matter are just
theoretical
possibilities, neither has been detected in the lab.

You wouldn't want to do such a thing. The big crunch would be great because
that would mean infinite energy was available and that would mean infinite
computation was available and that would mean infinite subjective time
was available.

Sigh.  There are days when the traffic on this list has
me picturing myself dressed as Princess Leia (a really strange
image to be sure), standing before R2D2, arms outstretched
saying, "Help me Sysop-AI, you're my only hope".

(And for those of you who know how much I dislike the Sysop-AI

I admit I am faaaar too silly on extropians, but yes, I do believe this 
planet
is colder than optimal for life.

If possible, yes, about 5 degrees C.  This attitude should be no 
surprise coming
from a lifeform which evolved in Africa.  That continent is warm and wet 
mostly,
and we are all African transplants.  A planet with a more Africa-like 
climate would
allow humans to inhabit nearly all the land instead of our current 
paltry fraction.

We need not fool with the oxygen content.  Keep that at its current 150 torr
partial pressure.  Adding a bit more CO2 would not be noticed even by
our athletes and would help the plants, as well as perhaps raising the
thermostat a bit.  Currently we have, what, 320-ish parts per million,
up from 260 before the industrial revolution?  We could go to 1000 ppm.

>

Agreed, and we will do likewise with the current threats.  But I do not
see climate change as necessarily a threat.

Harvey, my attitude is shaped by Robert Bradbury's vision of converting
the solar system's metals to computronium.  The human brain is the closest
thing we have currently to computronium, so the first step is making way
for as many humans on this planet as we can.  Humans are Africans, Africa
is warm, so why not terraform this planet to be warmer?  So what if we lose
a bit of real estate in the deal?  We can deal with that, especially if 
we get
back Siberia, Antactica and the Sahara in the deal.  Yes I will miss 
Florida,
if cryonics works.  But in the long run its a great trade.  spike

Last fall there were some interesting exchanges concerning the rate of
advancement of prehistoric peoples, but I was indisposed at the time,
and didn't join in.

One's of history's strangest and most moving moments occurred when
Cortez met Montezuma.  Here were representatives of two elaborate
cultures that had never heard of each other; nothing like it
happened before or since.  Judging from the cultural accomplishments
of contemporary Meso-American and European civilization, a long
time ago I guessed that European civilization was about 3000 years
more advanced.

Later I read in Jared Diamond's great book "Germs, Guns, and Steel",
a long list of particulars that reinforced this perception.  Finally,
I made a graph of Diamond's data, and decided to order the data by
Eastern Hemispheric discovery, and distributed the following result
to my local book discussion group a few years back when we read
Diamond's book:

                Graphical Comparison of Eastern vs. Western Hemisphere Civilization
                    
                                      by Lee Corbin
                          based upon data provided on pp 362-363
                        in Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond


The vertical axis comprises eight indicators from Diamond's table ordered by Eastern
Hemisphere date of discovery.  The horizontal axis denotes thousands of years B.C. or
A.D. (no politically correct B.C.E. or B.P. here!)


B.C. (1000's):   9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0     +1

Now I have re-examined this chart carefully, and it seems
inescapable to me that the Western civilization was narrowing
the gap between itself and the Eastern civilization, because
whether you consider triples or pairs of items, the gap in
time between initial development in the East and the West
is definitely narrowing.

This, if true, is incredibly strange!  Diamond documents the 
following rather obvious reasons that one would expect the
Eastern Hemisphere's peoples to have been more advanced:
the land mass and population of the Eurasian/African continents
is much greater, the "meeting place" of the continents (the
Middle East) is much more accessible than the corresponding
meeting place in the West (Panama), and (what perhaps isn't
so obvious) broad bands of geographical uniformity along
lines of latitude exist in the Eastern Hemisphere, but not
in the Western.  The latter particularly enables ideas to
spread more quickly at any particular latitude.

And the causes of them being more advanced in the first place
would surely continue to hold, with the effect that the gap
in development should have become greater with time, not less!
Exactly as we would expect a small island, say Japan, to
eventually fall behind the rest of the world if cut off,
and then to fall further and further behind over time.

The Spaniards first visiting Mexico City (Tenotitlan) report
over and over again their awe at the size and splendor of
the city.  Perhaps it really was much more impressive (in
certain ways) than European cities at the time.  It certainly
was more numerous, with a population, IIRC, of about 200,000.
But of course, those same Spaniards might have been equally 
impressed with ancient Rome, which had a very large population.

I have been completely unable to account for any reasons that
Mezo-American civilization should have been gaining on the
East.  (Please, if you do get uploaded and live past this
trying century, you simply MUST run some simulations of the
Americas without the Spanish advent!)

Conjectures, anyone?

Whether or not it's a "big deal" you one, of course, depends
on where one stands, and on the importance one places on a
host of issues.

However, Halloween was not associated with any particular
ethnic group, or at least was not generally perceived to
be so associated.  On the other hand, Cinco de Mayo *is*
a celebration peculiar to one particular ethnic group,
(just as is  "Oktober Fest"---always spelled with the
"k", of course, just to make sure that the point is taken).

It's natural for some people of, say, Italian extraction,
to feel a little left out.

I have heard of wombats derailing trains and then wandering off into the bush,
annoyed.

Wombats would make great battlefield observers, although they are a bit low to
the ground.


I'm not even going to *look* at the animal liberation aspects of this horrible
idea.

I was of the understanding that Steven Spielberg had funded a group who travel
around the world filing holocaust survivors before they are all dead.

So it sounds like it is already in operation. the Shoah memorial Foundation or
something.

Refurbished tired light is neat, but there are other reports which seem to 
confirm dark energy:

http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5564/2341b

 Four years ago, cosmologists astonished their colleagues by announcing 
that the universe appears to be expanding at ever-increasing speed--and 
that a mysterious antigravity force must be doing the pushing. Since then, 
other scientists have scanned space in vain for evidence that the 
unexpected acceleration might be an illusion. Now an international 
consortium of astronomers has confirmed the original finding by taking a 
completely different approach. "A compelling case has been made that the 
universe is accelerating," says Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the 
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

"This is an important piece of work," says Neil Turok, a cosmologist at 
the University of Cambridge, U.K. In combination with earlier results, 
Turok says, the new research adds to the mounting evidence that ordinary 
matter alone cannot mold space into the geometry that cosmologists believe 
it has. Instead, many now believe, "dark energy" must be added to the 
mix--a repulsive force similar to one that Albert Einstein once considered 
and then forcefully rejected.

The original finding and the new study reflect the two different 
strategies that scientists use to map the structure and geometry of 
far-flung corners of the universe. One is to take a "standard candle"--an 
object of known brightness--and then calculate its velocity by measuring 
how much the redshift "stretches" its light as it traverses the universe. 
The 1998 announcements that the universe's expansion is speeding up 
(Science, 30 January 1998, p. 651 ) relied on this technique, using 
exploding stars dubbed type IA supernovae as standard candles. Distant 
supernovae recede more slowly than expected, researchers found, suggesting 
a cosmic acceleration.

The new work, by a 27-person team from 14 institutions around the globe, 
takes the alternative route. "We have used a 'standard ruler' test," says 
George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, who led the 
study. By starting with something of known size, he explains, cosmologists 
can calculate how much matter the universe must contain to make it appear 
the way astronomers see it from Earth.

The researchers used an esoteric ruler: the size of the lumpiness of the 
universe. They started relatively close to home, by calculating the 
variations in clustering within a huge swarm of galaxies surveyed by the 
Anglo-Australian Observatory in Siding Spring, Australia--the so-called 
Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). This lumpiness, says 
Efstathiou, can be traced all the way back to the ripples in the afterglow 
of the big bang, the cosmic microwave radiation. In recent years, 
balloon-borne and ground-based detectors have given scientists a good look 
at those ripples in patches of the sky (Science, 28 April 2000, p. 595; 22 
June 2001, p. 2236).

 "The cosmic microwave background gives us a picture on the sky of the 
fluctuations as they were when the universe was 400,000 years old," says 
Efstathiou. "So the test is, we have a three-dimensional picture of the 
present day, and we can compare it with the angular picture at 400,000 
years." Working from that information, the team calculated how much matter 
must be sprinkled through the cosmos to transform the primordial ripples 
into multigalactic clumps as the universe aged.

The results, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical 
Society , confirm earlier findings that the universe is geometrically 
flat, or subject to the rules of Euclid on a large scale. More important, 
there is not enough matter to create that flatness. Taken together, the 
ordinary matter that astronomers can observe and the so-called dark matter 
that they infer from the pull of its gravity provide just a third of the 
energy required for a flat universe. It's the Enron problem, says Tegmark: 
"Most of the budget is missing." The budget deficit, the remaining 
two-thirds, is what cosmologists call dark energy.

"What we are measuring is the energy associated with empty space," says 
Efstathiou. And some features of that energy, Tegmark says, are "really 
weird." For example, whereas ordinary matter pulls on other matter and 
attempts to reign in the expansion of the universe, "dark energy has this 
strange property that it's essentially repulsive, so that it pushes 
everything away and makes the universe accelerate faster and faster."

The new study gives a valuable boost to the earlier results based on 
supernovae, says Paul Steinhardt, a cosmologist at Princeton University in 
New Jersey. "We are uncertain how reliable type IA supernovae are as 
standard candles when you talk about supernovae that exploded a long, long 
time ago," he says. The strategy used by Efstathiou and his colleagues "is 
much more secure since we have many cross-checks, [although] it is more 
indirect and less intuitive," says Steinhardt. Crucially, Tegmark says, 
the new study "finds the same amount of dark energy as the supernova 
analysis did, but in a completely independent way." In an online paper 
(xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0105091) scheduled to appear in Physical Review 
D, Tegmark and two colleagues provide further backing with a similar study 
based on a different, smaller galaxy survey.

Even so, Tegmark says, the case for acceleration fueled by dark energy 
"certainly hasn't been established beyond any reasonable doubt." Turok 
agrees. Data from the forthcoming MAP and Planck satellites and the 
million-galaxy Sloan Digital Sky Survey should help firm up the case and 
enable cosmologists to check out some of the assumptions underlying these 
tests.

We did have enough air to breathe last time I looked. And making oxygen
from water (assuming, you can vent hydrogen into space as you really can't
put it elsewhere) to elevate the oxygen level by even a few % is rather
megascale engineering. As to fuel, combustion enthalpy of hydrogen is so
great that you'll go a long way with a liter or two of water. I.e.  
negligible amounts. Even in the desert you can just capture atmospheric
moisture with a molecular sieve, or freeze it out to generate initial
amount of water, and since the output of the fuel cells is liquid water or
water vapour the recycling quote is near 100%. We're not living on Arrakis 
here...

Oil is being made on geological time scales (=it doesn't happen). It is
much quicker to pick up the biomass and process it in a reactor (here some
hydrogen does come handy).

I haven't seen the numbers for increased incidence of floodings and
hurricanes yet, and it's something which needs a trend evaluation and be
renormalized for increased amounts of people and infrastructure in the
landscape, but here's something which could cost real money. Like, *lots* 
of real money.

'confirm' might be too optimistic, however there's many different
observational pieces, and many people working on it.

Yep.  People dance and drink more on Cinco de Mayo and they 
don't block traffic with all the cops trying to keep everyone 
from seeing any fireworks without paying.  Not a bad extra 
holiday at all.

Indeed, and speaking of this, though my suggestion to take off-topic
discussions to ExI BBS was a total failure, I want to thank those
people who pioneered it on this occasion and answered nothing on the
BBS. Thank you.

Sigh.  I hope to hell that Buchanan and crowd don't get nanotech

SDSL and other DSL companies keep dying ignoble deaths or being 
eaten by AT&T and other big and relative conservative concerns.
We have SDSL at 780K bi-directional but it is a bit pricey and 
took forever to get installed.  When soemthing goes wrong the 
ISP (a very good one actually) checks there in then calls up 
Covad (who we are not allowed to talk to) and if they can't find 
a problem then they talk to the phone company who doesn't 
exactly have a lot of incentive to move quick to make some other 
player's customers happy.  All in all though, its been pretty 
stable.  Only once did it go down for a few days.  Someone had 
ripped a line digging up a tree.  A couple of other times it 
went down for a few hours.  But those turned out to be other 
acts of morons outside the three organizations mentioned.

In case you slept through it, US courts have been upholding the 
rights of the cops and other government goons to prohibit 
citizen's from filming them and to confiscate films.  At the 
least they generally uphold such film being inadmissible as 
evidence.

Pure accountability doesn't work if the guys over there with 
most of the armament and in control of the courts and the jail 
have very wierd notions about what is and isn't ok behavior for 
you and I to engage in.  Full disclosuer, the transparent 
society, works if you are dealing with rational people, 
particularly in a position of considerable power over you. 
Otherwise it simply full enables 1984.

Not accurate for the reasons mentioned above.  You seem to 
believe we have the power to hold government fully to account if 
we had full video and sound of everything they ever do.  First, 
they would never ever allow that.  Second, if they have the 
power they can tell you to go take a flying leap.  Your vote? 
They can give you TweedleDee and TweedleDum for a very long time 
while most of their organization is not even elected.  Thanks, 
but for now I require a fair amount of privacy if I am to have 
any real security at all.  So I would not like to overthrow that 
part of the Constitution just yet.

No, but he does have to justify them by international military 
standards.  War is not regular civilian life.  But it also 
should not be an utter free-for-all slaugther devoid of any 
honor or humanity whatsoever.

Hmm -- I've never considered this, but it doesn't seem strange, now that
I do.  Looks like a good example of Kurzweil's "Law of Accelerating
Returns" perhaps, i.e. that the effect of memetic evolution was
beginning to overtake the effect of other factors, which you would
expect, from an extropian point of view.  In other words, the amplified
power that cultural factors put at the disposal of humans in the
Americas was beginning to have cumulative impacts.  This was enabling
the humans to little by little overcome the differential impact of the
purely physical factors that Diamond identifies.

BTW, Cortez's travels and battles with his tiny ragtag band of assorted
thieves, thugs and other flotsam and jetsam of the Old World is, IMO,
one of the great adventure stories of all time.  If you made up such a
tale in a science fiction story, you'd be condemned for falling prey to
too many flights of imagination and allowing your story to be moved
along by too many dramatically improbable plot devices.  I used to say
that the story could never be made into a movie because it would cost
far too much to do so, but with the coming of high-quality CGI, perhaps
some courageous producer will try it.

I thought Halloween came over with the Irish.  If so, I'm sure when it
was first imported it was a big deal.

Recall, too, that public [government] education got a big push in
America as a means of assimilating immigrants in the late 19th and early
20th centuries.  Now is not the first time some felt there was a culture
war between current immigrants and descendants of earlier immigrants.

Later!

I think the pro-freedom side will always be in the minority, but I
didn't expect it to happen on this list.  But if you want the discussion
here to move from politics to technical possibilities, there are two
ways you can do this.  One is to limit yourself to such discussions.
The other would be to convince the moderator to disallow political
discussions.  I'm for the former because short of moderating the list, I
don't see the latter as likely.  Also, I don't mind a little political
discussion now and then.:)

One other comment.  How representative do you think people on this list
are of the Extropian movement?  Are the various welfare statists and
militarist statists (not that I can see much difference between the two
types) represented by huge numbers of others?  Or are they just highly
vocal pundits?

How many Extropians, too, spend a lot of time on the list?  I bring this
up because over the years I've been involved -- on and off since 1996 on
this list -- I've seen many people leave who were supporters of the
Principles.  What if those people were more representative than the ones
you're talking about?

Cheers!

<<< Is there any hope for quantum computing to challenge 
the Turing barrier, i.e. to solve an undecidable problem,
to compute an uncomputable function?
According to Feynman [1] the answer is negative. 
This [-see below-] paper reopens the case: 
We will discuss solutions to a few simple problems 
which suggest that quantum computing is theoretically 
capable of computing uncomputable functions.
The main features of our quantum 'device' are:
a special type of continuity, the choice of test-vectors 
from a special class of trajectories of two Markov processes 
working in two different scales of time and realized 
as elements of an infinitely-dimensional Hilbert space 
(infinite superposition), the ability to work with 'truly random'
test-vectors in an evolution described by an exponentially 
growing semigroup and the possibility to obtain the result 
from a single measurement.
In deciding the halting /non-halting status of a non-halting machine,
our 'device' is capable to 'announce'(with a positive probability)
the non-halting status in a ?nite amount of time, well before the
'real' machine reaches it (in an in ?nite amount of time).
Hence, the challenge was to design a procedure
that detects and measures this tiny, but non-zero probability.
In what follows a quantum solution is a solution designed 
to work on a quantum computer.
The discussion is mathematical and no engineering claims will be made;
in particular, when speaking about various quantum devices which 
will be constructed, we will use quotes to emphasize 
the mathematical nature of our constructs. >>>

Note that these authors also think that 
'The results discussed in this paper <...> go beyond 
the pure mathematical aspects; they might impose 
the re-examination of the mind-machine issue.' [2]

Actually, I think the use of force is very unExtropian -- increases
disorder -- for the most part.  Even the counterexamples are
self-defense and retaliation can lead to overreaction.  So it needs to
be strictly regulated and held to a much higher standard than "ordinary
civilian" ones, IMHO -- lest it turn into Samatha's "utter free-for-all
slaugther" -- whether that slaughter takes place during war or afterward
during occupation.  (The latter seems the case with the US occupation of
Okinawa, for example.  See _Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of
American Empire_ by Chalmers Johnson.)

In this vein, don't you think the concept of rules of war, which I
believe originated in the Middle Ages, are Extropian, since their goal
is to limit war, especially limiting who or what can be a target in war,
what constitutes grounds for war, and when it must cease?  (See _War:
Ends and Means_ by Payl Seabury and Angelo Codevilla, especially chapter
10.)

Cheers!

The real problem is that much of the politics expressed in these debates
appears to be disconnected from Extropian Principles and notions of science.
However, the proposed solution (below) - to ditch the politics and just
concentrate on the Principles, Science and Technology - is just as bad, as
it avoids the issue of the social formation within which a posthuman future
is currently developing, and which is also shaping its modes of social
existence. From this it follows that posthuman futures can only be
understood in relation to the social universe in which we live: the social
universe of capital. To understand this social universe, and to uncover the
social form that the posthuman will take, we shall need a critique of
capital's social universe. This in turn will provide us with a critical
account of what the posthuman is becoming and can become. Finally, this work
would provide us with a politics of human resistance (resistance to us
becoming a particular form of life), which would include a positive politics
for human transformation that is intregal to a project of social
transformation (as it must be) where there is an "open future" for the
human.

The only way I know of to keep a mailing list free of politics and
pseudoscience is to moderate it.  For example, on a certain mailing list
that shall go unnamed, what threatened to degenerate into political
discussion was immediately met with:

Okay, so I'm not fooling anyone.  But I wish to point out that the price of
an unmoderated list is bucketloads of irrelevant crap, and eventually the
irrelevant crap may drive away the real posters.  If so, it doesn't mean
that Extropy is dead - just that the Extropians list is sick.  There are
other forums; I'd be sad to see this one go, but it isn't the whole
transhumanist movement in itself.

However, if you apply Moore's Law to the problem, it is obvious that the
longer we wait, the less expensive it gets to solve the problem. This
phenomenon of waiting to save money was recognised in the original
carbon tax studies done by the DOE and EPA in the early 90's.

So you need to match two curves: one of hyperbolically decreasing costs
to fix the problem, and another of diminishing increases in impact.
Since CO2's impact on global warming is recognised to follow a
diminishing returns curve (every increase in atmospheric CO2 has less
warming effect than the previous equal incremental increase), and the
fact that we are pretty well along the flattening end of the CO2 impact
curve, while still on the steep end of decreasing the cost of cleanup,
it's indicative that cleanup will be easily affordable sometime in the
2010-2030 timeframe. 

While the real negative impacts of warming (as projected by some truly
flawed simulations which leave out significant phenomena) do not occur
for at least another 100 years, it's evident that the clamoring now is
little more than a new excuse by the left for massive taxation today of
the resources of economic development to fund massive welfare state
programs.

It's a fact that the history of the past several hundred thousand years
is that we've spent far more time in ice age conditions than in
relatively warmer interglacial periods. The Milankovich Theory says we
should be heading into a new ice age after the current minor upward blip
ends in a few hundred years (one of those odd periods where different
cycles intersect each other out of phase causing a sine wave of much
shorter period than those of the major cycles, the current sine wave
started in the middle ages).

THough not because of the threat of population explosion, since there
are plenty of cultures around the world today who are quite aware of the
phenomenon but are still breeding like rabbits. Habits change when women
gain legal independence and become increasingly educated.

Nor can we deal with real threats when our resources are diverted by
chimeras propagandized by those with alternative agendas.

The question is whether massive sequestration is a good thing or not. If
there is more sequestration than release, then we are going to be
cooling the planet (note that CO2's effect as a greenhouse gase follows
a diminishing returns curve). Putting that carbon into longer term
storage will add to the long term trend toward Ice House climate.

Uh, once again, no. The coastal ice sheets have been steadily breaking
away because they have grown too big to resist the circum-polar ocean
currents. The ice they formed from is that generated in the last 1000
years by the Little Ice age, which is currently ending. The coastal ice
sheets have broken away many times in the past. 

For example, when my cousin Andrew did his expedition to one of the
Katabatic canyons in Antarctica, at the base of the canyon he found the
dessicated remains of penguins, a location more than 250 miles from the
current edge of the ice shelf. They could only have gotten there if the
ice along that coast had been freed from that coast at some time in the
past, recent enough that wind had not eroded their bodies, but long
enough ago that there was once open ocean within a dozen or so miles of
his location.

Current thinking is that these penguin remains date to the pre-Little
Ice Age period, though there has not been any carbon dating done on them
(the scientific establishment at McMurdoe wouldn't let him take
samples).

I have seen the numbers. It turns out that there were twice as many
hurricanes (of all sizes) in the first half of the 20th century than in
the last half of the 20th century. Since those who push the 'global
warming' theory claim that more warming occured in the latter half, and
that the world was warmer in the latter half, then it logically follows
that a warmer world will have LESS in severe cyclonic storms (quantity
and severity). 

THis is a rather logical premise, since most of the alleged warming is
occuring at the temperate and polar regions, not at the equator, so
therefore the thermal gradient from equator to pole is less severe. A
less severe thermal gradient will result in less frequent and less
severe cyclonic storm systems, lower overall wind and weather
velocities, etc.

It was in 1990 that I first didn't have this idea... 

Now there were many other folks around at the time..
and it could be that this idea just wasn't in the air
and I didn't get it from someone else who had already
not gotten it.

But unless we hear of a credible disclaimer from
someone else with an earlier date, I think my non
discovery has precedence.

Loree

P.S.  I'm sure that Damien didn't have a similar idea
in one of his futuristic fiction stories around 1976
or so, but since I never read any of his stuff until
2000, it couldn't have been him I didn't get it from.

You sorted the list by time of Eastern discovery.  This creates
a bias indicating closure of gap since discovereries the East
made relatively late will tend to be ones with a lesser gap.
Sorting by time of Western discovery show no obvious trend over
time.  The only thing that jumps out is that the east is developing
social institutions (states, writing, villages) relatively late.
Not really enough data points, though.

I don't know where YOU live, but the streets are most certainly blocked on
Cinco de Mayo, it just isn't being blocked by the police.  When the Mexican
population density reaches a certain level, Cinco de Mayo tends to turn the
streets into a parking lot for inebriated Mexicans who are cruising.  Since
I live in one of these areas, I basically plan to not leave the house on
that day, as the local traffic is unbelievable, sometimes taking an hour
just to get out of the neighborhood.

This is a very good point which should be stressed more in these debates!

However, realize that it gets cheaper and cheaper up to the point where 
it becomes too late.  The problem also gets harder and harder.  We 
believe that technology will advance faster than the problem, but how 
can we be sure?  It is like playing a game of chicken by rushing 
headlong toward the problem and waiting for the last possible moment 
until we change course.  Many people will become extremely nervous as we 
get closer.  Even though it may be cheaper, the risk of failure 
increases as we get closer as well.

Also keep in mind that you are talking total cost.  It may be easier to 
pay more over a longer timeperiod, and to spread the cost over a lot of 
people.  It we could pay $1000 extra per car over a century, it might be 
easier than a single nanotech company paying billions all at once to 
nanoscrub the atmosphere later.  Like a car loan, many people rather pay 
less per month for a longer period of time.  So even if you are right, 
some people may rather choose the alternative.

Also, I do not believe Moore's law works smoothly as some people do.  I 
believe that we have plateaus between breakthroughs.  Our spaceships, 
for example, don't improve much gradually.  We have complete 
replacements every few decades.  Computer chips also don't increase as 
fast as the benchmark tests try to pretend.  The real speed increases 
occur with new chip sets.  While it may be advantageous to wait until 
the latest plateau before acting, we should start as early within that 
last plateau as possible.  The timing of this will be much harder to 
predict.

In other words, I agree with your point totally for the overall trend.  
However, I think that detecting the precise trigger point when it 
becomes time to act will be increasingly difficult as we get closer.  I 
also think that while the cost goes down, the risk goes up.  Timing 
becomes critical, and I don't trust our current government or corporate 
structures to be able to react quickly enough if we get too close.

> it's indicative that cleanup will be easily affordable sometime in the

Although I'm not sure about the detail, I agree with your final 
assessment.  Global ecology changes too slowly to wipe us out suddenly.  
Repair technology and detection technology is getting better as we 
progress.  We should be able to handle the problem before it gets too 
bad.  However, this implies that we must allow such technology to 
continue advancing!  We can't declare global warming a non-issue and 
stop research in that area.  Otherwise, the problem will advance while 
we stand still.

I'm not sure I believe this.  Are you aware that all coral reefs are 
sick and dying today?  It is blamed on global warming, although I 
suspect just plain pollution is a larger contributor.  We also have 
shifting migration patters within the oceans because the old spawning 
grounds are warmer than they used to be.  I think life is more adaptable 
than people give it credit, but I also think we are seeing major changes 
today.  The biggest fear is of the unknown.  Maybe it won't be a big 
deal if all the coral dies within a decade.  Or maybe it will have a 
major impact that we didn't suspect.  Like debugging complex software, a 
small change might be able to crash the whole system.  I don't think we 
are as unaffected today as many people claim.

True.  But my point was that the problem was real, not hype.  The 
solution was less breading, which we did.  I think education did solve 
the problem, and not as a direct attempt to solve the problem.  In other 
words, we got lucky on that one.  We did not directly solve the problem, 
nor did it turn out to be a non-problem.  Nor was it solved by 
self-regulating pressures on population.

> Nor can we deal with real threats when our resources are diverted by
> chimeras propagandized by those with alternative agendas.

Agreed.  This is where real science is required.  However, our two-party 
system in America has made real science undetectable.  We can predict 
what each side will claim on any issue.  We don't even have to do the 
science any more to have PACs jump in on both sides claiming they are 
right.  They are so highly funded and carefully spin-doctored, that I 
don't think we can tell where the real science is.  To be honest, I 
doubt you or I really can tell how much global warming is real.  There 
is so much propaganda out there, that all of us are probably fooled on 
various issues.  In the areas of my own expertise, I see more hype and 
vaporware than real science.  So many competitors are announcing 
vaporware that the company that doesn't can't compete.  I really have a 
fear that true science is being overrun by politics and advertising 
hype.  This is the biggest impediment to our scientific agenda today.

(This seems to be my favorite soapbox topic, lately....)

I'm all for making war as clean and surgical as possible, and holding
soldiers responsible for their actions.  My only reason for bringing this up
at all is my fear that in this day and age the soldiers could very well find
themselves facing unreasonable standards of conduct that run counter to the
reality of combat or even to their own survival on the battlefield.  I
certainly don't want politicians deciding the standards of conduct, as
history has shown that to be immensely bad on a number of levels and the
individual soldiers end up being the losers in the end.  It would be far
more useful to hold the politicians responsible for the actions of their
soldiers since they ultimately have massive direct and indirect influence on
the actions of the military, though they rarely take responsibility for it.

Based on what I know so far, I agree with you, Spike. I also agree with
Harvey that the transition period will be difficult. I see the rise in sea
level as one of the less difficult problems, although expensive. There are
also agricultural problems such as increased damage by insects and fungus
caused by rising temperatures. Expensive and difficult to deal with, but
manageable. Drought is a tougher problem. Some of the weather models
indicate there'd be less drought with rising temps. Others show more
drought. Bottom line: no one really has a clue. Best individual strategy far
as I can see is to stay flexible and keep more than one iron in the fire.

For anyone interested in weather patterns, there's a comprehensive list of
links here:

Thanks very much!  I'll take a much closer look, but
you fingered what is probably a fatal mistake.  I also
appreciate your effort in writing up result when sorted
by West first.

Whether or not my graph was intrinsically suspect, as Curt
claims, what you say here is important.

First, let me digress on geographical determinism, which
underlies Diamond's book.  At first blush, geographical
determinism seems unchallengable:  surely all the differences
between Earth's population must be traced ultimately to
environmental factors.  If one went back to 8000 B.C. and
moved all the people inhabiting Japan to the Phillipines
and vice-versa, then we would expect that it would still
be the northern people off the coast of Korea who would
become a cultural and military powerhouse, and that the
people inhabiting the less challenging tropical environment
would not.

However, Diamond is criticized by at least one person that
I know of: Victor Davis Hanson in "Carnage and Culture".
The only thing that I've been able to glean from criticism
of geographical determinism is the possibility that a
certain set of people in one geographical location may,
through randomness, develop a set of cultural features
that can only be logically associated with *them*, per se,
and not with their environment.  For example, the extreme
bloodthirstiness characterizing some primitive tribes may
be a relatively random development; this is substantiated
by the presence of less bloodthirsty tribes in almost the
same geographic location.  But if such a bloodthirsty
tribe, to continue this example, were to rise to global
emminence, then this particular trait would have to be
specifically associated with *them*, not their original
environment.

So are you and Kurzweil in effect criticizing geographical
determinism in just the same way that I am?

However, if you look at each, east and west, in their own order of
discovery, you will see that the curve of discovery in the east is far
shorter steeper, while the western one is less so. This is demonstrative
of the cascade effects of discovery when you have increasing rates of
cross fertilization. 

The east was more geographically conducive to cross fertilization of
ideas, and thus shows a steeper curve.

LONDON, England -- Thousands of people from across Britain
have gathered in central London to protest against Israeli
military action in the Middle East against the Palestinians.
Demonstrators poured into the capital's Trafalgar Square
on Saturday where they clambered on to Nelson's Column
chanting slogans before burning and tearing Israeli flags.
As the emblems burned, the crowd alternated chants of
"Down with Israel," "Down, down U.S.A." and "Jihad!" or holy war.
Protesters carried signs reading "Free Palestine --
Victory to the Intifada."

"Entre 10 et 12 actes antisémites par jour" :
c'est, selon France-Info, le recensement effectué
depuis le week-end de Pâques par les policiers des

diverses, allant du tag jusqu'à l'agression physique.
Pour sa part, le Mouvement contre le racisme et pour

12 avril "sa consternation et son effroi devant la
profanation de tombes juives au cimetière du quartier
de Cronembourg à Strasbourg". Des inscriptions antisémites
avaient été découvertes le même jour sur une vingtaine de
tombes et sur un mur de ce cimetière. Des croix gammées
et des insultes telles que "NTM les juifs" ont été inscrites
sur les sépultures dans la journée de vendredi ou dans la nuit
de jeudi à vendredi. Le MRAP a annoncé qu'il allait saisir
le procureur et se constituer partie civile. Les services
de la police judiciaire ont été chargés de l'enquête.

KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A crowd of about 50 youths attacked
the central synagogue in Kiev, beating three people with stones,
hurling bottles and breaking windows, the rabbi said Sunday.
Kiev's chief rabbi, Moshe-Reuven Azman, said the mob marched
down the Ukrainian capital's main boulevard shouting
"Kill the Jews!" before attacking the synagogue shortly
after 9 p.m. Saturday.
The assailants knocked the rector of Kiev's yeshiva to the
ground and beat him with stones, Azman said. The rector,
Tsvi Kaplan, was hospitalized overnight and released Sunday.
Azman said his own 14-year-old son, Jorik, and a security
guard were also injured and that the attackers broke 20
windows in the synagogue.
"I call this act a pogrom," Azman said. "It's a miracle that
it was not worse."
The attack occurred after Saturday evening services,
and many worshippers had already left the building.

We are rewriting history from here on out.  What most bothers me 
is that we lock people up for life in the US on "3rd strike" 
even if those crimes were all relatively minor with little jail 
time in an of themselves.  We now have a larger percentage of 
our people in jail than any country in the  world.  I don't 
think it is all because of braindead laws but over 40% 
nationwide are in for drug offenses - the majority for mere 
possession.  Our mandatory sentencing laws bypass judicial 
discretion.  The results are pretty horrendous to the 
individuals subject to this "justice" and to our society.  There 
is also little evidence that these draconian sentencing 
practices actually work to deter that much real crime.  We are 
one of a handful of countries that executes children and the 
mentally ill.  The others are places like Yemen, Iran and Saudi 
Arabia.  Studies have recently shown that as many as 80% of the 
people on death row in many states should not be there.  As many 
as 60% have been found subsequently innocent in some areas.

As Extropians I think we should be especially loathe to practice 
pre-Extropian hard justice, especially capital punishment.  We 
are not depriving people of the rest of a short life but of 
relative eternity!

It is quite possible that we will be able to cure the 
imbalances, injustices and so on that lead to most if not all 
crimes in the near future.  At the point we can then we notice 
that criminals are victims of several afflictions themselves. We 
might well look back and see our old attitudes as the equivalent 
to torturing the mentally ill and epileptics in bygone times.

As has mandatory sentencing practices that have filled our 
prisons to overflowing and should strike fear and loathing into 
everyone.

We all have a tremendous amount to fear from this "justice" 
system.  A lot of press has been slanted on purpose by the 
powers that be to make us look "soft on crime" and to instill 
the punishment meme.  The results are making this society 
deathly ill imho.

I am not for either one.  I think it is crucially important that 
we learn to see political and social questions in a new light of 
  extropian possibilities as well as the technical questions. 
That we show when we discuss politics and current events that 
being gung-ho extropians does not mean we necessarily have a lot 
of wisdom in other areas or are immune to current memesets is 
simply grist for the mill.  It shows us other places we have 
work to do to get to the sort of future we dream of.

I think there are a lot of very judgmental people on this list 
that could do with a broader sampling of humanity.  This very 
statement assumes that your labels are accurate and say all that 
needs to be said about those who may disagree with you on 
particular issues.  It is part of the the problem.  Simplistic 
labels will not get us very far.

Can you say in one sentence what is Victor Davis Hanson's
criticism? I've not read that book ("Carnage and Culture"),
but I've read the controversial reviews. The reviews turned
me off it.

C.&C. is a book of  a very different topic than the Hanson book
that I did read: "Who Killed Homer?" (classics / Ancient Greece
is Hanson's specialty).

Curt, Greg, and Mike have constructively added to the
discussion on Meso-American vs. Middle Eastern development,
but, alas, we have all been undone by the presence of blanks
within the charts, and the resulting distortion of the graphs
when viewed by various email programs.  For example, according
to Curt's chart (as I cut and paste ascii text), it looks as
though villages first developed in the West at 7000 B.C.,
which is different from what I gave.

So here, belatedly, is a corrected chart where I have used
dashes instead of blanks.  If you have the slightest doubt
about the veracity of the rendering by your software, export
it to an ascii editor, or compare it to the following data:

>From pages 362-363 of "Guns, Germs, and Steel" by Jared Diamond:

                      Fertile Cresent      Meso-America
Writing                  3200 BC              600 BC
States                   3700 BC              300 BC
Metal tools              4000 BC              1000 +AD (Andes)
Chiefdoms                5500 BC              1500 BC
Villages                 9000 BC              1500 BC**
Pottery                  7000 BC*             1500 BC**
Animal dom.              8000 BC              500 BC
Plant dom.               8500 BC              3000 BC

*China is credited with the advent of pottery making 500 years earlier.
**Villages and pottery are both found in the Amazon basin about 6000BC.

Corrected Charts:
B.C. (1000's):   9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0     +1  

Writingxxx------------------------------------------E---------------W----------
Statesxxxx---------------------------------------E-------------------W---------
Metalsxxxx-------------------------------------E-----------------------------W-
Chiefdomsx----------------------------E-----------------------W----------------
Potteryxxx-------------------E--------------------------------W----------------
Animalsxxx-------------E--------------------------------------------W----------

B.C. (1000's):   9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0     +1  

So I still claim that the West's development was probably quicker, no
matter how you slice it.  For example, following Curt's idea, let's graph
them in order of Western discovery:

Metalsxxxx-------------------------------------E-----------------------------W-
Statesxxxx---------------------------------------E-------------------W---------
Writingxxx------------------------------------------E---------------W----------
Animalsxxx-------------E--------------------------------------------W----------
Chiefdomsx----------------------------E-----------------------W----------------
Potteryxxx-------------------E--------------------------------W----------------

B.C. (1000's):   9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0     +1  

The Western development is more tightly clustered in total too.
But if there was diffusion in pottery making and the idea of
villages, then this conclusion is much less clear.

I was surprised that people are still being troubled by popup ads when
surfing. Almost as soon as they started to appear, free software became
available to stop them being downloaded to your PC. I run WebWasher and
Internet Explorer v6 on Win98 SE and never see any popup ads. WebWasher
speeds up surfing as well, as you download a lot less garbage to your PC.
Webwasher is free for personal use from:
http://www.webwasher.com/en/products/wwash/download.htm
Depending on your setup it can occasionally take a few tries to get it
working OK, but once done it needs no further attention. There are many
other alternatives - ask nice Mr Google.

The geocities wombat picture came up fine with no ads on my PC.

I notice that people are also worried about the Yahoo changes in group
preferences possibly generating a lot of spam to your inbox. Well, really!
If you go surfing to a site and it says to you  'Fill up this registration
form with your personal details before you can access this site' how do you
respond? Think carefully now. That's right. You fill their form up with a
load of valid looking garbage including an invalid email address like
anyone@maximus.com and, guess what, you don't get any spam from them.

Be careful. It's a jungle out there!

He says that culture is made from a combination of
"land, climate, weather, natural resources, fate, luck,
a few rare individuals or brilliance, natural disater,
and more", but that it is impossible "to determine
exactly which are the initial catalysts".

That's as close as I can come in one sentence.  ;-)

Perhaps an analogy would be this:  instead (so might
Hanson argue) of asking "what are the reasons that
George Washington was not the same person as Ben
Franklin---that is, what components of genes and
environment caused them to become different people?"
we should instead note that a huge number of
factors made them different people, and therefore
look to the effects that resulted in history as
arising from their separate personalities.

In other words, (he might say), we should often admit
culture as an original or basic cause in our explanations.

The extropians list is sick/dead/dying? Again? Damn, it seems to have been
doing that at least since I joined (mmmm, no, it's not me, really!)

I bet the quality of posts has diminished since the good old days too, is
that right?

    This is the 57'th update of my fly longevity experiments. Experiment
#57 was originally run at the same time as #56, which I reported on some
time ago. The fly experiments have continued, even if there was a hiatus
on my reporting of results. I'll be catching up on my report writing for
the next while.  Recorded average temperature during this experiment was
25.6 C.
    In this experiment I took another look at rice protein, and compared
this with freeze concentrated (FC) purple and white grape juice, both
separately and in combination. The poor survival of the control bottle I
again attribute to pathogens - probably viruses. Grape polyphenols are
known to exert an antiviral effect, so the increase in life expectancy was
not unexpected. I was surprised at the massive longevity increase in rice
protein supplemented flies, which yielded a survival curve comparable to
the best laboratory results obtained with flies stored at similar
temperatures, but under clean room conditions, and with fly food being
renewed regularly. I do not attribute this to any "antiaging" effect of
rice protein, but this supplement does look to be exerting a protective
effect under the adverse conditions I conduct my experiments; that being
no clean room, and no replacement of fly food after an experiment is
started. Roughly speaking, at about 25 C, a day in a fly lifetime, is
about equal to a year in a human lifetime.
    Adding freeze concentrated grape juice to rice protein decreases its
benefits, which again I suspect to be due to inhibition of protein
absorption from acidic fly food.
    There has been very little work investigating any proposed anti-viral
effect of rice protein, although a very good anticancer effect has been
documented in rodents. It is ironic that although the presumed viral
infections, are preventing my looking for "antiaging" effects in flies,
this may not be the case for humans. Maximum fly longevity is known to be
limited by degeneration of motor neurons, but this is not a major lifespan
limiting factor in humans, except for those few burdened with neurological
diseases, such as Huntington's disease. Age associated increases in
mortality follow a different pattern in flies and humans. Viral infections
do appear to be a significant factor limiting human lifespan, both
directly, as well as indirectly though increased risk of cardiovascular
disease and cancer. Could a rice protein supplement help aged humans live
much longer? I do not know the answer to this.

The former "Extropy Bookstore" was recently renamed "ShopExtropy" since it 
seemed a good idea to open up to making available items other than books 
(as we did years ago when I was employed full-time by ExI and had time for 
more activity). I'd like to have trivial but fun and meme-spreading items 
such as bumper stickers, coffee mugs, mousepads, and so on.

Since we don't currently have a staff to handle the logistics centrally, 
what we can do is to give the okay to ExI members who want to get such 
items made. We can sell them from ShopExtropy and divide up any profit by 
agreement. Members end up with useful, fun, and extropically-branded items, 
the designer/producers gets a modest reward, and ExI receives a little 
needed income.

Perhaps we could do a poll on ExI-Community or the new BBS forum to see 
what kinds of items would be popular, then get the ball rolling.

Onward!

Max

P.S. One of my favorite T-shirts was work by Jim Lippard. On the front it read:
"Have you forgotten about Jesus?"
If you wandered around behind him, on the back you read:
"Isn't it about time you did?"

'Yes. And the problem is particularly worrisom for we
who have much of our knowledge and livelihood tied up
in computer systems. Those can be and sometimes are

reclaim them even when all charges are dropped (if any
are actually even made). '>

When the FDA raided the Life Extension Foundation
offices years ago, they seized not only the Foundation
computers, but also those laptops that were the
personal property of anyone who happened to be
present.  LEF eventually defeated the FDA, totally and
completely (and it was the first time the FDA had ever
lost in court.) and I think they collected damages. 
Don't know about the computers.  

I do know that ALH&Co. was raided in the early '90's
by a conglomorate hit squad from several Federal
agencies, who stormed into their offices (the door was
open) with machine guns and siezed everything in site,
including, again, personal laptops belonging to
customers or employees.  Hargis successfully sued and
got everything back, although the laptops drives had
all been formatted.

Since my previous post in which I indicated that I
kind of expected further trouble since I contacted my
Green friend, I received a nice letter from the DMV,
informing me that my van had been "totalled" and
"salvaged" and that I must post haste send them my
plates and title and prepare to go through a nightmare
(been there, etc.) of inspections and fees to
reregister it.  

They based this claim on information which they had
allegedly received from Farmer's Insurance, which paid
me $1,000 a couple months back, in compensation for
damage ensuing when one of their clients ran into my
van as it was legally parked on the street.  I
specifically brought up this issue with the Farmers
agent and was assured that they would not claim the
vehicle was totalled, and the DMV's own code,
available on their site, says very specifically that
only the owner or the owner's insurance can make such
a decision.

Nonetheless, the DMV is citing the fact that I
accepted the $1,000 as proof that I agreed to this
travesty.  There was no attached paperwork with the
check from Farmers and no other written
correspondence.   

It's not like this will kill me, but it will mean a
book or two that I can't get to, a day or two or three
out of my life (probably that much already, given how
stressed I was today.)....   Enough of these little
annoyances together can pretty well halt you in your
tracks.

Brief article about Ganna Walska (credo: "enemy of the average"). 
Polish immigrant/performer/serial divorcee, lived to an active 97.  I
highly recommend visiting her sprawling "Lotusland" garden in Santa
Barbara, California, most famous for its collection of cycads and other
ancient plants (make reservations months ahead of time of possible, a
limited number of visitors are allowed to keep peace with the
neighbors).

I require a very long life to appreciate such gems and hopefully create
one.  And a world of staggering wealth so that many more creations of
"eccentricity, sophistication and deep pockets" may blossom.

AFAIK northern California's best contribution to this genre is the di
Rosa Art/Nature preserve in Napa:

And yet there is ample reason to be royally ticked by Israel

If I felt better physically at the moment and could stand to 
walk for very long, I might be in a protest march against what 
Israel is doing and the US lack of serious effort to stop it.  I 
wouldn't be chanting death to Israel and certainly not death to 
the US though.  There has been altogether too much death 
already.  Trotting out your favorite labels for everyone you 
despise or fear or simply strong disagree with is not helpful. 
Chanting for them to die is most definintely less helpful still.

I worry about anyone who still even thinks in terms of "right" 
and "left" personally.  The game has gone far beyond that. 
Support for Israel is not about "right".  Claiming those who 
oppose support for Israel or at least think we should respond 
strongly against what they are doing now, are anti-Jewish is not 
about "right" either. Such positions of opposition to what is 
now in Israel and between the US and Israel are also not "left" 
and  certainly not "anti-semetic".

When will the human species grow up enough to go beyond its 
simplistic labels and endless disowning of one set of its 
members or another.  After a while it doesn't look like it is 
important which side you agree or disagree with to what degree. 
  What seems important to most people is having some group to 
despise and to distinquish themselves by being other than. 
Chanting "death to X" doesn't help.  Despising those who protest 
  the actions of X doesn't help.  Either we can go beyond our 
own prejudices and first perceptions and rethink what we think 
we know all about or I don't see that much of anything will help 
ever.

There have actually been ups and downs.  I think the last several months
are a good example.  There have been many good Extropian discussions --
mostly I've just lurked in them -- but because of the September 11th
attacks there have been too many discussions of the terrorism on
terrorism -- er, war on terrorism that have had less to do with
Extropianism and more to be about personal political affiliations -- too
many of which I've been an active participant in.

No one has known before, nor could have borne,
For it is rooted in this deepening silence
That is our work and has become our kingdom.
If there were an answer, how could we be free?"
    -- from Edwin Muir's "The Usurpers"

they voluntarily dissolved their organization. 

The main ingredient in their defeat was the persistent resistance of the
population. No revolutions, just an everyday stubborn dislike, minor acts of
defiance, adding up to a great power. If you persist in demanding the right
to use a camera, if you disobey them, if they forcibly take it away from you
(all broadcast to your data bank), and put in prison for "contempt of court"
- well, it's a little step on a long road. If you do have a video, the jury
will believe you more, and there is no power that can stop you from telling
them you have the video, no power to stop you from demanding that it be
admitted, and no judge who can last long against juries who mistrust him.

Today on the NPR I heard about the government of Illinois considering the
videotaping of police interrogations, to reduce the risk of putting innocent
people on death row. The little steps will be taken, but only if we persist
in demanding reciprocal openness, not "privacy" for all.

### Privacy in an illusion if you are dealing with an immoral, corrupt
organization (best made so by lack of accountability), and a useless
impediment in dealing with nice people. The sooner we Brin the world, the
better.

Yes, Samantha, I know your deeply held views already, and am glad you have an 
opportunity to share them. On another point, the speechwriter who wrote Barry 
Goldwater's 1964 'sinker' that helped sink Goldwater's election ".. extremism 
in the defense of liberty is no vice..etc", went on to become a 60's and 70's 
Hippy. :-)

The writer, whose father was a Lutheran pastor, had hung around various 
groups from ultra-right to ultra-left, and was fascinated by the phenomena of 
Jew hatred. He indicated (I can't remember the guy's name) his astonishment 
on why the Jews were regularly attacked by this wide swath of society. He 
concluded that these groups, especially extremists, painted their own patina 
on whatever the Jew happened to be doing. 

I notice from watching the news, from being in yahoo chat, that the 
Jew-haters get inflamed and agitated, when Israel succeeds at something 
audacious militarily. It stirs their blood. The Pope said nothing when, for 
example, the PLO destroyed an ancient synagogue at the Tomb of Joseph. 

The hyprocrisy of the media, its urge to equivocate (at best) its avoidence 
of hard questions to the Muslim states and the PLO (which would then cut-off 
story-producing), the self-interest of the Europeans who import nearly all 
their petroleum from OPEC, is well-known, at least to me. 

My philosophy,  about such disengenious, critics is similar to that of the  
Bedouin: The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.

No.

2 + 2 = 3 or 5 for moderate values of 2.

I agree, and here on Monday morning they have already opened up
most areas. The Israelis routinely conduct such investigations, and
they are one of the few countries that actually finds their own
people guilty of misdeeds.

The Israeli Supreme Court over the weekend ruled that the army had
to turn over Palestinian dead to the Palestinians for example.

This is happening even as we speak.

The problem I have with the concept is that everybody is chasing
after possible Israeli violations while ignoring the fact that
every action undertaken by the Palestinians constitutes an
international war crime.

If the documents seized by the Israelis and being checked by the
U.S. prove to be authentic, Yassir and Slobodan might end up
cellmates.

I would like to point out, though, that much of what we 'know' about
western breakthroughs is highly tentative. Western civilizations were
located generally in highly tropical locales, which allows the jungle to
quickly rot, erode, and cover up things, and it seems that in many
locations that there is still much more to find deeper down you dig, and
much is being discovered about sites long excavated. For example,
Tenochtitlan sports little human figurines all over the place, either
toys or religious items or what is not known. What is known is that
these clay figurines were mass produced in identical molds, revealing a
level of abstract industrial thinking that was quite advanced.
Furthermore, because the fingerprints of the workers packing clay into
the molds can be tracked and the genders of the workers discerned, it
shows that these industrialized jobs slowly shifted from domination by
males to females.

The meso-american civilization's primary problems with advancing their
technology is that they were predominantly located in regions bereft of
any appreciable amount of metal ores outside of gold and silver.
Sedimentary plains like that of Babylon, they didn't have a nearby
Damascus to develop metals technology. By the time of the Conquistadors,
some Toltecs were just starting to experiment with iron, though this
large delay was largely due to the middle ages collapse of the Mayan
civilization due to Tangaroa related environmental changes.

Ken won't be at ConJose; he's been invited to serve as Guest of Honour
at a convention in Poland that clashes with ConJose. (We were discussing
attending ConJose last night in the pub, for reasons that will become
clear if you watch the ConJose website next week.)

I could care less that the Israel is a jewish state.  I only 
care that it behave itself reasonably and that we not have so 
many and deep problematic ties to it.  So why go on as if it is 
simply jew-baiting when I and others say there is something 
wrong with the current situation?  Does the very fact that they 
are Jewish make it impossible to criticise them in any way 
without thereby being automatically anti-Jewish in your mind?

Let me take a different tack on the privacy vs transparency 
issue.  I believe that private individuals should have privacy 
and that public institutions and individuals while working in 
the public servant capacity should not.  The latter allows us 
full scrutiny of the State but does not allow the less than 
trustworthy State full scrutiny of us.  They State has to 
justify its level of scrutiny of its individual citizens 
thoroughly.  That they are our "servants" means we do not have 
to justify scrutiny of how they have "served" us.

The mark of the exceptionally competent is that the violence is never
overt; violence can be far more subtle and indirect than a bludgeon to
the skull. There is no need to accomplish by attrition that which can be
accomplished by intelligent manipulation.

Sorry about taking so long to get back to you.  In private correspondance Olaf Henny told me he was definitely NOT a Nazi sympathizer.  So please don't jump to conclusions about the man.  He is to be respected for standing up against tyranny.

Amen brother!! : )  Actually, I think the Christian life would be of great help to people trying to make it through what is coming.  I still think Christ will be coming back to the shock of many(including those on this list!).    

Damien, I'm glad to see you are reading some good sermons online.  I would have never guessed it! ; )

Ah, well, he needs to be careful what he writes then, because that's certainly
how he comes across.

Well, this isn't a bumper sticker anecdote, but around a year ago, ACS' Jim

LN24UNI (Liquid Nitrogen for you and I)

LONGEVITY BOOTCAMP
Las Vegas, April 27-28

The Longevity Boot Camp, organized by the extropians at the Maximum Life 
Foundation, is coming up soon. Two weeks from now, in Las Vegas, we will be 
gathering to enjoy and benefit from a fascinating program of longevity 
information. If you have never met practical longevity pioneers (and real 
characters!) Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, this is your chance.

Let MaxLife know that you come from ExI: The organizers have generously 
offered to give Extropy Institute a portion of the registration fee of 
anyone who says they heard about it from us. They will also take $100 off 
your registration fee, and an additional $100 for any guest you bring. You 
can find more information here:

Longevity Boot Camp

I just finished reading a book (mini-stories, vignettes) about Rome.
It's the kind of book that I might have written, but much better
(don't you hate that? :-)) Delightful book, and true, to what I
have learned, so far, about Rome. I post some words from the introduction
because I think that there's some applicability to this group
in the psychological aspects of living immortal lives.


<begin quote>

Imagine being three thousand years old. Suppose by some mysterious
process you had managed to avoid the limitations of mortality, and
year after year you keep going, adding more and more experiences to
your life story until you have no choice but to repeat them because
you have exhausted all possibilities.

You are the very essence of what it means to be human. You have had
more than your share of victories and defeats, triumphs and
tragedies, moments of glory and those of abjection, times when you
wish you had never been born and times when you want to go on
forever. You have loved and lost, have abandoned and been left
behind, been rich and poor, skinny and fat, lived high on the hog
and been forced to scramble for a few morsels of stale bread. You
have seen it all, done it all, regretted it all, and then gone back
and done it all again.

You are la città eterna, Rome, the Eternal City.

To live in Rome is to have the capacity to endure everything life
has to offer -- moments of timeless beauty followed by torrents of
ugliness, the bella and the brutta mixed together in a bowl of hot
minestrone that has left nothing out, that encourages you to live
life from a completely different perspective. There is no more
mature place on earth, and that maturity has something to teach you.
Other cities may be older, but Rome still lives its past. Walk
anywhere in the city or the areas surrounding it, and within
minutes you are confronted with the remains of something that could
be up to twenty-five hundred years old, that functioned and was
vital to the daily life of the romani.

Rome is so old that its days of glory, when the empire stretched all
across the Mediterranean and far into Europe, Asia and Africa, ended
well before the development of the Italian language. But by that
time, history had already cast Rome in a leading role. Even if the
stage on which it had starred had long since been taken down, its
Latin culture was carried to the four corners of the earth by the
establishment and dogged vitality of the Roman Catholic Church,
whose theology came to dominate the everyday landscape of the world
like no other institution. It was almost as if the Romans, in their
infinite cleverness, came to see that they no longer needed to bear
the costs of a far-flung empire but would invest their energy in a
religion that would have more lasting effects. Rome would remain the
capo, the boss, while its minions in nearly every other country
would carry out the mission. Its position in the world secure, the
presence of the Church freed the romani to focus on and perfect the
fine art of living well, leaving others to handle the historical
heavy lifting while it devoted itself to the pursuit of pleasure.

The result is a strange anomaly, a sprawling metropolis that feels
like a small town, simply because it no longer has any illusions of
greatness. "Been there, done that" could be the motto of SPQR,
Senatus Populusque Romanus, the name of the city government. Romans
feel no need to prove themselves, to demonstrate to the world that
they still have the ability to command respect, enact their wills,
determine the course of history. Nobody cares about that any longer.
The city's place in history is indelible, and now its inhabitants
want to enjoy Rome's advance age in a manner that befits someone who
is three thousand years old. It's as if, had you lived to reach this
age and had you realized every one of the dreams of your youth, you
had no more worlds to conquer; that your drive, your ambition, your
desire to impress had long since been satisfied, and now you were
unabashedly devoted to the enjoyment of life's everyday pleasures --
eating well, looking good, devoting time to your family, and
accepting the inevitable ups and downs that human existence has no
choice but to offer.

This is Rome and the Romans who live in it, a city and a people of
contrasts and effusion, a place that has lived so many different
lives, in so many different epochs, that all it wants to do is
exist in eternity according to the wisdom of what it has learned.
The lessons are obvious. Life is to be lived passionately,
excessively, publicly -- in bars, restaurants, streets, and piazzas
-- applying charm and style mixed with a healthy respect for
tradition. Romans have big appetites, for theatrical experience as
well as exquisite food.

Ever since I came here for the first time two decades ago, Rome has
been a source of endless fascination to me.  It does this to people.
I am by no means the first to fall under its seductive spell. It
offers itself to the appassionato, one who is impassioned, as would
a lover who invites his or her suitor to find out every way in which
the beloved can be admired, reviled, explored, cursed, caressed,
rejected, made love to, and abandoned. I have heard it said on
numerous occasions that it is difficult to leave Rome, that once it
penetrates your consciousness, all other cities, all other places,
every other mode of living is just so lacking, leaving one with the
feeling that, for better or worse, to live in Rome and to be a
romano is to live at the apex of what is most profound about life;
that what it offers in the way of beauty, of sensuality, of
creativity, no other city can match. Even if New York is more
avant-garde, Paris more elegant, San Francisco fresher and more
naturally dramatic, Rome still holds first place when it comes to
utter devotion to pleasure and to the sheer ability to survive. Its
stories are older, more truthful, more instructive and complex. Its
spirit is still intact, and it provides a new wrinkle on the ancient
quest for everlasting youth. As the Eternal City, Rome's eternity
lies in its wisdom. To live here now is to partake of the infinite,
but to be in the present. You learn to separate yourself from
questions of status, glory, ambition, and striving and live as the
Romans do -- in the moment, with style, flair, and panache. The city
has been host to myriad lives since the days many, many years ago
when a nomadic tribe settled on the Palantine Hill, facing the
Tiber, and became the city of Rome. Not one of those souls has
managed to cheat nature. All have returned to the place from which
they sprung.

(or completely unlike it, one or the other)

Time to rename your book "The Spike" to "The book of Damien".

In one of the darkest of possible ironies, though not
the least bit surprising, the israelis are gradually
turning into nazis.  

The Palestinians, as long as they draw breath, utterly
refuse to allow the theft of their land, their
disposession and humiliation, to be universally
legitimized and propagandistically whitewashed.

"The Rules" of war are "there are no rules".  It is
anecdotal that the British said, "Oh those
dishonorable colonial terrorists (ie Americans-to-be),
they hide behind trees and wear clothing that makes it
hard for them to be seen clearly.  They don't fight by
the rules."  Get a clue.  It's utterly ridiculous to
think that the west or the us or the israelis can make
"the rules" for the Palestinians.  If you want them to
fight by the rules, give them tanks and planes and
nuclear weapons, I'm sure they'll use them to fight
with.  In the meantime, the war will go on, with the
Palestinians fighting however they can until they say
it is over,...or until they are dead to the last
fertile female.  This last, the "final solution", is
where the israelis will have to go, so long as they
refuse to admit to the world that the creation of the
state of israel, (check the FACTS out for yourself,
start with the creation of the Balfour Declaration)
fait accompli though it may be, is nevertheless a
geopolitical crime.

You may have "Hitlered" out already....

John Clark can I get a ruling?

The Israelis didn't steal it, they bought it, and paid top dollar.
The reason the Palestinians are currently dispossessed is because
they lost their land trying to destroy Israel.

The reason they haven't regained any is because they are still
attempting to destroy Israel.

The real fact of the matter is that the other Arab countries
ordered them to leave so they could attack Israel. They were told
any Arabs found living there would be considered traitors. They
also promised that they could keep the Israelis property after they
were destroyed. Didn't work out that way...

I also note you failed to mention that 820,000 Jews were kicked out
of their homes in surrounding Arab countries and their property
confiscated. 546,000 were resettled in Israel with no more than the
cloths on their backs, and at great expense.


Throttle back on the rhetoric.

Nonsense.

I just finished a history of the conflict and the reasons behind it
are nothing like the propaganda you are trying to disseminate. 

It's funny how the anti-Israeli world insists the Israelis play by
some ridiculous rules while the Palestinians get to do whatever,
including terrorism.

Since our recognition of the PLO and Yassir Arafat was based on
their renunciation of terror, and they have resumed their terrorist
ways, (like they ever stopped!) the logical thing to do is rescind
our recognition of them.

Well, I already published a bleakly funny novel called THE BOOK OF

of prophets only being recognized IN their own land...

This is the title of an article in the May issue of WIRED.

According to the article there are two new books coming out of
interest to the list Francis Fukuyama's "Our Posthuman Future" and
Gregory Stocks "Redesigning Humans". Fukuyamas's is apparently
dystopic.

An interesting article with discussion of such ideas as artificial
chromosomes, they would be created with on/off genetic switches to
activate/deactivate enginneered genes.

Extropian music fans will also apreciate that this is a music
issue, featured article and cover on Moby.

I respectfully disagree.

An army of illiterate entropic fundamentalists could certainly put
a major crimp in our plans, hopes, and dreams...

Know what's even worse?  An army of illiterate extropic fundamentalists.  I
agree; this thread is dead and it's time to kill it.  Everything "could" put
a crimp in everything else; we live in an entangled world where anything can
suddenly kill us at any time.  That's what prioritized risks are for.  I say
let's go back to discussing Leon Kass or Bill Joy.

"Extremism in defense of extropy is no vice, moderation in pursuit of a
transhumanist future is no virtue." 

You can quote me on that third hand paraphrasing...

As I see it, there are different levels of "on topic" discussions for 
Extropians:

Primary Extropian topics:  those that directly involve the Extropian 
Principles and of interest to Transhumanists more than most humans.  
This would include self-modification, future technology, space 
exploration, etc.

Secondary Extropian topics:  those that don't directly involve the 
Extropian Principles and are of no interest to transhumanists except 
that we need to address them to prevent them from interfering with our 
movement.  This would include Luddites, religion, legal restrictions, 
public opinion, etc.  We probably don't care about these issue except 
that they won't go away and probably need to be monitored.

Tertiary Extropian topics:  those that don't directly involve the 
Extropian Principles and are of interest to all humans equally whether 
they are transhumanists or not.  This would include guns, politics, 
self-defense, computer security, personal finance, etc.  Extropians may 
want to excel in these areas as a support function to the primary 
extropian ideals, but they are of no more importance to transhumanists 
than to any other humans.

Un-extropian topics:  those that don't have anything to do with the 
Extropian Principles and not of any special interest to transhumanists 
or other humans, but we want to discuss anyway.  Jokes, the latest 
movies, updates about how hellish our boss is, meetings for beer, etc.  
Not even related to extropian topics, but communications that humans 
have with their friends anyway.

Anti-extropian topics:  those that run counter to the Extropian 
Principles and are directly avoided by most transhumanists.  (There will 
always be exceptions.)  These topics would probably be off-limits in any 
case, and would include those beliefs that are contradictory to 
transhumanism.  Anti-freedom, anti-science, and other negentropy forces 
would be examples in this category.


While the Primary Extropian topics are definitely desired, it is the 
Secondary and Tertiary topics which create most of the volume.  These 
topics are related to our interests, and are vital in many ways, but are 
also seen as off-topic by many members.  I think these cause the most 
frustration because they are of no interest to large segments of the 
group.


Perhaps we can split these off into other lists somehow.  Comments?

Actually, I recall writing, possibly in the Singularitarian Principles, that
"Stupidity in the service of the Singularity is no virtue."  Obviously I
agree with you about the virtues of extremism, but it has to be normative
extremism, not Standard Hunter-Gatherer-Style Distorted Human Extremism.

"It's so cool, it's cryo" and "Cryo!" (for "Cool" or "Way cool") are phrases I wrote and which are now included in the Walker Museum's online net.art data links.  The memetic phrases come from a NY show "Meme Breeders" produced by Ebon Fisher, which I was part of some years ago.  I was hoping this phrase would really catch on (still hoping), and it's a lot of un when I hear someone say "Cryo!" instead of "Cool".

Does anybody on the planet know what the "Christian way of life" would be
like, on all levels from individual to the complete society? In other
words, is there anyone who could describe such a way of life as well as
so-called Christian missionaries describe pagan cultures?

I humbly submit that three of the above principles of Extropianism --
Self-Transformation, Open Society, and Self-Direction -- mesh on social
level with libertarianism (and free market economics), so I don't see
libertarian politics as a side issue here.  In fact, I also believe that
all other politics tend to be against the principles because they work
against one or more of them.

However, it would probably be best, given the level of emotion (from me
too) if we focused on the examples Harvey uses.  Also, I doubt after
about 2300 years of arguing over what's the right way to organize
society, we're going to persuade each other any of us has the solutions
here.  (Let's wait for the Signularity, right?:)

Cheers!

Fukuyama's book has been mentioned here, actually, and there's the debvate
between him and Stock at the Reason site. 

Here's the stupid and rabid blurb for his book on the British publisher's
site:

http://www.profilebooks.co.uk/

A book exploring the
             consequences of the
             biotechnology
             revolution. When it
             is published the first
             human being will
             have been cloned.
             But will 'it' truly be
             human? Is a baby
             whose personality
             has been chosen
             from a gene
             supermarket still a
             human? If we
             choose what we
             create what happens
             to morality? Is this
             the end of human
             nature?

`It'. Godawbloodymighty.

Maybe standard issue boilerplate: "Better future through science and
technology - WWW.EXTROPY.ORG". A politically effective statement should
emphasize the "Extropy" word and Website, and vaguely attract those who
might best appreciate our memes - persons with strong proscience leanings.

Or "Future's Friends - WWW.EXTROPY.ORG", "Transhumanity forever!
www.extropy.org", "Long live the Friendly AI ;-)"

The economics that drive the problems is interesting,
although it probably hasn't changed that much since
Bastiat did his analyses.  "The law is just.  It
forbids both the rich and the poor man from sleeping
under the bridges at night."  Proudhon or Voltair, I
forget....

A wealthy person can be a hard target, legally.  He
has the capital resources to fight back, probably win,
and even collect damages.  Thus, the law typically
goes after the targets of opportunity, the poor or
middle class, especially of color.  A thousand dollars
is a thousand dollars, right?  And a million is a
million...  

But we all know that if a corporate executive schemes
to scam a million or two or fifty by means of phony
partnerships and crooked accounting and insider
trading based on planning all the aforementioned, then
when he's finally caught when it all hits the fan, he
might possibly spend a year or two at a federal honor
farm, while if a low income person steals a hundred
bucks worth of merchandise, then he may be gone for a
while, especially if hes done it before (as though
this is the first time for the executive).

Similarly, in the ongoing case I mentioned before, I
have discovered some interesting things about
ownership in People's Republic of California.  It
turns out that, according to the DMV information
people with whom I talked yesterday, if an insurance
company sends in a report to them that your car has
been "totalled," then no power on earth will convince
the DMV that this report was in error.  At that point,
you have just lost your vehicle.  Interesting that a
ficticious "person," a corporation, is taken at its
word, and no denial by a real person has any weight.

Consider now two very similar vehicles, of the same
size, power, carrying capacity, etc., but one of them
is a bare bones Toyota or Chevrolet, while the other
is a luxury car.  Both of them receive body damage
that will cost $2501 estimate to repair.  But the one
car is worth $2500, by Blue Book, even though it is
far above average in terms of maintenance, while the
other is worth $25,000.  Guess who loses their vehicle?

Speaking of 'remastered races' and cloning, has any SF
author yet portrayed the poor clones as hunted fugitives?
There are so many parallels with earlier evil persecutions,
you know.

Suppose I go to China or some other advanced nation in
a couple of years, get a little Lee, raise him in some
free country, e.g., on board my own yacht since I can't
name any free countries, and then when he's five or so,
claim my citizenship and attempt to return to the U.S.
with him.  What will the Authorities do with me, or to
him?

A truly magical prospect. I wonder what would be the physical manifestation
of a solution to an unsolvable problem - would it open the way to actions
which at present seem to be forbidden by the known laws of physics? (this is
just a totally uninformed deliberation on my part).

Subject: 'tunneling' the Turing barrier


<<< Is there any hope for quantum computing to challenge 
the Turing barrier, i.e. to solve an undecidable problem,
to compute an uncomputable function?
According to Feynman [1] the answer is negative. 
This [-see below-] paper reopens the case: 
We will discuss solutions to a few simple problems 
which suggest that quantum computing is theoretically 
capable of computing uncomputable functions.
The main features of our quantum 'device' are:
a special type of continuity, the choice of test-vectors 
from a special class of trajectories of two Markov processes 
working in two different scales of time and realized 
as elements of an infinitely-dimensional Hilbert space 
(infinite superposition), the ability to work with 'truly random'
test-vectors in an evolution described by an exponentially 
growing semigroup and the possibility to obtain the result 
from a single measurement.
In deciding the halting /non-halting status of a non-halting machine,
our 'device' is capable to 'announce'(with a positive probability)
the non-halting status in a ?nite amount of time, well before the
'real' machine reaches it (in an in ?nite amount of time).
Hence, the challenge was to design a procedure
that detects and measures this tiny, but non-zero probability.
In what follows a quantum solution is a solution designed 
to work on a quantum computer.
The discussion is mathematical and no engineering claims will be made;
in particular, when speaking about various quantum devices which 
will be constructed, we will use quotes to emphasize 
the mathematical nature of our constructs. >>>

Note that these authors also think that 
'The results discussed in this paper <...> go beyond 
the pure mathematical aspects; they might impose 
the re-examination of the mind-machine issue.' [2]

There is a an article in the MIT technology review this month on the
development of sensors powered by vibrations of walls and HVAC ducts. The
sensors are not commercially available yet. Somehat similar to the locator
network in Vinge's "A deepness in the sky".

Subject: Free Energy and How to Capture It


A few years ago, I took a big sub-woofer and connected
the input leads to an LED.  Sure enuf, you bang the
speaker and the LED lights up.  Put enough of these
speakers by a freeway with a full-wave bridge
rectifier on each one and you could get some
appreciable power, although it would still be very
inefficient, as the speakers are not optimzed to work
as generators.

Similarly, on at least two independent occasions, I've
met people who invented RF powered radios for their
own use.  One guy was an Air Force Mechanic in the
Czech military.  He disguised his radio as a hearing
aid.  It had two tuning circuits.  First you tuned the
power circuit to the strongest source you could find. 
Then you tuned the listening circuit to whatever you
wanted.  He said he used to listen to BBC and Radio
Free Europe all day long and no one suspected a thing.
 The other guy was a neighbor of mine who repaired
TVs, etc., for a living, back in the early '60's.  He
essentially did the same thing, just to see if it
would work.  In most urban areas there is quite a bit
of broadcast power passing through every cubic meter
that currently dissipates to entropy.

There is quite a lot of sonic vibration out there as
well, man-made or otherwise.  So, how to optimally
design a system that tunes itself to either transient
or continous harmonic vibrations?

PKD, John Varley, and, I'm sure, many others whose names escape me.
Also, the films "Bladerunner" and "The Sixth Day" had just this.

I think your idea should be made into reality with a big batch of bumperstickers printed up.  The other ideas people have put forward have been very clever, but your catch-phrase will best capture public interest.  

My own idea for a bumper sticker is...
"Technology & Humanity -Make a Real Difference! WWW.EXTROPY.ORG" 

Or just for today I could make up a bumpersticker which says, "It's my Birthday, So Stay the Hell Out of my Way!! : )"  

I went and saw The Lord of the Rings for the second time with a friend who had never seen it before.  The magic was still there for me, but with my friend's film school background & unique perspective he had some complaints.  

Bottomline for me, the film touched my heart due to the fine cast and script, while not becoming overwhelmed by the special effects.  And they now have a preview of the next film tacked onto it!!  It looks really good folks!

My thanks to everyone who wished me a Happy Birthday! 

best wishes,

John : )

It was educational to watch how much difficulty society has had
with something as trivial as cell phones.  In a very weak sense, they
represent an enhanced ability to the user, a very slight advantage.
Schools wanted to disallow them, they were considered rude, etc,
even if the person did not speak loudly.

Shortly we will see wearable computers become practical.  The
cell phone adventure of the past 20 years gives us a vision of what
it will be like to have a wearable, especially if we get good enough
with them to create a practical advantage over non-wearers.  spike

Huge hydrogen stores found below Earth's crust
Discovery suggests near limitless supply of clean fuel
    
Robert Matthews     
Vancouver Sun   

Monday, April 15, 2002

LONDON -- Scientists have discovered vast quantities of hydrogen gas, widely 
regarded as the most promising alternative to today's dwindling stocks of 
fossil fuels, lying beneath the Earth's crust.

The discovery has stunned energy experts, who believe that it could provide 
virtually limitless supplies of clean fuel for cars, homes and industry.

Governments across the world are urgently seeking ways of switching from 
conventional energy sources such as coal, gas and nuclear power to cleaner, 
safer alternatives.

Energy specialists estimate that oil production will start to decline within 
the next 10 to 15 years, as the economically viable reserves start to run 
out. 

Hydrogen gas has been hailed as the ultimate clean fuel, as it produces only 
water when burned. Until now, however, moves to switch to a "hydrogen 
economy" have been dogged by the cost of making the gas. The two most common 
ways -- extraction from natural gas and sea water -- are expensive and create 
environmental problems.

Now scientists at the American space agency Nasa have found that the Earth's 
crust is a vast natural reservoir of hydrogen which has become trapped in 
ancient rocks.

The team made its discovery while trying to explain how bacteria live many 
miles below the Earth's surface. Such bugs have no access to sunlight, 
forcing them to rely on another source of energy for life. Scientists 
suspected that hydrogen was the source.

According to Professor Friedemann Freund and colleagues at Nasa's Ames 
Research Center in California, the gas is produced when water molecules 
trapped inside molten rock break down to release hydrogen.

"In the top 20 kilometres of the Earth's crust, the conditions are right to 
produce a nearly inexhaustible supply of hydrogen," said Professor Freund.

Studies by the team of common rock types such as granite and olivine have 
revealed extraordinarily high levels of trapped hydrogen. Professor Freund 
said that his team had "tantalizing evidence" that as much as 1,000 litres of 
hydrogen may be trapped in each cubic metre of rock.

Although formidable engineering problems remain to be overcome in abstracting 
the gas, the sheer volume of the Earth's crust means that such a high 
concentration would solve the world's energy problems.

"Everyone thinks of gas and oil as the main sources, and it's very difficult 
to get anyone to take alternatives seriously," said Dr. David Elliott, the 
professor of technology policy at the Open University in London. "The 
possibility of vast reserves of hydrogen in the Earth's crust could change 
that mindset."

The low yield of energy from burning hydrogen compared to gas, however, means 
that vast quantities of rock would have to be mined. 

Professor Freund believes that the extraction and crushing of rock to extract 
the trapped hydrogen is likely to be prohibitively expensive. The reaction 
which creates the gas takes place at depths far below those involved in oil 
extraction, which are typically about two miles down. 

The most promising source of the hydrogen may be geological "traps" similar 
to those now drilled for natural gas. Professor Freund said: "One of these 
natural hydrogen fields is already known to exist in North America, and 
extends from Canada to Kansas."

There are all ready split-off lists.  I oppose splitting off any 
topics here.  I think we already have our minds too split and 
insufficient integration of all the factors crucial to our 
success and coming to reasonable understanding with one another 
as it is.  The above topics are only the technological aspects. 
In my opinion, those will not be the most difficult parts of 
getting from here to there.

I suggest taking a closer look at the US INS domicile rules.
You don't have the automatic legal status living abroad with
your 'family' that  Little Lee would be able to live with you
in the U.S. when you return.

I talked about this last week. Inserting that part of
last week's ("re: A logician challenges the Constitution")
message:

----------
BTW, (seriously  now) has anyone here taken a look lately at the INS
definition of domicile? Some things changed in 1997. A large class
of US citizens living abroad with their families would not be
permitted to bring their (nonUS citizen) spouse and children to
live with them in the U.S. based on the current domicile rules. They
are effectively in exile (perhaps are not even aware of that fact).

"Domicile" is a dicey issue, more determined case by case.  It's a
wrong assumption to think that being born in the U.S. and/or
spending most of your life in the U.S. automatically gives you legal
status to have your (nonUS citiizen) spouse and children live with
you in the U.S. If you are a U.S. citizen living abroad and
building your life outside of the U.S., you should probably be aware
of INS domicile definition(s).

See: INS Meaning(s) of domicile.

[One aspect I found interesting was the section
"In the employment of"]

And: Lynne Marie Stockman's case (I learned about this
domicile issue from her)

Neither Blade Runner nor The Sixth Man featured a poor
helpless, pathetic, true clone, namely, a small child
who of course is fully human, and therefore as saintly
in our society as any other child. I don't know about
the other SF that Dan mentioned.

Yes, and cell phone users arouse resentment already
---some of the resentment deserved, of course.  But
fine clothing used to do the same, and culturally
we're very used to it.  This is something else:

Clearly all the conservative tendencies in our society
are uniting to demonize the creation of clones, but
actual clones must engender even more sympathy than
the child in the movie AI.  This coming paradox can
obviously be exploited in SF, but the novels that I
remember in which children are persecuted, e.g., SLAN
and The Midwich Cuckoos, were about mutants, not true
human children.

This is solving the wrong problem.  There is no shortage of hydrogen.  
We can get it from sea water.  The problem is extracting it cheaply 
enough to get a net gain in energy.  This discovery just provides 
another source of hydrogen that takes more energy to extract than it 
provides.  It does not progress the state of the art for using hydrogen 
as an energy source.

I disagree.  I hate this quote.  Extremism is evil, even if it is for a 
good cause.  Then ends do not justify the means.  We must keep logic and 
rationality in mind on every issue.  No issue is so important that we 
break the rules, don't consider the consequences, or give ourselves 
special considerations that we do not allow for others.  This is the 
trap that all evil empires and religious cults fall into.  The cause 
becomes so great that we don't have time to plan, we don't have time to 
consider, we don't have time to be careful.  When the speed becomes of 
the essence so that delays are unacceptable, corners are cut, security 
is lost, mistakes are made, and catastrophes happen.

Bogosity meter pegged.  1000 liters of hydrogen is close enough to 90 
grams.  Not
enough energy in 90 grams of hydrogen when combined with oxygen in air to do
much with a cubic meter of rock.  spike

    A truly magical prospect. I wonder what would be 
    the physical manifestation of a solution to an unsolvable 
    problem - would it open the way to actions which 
    at present seem to be forbidden by the known laws 
    of physics? (this is just a totally uninformed deliberation 
    on my part).

Incompleteness, Complexity, Randomness and Beyond
Authors: Cristian S. Calude
Comments: 16 pages
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0111118
Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems have the same scientific 
status as Einstein's principle of relativity, Heisenberg's 
uncertainty principle, and Watson and Crick's double helix 
model of DNA. Our aim is to discuss some new faces of the 
incompleteness phenomenon unveiled by an information-theoretic 
approach to randomness and recent developments in quantum 
computing. 

Strong Determinism vs. Computability
Authors: C. Calude, D. I. Campbell, K. Svozil, D. Stefanecu
Comments: 13 pages
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9412004
Are minds subject to laws of physics? Are the laws 
of physics computable? Are conscious thought processes 
computable? Currently there is little agreement as to 
what are the right answers to these questions. Penrose 
goes one step further and asserts that: {\it a radical 
new theory is indeed needed, and I am suggesting, moreover, 
that this theory, when it is found, will be of an essentially 
non-computational character.} The aim of this paper is 
three fold: 1) to examine the incompatibility between 
the hypothesis of strong determinism and computability, 
2) to give new examples of uncomputable physical laws, 
and 3) to discuss the relevance of G\"odel's Incompleteness 
Theorem in refuting the claim that an algorithmic theory
---like strong AI---can provide an adequate theory of mind. 
Finally, we question the adequacy of the theory of 
computation to discuss physical laws and thought processes.

C. Let's Defuse the Rhetoric by Sharpening Our Vocabulary


	 On December 7, 2002 of last year, we wrote that ordinary English has
proven itself to be inadequate to facilitate the debate that will soon be
under way in the U.S. Senate. We would like to recommend the following
terminology whenever speaking about the distinction between Human
Therapeutic Cloning and Reproductive Cloning, as follows:

	 1. The term preembryo shall be defined as a pre-implantation zygote
during the interval from conception to approximately [10 - 14] days
thereafter.

	Conception is the fertilization of a human ovum (a haploid [n] female
gamete) by a sperm (a haploid [n] male gamete). A zygote contains a full
[2n] complement of chromosomes [22x2 + XY or XX =3D 46 chromosomes] in each
and every cell. In particular, a preembryo will normally develop by
successive mitotic divisions starting with a single diploid cell into a
multicellular blastocyst first by forming a morphological ball and later
by invagination, that will subsequently contain several hundreds of cells
(including a large number of undifferentiated pluripotent embryonic stem
cells that are fated to form the tissues of the fetus).

	Blastocysts containing non-diploid cells are typically pathological and
will not normally implant.

	 2. The term embryo shall be reserved exclusively for a
post-implantation blastocyst that has begun the process of placentation
(formation of a placenta within the wall of the womb) accompanied by
differentiation into three fundamentally different tissue types
(endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), with neural streak formation and the
beginnings of organogenesis (formation of a spinal cord).

	 3. The term fetus shall be reserved for a prenatal post-organogenesis
embryo that has developed mature limbs (with visible digits [fingers and
toes]), a beating heart, and other distinguishable features of a human
face (eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and so on).

	 4. The term neonate (or baby) shall be reserved for a post-fetus that
has been delivered either vaginally or by C-Section and whose umbilical
cord has just been severed from its placenta.

	 5. The term person shall be reserved for an embryo whose fate has been
unambiguously determined to be a single individual (by ultrasound or
other visual means for examination). Note that a preembryo's fate could
be multiparous (as with identical twins [both male or both female]), in
which case there would be two (or more) persons derived from a single
preembryo. Conversely, note that, on rare occasions, two preembryos
(fraternal twins presumably of the same gender) could fuse to form a
single person (with chimera formation at the cellular level).

	 The value of this careful terminology is to obviate the absurd,
emotionally-charged religious debates that arise from statements of the
form: "People begin at conception," which is completely inconsistent with
the facts of biology. One might just as well say that "People begin with
eggs or sperm" or "People begin with a twinkle in a man's eye as he spies
a beautiful woman across the street." At what seemingly-arbitrary point
should we seek to punish someone for being disrespectful of sentient
human life? Although we cannot be sure of the precise moment, it seems to
make the most sense, on conservative grounds, to appreciate that, since
preembryos can never be a described as a person using the definitions
above, we can never penalize someone for "killing" a preembryo on moral
grounds. In the same sense that one cannot be charged with the crime of
"killing" a dead person, one cannot be charged with the crime of
destroying or "killing" a preembryo. Linguistically speaking, the object
of the verb "kill" is required to be either a person or at least a living
creature for the word to even make sense in English. Just as one does not
normally speak of killing a tree, except metaphorically, one cannot speak
about "killing" a cluster of undifferentiated cells that is not yet a
person.=20


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D


They err in saying you can't kill a tree. I'd have preferred they speak
of not being able to kill toenail or hair clippings, or a discarded
placenta, but then one still runs into the problem of people's
sensitivities.

Anatole France, I believe:

"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich, as well as the poor, to
sleep under the bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread."

I believe the idea is to look for liberated hydrogen accumulated in traps. 
Given that virtually no high-hydrogen geogas sources are known, it must be 
either damn rare, or be too deep (I believe 20 miles were mentioned, even 
if the averade depth was just a few km that'd put it out of reach in most 
places.

Whoa!  How do you define "extremism" -- before going off on a moral
tangent here?

Giving up ? :-)

I'm not giving up on looking at the ways that societies and cultures
live and work together, and I think that it is the largest problem
that faces humankind on this planet today, if humans are going to
survive to any 'transhuman' state. Our own extropian microcosm is a
perfect example that we have the same kinds of problems here. How can
we expect to travel to and live outside of this planet if we cannot
find how to live on Earth with other humans, and how to discuss these
kinds of issues, even in our own extropian community?

In my opinion, the solutions *do* exist for how to accomplish this
feat, if only we open our eyes, listen, experience, pay attention,
and educate ourselves, hopefully without the extra baggage of ignorant
prejudices (some compassion would help too). History has provided us
with many pieces of the puzzle: We know many ways of working and
living together with other humans that *don't work*, as well as many
that *do* work. So then, use that information. In this era, we have
the best chance to take positive actions because we have an abundance
of present and past information, more accessible than ever before.  So
I say: Use it!  Learn. Try. Our humankind's survival depends on it.

It seems to have emerged, that the major motivation for the EC's ardent 
support of Chairman Arafat, is a fear that their large Muslim populations 
will also produce homicide bombers. Therefore, they can take public positions 
to mitigate against the occurrence of such attacks. If true, this is sad,

Just to be petty and definitionistic (yeuch! horrible word...) Don\'t we want to survive to a *Posthuman* state? I think we are Transhuman state the moment we make the decision that we want to overcome our human one.

I\'m of the opinion that we can learn more about how we can live on this planet more effectively by looking at what we have to do to live on another planet (Mars for example). 

<<In my opinion, the solutions *do* exist for how to accomplish this feat, if only we open our eyes, listen, experience, pay attention, and educate ourselves, hopefully without the extra baggage of ignorant prejudices (some compassion would help too).

Yes, I too think many solutions exist, and most require us to find solutions that result in \'win-win\' answers (to use a Management buzzword). To me the \'win-win\' is pure enlightened self-interest. But we must try to lift ourselves above narrow tribalism to succeed. Tribalism may once have been essential for the earlier development of mankind, but now it\'s becoming an increasing danger. 

<< So I say: Use it!  Learn. Try. Our humankind\'s survival depends on it. >>

But \'humankinds survival\'? That may have to be sacrificed to our Posthumanity... :)

You guys are pretty negative. Given the quantities this is about I'd say that 
even a 1% chance to overcome the problems should warrant to put EUR100M into 
investigating that. It's clear that traditional mining and driving out the 
gas with heat is not applicable here. Maybe someone else has other means. 
Eric Drexler might have an idea if you give him half of those EUR100M.

Much better R&D ROI on thin-film photovoltaics, high-efficiency water
electrolysis and fuel cells. I would even considered putting it into
alternative higher-risk scenarios, like developing an artificial
photosynthetic center that is cheap and stable enough for practical use.

Really, looking for ways to liberate high-pressure geohydrogen bound in
bulk rock (traps are different) a few miles under your feet is another
nonproblem nonsolution.

As far as I can tell, no extremist ever thinks of themselves as an
extremist, but it is really a statement about how we judge the actions of
others. The statement "extremism is evil" will therefore always necessarily
be true, because by our very use of the word we are stating that we have
already judged the perpitrator that has become the recipient of this label
as having acted in an excessive manner and excess in western morality is
nearly always judged an evil (CF Aristotle - the Nicomachean Ethics - the
section on "the doctrine of mean").

Going back to lurk mode...

Whoa!  How do you define "extremism" -- before going off on a moral
tangent here?

This is all good stuff, particularly fuel cells, which is why there is no 
public funding needed for this. I think I remember announcements by 
Daimler-Chrysler and Honda to enter the market with fuel cell driven cars in 
a few years. Lots of companies invest heavily in all kinds of methods to make 
electricity/fuel out of light.

There is no hope to raise capital when the time frame for ROI is as long as 
here. When investments are in the national interest but don't improve the 
shareholder value, govt has to do it. Just think of space flight. Without 
govt support we would not have a single satellite up there today.

I did not advocate to put 100M into this. I am just advocating to take *any* 
idea serious that has the potential to rid us from our dependance of fossil 
fuels until it can be disproved, such as cold fusion was. I mean *disproved*, 
not just the gut-feeling says: "impossible"

Nay-saying is always easy but it never solves a problem. It is, in principle 
at least, possible to free the hydrogen with a positive yield of energy.

I'm not an extremist, (nor illiterate) although I've been
inappropriately labeled as such.

When you apply logic and rationality to politics you are often seen
as extreme, since it's decisions are usually made based on
emotions, and your position violates others preconceived notions.

Take the middle east problem. Two groups want to live in the same
area. Logic says they should negotiate and come to a settlement
whereas they can both live there.

But one group refuses to live with the other group, so no
negotiation is possible. The only current solution is for them to
battle it out till one party is eliminated, or the party refusing
to negotiate changes it's postion, or a new solution is found.

Simple application of the principals.

No. But you must understand that these are earmarks of superior 
technology, and hence not really debatable. 

You'll be thrilled to hear that we are currently working on implementing
the new and improved <ULTRAVIOLET> tag, which will become available for
the next version of the BBS. Please upgrade your screen, your computer,
and your retina to be able to use the ExXxSCREAM SKR33N[1] technology.

The lesson here being to wait to commit crimes until you become a
corporate executive. This does not sound alltogether bad to me.

Nowadays I do all development using Opera. If it works in Opera, it'll
work in MSIE. Netscape is another case. MSIE will attempt to render
whatever it is given, and thus is not a suitable choice for a
development browser. Final testing must be done in multiple browsers and
platforms but imho Opera is the best for development.

I think that a distinction between extreme means and extreme ends (and
subsets of both) should be made. Dovetailing with our recent discussion
of the laws of war, and current western predeliction with personal
safety and distain for personal sacrifice for others, I think that it
can be said that there is extremism and then there is extremism, which
is not to say that there is marklar and marklar (;)). It would be
considered extreme to be willing to sacrifice one's own life to further
an end, but not morally repugnant, while it would also be extreme to
sacrifice the lives of innocent bystanders (i.e. civilians) to the same
end, but this *would* be morally repugnant.

Another test of morality is to ask "Who *would* you be willing to kill
to guarrantee a transhuman future?" A luddite? What sort of luddites
would be moral to kill, and what sorts would not be?

We are, after all, talking about the future of the human race, and if we
don't establish a tranhuman future, then Planet Earth is doomed to a
rather dismal malthusian extermination from disease, hunger, and lack of
resources. If we don't build a tranhuman future, billions of people
*WILL* die. No ifs, ands, or butts. This *WILL* happen if the Luddites
win.

To analogize, if you KNEW in 1936 that the Holocaust was guaranteed to
happen if certain things didn't happen, what steps would you consider
morally acceptable, and what ones unacceptable, in order to prevent that
future from occuring?

This is why I think that a little extremism in defense of extropy is no
vice. This is not to say that there isn't anything I wouldn't do. I've
been most vehement about the laws of war here, and I stand by the
standard of behavior they demand.

The difficulty, though, is that the Luddites are not a nation, not an
army, but are engaged in an organized opposition to the future we
envision as most desirable. They have the advantage in money, in public
sympathy, and command the high ground in the school and university
system, and their dogma is far more accepted in the halls of government
and the media. The terrorism they perpetrate is generally accepted by
the general public as just.

It is often said that Germany lost WWII because it lost a mere handful
of its best minds (primarly nuclear physicists), though it is as often
said that the wars end was preordained by industrial logistics, just as
the Cold War's result was ordained by the relative efficiencies of two
economic systems. Both of these ignore the Nietcheian Will as a force
involved in either result. A free people will always be more motivated
to triumph over an enslaved people than the reverse, but only if the
free people recognise that there is a conflict and are determined to win
it.

What's this groupism business?  Some Israelis want to ethnically
cleanse the Palestinians.  Some want to live in two separate states,
and some want to live mingled.  Some Palestinians want to 
ethnically cleanse the Isrealis.  Some want to live in two separate
states, and some want to live mingled.  Right now it looks like the
cleanser Israelis are succeeding in getting the cleanser Palestinians
to play into their hands, but that hardly makes them the good guys,
nor does it make the many peacefully oriented Palestinians disappear.

This has not been my experience.  In my experience, applying logic and 
rationality is viewed as being "moderate" or "compromising".  Extremists 
always seem to "know" what must be done, and they want to act 
immediately.  Extremists do not use logic and rationality, and they 
consider those who do to be obstructionists.

This is the exact OPPOSITE of the extropian principles.  The example 
gives up on logic and negotiation.  It replaces them with emotions, 
force and violence.  It concludes that genocide of one faction is the 
only answer.  This is extremism, and about as unextropian as you can get.

Your definition and example seem diametrically opposed to my definitions 
and examples.

The human mind has long fascinated psychologists

  
  
Helen Briggs 
BBC News Online  
 
 
Australian scientists say they have created a "thinking cap" that will 
stimulate creative powers. 
The invention raises the possibility of being able to unlock one's inner 
genius by reawakening dormant parts of the brain. 



This shock finding will challenge many of our conventional views regarding 
creativity 
 
Steve Williams, Institute of Psychiatry  
It is based on the idea that we all have the sorts of extraordinary abilities 
usually associated with savants. 

According to scientists at the Centre for the Mind in Sydney, these hidden 
talents can be stimulated using magnetism. 

Professor Allan Snyder and colleague Elaine Mulcahy say tests on 17 
volunteers show their device can improve drawing skills within 15 minutes. 

They intend to submit their work for publication in a scientific journal. 

The news, reported in Chemistry and Industry magazine, has been given a 
cautious welcome by experts in the UK. 

'Unconscious skills' 

Professor Steve Williams of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, said 
Professor Snyder was a highly respected international scientist and he was 
looking forward to reading the scientific paper. 

 
Many autistics are accomplished artists
 
He told BBC News Online: "This shock finding that everyone might possess 
unconscious skills that can be 'switched on' with magnetic stimulation will 
challenge many of our conventional views regarding creativity." 

The inspiration for the device comes from savant syndrome, a condition 
portrayed in the Hollywood film Rain Man. 

Savants are extraordinarily gifted. They may have amazing memories or excel 
at maths, music or art. But they also have developmental disorders such as 
autism. 

Mind state 

One theory behind savant syndrome is that the right side of the brain 
overcompensates for damage to the left hemisphere. 

The skills most often seen in savants are those associated with the right 
side. 

Savant syndrome  
Rare condition in which persons with various developmental disorders have 
astonishing abilities or talents 
Savants also have a prodigious memory 
Typical savant skills include music, art, and mathematical skills 
About 10% of persons with autistic disorder have some savant skills  
According to Professor Snyder, it might be possible to train someone to 
access this state by controlling their brain waves. 

David Potter of the National Autistic Society, a UK charity, said the 
research was fascinating. 

"Some scientists believe that the essence of creativity is not a state of 
mind but an activity," he told BBC News Online. 

"Whether Snyder and Mulcahy's research will enable the expression of savant 
skills without accompanying impairments remains to be seen."

"Thou shalt not commit murder."  Does this need to be an Extropian 
Principle?

"What sort of luddites would be moral to kill?"  Are you kidding?  We 
can't just kill people because they believe differently than us.  We 
can't just kill them because they lobby congress to outlaw cloning.  We 
can't just kill them because the turn public opinion against science and 
set us back a whole generation.  Our tools are free-speech, free-market, 
logical debate, scientific method, and critical thinking.  If our ideas 
don't win with these methods, I don't see any reason they should win at 
all.

If we replace free-thought and debate with murder and violence, we cease 
being Extropian and become the worst sort of Extremist Religious 
Terrorists who simply want to kill off nonbelievers.  How is this any 
different than the various terrorist groups we oppose now?  Instead of 
defeating them, we would be joining them.

Well since I don't "know" for certain, and I do use both logic and
rationality, and admire/support those who do, by your own
definition I am not an extremist.

The rest is differing experience/opinion.

I made no such conclusion and I indicated at least three possible
answers.

Strawman argument.

You ignore the facts, which is the exact opposite of extropianism.
The Arabs have refused every compromise since 1947, and have
consistantly refused to negotiate. When one side refuses to
negotiate or accept the outcome of negotiations they are
technically over. It is the Arabs/Palestinians who initiated
violence first and time after time.

The only time the Israelis have used violence is to retaliate for
violence, or in the case of '67 to preempt an imminent attack.


>Your definition and example seem diametrically opposed to my

I have presented counter arguments and examples.

May I suggest www.camera.org for more info.

Referring to a group refers to the majority opinion.

Evidence please.

Poll numbers indicate the vast majority favor two separate states.

The long historical record, and current statements, indicates that
both the Palestinians and the surrounding Arab states favor the
total destruction of Israel.

What is happening right now is a war to kill/capture those
responsible for terrorist attacks against Israel. When it is
complete the Israelis have already indicated they are ready to
negotiate.


Now here is one for you to answer.

In Sept of 2000 Ehud Barak took a very bold step and proposed a
deal that would have given the Palestinians 97% of everything they
had ever said they wanted. Yet Arafat refused to sign, and instead
re-started the intifada (initiated violence).

Why?

Disover magazine had an excellent article about a similiar effect recently,
which is probably what this 'cap' is based on.  The full article follows,
but the gist is here

"Savants, he believes, can tap into the human mind's remarkable processing
abilities. Even something as simple as seeing, he explains, requires
phenomenally complex information processing. When a person looks at an
object, for example, the brain immediately estimates an object's distance by
calculating the subtle differences between the two images on each retina
(computers programmed to do this require extreme memory and speed). During
the process of face recognition, the brain analyzes countless details, such
as the texture of skin and the shape of the eyes, jawbone, and lips. Most
people are not aware of these calculations. In savants, says Snyder, the top
layer of mental processing-conceptual thinking, making conclusions-is
somehow stripped away. Without it, savants can access a startling capacity
for recalling endless detail or for performing lightning-quick calculations.
Snyder's theory has a radical conclusion of its own: He believes it may be
possible someday to create technologies that will allow any nonautistic
person to exploit these abilities. "

Makes sense, the brain spends countless compuational time on recognizing
patterns, ask a child to draw their mom and you get a stick figure with a
round head and two eyes and a line for a mouth, because that is the pattern
that the brain recongizes as a person.  Ask an autistic individual to draw
the same, and out comes an totally accurate drawing of their mother.
Lacking is the ability to recognize the necessary patterns all throughout
the world, since the processing abilities of the brain are not devoted to
this important task.

The article mentions that autistics frequently narrowly focus their
attention on things that others would perceive as mundane, such as ripping
paper, rocking in a chair, or clothes tumbling in a dryer.  But if the major
pattern seeking part of the brain is not focused toward seeking patterns,
perhaps every moment of these seemingly mundane tasks remains fascinating
and awe inspiring since the brain never recongizes the repetitiveness of it.

Michael

The Inner Savant 

http://www.discover.com/feb_02/featsavant.html

Are you capable of multiplying 147,631,789 by 23,674 in your head,
instantly? 
Physicist Allan Snyder says you probably can, based on his new theory about
the origin of the extraordinary skills of autistic savants 
By Douglas S. Fox
Photography by James Smolka 

Nadia appeared healthy at birth, but by the time she was 2, her parents knew
something was amiss. She avoided eye contact and didn't respond when her
mother smiled or cooed. She didn't even seem to recognize her mother. At 6
months she still had not spoken a word. She was unusually clumsy and spent
hours in repetitive play, such as tearing paper into strips.

Allan Snyder, director of the Center for the Mind in Sydney, Australia,
thinks temporarily inhibiting neural activity through a technique called
transcranial magnetic stimulation could lead to creative breakthroughs.  

But at 31/2, she picked up a pen and began to draw-not scribble, draw.
Without any training, she created from memory sketches of galloping horses
that only a trained adult could equal. Unlike the way most people might draw
a horse, beginning with its outline, Nadia began with random details. First
a hoof, then the horse's mane, then its harness. Only later did she lay down
firm lines connecting these floating features. And when she did connect
them, they were always in the correct position relative to one another. ¦
Nadia is an autistic savant, a rare condition marked by severe mental and
social deficits but also by a mysterious talent that appears
spontaneously-usually before age 6. 

Sometimes the ability of a savant is so striking, it eventually makes news.
The most famous savant was a man called Joseph, the individual Dustin
Hoffman drew upon for his character in the 1988 movie Rain Man. Joseph could
immediately answer this question: "What number times what number gives
1,234,567,890?" His answer was "Nine times 137,174,210." Another savant
could double 8,388,628 up to 24 times within several seconds, yielding the
sum 140,737,488,355,328. A 6-year-old savant named Trevor listened to his
older brother play the piano one day, then climbed onto the piano stool
himself and played it better. A savant named Eric could find what he called
the "sweet spot" in a room full of speakers playing music, the spot where
sound waves from the different sources hit his ears at exactly the same
time. 

Most researchers have offered a simple explanation for these extraordinary
gifts: compulsive learning. But Allan Snyder, a vision researcher and
award-winning physicist who is director of the Center for the Mind at the
University of Sydney and the Australian National University, has advanced a
new explanation of such talents. "Each of us has the innate capacity for
savantlike skills," says Snyder, "but that mental machinery is unconscious
in most people." 

Savants, he believes, can tap into the human mind's remarkable processing
abilities. Even something as simple as seeing, he explains, requires
phenomenally complex information processing. When a person looks at an
object, for example, the brain immediately estimates an object's distance by
calculating the subtle differences between the two images on each retina
(computers programmed to do this require extreme memory and speed). During
the process of face recognition, the brain analyzes countless details, such
as the texture of skin and the shape of the eyes, jawbone, and lips. Most
people are not aware of these calculations. In savants, says Snyder, the top
layer of mental processing-conceptual thinking, making conclusions-is
somehow stripped away. Without it, savants can access a startling capacity
for recalling endless detail or for performing lightning-quick calculations.
Snyder's theory has a radical conclusion of its own: He believes it may be
possible someday to create technologies that will allow any nonautistic
person to exploit these abilities. 

The origins of autism are thought to lie in early brain development. During
the first three years of life, the brain grows at a tremendous rate. In
autistic children, neurons seem to connect haphazardly, causing widespread
abnormalities, especially in the cerebellum, which integrates thinking and
movement, and the limbic region, which integrates experience with specific
emotions. Abnormalities in these regions seem to stunt interest in the
environment and in social interaction. Autistic children have narrowed
fields of attention and a poor ability to recognize faces. They are more
likely to view a face, for example, as individual components rather than as
a whole. Imaging studies have shown that when autistic children see a
familiar face, their pattern of brain activation is different from that of
normal children. 

That narrowed focus may explain the autistic child's ability to concentrate
endlessly on a single repetitive activity, such as rocking in a chair or
watching clothes tumble in a dryer. Only one out of 10 autistic children
show special skills. 

In a 1999 paper, Snyder and his colleague John Mitchell challenged the
compulsive-practice explanation for savant abilities, arguing that the same
skills are biologically latent in all of us. "Everyone in the world was
skeptical," says Vilayanur Ramachandran, director of the Center for Brain
and Cognition at the University of California at San Diego. "Snyder deserves
credit for making it clear that savant abilities might be extremely
important for understanding aspects of human nature and creativity." 


 
Drawings by normal 4-year-olds 
When 4-year-old children draw a horse, they typically choose to establish
its contour and familiar features such as head, eyes, legs, and tail. Allan
Snyder believes that these kids draw on a concept of the horse to re-create
it rather than recalling the precise physical details, as savants do. 

 
A Drawing by a 3-year-old Savant 
A 3-year-old child named Nadia became famous for her ability to sketch
spectacularly detailed horses and riders from memory. Savants like Nadia
show the ability to perform unusual feats of illustration or calculation
when they are younger than 6. Snyder wants to figure out how they do it. 
Snyder's office at the University of Sydney is in a Gothic building,
complete with pointed towers and notched battlements. Inside, Nadia's
drawings of horses adorn the walls; artwork by other savants hangs in nearby
rooms. 

Snyder's interest in autism evolved from his studies of light and vision.
Trained as a physicist, he spent several years studying fiber optics and how
light beams can guide their own path. At one time he was interested in
studying the natural fiber optics in insects' eyes. The question that
carried him from vision research to autism had to do with what happens after
light hits the human retina: How are the incoming signals transformed into
data that is ultimately processed as images in the brain? Snyder was
fascinated by the processing power required to accomplish such a feat. 

During a sabbatical to Cambridge in 1987, Snyder devoured Ramachandran's
careful studies of perception and optical illusions. One showed how the
brain derives an object's three-dimensional shape: Falling light creates a
shadow pattern on the object, and by interpreting the shading, the brain
grasps the object's shape. "You're not aware how your mind comes to those
conclusions," says Snyder. "When you look at a ball, you don't know why you
see it as a ball and not a circle. The reason is your brain is extracting
the shape from the subtle shading around the ball's surface." Every brain
possesses that innate ability, yet only artists can do it backward, using
shading to portray volume. 

"Then," says Snyder, speaking slowly for emphasis, "I asked the question
that put me on a 10-year quest"-how can we bypass the mind's conceptual
thinking and gain conscious access to the raw, uninterpreted information of
our basic perceptions? Can we shed the assumptions built into our visual
processing system? 

A few years later, he read about Nadia and other savant artists in Oliver
Sacks's The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales. As
he sat in his Sydney apartment one afternoon with the book in hand, an idea
surfaced. Perhaps someone like Nadia who lacked the ability to organize
sensory input into concepts might provide a window into the fundamental
features of perception. 

Snyder's theory began with art, but he came to believe that all savant
skills, whether in music, calculation, math, or spatial relationships,
derive from a lightning-fast processor in the brain that divides
things-time, space, or an object-into equal parts. Dividing time might allow
a savant child to know the exact time when he's awakened, and it might help
Eric find the sweet spot by allowing him to sense millisecond differences in
the sounds hitting his right and left ears. Dividing space might allow Nadia
to place a disembodied hoof and mane on a page precisely where they belong.
It might also allow two savant twins to instantaneously count matches
spilled on the floor (one said "111"; the other said "37, 37, 37").
Meanwhile, splitting numbers might allow math savants to factor 10-digit
numbers or easily identify large prime numbers-which are impossible to
split. 

Compulsive practice might enhance these skills over time, but Snyder
contends that practice alone cannot explain the phenomenon. As evidence, he
cites rare cases of sudden-onset savantism. Orlando Serrell, for example,
was hit on the head by a baseball at the age of 10. A few months later, he
began recalling an endless barrage of license-plate numbers, song lyrics,
and weather reports. 

If someone can become an instant savant, Snyder thought, doesn't that
suggest we all have the potential locked away in our brains? "Snyder's ideas
sound very New Age. This is why people are skeptical," says Ramachandran.
"But I have a more open mind than many of my colleagues simply because I've
seen [sudden-onset cases] happen." 

Bruce Miller, a neurologist at the University of California at San
Francisco, has seen similar transformations in patients with frontotemporal
dementia, a degenerative brain disease that strikes people in their fifties
and sixties. Some of these patients, he says, spontaneously develop both
interest and skill in art and music. Brain-imaging studies have shown that
most patients with frontotemporal dementia who develop skills have
abnormally low blood flow or low metabolic activity in their left temporal
lobe. Because language abilities are concentrated in the left side of the
brain, these people gradually lose the ability to speak, read, and write.
They also lose face recognition. Meanwhile, the right side of the brain,
which supports visual and spatial processing, is better preserved. 

"They really do lose the linguistic meaning of things," says Miller, who
believes Snyder's ideas about latent abilities complement his own
observations about frontotemporal dementia. "There's a loss of higher-order
processing that goes on in the anterior temporal lobe." In particular,
frontotemporal dementia damages the ventral stream, a brain region that is
associated with naming objects. Patients with damage in this area can't name
what they're looking at, but they can often paint it beautifully. Miller has
also seen physiological similarities in the brains of autistic savants and
patients with frontotemporal dementia. When he performed brain-imaging
studies on an autistic savant artist who started drawing horses at 18
months, he saw abnormalities similar to those of artists with frontotemporal
dementia: decreased blood flow and slowed neuronal firing in the left
temporal lobe. 

One blustery, rainy morning I drove to Mansfield, a small farm town 180
miles northeast of Melbourne. I was heading to a day clinic for autistic
adults, where I hoped to meet a savant. The three-hour drive pitched and
rolled through hills, occasionally cutting through dense eucalyptus forests
punctuated with yellow koala-crossing signs. From time to time, I saw large,
white-crested parrots; in one spot, a flock of a thousand or more in flight
wheeled about like a galaxy. 

I finally spotted my destination: Acorn Outdoor Ornaments. Within this
one-story house, autistic adults learn how to live independently. They also
create inexpensive lawn decorations, like the cement dwarf I see on the
roof. 

Joan Curtis, a physician who runs Acorn and a related follow-up program,
explained that while true savants are rare, many people with autism have
significant talents. Nurturing their gifts, she said, helps draw them into
social interaction. Guy was one of the participants I met at Acorn. Although
he was uncomfortable shaking my hand, all things electronic fascinated him,
and he questioned me intently about my tape recorder. 

Every horizontal surface in Guy's room was covered with his creations. One
was an electric fan with a metal alligator mouth on the front that opened
and closed as it rotated from side to side. On another fan a metal fisherman
raised and lowered his pole with each revolution. And then I saw the sheep.
Viewed from the left, it was covered in wool. Viewed from the right, it was
a skeleton, which I learned Guy had assembled without any help. Guy didn't
say much about himself. He cannot read nor do arithmetic, but he has built
an electric dog that barks, pants, wags its tail, and urinates. 

During my visit, another Acorn participant, Tim, blew into the room like a
surprise guest on The Tonight Show. He was in a hurry to leave again, but
asked me my birthday-July 15, 1970. 

"Born on a Wednesday, eh?" he responded nonchalantly-and correctly. 

"How did you do that?" I asked. 

"I did it well," he replied. 

"But how?" I asked. 

"Very well," he replied, with obvious pleasure. Then he was out the door and
gone. 

How do calendar savants do it? Several years ago Timothy Rickard, a
cognitive psychologist at the University of California at San Diego,
evaluated a 40-year-old man with a mental age of 5 who could assign a day of
the week to a date with 70 percent accuracy. Because the man was blind from
birth, he couldn't study calendars or even imagine calendars. He couldn't do
simple arithmetic either, so he couldn't use a mathematical algorithm. But
he could only do dates falling within his lifetime, which suggests that he
used memory. 

He could, however, do some arithmetic, such as answer this question: If
today is Wednesday, what day is two days from now? Rickard suspects that
memorizing 2,000 dates and using such arithmetic would allow 70 percent
accuracy. "That doesn't reduce it to a trivial skill, but it's not
inconceivable that someone could acquire this performance with a lot of
effort," he says. It's especially plausible given the single-minded drive
with which autistics pursue interests. 

Yet Tim, the savant at Acorn, can calculate dates as far back as 1900, as
well as into the future. And there are reports of twins who could calculate
dates 40,000 years in the past or future. Still, practice may be part of it.
Robyn Young, an autism researcher at Flinders University in Adelaide,
Australia, says some calendar savants study perpetual calendars several days
a week (there are only 14 different calendar configurations; perpetual
calendars cross-reference them to years). 

But even if savants practice, they may still tap into that universal ability
Snyder has proposed. Here it helps to consider art savants. That Nadia began
drawings with minor features rather than overall outlines suggests that she
tended to perceive individual details more prominently than she did the
whole-or the concept-of what she was drawing. Other savant artists draw the
same way. 

Autistic children differ from nonautistic children in another way. Normal
kids find it frustrating to copy a picture containing a visual illusion,
such as M. C. Escher's drawing in which water flows uphill. Autistic
children don't. That fits with Snyder's idea that they're recording what
they see without interpretation and reproducing it with ease in their own
drawings. 

Even accomplished artists sometimes employ strategies to shake up their
preconceptions about what they're seeing. Guy Diehl is not a savant, but he
is known for his series of crystal-clear still lifes of stacked books,
drafting implements, and fruit. When Diehl finds that he's hit a sticking
point on a painting, for example, he may actually view it in a mirror or
upside down. "It reveals things you otherwise wouldn't see, because you're
seeing it differently," he says. "You're almost seeing it for the first time
again." 

Diehl showed me how art students use this technique to learn to draw. He put
a pair of scissors on a table and told me to draw the negative space around
the scissors, not the scissors themselves. The result: I felt I was drawing
individual lines, not an object, and my drawing wasn't half bad, either. 

Drawing exercises are one way of coaxing conceptual machinery to take five,
but Snyder is pursuing a more direct method. He has suggested that a
technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation, which uses magnetic
fields to disrupt neuronal firing, could knock out a normal person's
conceptual brain machinery, temporarily rendering him savantlike. 

Young and her colleague Michael Ridding of the University of Adelaide tried
it. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation on 17 volunteers, they inhibited
neural activity in the frontotemporal area. This language and
concept-supporting brain region is affected in patients with frontotemporal
dementia and in the art savant whom Miller studied. In this altered state,
the volunteers performed savantlike tasks-horse drawing, calendar
calculating, and multiplying. 

Five of the 17 volunteers improved-not to savant levels, but no one expected
that, because savants practice. Furthermore, transcranial magnetic
stimulation isn't a precise tool for targeting brain regions. But the five
volunteers who improved were those in whom separate neurological assessments
indicated that the frontotemporal area was successfully targeted. "Obviously
I don't think the idea is so outlandish anymore," says Young. "I think it is
a plausible hypothesis. It always was, but I didn't expect we'd actually
find the things we did." 

Snyder himself is experimenting with grander ideas. "We want to enhance
conceptual abilities," he says, "and on the other hand remove them and
enhance objectivity." He imagines a combination of training and hardware
that might, for example, help an engineer get past a sticking point on a
design project by offering a fresh angle on the problem. One method would
involve learning to monitor one's own brain waves. By watching one's own
brain waves during drawing exercises, Snyder imagines it may be possible to
learn to control them in a way that shuts down their concept-making
machinery-even the left temporal lobe itself. 

Even if further research never fully reveals why savants have extraordinary
skills, we may at least learn from their potential. Snyder is optimistic. "I
envisage the day," he says, "when the way to get out of a [mental rut] is
you pick up this thing-those of us with jobs that demand a certain type of
creativity-and you stimulate your brain. I'm very serious about this."

The human mind has long fascinated psychologists

  
  
Helen Briggs 
BBC News Online  
 
 
Australian scientists say they have created a "thinking cap" that will 
stimulate creative powers. 
The invention raises the possibility of being able to unlock one's inner 
genius by reawakening dormant parts of the brain. 



This shock finding will challenge many of our conventional views regardingc
 reativity 
 
Steve Williams, Institute of Psychiatry  
It is based on the idea that we all have the sorts of extraordinary
abilities 
usually associated with savants. 

According to scientists at the Centre for the Mind in Sydney, these hiddent
 alents can be stimulated using magnetism. 

Professor Allan Snyder and colleague Elaine Mulcahy say tests on 17 
volunteers show their device can improve drawing skills within 15 minutes.
T
 hey intend to submit their work for publication in a scientific journal.
T
 he news, reported in Chemistry and Industry magazine, has been given a 
cautious welcome by experts in the UK. 

'Unconscious skills' 

Professor Steve Williams of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, said 
Professor Snyder was a highly respected international scientist and he wasl
 ooking forward to reading the scientific paper. 

 
Many autistics are accomplished artists
 
He told BBC News Online: "This shock finding that everyone might possess 
unconscious skills that can be 'switched on' with magnetic stimulation willc
 hallenge many of our conventional views regarding creativity." 

The inspiration for the device comes from savant syndrome, a condition 
portrayed in the Hollywood film Rain Man. 

Savants are extraordinarily gifted. They may have amazing memories or excela
 t maths, music or art. But they also have developmental disorders such asa
 utism. 

Mind state 

One theory behind savant syndrome is that the right side of the brain 
overcompensates for damage to the left hemisphere. 

The skills most often seen in savants are those associated with the rights
 ide. 

Savant syndrome  
Rare condition in which persons with various developmental disorders havea
 stonishing abilities or talents 
Savants also have a prodigious memory 
Typical savant skills include music, art, and mathematical skills 
About 10% of persons with autistic disorder have some savant skills  
According to Professor Snyder, it might be possible to train someone to 
access this state by controlling their brain waves. 

David Potter of the National Autistic Society, a UK charity, said the 
research was fascinating. 

"Some scientists believe that the essence of creativity is not a state ofm
 ind but an activity," he told BBC News Online. 

"Whether Snyder and Mulcahy's research will enable the expression of savants
 kills without accompanying impairments remains to be seen."

What Harvey describes as "extremism" seems like obsessive-
compulsive disorder.  Certainly one can criticize that.  But
"extreme" just means "at the tails of the bell curve", and
there are certainly cases where that's the right place to be.

Moderation, too, should be practiced in moderation.

Greetings, 

I'm a 7 year member (though seldom list visitor) of the Extropian
movement.  As this list contains some of the keenest minds on the
internet, I'm looking to it for comments about a new business venture a
partner and I are undertaking.  If you'd have the time, I'd really
appreciate your opinions and brutal comments before we get too far down
this road.  

The premise is that biodiversity is both an aesthetic and medicinal
resource, and this effort is a somewhat quixotic attempt to both exploit
and protect the resource.  Definitely not a Green Party member, I
consider myself an anarchocapitalist technogaiaist concerned with loss
of biodiversity.  The idea is part edu-tainment, part escapism enabler,
and part overpriced screensaver.  In short, it's a self-updating
Biodiversity Screensaver membership, containing 4 adventures each year. 
Each screensaver adventure comes from a different biodiverse hot spot,
and includes about 20 photos of animals and plants, sounds from the
forest, and "Factoids" which describe interesting tidbits about animal
behavior or ethnobotany, etc.  Of the fees received, 51% are donated to
organizations like Nature Conservancy and World Wildlife Fund.

Still in pre-release mode, the mechanics of the screensaver and website
are now functional and the initial screensaver edition is available as a
free download after completing a 17 question survey at the website. 
Completion of a second (10 question) survey will provide a free 2 week
trial membership to the site, which allows searches of the Factoid
database, quizzes, games, contests, biodiversity postcards, etc.  Check
it out at http://biosaver.org  The screensaver installs easily and
uninstalls clean.

So my questions to y'all are:  Will this work?  Do you see fatal flaws
in the concept?  Can you spot obvious areas of improvement?

Basically, I would like to get some opinions from knowledgeable people
before diving in headfirst and spending a ton of advertising dollars.

Here are a few concerns that we've already come up with:

- There are already soooooo many free screensavers available.  --->
While this is true, we've calculated that we need only about 3-4000
subscribers per year to cover the costs.  Plus we feel the content is
unique and valuable in itself.

- The average person does not yet have enough bandwidth to download the
7MB screensaver each quarter.  ---> One of the reasons we're doing the
market research is to discern this.  We'd love to add video snippets to
the screensaver but that would increase the download size even more.

Thanks mucho in advance!  We look forward to hearing your opinions.

-Steve
PS. If you'd prefer to contact me directly rather than post to the list,

I must have misunderstood you when you said "The only current solution 
is for them to battle it out till one party is eliminated."  I thought 
you were endorsing this as the only option currently possible.  I 
thought you rejected the first alternative by saying "no negotiation is 
possible" and rejected the third alternative because it didn't exist 
yet.  Therefore, I thought you were endorsing genocide as the "only 
current solution."  It was this option that I claim is unextropian.  The 
first option of negotiation would be extropian, as would the third 
option of finding another solution.

Also note that I never said you were unextropian or that you had chosen 
an unextropian option.  I think you are defending yourself more than 
defending any idea which called unextropian.

Hello list-members,
the peer-reviewed electronic Journal "Informação e Cognição"
(vol. 3, no. 3) has recently published a special issue about
consciousness and quantum physics, edited by Alfredo Pereira Jr.

This is the link to the content page:
http://www.marilia.unesp.br/atividades/extensao/revista/v3/artigos.html

Here you can find the following articles (click at them to get them):

------------------------------------

What is an Essentially Quantum Mechanical Effect?
Osvaldo Pessoa Jr.

When asking whether consciousness is an essentially
quantum effect, one must first lay down criteria
for considering an effect quantum mechanical. After
a brief survey of the  interpretations of quantum
theory, three such sufficient criteria are proposed
and examined: wave-particle duality (or collapse),
entanglement (non-locality), and quantum condensation
(involving identical particles). A fourth criteria
could involve the use of quantum field theories, but
this problem is left open. If a quantum effect played
an essential role in the brain, it would probably follow
the first criterion, since the entanglement of many
particles would be rapidly washed out by decoherence,
and there is no strong evidence for the existence of
biological condensates.


Are Perceptual Fields Quantum Fields?
Brian Flanagan

We discuss Chalmers hard problem in respect of a
mind/brain identity theory. We examine a handful of
mathematical parallels between the visual field and
its concomitant quantum field, and argue for an
identity between the two fields.


The Quantum Mind/Classical Brain Problem
Alfredo Pereira Jr.

The quantum theory of mind allows a shift from the
Mind/Brain metaphysical problem to the Quantum
Mind/Classical Brain scientific problem: how could
systematic and coherent quantum processes - assumed
to be the physical support of our conscious experiences
- occur in a macroscopic system as the brain? I discuss
a solution based on a neurobiological model that attributes
to quantum computation in intra-neuronal protein networks
the role of directly supporting phenomenal experience. In
this model, quantum coherence is created or prepared by
classical mechanisms as recurrent neuronal networks,
oscillatory synchrony and gated membrane channels, thus
avoiding common theoretical constraints for the existence
of quantum communication and computation (ultra-cold
temperatures and quasi-isolation from the environment).


Why Quantum Correlates of Consciousness Are Fine But Not Enough
Ruediger Vaas

The existence of quantum correlates of consciousness (QCC)
is doubtful from a scientific perspective. But even if their
existence were verified, philosophical problems would remain.
On the other hand, there could be more to QCC than meets the
sceptic's eye:
-- QCC might be useful or even necessary for a better
understanding of conscious experience or quantum physics or
both. The main reasons for this are: the measurement problem
(the nature of observation, the mysterious collapse of the
wave function, etc.), ostensibly shared features of quantum
phenomena and conscious phenomena (e.g., complementarity,
nonspatiality, acausality, spontaneity, and holism) and
connections (ontology, causation, and knowledge), the
qualia problem (subjectivity, explanatory gap etc.). But
there are many problems, especially questions regarding
realism and thenature and role of conscious observers;
-- QCC are conceptually challenging, because there are
definitory problems and some crucial ontological and
epistemological shortcomings. It is instructive to compare
them with recent proposals for understanding neural correlates
of consciousness (NCC). QCC are not sufficient for a quantum
theory of mind, nor might they be necessary except perhaps
in a very broad sense;
-- QCC are also empirically challenging. Nevertheless, QCC
could be relevant and important for the mind-body problem:
QCC might reveal features that are necessary at least for
behavioral manifestations of human consciousness. But QCC
are compatible with very different proposals for a solution
of the mind-body problem. This seems to be both advantageous
and detrimental. QCC restrict accounts of nomological identity.
The discovery of QCC cannot establish a naturalistic theory
of mind alone. But there are also problems with QCC in the
framework of other ontologies.


Uma Revisão da Teoria da Consciência de Penrose-Hameroff
Henrique de Morais Ribeiro

Este artigo representa a parte descritiva de um trabalho no
qual se  analisa criticamente a hipótese de consciência
quântica de Penrose-Hameroff. Segundo esta hipótese, a
integração das atividades cerebrais (binding) é devida
ao fenômeno quântico do condensado de Bose-Einstein
amplificado, hipótese esta que indica a existência de
um campo interdisciplinar de pesquisa, a Neurociência
Computacional-Relativística Quântica. Esta ciência
representa uma grande interdisciplina que liga outras
ciências, quais sejam a Mecânica Quântica, a Teoria da
Relatividade e a Neurobiologia, de modo que a hipótese
haure fontes nestas disciplinas. No que se refere à Mecânica
Quântica, discute-se brevemente o problema da medida e a
correspondente abordagem de Penrose deste problema, em
termos de redução objetiva do vetor de estado quântico
(objetive reduction, OR). Na Relatividade, são abordados
os elementos do problema da grande unificação, e a proposta
de Penrose para sua solução. No domínio da Neurobiologia,
investiga-se a anatomia e a fisiologia dos microtúbulos,
considerados relevantes para o entendimento dos fenômenos
mentais. Na complexa ligação entre essas ciências, a
hipótese de Penrose representa um importante traço de
união interdisciplinar. Em outro artigo, tratar-se-á da
análise crítica dos pressupostos da hipótese descrita neste
artigo.

Moderation should be practiced with precision, as should extremism.

The pursuit of the truth is primary, and sometimes it leads to the middle of
the curve, and sometimes it leads to the tails.  Someone who is "moderate in
all things" or "extreme in all things" is probably wrong in many specific
cases, and someone who chooses beliefs solely on the basis of whether they
are "moderate" or "extreme" is definitely not a normative reasoner. 
However, it is worth noting that there are pure social pressures toward
"moderation" in some cases, and pure social pressures toward *particular*
extremes, or to choose one of two polar extremes, in other cases.  We should
therefore expect a normative thinker, or one who is less non-normative than
average, to be called "extreme" in at least some of those cases where social
pressures demand "moderation"; a contemporary example is holding that
evolution is an absolutely solid fact, which it is, but this solidity is not
commonly realized and may be taken as extremism.  A normative thinker should
also expect to sometimes occupy neither of two common extremes (neither
Democrat nor Republican) and to therefore have opinions which are not easily
explained; and a normative thinker should expect to be accused of "too much
moderation" in cases where social pressures tend toward a particular extreme
(i.e., failing to hold that the US is right on all issues whenever there is
a conflict of interest with another nation).

It's amusing, but is it true? A broken leg isn't hereditary. UV damage to
skin isn't, either (although a propensity to it might be).

Life, on the other hand, clearly *isn't* a disease--only an embittered
cynic could think that.

Jay,
  Given the fact that Georgia (and Tennessee, my home state)
both have concealed carry laws and a real lack of

I'd observe that Eli should feel markedly better wearing

Technotopia & the Death of Nature
Clones, Supercomputers, and Robots

by James Bell

Earth Island Journal
Summer 2002
 Vol. 17, No. 2

===========

There is no question that technological growth trends in
science and industry are increasing exponentially. There is,
however, a growing debate about what this runaway
acceleration of ingenuity may bring. A number of respected
scientists and futurists now are predicting that technological
progress is driving the world toward a "Singularity" - a
point at which technology and nature will have become one.
At this juncture, the world as we have known it will have
gone extinct and new definitions of "life," "nature" and
"human" will take hold.

      "We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of
human life on Earth," San Diego University Professor of
Computer Science Vernor Vinge first warned the scientific
community in 1993. "Within 30 years, we will have the
technological means to create superhuman intelligence.
Shortly after, the human era will end."

     Some scientists and philosophers have theorized that the
very purpose of life is to bring about the Singularity. While
leading technology industries have been aware of the
Singularity concept for some time, there are concerns that,
if the public understood the full ramifications of the
Singularity, they would be reluctant to accept many of the
new and untested technologies such as genetically
engineered foods, nano-technology and robotics.

Machine Evolution
A number of books on the coming Singularity are in the
works and will soon appear. In 2003, the sequel to the
blockbuster film The Matrix will delve into the philosophy
and origins of Earth's machine-controlled future. Matrix
cast members were required to read Wired editor Kevin
Kelly's 1994 book Out of Control: The Rise of
Neo-biological Civilization. Page one reads, "The realm of
the born - all that is nature - and the realm of the made - all
that is humanly constructed - are becoming one." 

     Meanwhile, Warner Brothers has embarked on the most
expensive film of all time - a $180 million sequel called
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. The film is due out in
2003; a good decade before actual machine evolution is
predicted to accelerate "out of control," plunging human
civilization towards the Singularity.

[]     The majority of people closest to these theories and laws
- the tech sector - can hardly wait for the Singularity to
arrive. The true believers call themselves "extropians,"
"post-humans" and "transhumanists" and are actively
organizing not just to bring the Singularity about, but to
counter what they call "techno-phobes" and "neo-luddites" -
critics like Greenpeace, Earth First! and the Rainforest
Action Network. 

     The Progress Action Coalition [Pro-Act,
www.progressaction.org], which was formed in June 2001,
fantasizes about "the dream of true artificial intelligence...
adding a new richness to the human landscape never before
known." The Pro-Act website features several sections
where the strategies and tactics of environmental groups
and foundations are targeted for "countering." 

   [] 

     Yet there is something missing from this discussion of
the technologic singularity. The true cost of technologic
progress and the Singularity will mean the unprecedented
decline of the planet's inhabitants - an ever-increasing rate
of global extinction. 

     The World Conservation Union (IUCN), the
International Botanical Congress and a majority of the
world's biologists believe that a global "mass extinction"
already is underway

I suppose that its perfectly acceptable to some to let future genocidal
fascists continue on until they kill half of the human race or more.
It's not to me, and it shouldn't be to anyone who actually does give a
damn about the future and human life.

My question, though, was to provoke thought. How much do you think an
extropic future is important, is absolutely necessary to the human
race's survival? Is passivity and pacifism an acceptable principle when
it's consequences are counted in billions of lives? Sins of omission of
such a scale are of far greater weight than sins of commission at an
individual level.

If you knew in 1936 what you know now, would killing a few specific
individuals be morally repugnant or not?

At Extro last summer, when Robert Bradbury said about the luddites, "The
blood of billions is on their hands", he was not making a rhetorical
statement. What do YOU intend to do about it? To what ends are you
willing to go to save billions of lives? What means are you willing to
accept to achieve those ends?

Furthermore, your statements are hopelessly hyperbolic, automatically
labelling everything I spoke of as 'proposing terrorism'. I did not and
I demand an apology about that.

Socrates (or perhaps Plato's "Socrates") said that life was a sickness. A
counterexample?

There is murder and then there is homicide. For an atheist, Harvey, you
seem to be rather quick to quote scripture.

Your position is its own sort of extremism, one that refuses to take
responsibility for the consequences.

In high school in Israel, I was taught this version of history as well. 
This may have occurred to some extent, but there are now revisionist 
histories that argue that there is credible evidence that Jewish 
Palestinians in the Haganah and later, Zahal, did violently "encourage" 
Arabs to leave their homes during the 1948 establishment of Israel.

If this is true, I don't have a problem with it.

First, one could argue that it was a pre-emptive strike to increase the 
likelihood of Israel surviving an imminent massive attack that, in 
hindsight, might have made the difference, considering how under-armed 
Israel was and how close it was to losing at various points in the war.

Second, war is always ugly and no state I know of has ever been peaceably 
established.  I'm fine if you want to rage against all states.  But in a 
scale of state offenses, Israel's rank fairly low, even compared with 
events in America's history (like the near-genocide of American Indians, 
which included deliberate biological warfare).

For eighty years Israel (and the predecessor Jewish community) has been 
regularly pilloried for alleged misdeeds that are dwarfed by Arab behavior 
against Israel, Jews, other Arab states, or their own people.  Every one of 
the states that has attacked Israel have outrageous barbarities in their 
recent past.  Why is there a double standard?

Lastly, I am a fervent libertarian (and wannabe but unconvinced Friedman 
anarchist). But I do live in the real world, where states exist, decisions 
must be made, and honorable people can reach different conclusions than I do.

Thanks for clearing this up, it was clearly a misunderstanding. You
get +2 points for peacemaking (Save! Win Valuable Prizes!).

Maybe a brief summary of my thinking/position will help clarify
this.

I favor a negotiated settlement to the troubles in the Middle East,
I think the result of this settlement includes both Israel and a
new and sovereign Palestinian state.

Some of the problems:

1) Terrorism, the PLO has returned to it's use, both as a
negotiating tool to try and get a better deal, and possibly to
achieve Arafats lifelong dream of destroying Israel.

I oppose terrorism 100%, the one thing we should make clear is that
terrorism is not a valid negotiating tactic and will not be
tolerated.

2) The land, I favor modified borders to the 1967 boundaries which
proved indefensible.

There is an interesting possibility on the land I have not seen
discussed yet. Modern Jordan is composed of land that has largely
been historically Palestinian, in fact 80% of it's population is
Palestinian. Since the issue will come up sooner or later, why not
divide Jordan and unite the Palestinian part.

3) The Settlements, some of these settlements are no more than
suburbs of existing Israeli cities and were built in areas where
the borders were weak, I tend to favor keeping these, others are
not so strategic and I think it should be made clear to those
living there that under the settlement this will be Palestinian
land, and they are therefore subject to Palestinian law.

4) Resettlement, probably the most difficult issue. About 450,000
Palestinians fled Israel at the Arabs insistence during the 1947
war, although some did resettle, others did not.

Here's the rub, 820,000 Jews were kicked out of surrounding Arab
lands and their property/possessions confiscated. 546,000 of these
were resettled in Israel with no more than the cloths on their
backs and at great expense.

Any discussion of this issue will need to include ALL refugees.


>Also note that I never said you were unextropian or that you had

>more than defending any idea which called unextropian.

I was facing multiple opponents at the time. ;) Thanks again for
making the effort to square this.

I have no idea why you say this.  I explained in detail why 
assassination would run counter to our Principles and would have a 
negative affect on our community and our claimed plans for the future.  
It is exactly because of claiming responsibility for the consequences 
that I cannot condone killing off Luddites as a reasonable defense of 
science.

You misunderstand my message.  I have no intention of letting future 
genocidal cascists continue on until they kill half of the human race or 
more.  You falsely assume that if I don't concede to your methods that I 
am giving up.  On the contrary, I am looking toward science, logic, 
rationality and intellect to provide better solutions.  I would consider 
the act of murdering our opponents to be giving up on our Principles.

You propose a false dichotomy.  You assume that violence is the only 
answer and that by rejecting assassination I am dooming humanity's 
future and condemning billions of humans to die.  I am sorry that you 
have so little faith in the Extropian Principles that you think they 
must be abandoned to save lives.  I, on the other hand, believe that 
only by following our Principles can humanity be saved.

Let me ask you a question, to provoke thought.  Why do you consider 
yourself to be an Extropian if you think the Principles will doom 
humanity?  Why do you espouse the Principles in our trivial daily lives, 
and yet abandon them when it comes to the big important future?  Is the 
use of force really the best method that trumps all other human 
endeavor?  Can science, logic, rationality never triumph over basic 
human instinct toward violence?

Bad analogy.  We can never have magical knowledge of the future.  We can 
only go through life with what we know up to now.  I cannot condone a 
pre-emptive strike against Luddites on the theory that we "know" what 
the future would be like if they are allowed to live.  We do not know 
the future.  It is hubris to think that we are so infallable and that 
they are so obviously wrong that we have the right to sentence them to 
death right now.  We must actually wait until a clear and present danger 
is manifested before the use of deadly force.  Eroding that prerequisite 
down to the point the we simply kill those with alternate political 
beliefs is unacceptable.

There are people on this list now who promote dangerous ideas.  Some may 
lead us down the road to involuntary uploading.  Some have differing 
political theories.  Some want to turn the earth into computronium.  
Should we start a star chamber to start assassinating our own membership 
now?  What about me?  I obviously oppose your plan to assassinate our 
enemies.  If you feels so certain that this must be done, am I standing 
in your way?  Should you add me to your list and come and shoot me now?  
When will it all end?  Where do we draw the line for killing off people 
with undesireable belief systems?  What about the Pope or other 
religious leaders?  Are they on your list to be assassinated?  What 
about the next President if the election doesn't go your way?  Our 
current President seems determined to outlaw cloning.  Is he on the list 
now?

I keep repeating:  The ends does not justify the means.  No matter how 
vital the end result is, that does not mean I will stop looking for a 
solution and take the easy way out.  We have time.  We don't have to 
kill Luddites *before* they take action.  We can try to counter their 
movement with initiatives like Pro-Act.  if that doesn't work, we can 
move to a more reasonable country.  If that doesn't work, we can move 
into international waters or go underground (literally or 
figuratively).  Maybe eventually we can even move into space.  I will 
not resort to murder while their are other options available.

OK.  I apologize for using the word "terrorism" to describe this 
proposal.  I really do not believe you are a terrorist.  But I am afraid 
that your ideas might eventually evolve into terrorism in the hands of 
overzealous followers.  I will try to use a different word.  What do you 
propose we call it when a groups kills off the "enemies of humanity" 
because they have differing political beliefs and agendas for the future 
that do not correspond to what is considered the Truth?

You looking for human testers?  I'd love to put a "Where's Lee?"

Whoops.

What I meant to say, but left out, is that the Israelis are routinely 
castigated world-wide, regardless of the evidence or severity of the 
offense, while clear evidence of horrifying acts by other parties -- 
especially the Arabs, but also other groups elsewhere in the world -- is 
either not reported on or explained away.  (We hear about alleged Israeli 
torture of PLO suspects; we don't hear about alleged British torture of IRA 
prisoners.)

And, yes, of course there are also apologists for Israel.  Fewer worldwide 
and in US major-media than people who promote a pro-Arab position.

It's funny to see in the US how the two groups that are strongest in their 
support are Jewish liberals and Christian conservatives.  And the 
conservatives are more unwavering than the Jews.  The most consistent 
attacks are from non-Jewish liberals and other groups of Christian 
conservatives.  I don't think there's a clear libertarian perspective; it 
seems as potentially divisive as abortion is in the LP.

You say "some Israelis".  I don't dispute this.  Out of 6,000,000 Israelis, 
I'm sure there's at least one who wants to exterminate them.  But then you 
refer to "cleanser Israelis" in a way that suggests that there are enough 
of them to be politically influential in Israel.

I believe there is substantial evidence that there are "cleanser 
Palestinians".  There are hundreds of statements from prominent Arab 
political and religious leaders (and a new one every day) calling for the 
annihilation of Israel or  praising the killing of Jews.

But "cleanser Israelis"?  This is more of the moral equivalency 
nonsense.  Who are these people?  Substantiate your allegation.

The most extreme view that I've seen in 35 years of following Israeli 
politics is from those who looked at population trends is that of the 
followers of Meir Kahane, who saw that in a few decades Israel could not 
remain both Jewish and democratic, and advocated solutions such as forcibly 
evicting the Arabs from the West Bank or Israel proper.  And even that 
view, which is far from advocating mass murder, never attracted more than a 
few percent.

The settlements are pretty straightforward ethnic cleansing.  
Land is seized under various pretexts, the Palestinian inhabitants 
evicted, and Israelis brought in.  The Israeli government supports
the settlement effort in a variety of ways, so, yes,

The settlements are pretty straightforward ethnic cleansing.  
Land is seized under various pretexts, the Palestinian inhabitants 
evicted, and Israelis brought in.  The Israeli government supports
the settlement effort in a variety of ways, so, yes, the "cleanser Israelis" 
clearly do have substantial influence.  While border settlements don't imply 
a desire to cleanse all Palestine, the West Bank is now literally covered 
with settlements and those settlements make no sense unless the inhabitants 
intend for all of Palestine to become Israeli.

More on the other side does not excuse some on the Israeli side.  And, IMO,
it's the fact that the settlers have governmental support which is the primary
reason for the radicalization of the Palestinians.  A reasonable Palestinian
would conclude the Israeli government is supporting a deliberate attempt to
remove Palestinians from most of the occupied territories.  Under the 
circumstances, I'm not surprised they get very hostile.  Regardless of
propaganda, most people would rather just be left alone, and the militants
would get little support if it didn't look liike the normal people will get
evicted eventually anyway.  The Palestinians tolerated occupation for
20 years.

Ethnic cleansing is not mass murder, it's mass eviction.

The book I mentioned earlier goes into this at considerable length.
There were Israelis who opposed (and still do) partioning of what
they see as the Jewish holy land, the Irgun and Sternists for
example.  it talks about actions of the Haganah as well. Still, the
vast majority did leave at the Arabs urging however.

Israel took steps to encourage the Arabs to stay, the Assembly of
Palestine Jewry issued an appeal on Oct 2, 1947 and the
proclamation of independence issued May 14, 1948 invited the
Palestinians to remain and become equal citizens. Almost 190,000
did.

A British police report dated April 26: "every effort is being made
by the Jews to persuade the Arab populace to stay and carry on with
their normal lives" This at a time when the British were at odds
with the Jews in Israel.

There is considerable outside evidence that things happened this
way. The Arabs were blunt in taking credit for the war:

Jamal Husseini told the security council April 16 1948: "The
representative of the Jewish Agency told us yesterday that they
were not the attackers, that the Arabs had begun the fighting. We
did not deny this. We told the whole world we were going to fight."

In his memoirs Haled al Azm the Syrian Prime Minister in 1948-49
noted: "Since 1948 we have been demanding the return of refugees to
their homes. But we ourselves are the ones who encouraged them to
leave. Only a few months separated our call to them to leave and
our appeal to the United Nations to resolve on their return."


>If this is true, I don't have a problem with it.

Necessities of war, they did forcibly evacuate some towns, Lydda
and Ramle along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and Biram along the
Lebanon border.

The facts back this up.

It is important to note that had the compromise been accepted by
the Arabs, no Palestinian would ever have been displaced. The two
nations might have grown up together in peace.

I think in some cases it is anti-semitism, others merely anti-
Israeli-ism, and in some cases merely misguided understanding of
how it all came about. Maybe a little bit of common compassion,
although somewhat misunderstood, for the downtrodden.

The reasoning in this matter of being pro active to the point of executing
the opposition in order to further a just and noble cause is similar in some
ways to the concept of a death penalty for criminals.

To pass judgement one must first obtain the moral highground. Any cause will
be considered to provide this by its members. This achieved, the group in
question be it an extreemist movement or indeed a court of law will if it
desires extend this to include the right of confiscating life. In the case
of an extreemist movement this is unacceptable, in a court it is a debated
issue but still the same question:

Do we have a right to confiscate life to promote our ideology?

The answer is determined by the majority; but this does not alter the ethics
involved. Of course we all subscribe to different sets of ethical, moral,
and religous guidlines some mainstream some not. But no matter what you
believe it is my opinion; and I personally take my lead from the UN bill of
Human Rights, that as soon as you are prepared to kill in order to promote
one's own point of view any possible claim of superiority is lost. Is it
right to murder the murderers?

To return to the point should modern day fascists be killed by the liberal
democratic world? Or anti-progress groups by Extropians? (and I stress I
don't intend to suggest anti-progressionists are fascists). If the answer
for you is in the affirmative then consider that by reverse argument, it is
right for fascists or in this case anti-progressionists to kill you. I think
a war started that way that cost 100 Million lives. I'd rather live in a
world with what I perceive to be unsavoury ideology and the people
proffessing it; than start violence simply to remove an aspect of society
that offends my sensibilities or my ethics.

Nanotube-laced epoxy: three times harder, far better at conducting heat. One

Molecular Conductivity Takes Shape. Mind the gap. By breaking a tiny gold

current through a single molecule. Now they have shown a specific way in
which the molecule's shape affects its conductivity. Tomorrow's electronics

currents--if researchers can determine precisely how a single complex
molecule conducts electricity. In the 29 April print issue of PRL, a German
team shows that an asymmetrically shaped molecule conducts differently
depending on which direction the current flows. That means molecules differ
from wires in the everyday world, which conduct equally well forward or
backward, regardless of their shape. (Physical Review Focus 4/10/02)

This began in a discussion of Middle Eastern politics but I've changed the

It was my understanding that the phrase "ethnic cleansing" referred to a 
comprehensive campaign to remove an ethnic group from a region by any means 
necessary, particularly through terror techniques like mass murder, rape 
squads, death marches, and forced starvation.

While the term "ethnic cleansing", interpreted literally, may be an 
appropriate term for mass eviction, I have only seen it used as a euphemism 
for genocidal activity.  Whatever the morality of mass eviction, referring 
to it as ethnic cleansing is hyperbole that undercuts the fight to end true 
ethnic cleansing.  Much in the way that terms like murder, rape, child 
abuse, and sexual harassment have been line-extended in ridiculous ways 
that over--dramatize lesser offenses, undercutting efforts to prevent both 
the actions that these terms truly refer to and lesser harms.

When I was younger, I didn't realize how important word choice is, and the 
extent to which you can shape a discussion or attitude by leveraging the 
emotional associations that a word has.  The more we're conscious of the 
implications of word choice, and other linguistic dimensions, the more 
aware we can be of other people's hidden agendas in communicating with us 
and the more impervious we can be to attempts to manipulate us. Equally, 
through our own word choices and non-verbal attributes, we can influence 
how receptive others will be to our message and, consequently, how likely 
we are to achieve our goals.

Brian: "The Israelis didn't steal it, they bought it,
and paid top dollar." 

I am not well versed in the specifics of the
legalities of land ownership and transfer in Palestine
in the period 1859-1920 under the Ottoman Turks, and
then 1920-1947, under the British Mandate.  I have
read however, that the Ottomans, at the end, were
deeply in debt to the Europeans, and changed their
laws in 1859 to permit the sale of land.  So did the
Ottomans sell from under the Palestinians, the land
that they had lived on for generations?  There are
land sales and there are land sales.  
 
The theft I was referring to--that is, prior to the
wholesale expulsion of the Palestinians in 1947-8--was
the theft of sovereignty, the theft of political
rights, the theft of the Palestinian 'nation' (Of
course I expect in response, to hear that "the
Palestinians didn't have a 'nation'", and in the
usually accepted sense they did not. Palestine was an
outlying district of Syria, which was a suzerainty of
the Ottomans.  What the Palestinians had was 1300
years of continuous occupancy, and the internationally
recognized--though routinely ignored-- political
rights that go along with that.) The Brits and the
zionists joined forces to 'make' a nation--a jewish
homeland--Israel--on land that wasn't theirs to make
such decisions about. They knew the Palestinians had
rights, but the Brits and the zionists didn't care.
Why should they?  The Brits were the preeminent world
power with the military resources to do anything they
wanted to do, and the Palestinians were powerless to
do anything but complain.  So the Palestinians got
screwed, right out front, in full view of the entire
world.  Which is what great powers have always done.  

That, Brian, is the real story.  That's the Balfour
Declaration, and the British/zionist plan for
Palestine under the Bitish administration of the
League of Nations Mandate for Palestine.     

Brian continues:

"The reason the Palestinians are currently
dispossessed is because they lost their land trying to
destroy Israel." 

No, Brian, the reason is that the Palestinians didn't
have the military capability to prevent the zionist
colonial conquest of their land, promoted and
militarily facilitated by the British during their
League of Nations Mandate 'stewardship' of Palestine,
and buy the US thereafter.

Brian again:

"The reason they haven't regained any is because they
are still attempting to destroy Israel." 

But Brian, Israel is a criminal fact, no more
legitimate than Iraq's 19th province. It's destruction
is as fully justified as the expulsion of Iraqi forces
from Kuwait.  

Brian again:

"The real fact of the matter is that the other Arab
countries ordered them to leave so they could attack
Israel." 

So you're saying that the neighboring countries formed
a coalition to defend against a foreign aggression.  

"They were told any Arabs found living there would be
considered traitors. They also promised that they
could keep the Israelis property after they 
were destroyed. Didn't work out that way..." 

More Brian:

"I also note you failed to mention that 820,000 Jews
were kicked out of their homes in surrounding Arab
countries and their property confiscated."

A simple question: did this happen before or AFTER the
zionists fucked the Palestinians?  Lay the blame for
this where it belongs, ON THOSE WHO STARTED IT.  After
the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans
were looked upon with extreme suspicion.  Interned
even.  Imagine how much worse it could have been had
the Japanese carved out a chunk of California and
called it the Sushi Prefecture.

Brian advises:

Throttle back on the rhetoric. 

I advise: you need to examine your propaganda-bloated
worldview and learn to distinguish fact from jingoism.

Brian:
"Nonsense." 

When you have little experience or interest in the
truth--preferring the hearty flavor of to-your-taste
jingoism--the truth must surely seem like nonsense.

Brian with more:

Recommendations of the King-Crane
Commission On Syria and Palestine

http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/crane.html

But allow me to cut and paste a particularly relevant
chunk:

(3) The Commission recognized also that definite
encouragement had been given to the Zionists by the
Allies in Mr. Balfour's often quoted statement, in its
approval by other representatives of the Allies. If,
however, the strict terms of the Balfour Statement are
adhered to-favoring "the establishment in Palestine of
a national home for the Jewish people, it being
clearly understood that nothing shall be done which
may prejudice the civil and religious rights of
existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine"it can
hardly be doubted that the extreme Zionist Program
must be greatly modified. For a "national home for the
Jewish people" is not equivalent to making Palestine
into a Jewish State; nor can the erection of such a
Jewish State be accomplished without the gravest
trespass upon the "civil and religious rights of
existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine." The
fact came out repeatedly in the Commission's
conference with Jewish representatives, that the
Zionists looked forward to a practically complete
dispossession of the present non-Jewish inhabitants of
Palestine, by various forms of purchase. 

In his address of July 4, 1918, President Wilson laid
down the following principle as one of the four great
"ends for which the associated peoples of the world
were fighting": "The settlement of every question,
whether of territory, of sovereignty, of economic
arrangement or of political relationship upon the
basis of the free acceptance of that settlement by the
people immediately concerned, and not upon the basis
of the material interest or advantage of any other
nation or people which may desire a different
settlement for the sake of its own exterior influence
or mastery." If that principle is to rule, and so the
wishes of Palestine's population are to be decisive as
to what is to be done with Palestine, then it is to be
remembered that the non-Jewish population of
Palestine-nearly nine-tenths of the whole-are
emphatically against the entire Zionist program. The
tables show that there was no one thing upon which the
population of Palestine was more agreed than upon
this. To subject a people so minded to unlimited
Jewish immigration, and to steady financial and social
pressure to surrender the land, would be a gross
violation of the principle just quoted, and of the
peoples' rights, though it kept within the forms of
law. 

It is to be noted also that the feeling against the
Zionist program is not confined to Palestine, but
shared very generally by the people throughout Syria,
as our conferences clearly showed. More than 72 per
cent--1350 in all--of all the petitions in the whole
of Syria were directed against the Zionist program.
Only two requests-those for a united Syria and for
independence-had a larger support. This general
feeling was only voiced by the "General Syrian
Congress," in the seventh, eighth and tenth
resolutions of their statement [paras. 7, 8, 10, Doc.
251.... 

The Peace Conference should not shut its eyes to the
fact that the anti-Zionist feeling in Palestine and
Syria is intense and not lightly to be flouted. No
British officer, consulted by the Commissioners,
believed that the Zionist program could be carried out
except by force of arms. The officers generally
thought a force of not less than fifty thousand
soldiers would be required even to initiate the
program. That of itself is evidence of a strong sense
of the injustice of the Zionist program, on the part
of the non-Jewish populations of Palestine and Syria.
Decisions, requiring armies to carry out, are
sometimes necessary, but they are surely not
gratuitously to be taken in the interests of a serious
injustice. For the initial claim, often submitted by
Zionist representatives, that they have a "right" to
Palestine, based on an occupation of two thousand
years ago, can hardly be seriously considered. 

      ---------------end of excerpt---------- 

By the way, despite my name, I am one hundred percent
Ashkenaz Jew and proud of it.  The blood of Abraham
surges in my veins.  My opposition to the state of
israel is based on the unjust way it came into being,
the ongoing lie being promulgated to cover the current
and historic facts, and the savage toxic horror that
is the consequence.  Not anti-semetism.

Whatever constitutes an extropic approach to this
problem, I would suggest that it begins with telling
the truth.  Finding the truth appears, however, to be
a non-trivial undertaking. 

I'm reminded of the words of Mark Twain:  "Always tell
the truth.  You'll please some people, and astonish
the rest."

Best, Jeff Davis

You can go even further Rafal.  You could run the system for a while
on a negative energy balance.  Its not like we are short on supplies
of plutonium or other hot radioactive wastes that could be used to
melt the granite, freeing the hydrogen.  You could kill two birds
with one stone -- get a clean fuel and sequester nuclear weapons
materials and nuclear waste at the same time... :-)

Ohhhh, Spike, how much granite could we melt (or make moderately soft)
with 100 tons of plutonium?

I didn't read the article -- I'd tend to think you would find
more hydrogen in sedementary rocks rather than igneous rocks.
Thoughts?

While the Yugoslavian cleansing campaigns were far more reprehensible than
any hypothetical Isreali one, they killed only a small fraction of the 
population
of Kosovo and the disputed Croatian territories.  Certainly not genocide.
Recent events in Macedonia have been referred to as ethnic cleansing and
the death tolls there are comparable to the current Israeli-Palestian war.
Rwanda was a whole different ball game.  Ethnic cleansing can refer to things
far worse than what's going on in Palestine but I think this is an appropriate
use of the word.  Genocide should be referred to as, well, genocide.

The period I was refering to was under the British mandate 1920-
1947. The Zionists bagan moving to the middle east and buying
desert scrub from the people living there paying up to $1000 an
acre for desert at a time when prime Iowa farmland was $100 an
acre.

The Palestinians weren't expelled, they left at the orders of the
Arabs who were about to attack. They were screwed when the war
didn't go as expected. 

The Brits didn't join with the Zionists, they hated each other, the
Israelis fought their own terrorist campaign against them.


It was the U.N that tried to solve this, your facts are wrong.

I've read the Balfour Declaration, and the U.N. resolutions, and
the commentaries by those involved. My interpretation is completely
different from yours.

The Jews didn't attack, the Arabs did, and there were 5 Arab armies
involved. The only thing the Zionists were declaring a country was
the land they had bought. The Balfour declaration came later as an
attempt to solve the conflict.

The British were anti-Zionist.

Besides being able to locate all chipped persons instantly and 
potentially track their movements completely (including who they 
met with and for how long and where), there are also a few more 
possibilities for feeding paranoia.  Similar devices that give 
electric shocks or other unpleasantness to prisoners under house 
arrest have been worked on.  There is some possiblity of 
applications that effect moods and mental functioning.  Some 
versions of such chips may contain such "special" features.

I love computers and technology but some of the possible abuses 
have me a bit worried.

I think I saw something like this in action when I moved here four
years ago, and went on a tour of a countryside with a doctor and his
family. On our return to Heidelberg, we stopped at a small farm. The
farmer and the doctor were friends, and so we received a tour of the
farm and I learned some facts about the dairy industry in a European
Union country. Do you remember the note Serafino posted regarding
the European Union requirement that all peas must have no more and
no less than 6 peas in a pod? The rest of the farm business is
similar.

Farmers are allowed to sell milk of particular percentage fat in the
EU, so if they have some milk with more fat or less fat, that milk
doesn't get sold. Therefore, the farmers tightly control the fat
percentages of the milk produced by their cows. (Otherwise they lose
money.) Do you see how EU politics changes the methods of such a
simple industry?

The way they control the fat content is to precisely monitor the
food intake of their cows. Each cow wears a transponder that
identifies that particular cow. Each cow is allowed to go into the
main feed area a particular number of times per day. When the cow
enters the feed area, the electronic device in the feed area that
identifies that particular cow (because it is wearing a transponder)
signals the food dispenser to give a particular food (quantity and
type) to that particular cow.

So not exactly a chip, but this transponder perhaps has a similar
purpose to the chip.

I was also amused with other methods by this farmer. He said that
"unhappy cows produce sour milk" so he is very concerned that his
cows are happy (they receive exceedingly good care).

The transponders provide locations at any time for any of the
cows. So if one has the right computer and software at home, a
farmer can watch his/her cows on his computer. This funny fact
prompted the doctor to say to me: "they run the cows under Windows".

It's interesting that we've been arguing so avidly.  If I were to devise a 
Solomonic solution it wouldn't be all that different from yours.  Actually, 
yours isn't too different from the Saudi plan either.  I disagree in that I 
don't think stopping the violence first is necessary.  Particularly when one 
of the sides is highly divided and disorganized, negotiation is an excellent 
technique for settling things down.

And I dont. As you noted, "thou shalt not murder" is not in the
principles, nor is there anything in the principles that disavows the
use of rational, proportionate force in defense of human life and an
extropic future.

You falsely assume that using force is somehow 'giving up' on the
Principles.

And you set a false standard. You assume that a) the libertarian
principle of non-initiation of force means never using force under any
conditions, and b) that this libertarian principle is somehow in the
Extropian Principles. You are wrong on both counts.

Why do you think that my rhetorical question a) assumes that the
Principles doom humanity, and b) that my question abandons them, and
that c) I think that force is the *best* method that trumps all other
human endeavor?

On the last question, I can say that when law prevents science, logic
and rationality from even attempting to try, those who propose,
advocate, and pass such laws do become genocidal fascists.

I never said that this would be the first strategy. I was merely asking
you (and the rest of the list) to ask yourself what acts you are
yourself willing to engage in, under what circumstances, to save the
human race from luddism.

I can say that if even 1/4 of our most general predictions come true
(especially those which the luddites agree will occur), then a luddite
control of the future will cause the deaths of half the human race to a
90%+ probability. Just as gun control caused 100 million deaths in the
20th century, technology control in the 21st will kill many times more.

What are you willing to do to prevent those deaths from occuring?

Neither will I. However, I am rather disappointed in Pro-Act. It has
been a year since it's been allegedly founded, yet it has really
achieved absolutely nothing so far. I have offered my services on
multiple occasions with *absolutely no response*. As far as I can tell,
it has little or no budget, no fundraising apparatus, no publications or
press releases, position papers and outside of a minor mention in one
online article by the opposition, has attracted zero attention from the
enemy. It seems to me that all Pro-Act has accomplished is to help
perpetuate a hands-off lackadaisical attitude in the general
transhumanist community to defuse our just anger at the current
domination of the public technology agenda by the luddites.

I think Jeff's post points out how extremely complex
the Mid-East situation is.  Should not the Palestinians
or Arabs be taking their frustration out on the Turks
rather than the Jews?  [from:]

Ok, here we have a case of religious extremism that
should be clearly identified as such.  I expect this
extends to the "settlements" issue of our time.
One wonders how the Zionists would treat communities
of Zoroastrians, Sufis or Zen Buddhists living in
their midst(!).

In fact an *interesting* peace proposal could revolve
around community transplantation -- complete exchange
of Palestinian communities with alternate ethno-religious
communities with appropriate financial compensation
to make it *very* attractive.  Exchange several million
Palestinians with several million Indian Hindus.  What
would the Israelis do then?

The key point from my perspective seems to be rejecting
the "material interest or advantage of any other nation
or people".  If you can *really* buy a person off then
it seems resonable to do it!  I mean *really* are the
Palestinians or Israelis *so* attached to scraps of
what is mostly desert that they cannot be bought out
and be moderately happy that they are getting a fair deal?

In tnis case, what seems appropriate is for the wealthier
Western countries to propose a land for $ sale -- they
will buy up land (whether they be in Isreal or "Palestine"),
bank it for a generation to let tensions diminish, then
sell them back to the highest bidder.  I.e. each individual
is allowed to make a choice between their "beliefs" and their
"conditions".

The key problem may be related to the "property rights" and
"system of law" arguments of Hernanodo de Soto.  Because the property
rights for the land of Israel/Palestine are so messed up both parties
have legitimate claims.  It should be up to courts to resolve
those claims.  I'd tend to agree with Jeff -- that it will be
problematic for "claims" rely on words from heaven (really bad)
or history ("my family lived here 2000 years ago") rather than
concrete evidence that "this was *my* family land".  The older
claims it would be *very* difficult to verify even if the they
were really legitimate(!) -- e.g. the "claims" were taken by
force of arms when property rights documentation was unavailable.
Then the best way to resolve the problem is by buying people out
at a "fair" price.  At least in the news articles I have read
suggests that seems to be an allowed component of the 1940's UN
policy (the trick is to make it "fair").  

Perhaps the way to deal with the refugee situation is simply
compensation.  Pay people off to forego the right of return
(for the Palestinians) or their right of "claim" to Israel
(for the Jews).

Can you convert the rule of emotions to a rule of law?

The point is that "ethnic cleansing" refers to removing 
(virtually) all people of an ethnicity from an area involuntarily.
It may be genocidal, or it may not.  

I actually forgot the best example of a low death count cleansing,
which is the Croatian expulsion of Serbs from the disputed territories
in Croatia several years ago.  Very few people died in that one, but
the Serbs were indeed disposessed.  The international community was
disturbingly quiet over it, although since the war in Bosnia was going on
at the time there were distractions and there was a reluctance to admit
that some Serbs could be victims too.  Groupism again - apparently people
have a hard time grasping person A is getting victimized while his distant
relative is victimizing 50 miles away and *both* activities are equally
wrong.  Yes, I know that in this case the activities were not equally wrong,
but still...

I would note that the Dutch government has recently resigned
for its "acts of omission" in allowing such "cleansing" campaigns
to occur.

The fraction of the population is not so important as actual
numbers.

If it were only thousands of people who were murdered it
ranks on the scale of the 911 tragedy (perhaps more so
because it happened over a greater period of time, involved
people who were aware of what was taking place, who were supposed
to be "protecting" the refugees and *could* have prevented it).

And one can compare thousands or tens of thousands of people
killed in 911 vs. Yogoslavia with the millions that die from
hunger and starvation every year or the tens of millions that
die from "natural causes" every year.  Creating a "proper"
context for evaluating deaths is *not* an easy thing to do.
You have to balance absolute counts with how difficult it
may be to prevent each death.

The British attitude toward the Zionist movement was lukewarm at best, and 
hostile at worst.  Their policies during the Mandate were, to the contrary, 
clearly pro-Arab.  Jewish immigration was sharply curtailed, even in the 
wake of the Holocaust.  Passengers were sent back to die or 
languish.  Jewish access to weaponry was severely limited by the British, 
which made the Arab riots in the 1920's more horrible than they would have 
been had the Jews been able to defend themselves.  The British did nothing 
to stop the riots and little to punish the criminal rioters.  They often 
conducted raids to seize Jewish weapons and arrest those found with them, 
and did not similarly restrain the Arab population.

As WW II darkened, the British and Haganah formed an uneasy alliance to 
fight Hitler while the Arabs applauded the Axis.  (Which continued to this 
day.  Sadat and Arafat, for example, used to give speeches praising 
Hitler.  (NOT the usual "smear your opponent by calling him a Nazi" -- I 
have copies somewhere and I'm sure you can find them on the web.))

The land that the Jews acquired in Palestine from the first wave of 
immigration in the late 1800's to the end of the Mandate was entirely 
purchased from individual Arab natives at well-above market rates, not from 
the Ottoman Empire or the British.  The Jews paid premium prices for swamp 
land, which they braved malaria to drain and then farmed.  During Ottoman 
and Mandate years, the government placed restrictions on how much land 
could be sold to Jews.

BTW, although some of the initial Jewish settlements in Palestine were 
attacked by local Arabs (see the story of Tel Hai), relations between Arabs 
and Jews were sometimes very friendly, during the first few waves of Jewish 
settlement.  Moshe Dayan's autobiography, for example, tells of the 
friendships he forged.  In later years, the Jews were shocked to be 
attacked by people they had considered friends.

This is all stuff that we had to read chapter after chapter about, full of 
specifics and copies of British or Ottoman source documents.

>PS I checked into www.camera.org ;

>thought police; but skillfully done.  I wonder where they get their funding.

Similar to the questions of drug efficacy, liberal media bias, or the 
utility of shall-issue CCW permits, the validity (or lack thereof) of 
CAMERA's findings can be ascertained by rigorous analysis, without regard 
to the tenor or funding of the organization.  I've seen several CAMERA 
reports that give a detailed numeric analysis of media coverage of the 
Middle East.  They explain their sources and methodology in sufficient 
detail as to allow independent confirmation.

Another issue that I haven't seen discussed here (and rarely elsewhere) is 
the life of an Israeli Arab compared to the life of, say, a Syrian 
Arab.  An Israeli Arab, while not as well-off as an Israeli Jew, still has 
far more freedom, economic prosperity, and life expectancy than an Arab in 
almost any other Arab country.  (Not to mention how well off the Bedouin, 
Druze, Ba'hai, and Christians are.  While Arabs can vote and be elected to 
the Knesset, they are not trusted enough to serve in the 
military.  Military service is not mandatory for the Bedouin and Druze as 
it is for Jews, but they do have the option of enlisting, and many have.)

And if we're talking extropianism, the values and culture of Israeli 
society would seem to be beyond question far more worthy of support than 
those of its foes, and far closer to our ideals.  Speaking as someone who 
lived there for five years, I probably know better than most of you how 
short they fall, but they're closer, and heading in the right direction.

Brian Williams replied:

Mr. Davis holds Israel to a different standard then other nations , and this is curious. If we look into how Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, etc, were "founded" I would suspect that Israel's sins are fairly comprable, or perhaps even better then these nations I have mentioned. If we look further back into history, the rivers of blood that have flowed to jump-start, even the USA are quite impressive. Other societies have rather similar histories. 

About one's ethnic heritage being a barrier against anti-semiticism (sp?) For example, I seem to recall that even Torquemada, the Inquisitions' torturer, had some Jewish blood in his veins as well as on his boots ;-)

Your passionately, held, beliefs would be more persuasive, Mr. Davis, if you could criticize the Palestinians, with the same vehemence you direct toward the Israelis. But seeing as that appears anathema to you..? <shrug>  But after following your argumentation, let me ask: Is your solution a Two-State solution? Or would you just rather have the Israelis disappear?

Me, too.

My outrage at the post I was responding to stemmed from the moral 
equivalence you were implicitly implying with the use of the term "ethnic 
cleansing".  If we use your more-neutral phrase 'mass eviction', I'm 
comfortable with continuing the discussion.

Are there any circumstances under which you would consider mass eviction to 
be an appropriate response, perhaps as the least offensive resolution to 
some situation with no good alternatives?  Or is it always unacceptable?

(Consider, for example, that Thomas Jefferson and others felt that it be 
preferably to forcibly return freed slaves to Africa over attempting to 
integrate them into their society.)

I discussed in my previous post aspects of how Bedouin, Druze, and Arabs 
are integrated into Israeli society.  There was a Baptist village down the 
road from us; I'd walk the three miles there to use their swimming 
pool.  Various Christian enclaves near sites holy to them.  The world 
headquarters for the Ba'hai faith is in Haifa.  Israel is very tolerant of 
non-Jewish religions, although they loathe Mormon missionaries and are 
insufficiently tolerant of American branches of Judaism.

The system is basically everyone is equal, but some people are more equal 
than others.  Non-Jews can become Israeli citizens, through a five-year 
process that is very similar to what the US has.  But anyone who can prove 
Jewishness can instantly become a citizen, under the Law of Return.  (This, 
combined with the leverage that the religious political parties have always 
had when government coalitions are formed and the clout that American Jews 
have, has meant that there were several decades of arguing over Who Is A 
Jew, focusing on whether Israel has to recognize conversions to Judaism 
performed by non-Orthodox rabbis under the Law of Return.)  There's also a 
quasi-governmental organization called the Jewish Agency funded largely by 
American Jews that routes money and services to the Jewish population while 
reducing the appearance of a two-tier system.

Family law is under the jurisdiction of religious courts, one for each 
religion.  They have complete autonomy, and their decisions are not subject 
to review by the secular court system.  People who want to do something 
that their religion disapproves of, like marry someone of a different 
faith, fly to Cyprus (much as Irish women travel to Britain for 
abortions).  When they return, the non-Israeli civil marriage is recognized.

Israel extended itself nearly to the breaking point to bring in hundreds of 
thousands of Sephardic Jews, who were culturally quite alien to the 
dominant Eastern European Ashkenazim and physically resemble the 
Arabs.  More recently, they brought over many Ethiopian Jews, who appear to 
be black.  Their existence is presumably a consequence of Solomon's 
dalliance with the Queen of Sheba.

It's funny you mention Indian Hindus; there are apparently about 
100,000,000 Indians whose claim for Jewish identity is at least as good as 
the claim the Ethiopians have.  (There are Jews everywhere; there used to 
be a thriving community in Shanghai with the most curious variations on 
religious observance.)  Some of them have sought the Right of Return.  The 
authorities in Israel have stalled on answering their request.  If even a 
small fraction moved there, the country would be dramatically transformed.

Meanwhile, there were a couple decades when Israel and the United States 
pursued the plight of Soviet Jewry.  Consequent to this, many Russians 
asserted Jewishness and moved to Israel.  Turns out more than a few weren't 
Jewish at all; they just wanted out of the USSR.

Perhaps over the course of several generations.  It's 
funny:  intellectually, I know how little most people are governed by 
logic, so I try to take this into account.  But I'm still surprised when 
they aren't.

None whatsoever because the future that I wish to see is a 
future for everyone not just those you (or I for that matter) 
might not consider "luddites".

It is not for certain that a malthusian future is the only 
alternative to transhumanism.  I find it a bit strange and 
strained that you would take roughly a Club of Rome position on 
our future sans transhumanism.

If we start killing off all who aren't with the program on a 
transhuman future in order to "guarantee" said future then 
billions will certainly die.  Many of the transhuman Singularity 
scenarios have a high potential of billions dying or even the 
entire non-uploaded human race. This is a problem.

We didn't know then and you don't know now.  You may think you do.

Huh?  Terrorism?  Except for a few radical Greens just exactly 
what are you speaking of?  If we want to win we need to take the 
moral high ground.  If we want to do that we must really have 
something much better, not just for the few, but for all 
humanity.  That generally precludes killing off the opposition.

Irrelevant to talk of killing of what you judge to be "luddites".

Well, several groups I consider fascists or worse are usually 
defended by you so I am not sure if I understand exactly what 
you "are on" about. Those who don't mind large groups of people 
dying or who think it is just come in many different stripes but 
they are all a danger imho.

I think what is most necessary to human survival is to get over 
our apish attitudes and learn to thing in larger terms than our 
own group.  Higher technology, especially that leading to 
intelligence augmentation and fuller abundance, will certainly 
help IF enough of us grow a bit in time.  Even among extropians 
I don't see unambiquous evidence that such growth is forthcoming 
or its importance even understood.

Is hawkishness acceptable when its outcome is possibly millions 
if not billions of lives?  Loaded questions can be asked from 
both directions.  The greatest sin of omission is a bit of 
compassion and living according to what one really believes to 
be right.

I intend to do what I can to get through to them about happier 
alternatives than they envision.  What do *you* intend to do 
about it?  Wipe them off the deserving to live list?   Do you 
really believe that most of those who you or even I consider 
relatively luddite understand what the alternatives are?   If 
not do you plan to portray the ignorant as monsters and 
therefore perhaps ok to kill?

Someone a while ago mentioned that Vernor Vinge would be GoH at ConJose,
this year's world SF convention  (see www.conjose.org). Someone else
asked if Ken MacLeod would be there. Ken won't be there,  but now I can
reveal that _I_ will be there, on account of having been shortlisted
for a Hugo, dammit, for a novelette that tries to explore some extropian
themes. (So has Ken, but he's going to be GoH at the Polish national SF 
convention at the same time.)

Anyway. What are the prospects for some kind of extropian/futurological
get-together at the con?

Whether I go may depend on whether I can find someone to share a hotel room,
since four/five nights at $100+/per is a wee bit pricey... any takers?

Just a quick note having just heard ABC (Aus) Radio 3RN Science Show, that
the Uni of New South Wales (Australia) thinks they will have a commercial
protoype direct H20 to H2+O2 within 5 years, commercialisable in a
subsequent 2 years.

The process is based on using titanium in a way that I'm not familiar with.
It generates enough electrical potential under the right conditions to
simply split moisture using sunlight. The installations are small and
robust. Test units have been running for a year or more on the lab roof.

The implications are huge. The words were "prepare, at last, for the
hydrogen economy and the final disconnection of our dependence from Middle
East Oil supplies". The last time this was forecast was in 1972ish. The
economics of hydrogen has changed, the storage and usage technology has
matured and and the 15% efficiency level needed (for the titanium system) is
within site of reasonable funding.

This is a trigger point just like the early days of the fax, mobile phone,
ATM, internet, video machine, DVD, PC etc etc.....may it roll on down.....

*cynic hat on*
1) In the absence of any intelligent funding from stupid shortsight ignorant
frightened corner-store minded Australians who would rather invest in a
MacDonalds franchise, a US conglmerate will snap it up and we'll lose all
the royalties, spinoffs and ultimately all the brains. As f.....g usual.
OR
2) An oil company will finance it and bury it.
*cynic hat off*

cheers,

colin
PS: a spinoff! - They are looking at real-time many-gas concentration
measurement with tiny transducers - able to be put into every miner's
helmet. This came from their work on the gas analysis of the output of the
new H2 generators. Cool!

There will be several extropians at ConJose.  If no other arrangements
are made I suggest meeting up with some of them at the Prometheus Awards
ceremony of the Libertarian Futurist Society.  Also a LFS room party is
in the planning stages.

Vanessa,

They say the epicenter was just south and west of Plattsburgh.  That's about
100 miles north of were I live.  We got a pretty good shake, the biggest
quake I've felt in upstate NY and only the second that I've felt in over 20
years.  No damage around here, but the local news said there were reports of
"damage" farther north.  No word on the extent.

Tom

I thought that the concept of "defense" required a clear attack to 
defend against.  I think you are talking about pre-emptive strikes by 
killing Luddites because their movement will harm the future, but not 
because the specific Luddite killed was currently initiating any 
specific violence.  In such a scenario, I would consider our side to be 
the attacker or the initiator of force.

I believe that you agree that violence is to be used as a last resort.  
By resorting to violence, I believe you are giving up hope that any 
other methods will succeed.  I think each of the Extropian Principles 
must be determined to be a nonviable solution before the final resort of 
violence is used.  Thus, I consider this last resort to be equivalent of 
giving up on the other Principles.

No, it means never initiating force.  Until the Luddites specifically do 
violence to us, I don't think we can do violence in return.  If we do 
violence first, we would be initiating force where none had been used 
before.  I do believe that this would run counter to the Principles of 
Libertarianism.

I do agree that your argument of no other recourse is compelling.  
However, I do not believe that this will actually happen.  I am not sure 
it is even theoretically possible to know or prove that all possible 
options have been tried and failed.  In any case, I am pretty sure that 
we have not reached that point yet.

Again, I concede that given your premise, this might be an acceptable 
response.  But to be more specific, I do not think your trigger scenario 
will happen or is even possible.  I believe that there will always be 
further options without resorting to violence.

Just as a thought experiment, don't you think that your line of 
reasoning is exactly what the suicide bombers are claiming?  I am sure 
that you do not agree with them, nor do I think you are like them.  But 
train of thought leading up to the violence seems to be the same 
argument that every violent person uses.  They claim there is no other 
way and that they had to do what they did.  What would be different in 
our case versus theirs?  Is it just the knowledge that we are "right" 
while they were "wrong", or is there a different logic or criteria at 
work here?

I am assuming that your only resort to violence as a last resort.  
Therefore, if you propose such violence, I am assuming that you think 
nonviolence will fail.

I probably shouldn't have implied that you thought violence was the 
"best" method.  What I meant to say is that your "best" or "preferred" 
methods are predicted to fail such that the "non-best" method of 
violence becomes the lesser of two evils.  I do understand that you 
don't prefer violence or consider it best, just that you think it is the 
only option that will work in such extreme cases.

OK.  I think I have answered.  And I do understand that this is a 
thought provoking question.  I don't really think you are proposing this 
(yet).  But the discussion may lead to ground-setting precedence in the 
future.  Future actions are based on past philosophies.  Most religious 
conflicts bear this out.  If we decide that violence may be the answer 
in certain cases, then people will be primed and ready to use violence 
when those cases occur.  This concerns me because I disagree that 
violence is the answer, and do not think those cases will ever actually 
occur.

Let's clarify here.  Are you talking about new deaths, or more deaths 
than are occuring now?  If so, exactly how does this come about in your 
scenario?  Or are you talking about not extending current lives or not 
saving more lives than are saved now?  There is a difference between 
killing someone who would not have otherwise died, and merely not saving 
someone who would have died under most normal circumstances.  For 
example, are you calling lack of cloning the same as deaths, or lack of 
life extension the same as premature deaths, or lack of uploads as 
deaths?  This becomes a lighter argument, in my opinion, because we are 
talking about the loss of theoretical extra lives or extra years that 
aren't available yet.  There is a chance that they never could become 
available.

If this argument is about a lack of life saving as opposed to actual 
killing or additional deaths or shortening of natural lifespan, I think 
it is even more unreasonable to use violence to counter a theoretical 
lack of gain.  It is like trying to sue for lost wages at a business 
that never really made money.  Or suing for sterility over the loss of 
children that never existed.  Or even more provocatively, this is like 
considering abortion murder for the loss of a being that might have been 
but never was.  Are these the "deaths" you are referencing, the 
theoretical life-extensionists, the uploads, the clones, or the new 
miraculously saved humans?  Or is there expected to be killing or 
premature deaths or a shortening of normal life-span that I am missing 
here?

Your gun control example is a perfect example of what I am talking 
about.  I think it is debatable to say that gun control has caused 100 
million deaths.  If you decided to assassinate congress members who 
support gun control as "self-defense" of 100 million people in the 
future, I would think that this was a spurious claim.  The debatable 
number of theoretical deaths that may or may not really occur at some 
time in the future are not enough justification of violence toward a 
congress person who believes in gun control and has never initiated 
violence against anyone.  The cause and effect is too theoretical and 
too distant to count as self-defense in my book.

> Now you are just being silly.

Yes, but I think I was pointing out the slippery slope problem when we 
start killing people for their ideas instead of their direct actions.  
Many people have very dangerous ideas that could destroy all of humanity 
if they were to be implemented.  But I think we must wait until the 
threat of imminent violence before we can respond with violence.  A 
pre-emptive strike to kill an idea just in case it might take over 
public opinion is too premature.

I agree with this 100%.  I have been very discouraged at our general 
ineffectiveness on a number of fronts.  I think this difficulty is our 
biggest problem.  Almost all of our activities boil down to 
spin-doctoring, in the form of web sites and mailing lists, PR releases 
and interviews.  I think this topic needs a whole other discussion about 
what we should do and how we should do it.  I am sure that no one 
deliberately ignored your offers to help out of a desire to make Pro-Act 
ineffectual.  The problems are as you describe.  Everyone is overworked, 
underpaid, too busy, and have no time or resources to make a real 
impact.  Little bursts of activity here and there look promising and 
generate great ideas, but we don't have the resources to sustain them.  
This is nobody's particular fault.  But I do think something has to 
change somehow, but I don't know what.  I don't know if we need to 
pursue better funding, clearer goals, better organization and planning, 
different agendas, public support, or what.

I apologize.  I do get overzealous and excited on certain topics.  I 
think I have responded too literally to your suppositions, and I think 
you probably have responded too defensively to my critiques.  Besides 
the ineffectual progress problem mentioned before, I think the 
difficulty of debate over e-mail is our second biggest problem.  It may 
be our monkey genes, or it may be the medium of e-mail, or it may be 
inevitable.  Humans get emotional when the argue and disagree.  It gets 
worse when basic core assumptions are challenged or opposed.  It is even 
worse in our case where very intelligent and creative individuals 
deserving of respect in all sorts of different areas oppose such issues 
that seem obvious to our own personal beliefs.  We can't just ignore 
such differences, since we want to work together and plan an extended 
future of cooperation and accomplishment.  This makes it ever more vital 
and more frustrating to disagree.  So we try harder, and we keep trying, 
and we just won't quit trying to rehash the same issue indefinitely, 
trying to find some common ground or at least some understanding.

I think it is like a love-hate relationship.  The more we respect the 
person, and the more we dislike the idea, the greater the discontinuity 
appears, and the more emotional our response is, as is our desire to 
figure out some resolution.  My past arguments with you about gun 
control have not been because I seek out gun issues to oppose.  This 
never comes up elsewhere in my life.  It is more because I do respect 
you and see you as creative and intelligent.  It therefore is even more 
surprising that my knee-jerk reaction to an issue does not match yours.  
I challenge your statements, not so much to attack you, but to test the 
solidity of your data, to further explore the reasoning behind the 
positions, and better understand the opposing viewpoint.  These kinds of 
discussion should be learning experiences and attempts to build 
cooperation between different viewpoints.  Unfortunately, human nature 
makes them quickly degenerate into emotional battles where 
communications is the first casualty.

As an example, I have learned a lot from this exchange with you.  I 
don't really think you are a trigger-happy assassin looking for an 
excuse to start blowing Luddites away.  Your rhetorical question of 
where to draw the line was intriguing and thought-provoking.  Although 
we each have different ideas, and may never agree, I think we have both 
express our reasonings and have laid out a whole strategy or scenario 
for our positions.  I fully understand your position, and it is 
reasonable and logical within its framework.  I think I have isolated 
the specific key difference, which would be when we can decide that we 
have tried every nonviolent action and that only violence remains.  This 
could be an area for further research to determine that answer.  We 
currently have our inexact gut-feelings giving us different answers.  
But we both are hopefully better at understanding alternate viewpoints, 
or at least can anticipate future objections to such a scenario when 
they occur again.

Sorry for such a long post.  As you can tell, I have been thinking a lot 
about our movement's ineffectiveness and our difficulties in 
communications.  I waver between frustration and discouragement, and 
between bitching and philosophising.  Sometimes I don't know whether to 
give up or strive harder.  Giving up seems easier, but in the end 
striving harder always wins out.  I don't know why.

Non sequitur.     You said that I refused to take responsibility for the 
consequences of my own position.  When I pointed out that I actually did 
do this, you changed your complaint.

I did actually respond to your counterexamples.  I understand that you 
disagree that my response resolved our objections.  But that is not the 
same thing as me not responding.

A US politician caught lying under oath, or embezzling money, might be
castigated, thrown out of office, thrown into jail.  The government of
the Netherlands has resigned en masse recently for failing to stop
ethnic cleansing in Serba -- not for being complicit, but for being
bumbling.

But the politicians of North Korea are causing their citizens to starve
en masse, and the West doesn't really care.  Oh, we'll say it's horrible
and even evil if asked about it, but it doesn't make the news as much as
local scandals.  Why is there a double standard?

Most of the people I know will readily admit Israel is far better than
any of the Arab countries.  But yes, Israel gets the detailed criticism.
Part of this is thinking of Israel as "us".  Part of it is utility --
Israel's close enough, and democratic enough, to have a real hope of
shaming it into shape, hope you just don't have with Saudi Arabia or
North Korea.  And part of it is the standards Israel claims for itself.
Israel's proud of being "the only democracy in the Middle East".  Israel
was founded largely by European Jews, with European values.  Israel
expects that the horror of the Holocaust be seen as significant --
expects that the Holocaust be _seen_ as a horror.  But the modern value
systems which view the arbitrary killing of another tribe as a horror
come with baggage, such as not torturing prisoners, or censoring your
occupation residents.  The Arab states, and North Korea, don't even
pretend to subscribe to our value systems, so we don't waste time
pointing out how they fail.

It's more complicated, since they do slightly, and we do, somewhat.  But
essentially Israel wants to be treated as an enlightened Western
country, and gets judged by that standard.  Saudi Arabia is just a
distasteful ally, as we no doubt are to them, and gets judged by that
standard.  There's not much middle ground.

Unfortunately for Israel, because I often think of it as a
contradiction.  Founded by Westerners, with Western values, for tribal
purposes, partially in retreat from the tribal persecution they suffered
in Europe.  I don't think it's a particularly healthy mix.

Not to mention Irgun:
 On April 9, 1947, a group of Irgun commandos raided the Arab

One thing to take away from that might be that states shouldn't be
established, at least not as a primary goal.

And there have been peaceful secessions, actually: the Soviet Union, the
breakup of Czechoslovakia, Iceland's departure from Denmark, and maybe
Norway's secession from Sweden, although I can't swear to a total
absence of Norwegian terrorism.  And weren't a lot of the African and
Arab countries in fact established peacefully by the departing colonial
powers?  "We're out of here, you're in charge, enjoy."  Given the
starting point of the British in charge of former Ottoman territory,
there's no a priori reason a state there couldn't have been peacefully
carved out and formed.  Of course, it probably wouldn't have been a
Zionist state.

         :

Nicely put.  We extropians, individually and as we interact with each 
other, are far more governed by our social conditioning and biological 
heritage than we like to admit.  We espouse such grand ideals and then fall 
far short of them in practice.

But it's so damned hard to change.  For example, growing up Jewish in the 
New York area, I took it for granted that people interrupt each other in 
conversation.  Everyone does it, and no one minds particularly or thinks 
less of you.  Then I moved to a state where it was considered insufferably 
rude. Since then -- 20 years now -- I've been trying to retrain myself not 
to interrupt, recognizing that my speaking style was harming my 
effectiveness in achieving my goals in interacting with other people.  I 
haven't gotten very far.

The only times I've been able to make permanent changes in habits like that 
have been when I had a friend, co-worker, or SO who would bring every lapse 
to my attention.  After a few weeks, the modification would become 
ingrained and there was no longer a risk of reversion.

So, two important questions:

         (1) What has/hasn't worked for you in behavioral transformation?
         (2) What can we do as a group or individually to improve the tenor 
of discussion on the list?

Yeah, it was centered up near Plattburg, NY and was felt all the way to
Virginia. I felt it this morning. Felt like a combination of a crowd of
people moshing on the roof and a jet flying directly overhead. This is
the strongest quake in this region since a high-5 to low 6 quake back in
the 80's, though there have been occasional lesser tremors. Nothing
spectacular compared to the west coast, but a nice wake up call.

Great questions!   

Things that have worked to change bad (or sub-optimal) habits:
1) Meditation  helps me sit in a different place in my head where I 
notice what I am doing, feeling, thinking rather than just being 
given by it and totally caught up.  This gives me more room to choose.

2) People that will remind me

3) Paying attention to how much it bothers me when I'm on the 
receiving end (only works for things I dislike in others)

4) Remind myself that I care more for effectiveness than for the 
aggrandizement of my emotions or ego

What can we do as a group or individually to improve our discussions?

1) Most of it is individual - the work we do on ourselves

2) Remember: "You are not the target."  Even when someone is saying 
you are a real idiot it is usually the case that what they are 
reacting to is not precisely you but a whole chain of their own 
beliefs and perceptions that have for a moment found their focus in 
you and your words.  If you can speak to those instead of taking it 
personally you will generally be a lot more effective

3) Set some workable group expectations of how we discuss, speak to 
one another.  By workable I mean ones that we don't quibble endlessly 
over and fight about.  :-)

4) Always assume the other person cares about many things you do and 
cares just as passionately as you do.

5) When some one or some group of people apparently don't care about 
something you care about a lot don't assume they are thereby "evil".  
Did you always care about the same things you do now or have your 
current understanding?  Are you absolutely certain your view is the 
only reasonable one?

Acceptable pre-emptive use of force:
If you see someone point a gun at someone, you can shoot them before
they actually pull the trigger.
If you see or have evidence of someone conspiring to kill someone, and
and they lay in wait to do so, killing them before they actually pull
the trigger is acceptable.
If you know someone has a nuclear weapon, or other stand-off destructive
device, and threatens to use it against you for no reason you have
created, killing them before they a) produce, b) deliver, c) set off,
the weapon is acceptable preemption.

Do you accept any of these circumstances as acceptable pre-emptive use
of force?

But we are also dealing with threshold points between population growth
and technological development curves. If the tech curve is retarded to
some degree, the population curve will swamp it.

To respond to Samantha's chiding me for subscribing to the Club of Rome
predictions: If not for technological progress, EVERYTHING that Malthus
and the Club of Rome predicted WOULD come true. Not *might* come true,
WOULD. Technological advancement is the one factor they found impossible
to predict, or did not even consider. Exponential growth of technologies
was never even thought possible by them to the extent it is already
occuring.

On that note, we do not have a cut-off date of 2020 or 2030 or 2040 to
base a drop dead decision on. It is far closer than you think, more like
2005-2010, if not right now. If the Luddites are allowed to retard
technological development even to a fraction of what they want, this
WILL result in a devastation of the human race at least on the scale
predicted by Vernor Vinge in "The Peace War".

Well, the Luddites are already committing violence against us, on two
fronts: they are using the martial force of government to ban cloning
and other genetic engineering work on the human, animal, and plant
genomes, as well as the illegal use of terrorism in insurgent action
against specific targets. The second strategy has resulted already in
over $100 million in damage and the deaths of thousands of animals. 

By your criteria, it is now acceptable for us to a) lobby for laws
against luddism and luddite tactics, and b) to engage in sabotage
operations against luddite targets.

As a matter of fact, I do believe the claims of Palestinians have at
least some legitimacy. Only their use of terrorist tactics against
civilians delegitimizes their claims. Their 'first use' of such tactics
is where they are wrong, and you and I agree on such a standard. Nor do
I think that selective, targeted assasination is an unlegitimate tactic,
nor is it terrorism. Note that Israel has pursued a martial strategy of
specifically targeting militants in the ranks of the PA and its
terrorist organs, not against civilians in general. Those who engage in
terrorism make themselves legitimate targets of punitive termination.
This is *entirely* legal under the Laws of War.

When the opposition is using the martial force of government,
non-violence is guaranteed to fail under more circumstances than not.

I don't think it's the only option, or even the first or second option.
My questions are to ask what options are you willing to resort to *in
the end*, if *all else fails*.

Yet if it is publicly known by the luddites to what ends we are willing
to go, they may be deterred from engaging in confrontation and more
willing to engage in discussion and compromise.

a) a lack of agriculture based on genetic engineering will result in
worldwide famine by the middle of the 21st century.

b) a lack of genetic engineering in medicine will result in worldwide
epidemics in the same time frame.

c) a lack of martially superior technology in the hands of extropic
leaning nations will result in "Holy War" type pogroms against
technology advocates, producers, and users, resulting in wars of
genocide, primarily between the muslim world and the western
democracies.

d) a lack of martially superior technology in the hands of individual
transhumans will result in them becoming targeted by witch hunt type
inquisitions. Elimination of transhumans will result in the death of
humanity.

Add to this the permanent deaths caused by laws against cryonics,
cloning, and mind/computer interfacing/uploading, the lives prevented by
bans on cloning and designer offspring, as well as the added risk of
species destruction caused by restrictions on human migration into
space.

Every genocide of the 20th century was preceded by bans on gun ownership
by the groups that became victims of genocide. It isn't debatable.

I agree, and I don't think that is what I've said. It can be
convincingly shown that the luddites are already engaged in both overt
and subvert campaigns of force against transhumanist goals. As we sit
around debating whether it exists, not even what to do about it, they
continue to escalate the conflict.

Well, I'd like to throw down the gauntlet:
I am willing to dedicate my full time and attention to a peaceful,
non-violent political/PR campaign. As I've said before, I have extensive
experience in mass mail based fund raising campaigns, in advertising
design, and as you will probably agree, provocative political writing.
Based on a seed fund of $75,000 to $100,000, I could raise $1 million or
more for Pro-Act. I could build a grassroots political machine in the
engineering and computer science departments of universities around the
country and internationally, as well as in high tech businesses and
through freelance information workers.
I don't have the money to fund this effort, but I do have the time, and
there are other extropes who do as well. There are also
transhumanist-leaning people on this list and elsewhere who do have the
funds to pledge to this effort. If just the extropians list alone
averaged $300 per person, this campaign could be bootstrapped. It's time
for people to put their money where their mouths are.

To the list:
What can you contribute? Printer time? Envelope licking time? Fine.

The big ticket items are:
a) list rentals
 not just any lists. You've got to pick markets where the strongest
support is: engineers, scientists, computer people, libertarians,
political moderates who dislike religious conservatism and dogmatic
environmentalism. Find magazines that cater to these, especially high
income/networth individuals, and rent lists of their subscribers. Find
direct marketers that cater to these: The Edge, Sharper Image, Dell,
Gateway, etc and rent lists of their customers sorted on big customers.

b) printing costs
 I, as well as others here, have experience in the printing business and
know 'where the bodies are buried'.

c) mailing costs
 Need a non-profit mass mailing permit from the USPS, need to run any
final mail list through a postal pre-sort software application to
generate labels,

d) fulfillment processing
 This should be outsourced to fulfillment houses that do this
professionally. They can apply the labels to the promo materials, deal
with mailing, as well as provide call center services for people to
respond by phone, etc...

Now, heres another question to answer: if violence in our cause is so
abhorrently unacceptable to you and others on the left side of things,
why do you, and others on the left side of things, give such a broad
free pass to the 'violence as a first resort' tactics of the
Palestinians?

I joined the CoV list for about a week, and seeing all of that confused the 
hell out of me. Reading over it, I can see how it could be very useful in 
increading readability. On the other hand, it seems a waste of effort to 
have to completely manually reformat all email - if someone designed a mail 
program that did this automatically (or could be set to use the >>> system 
or the Hermit system) I'd be ecstatic.
Still, the initial confusion of how replies were handled on that list 
definitely contributed to my leaving (though not so much as the sheer 
volume of mail).

The Libertarian Futurist Society, which annually gives the Prometheus award
for best Libertarian Science Fiction will be hosting a room party Saturday
night.  Fred Moulton is organizing it, and I think he's arranged for at least
four of us to be there that evening.  (Fred and I are both on the Board of Directors.)

We'd be happy to have you and anyone else on this list come to our party.

If the extropian themes are at all libertarian, you should make sure we know
about it.  If it was published early last year, it may be too late for an
award for that one, but do let us know about your next (libertarian) efforts.

The formatting under discussion may be viewed at FAQ: Hermitish mail mark-up and citation V2.1 (http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs/index.php?board=31;action=display;threadid=11526)

As this reply appears to be relevant to Extropians as well, and is indirectly a response to a critical article posted on the ExI BBS (of which I am a member), it appears appropriate to post excerpts here too.

[David Lucifer] Message sent to Extropians mailing list: http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=61;action=display;threadid=51564

[Ashton 2] Humm, I\'d swap bizarrely wrong design with the more delightful \'wrong-headed\'.

[Hermit 3] I\'ll deal with this later. I would suggest that \"bizarrely wrong design\" might apply to people advocating embedding line wrapping into text, and thus confusing data and presentation. If so, it indubitably applies to \">\" indentation of mail which requires the embedding of hard line feeds and makes the material almost unusable after more than a few people have commented on it, even on computers supporting 80 column text. I\'m not even sure that \"wrong-headed\" applies at all, as the mark-up is a way which permits users to format their text in such a way as to make it more attractive to people viewing it through the BBS, comprehensible to those receiving it in mail and fully useable in a WAP environment. The alternative appears to be no formatting capability at all, the easy confusion of attribution in all but the simplest cases, a confused tangle of wrapped lines and the non-portability of the material. Perhaps the reason for considering this approach \"wrong headed\" is simply that none of this might be visible to somebody lacking appropriate experience or imagination. Perhaps you would like to expand on why you perceive this effort as \'wrong-headed\'?

[Ashton 2] \'a simplified mail-markup\'? It\'s certainly not simpler for the writers! Unless, of course, someone\'s scripted their mail agent blue in the face ...

[Hermit 3] Actually, I have to disagree. It takes me much less time (as a fairly prolific writer), to enter \"Hermitish mark-up\" manually, rather than trying to follow \">\" indentation. Certainly I (and many others) find it much easier to follow. The important point being that the use of any form of mark-up is purely optional, but the fact that it exists and is \"mail-safe\" as well as displaying effectively on the BBS allows those who wish to take the trouble to make their messages a lot more attractive, and allows somebody with slight experience to follow items formatted in this fashion in email or on the BBS. As the FAQ (http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs/index.php?board=31;action=display;threadid=11526) puts it, \"The use of this system is recommended but not mandated for postings on the CoV. Using it will make it more likely that others will read your submissions and will help to prevent the CoV from becoming a \"write only zone.\" The use of HTML in posting to the CoV is depreciated and should be avoided under any circumstances.\"

[Ashton 2] However, I guess that it keeps the cult factor high though sheer ugliness.

[Hermit 3] This loaded sentence contains a number of assertions which I would challenge. The use of \"sheer ugliness\" is a personal opinion, which you are certainly entitled to, although not, I think, generally shared. Certainly, the assertion of \"cult factor\" does not apply at all, unless the CoV is a cult. So let\'s see.

[hr]
First allow me introduce you to the Church of Virus.

 Virus is (http://virus.lucifer.com/about.html) ...
[*]a forum for rational discourse
[*] a memetically engineered atheistic religion
[*] a synthesis of religion and evolution
[*] the best possible conceptual framework for living and thinking
[*] a neo-cybernetic philosophy for the 21st century
[*] Darwin\'s dangerous idea out of control 
[*] an extended phenotype of the Virion Council
We have a clearly defined Purpose or Goal (http://virus.lucifer.com/about.html)
Virus was originally created to compete with the traditional (irrational) religions in the human ideosphere with the idea that it would introduce and propagate memes, which would ensure the survival and evolution of our species. The main advantage conferred upon adherents is Virus provides a conceptual framework for leading a truly meaningful life and attaining immortality without resorting to mystical delusions. And an equally clearly defined set of \"virtues,\" The 3 Virian Virtues: Reason, Empathy, Vision (http://virus.lucifer.com/virtues.html) and \"sins,\" The 3 Senseless Sins: Dogmatism, Apathy, Hypocrisy (http://virus.lucifer.com/sins.html) The Church of Virus is a collaborative project; and those who subscribe to our ideas are invited to consider joining us on the Virus BBS. From the above we can conclude that: A Virian is someone who uses rational cognition to recognize, create, host, and propagate successful and beneficial memes. (http://)

Before examining the question of whether we are a cult, a better understanding of one additional word might be useful. The word is \"Belief.\" 3 Belief: Belief can only occur where acceptance is not compelled, for if acceptance is compelled, then belief is not required to accept that thing. Belief is thus the acceptance of some thing as being provisionally true where:
[*] contradictory evidence exists which throws doubt upon or compels the rejection of the thing being accepted as truth.
[*] insufficient evidence exists to compel or suggest acceptance of the thing as truth.

As such belief is generally either dogmatic or hypocritical or both, and as such is rejected by the CoV as being senseless.
[hr]
Now, the question arises, is the CoV a Cult?

Borrowing the definition of a cult from the Skeptics Society (From Skeptic vol. 2, no. 2, 1993, pp. 74-81 available on-line at http://www.skeptic.com/ (Unfortunately not a site designed to encourage citation)), we find that they describe a cult as follows. A cult may be characterized by:

[*]Veneration of the Leader: Excessive glorification to the point of virtual sainthood or divinity. 
[*]Inerrancy of the Leader: Belief that he or she cannot be wrong. 
[*]Omniscience of the Leader: Acceptance of beliefs and pronouncements on virtually all subjects, from the philosophical to the trivial. 
[*]Persuasive Techniques: Methods used to recruit new followers and reinforce current beliefs. 
[*]Hidden Agendas: Potential recruits and the public are not given a full disclosure of the true nature of the group\'s beliefs and plans. 
[*]Deceit: Recruits and followers are not told everything about the leader and the group\'s inner circle, particularly flaws or potentially embarrassing events or circumstances. 
[*]Financial and/or Sexual Exploitation: Recruits and followers are persuaded to invest in the group, and the leader may develop sexual relations with one or more of the followers. 
[*]Absolute Truth: Belief that the leader and/or group has a method of discovering final knowledge on any number of subjects. 
[*]Absolute Morality: Belief that the leader and/or the group have developed a system of right and wrong thought and action applicable to members and nonmembers alike. Those who strictly follow the moral code may become and remain members, those who do not are dismissed or punished.

Now, knowing what a cult is, let us compare this to the Church of Virus. Before doing so, it is worth reminding ourselves that our \"articles of affiliation\" are simply that anyone working with us towards our goals, eschewing the \"senseless sins\" and aspiring to exemplify the \"virian virtues,\" is welcome to be a member of the Church of Virus. So, with a shared basis of understanding, let us examine the CoV against the hallmarks of a cult.

<Response snipped here to reduce volume. Essentially each of these cultish attributes is contrasted to the principles and practices of the CoV and rejected.>

[hr]
[Hermit 3] So are we a cult? Not by a \"skeptical standard.\" Would you like to offer us an alternative definition which supports your blundering assertion, or was it simply an attempted insult - in which case it has already received more attention than it deserved.

[Hermit 3] In conclusion, let me suggest that what I don\'t get is why people join an existing group, where the invitation to join is \"Virus is a collaborative project; if you subscribe to the ideas consider joining us on the Virus BBS\", only to criticize what has achieved, without having introduced themselves, let alone made a contribution, and without offering a viable alternative. So, Ashton, if you consider what we are using to be \"wrong headed\", please take the time to propose your \"right headed\" alternative which permits the same capabilities of portable ASCII email and useable BBS mark-up (in the same mail). After all, the Church of Virus is a \"collaborative\" community and we wish to provide the best possible support for our members whether the attend via the web (http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs) or via the maillist (subscribe virus  at [email]majordomo@lucifer.com]) and irrespective of whether they use a PC, a hand held or a voice synthesizer (as a number of our members do).

Good suggestions and valid criticism are always welcome. Unwarranted sneering and invalid objections are not.

Regards

Hermit

I was confused about ConJose (the WorldCon occurring in San Jose this fall)
versus BayCon (a local con occurring in San Jose at the end of May).  The
above does not apply to ConJose.  My apologies.  I should also have read ahead
far enough to see that Fred had already replied.

If they are conspiring they either are or are not serious.  Your

If you did this you would be in great danger of a larger nuclear 
exchange.  By this logic both the US and Russia should have 
advocated first strike.

What do you mean by "for no reason".  Not many are simply 
psychotic enough to lob a nuke for literally no reason.  Many 
might consider it for what they believe are good reasons.  You 
might not agree with these reasons.

Without a declaration of war it is not ok to do preemptive 
strikes on other sovereign countries.

I often lean strongly toward non-violence myself but when I

serious caveats and matters of right and legality listed.

It is always retarded "to some degree".  Does that means we 
should consider killing those we perceive as in our way?

Technological progress is one thing.  We are already getting a 
lot of technological progress.  Progress sufficient for a 
Singularity is something else again.  Do you take the position 
that Club of Rome predictions are true if we don't get to a 
Singularity as quickly as possible?  We already have more than 
sufficient technology for me to think it unlikely that Club of 
Rome scenarious are a likely worldwide catastrophe for some time.

Why on earth would you predict it is as soon as 3 years that the 
"drop dead" decision occurs?  I don't get your logic.  Which 
"luddites"?  Many simply say, "Hey, wait a minute.  Can we think 
about this more?"  Only a handful actually wish to turn back 
technology which I agree would likely be deadly.  It is not at 
all clear to me that the current battles over human cloning 
(including all variants) and genetic engineered plants spell the 
doom of us all so certainly that we need to consider termination 
of the arguments with extreme prejudice.

What will give a major hiatus is if we don't stop some of our 
war-like ways throwing us into unending conflict and 
considerable loss of the freedom essential to scientific 
innovation and technological advance.  On that one you and I 
appear often to be on opposite sides of the ideological fence. 
With considerable respect, you quite often think like a soldier. 
  That is not good when armed conflict is not what is needed and 
may actually be diametrically opposed to what is needed.

One of the dangers of governments is that the machinery of the 
State may be commanded by those opposed to our objectives.  But 
this if far from an instance of "committing violence" in any 
rational political philosophy.  Yes the State is in many ways 
unjust and has usurped far too much power.  But it is a 
dangerous path to claim that passing laws is violence on our 
person and that we should respond or are perfectly justified in 
responding violently.  Do you actually mean to say this?

It is of course ok to use democratic means to fight 
democratically sanctioned injustice.  I don't see how Harvey or

Means cannot delegitimize a legitimate complaint, ever.  By your 
logic all claims of the Israelis are also illegitimate by now. 
Do you agree with that?  And all claims of the US to be 
impartial workers for peace in the area are illegitimate since 
the Israelis are bearing American arms that we, including you 
and I, subsidize to the tune of 3.6 billion dollars a year.

What do you call them flying Apaches and Blackhawks around 
civilian camps for days on end and firing endless machine gun 
rounds and missles at the village at large?  I certainly don't 
call it lawful military action.  It is not legal under any "laws 
of war" that are worth the paper they are written on.

Actually, we aren't at that point yet.  And, if you read your

Or the government may track us and bug the hell out of us a lot 
more thoroughly than they would otherwise because there is some 
noise about us taking up arms to ensure we get to Singularity. 
That puts us squarely on the possible terrorist list.  If we get 
a bit more on such lists then it is far more easy to discredit 
extropianism and transhumanism than it would be otherwise.  Do 
you think the possible "deterrence" is greater than or justifies 
the risks of the other possible consequences?

I need to see more argument here.  The current crops are

More than a few engineered crops are already in large scale

There is no way you can say "will result" with that much

News Flash.  There is no such thing at this time as an "extropic 
leaning nation".  Technology advocates are not seen as the 
enemy.  Greedy, heartless organizations that are raping many 
countries of everything are seen as the enemy of said countries 
and peoples.  I don't consider such greed and short-sightedness 
to be in the least "extropic".  There is a large need to 
distinquish a bit finer than whether a group or people believe 
in high tech or not.  Belief in high technology does not 
automatically make anyone or any group trustworthy.  I do not 
believe for a second that Muslim vs. Western Democracy is the 
likely big conflict.

There are no real "luddite" restrictions on space migration and 
for reasons that have been well presented here it is probably 
not a very viable option for the time being anyway.  There is no 
law particularly against mind/comptuer interfacing.  Uploading 
is barely a gleam in some of our eyes so there is no serious 
opposition to it yet.  There are not so much laws against 
cryonics AFAIK (in the US anyway) as there are laws that 
sometimes make it difficult to do well because the issues are 
not taken that seriously yet and pre-cyronics laws are still in 
the way.  Cloning has potential to save lives in many of its 
forms and the battle is still on to get it past the evil memetic 
imagery  playing in many minds.  This whole set of things is not 
exactly an organized attempt to end all our dreams and again, 
does not justify taking up arms as far as I can see.

You have not shown this unless you count the force of law.  But 
that kind of force doesn't count for your current argument 
unless you wish to preach full revolution.

So what are you saying we should do about it?  Use force?  If 
so, in what ways would you recommend?

Please, drop the silly and unfruitful designations such as 
"left" and "right".  Both we and our world are a great deal more 
complex than that.

I don't give a "broad free pass" to any such thing and neither 
does anyone else of different opinion than you on the subject. 
But I very much do understand why some of them would believe the 
situation is desperate enought that they would resort to such 
means.  I understand that a lot better than I understand why the 
Israelis would blast the hell out of a civilian camp using many 
times over superior force for days on end and bulldoze the 
rubble and many of the bodies of the dead civilians.  I don't 
understand why some of us apparently consider such atrocities to 
be simply "just desserts". I don't understand is why some can 
justify the actions of the Israelis almost totally but think 
there is absolutely no justification for the rage and violence 
of the Palestinians at all.

I find WAP woeful. A chacun a son gout. 

Confession: I put hard line breaks in because one person asked me to (on the
ExI list). I might change back; I do think it's a bit silly.

I agree that better reading/writing tools are needed. I wish CoV the best of
luck (or whatever the appropriate expression is in CoV-speak) with their
approach. 2002 and we still don't have wide acceptance of typed
(n>1)-directional links, nor decent filters. *Sigh* Sometimes I wonder if
search engines have provided a kind of lock-in disincentive for filters. I
know the Web has done that for typed n-way links. "It'll do anything you
want.... Why would you want to do _thaaaat_?"

As for cults, I'm fond of L. Sprague de Camp's working definition that a
religion is anything you're born into, and a cult is anything you convert to.

For the benefit of the list (not BBS, that's something different, see
subject line) subscribers I've reformatted Hermit's reply properly by
wrapping overlong lines, and using legacy citation methods and removing
the CoV plug, since irrelevant to the discussion.

Here Hermit admits implicitly that the email format with full markup is
inferior if not rendered into HTML and viewed via a browser. No
explanation is given why using a browser is preferrable to user's current
method of choice (MUA) to view what is a pure text message.

For the first time twitter is introduced. The first time reader scratches
her head, before reading on, the more seasoned reader recognizes a
reinvention of a wheel (Supercite):

	http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/emacs/v19_34/sc_toc.html

albeit in a polygonal shape. Yes, it is really hard to improve on a mature
medium.

> [David Lucifer] Message sent to Extropians mailing list:

Here you see the polygonal-wheel aspect of the citation method: it doesn't
use abbreviations for the author cite, thus wasting line width, a scarce
resource in this medium.

Here we see more twitter. The idiotic gateway from the SuperDuperMarkUp
feels it's necessary to mask apostrophes in plain text rendition of the
markup. There is absolutely no reason to do this either than author's
fiat.  Here he continues demonstrating his fundamental lack of
understanding of legacy medium plain text, or blatant disregard for user's
wishes. It would have been trivial to reverse the masking, and even to
convert his citation style into legacy (I frankly admit the reverse is
less trivial, but that's not the point discussed).

The assertion is that his method is superior. There is no proof given but
reference to nebulous mention of "confusing data and presentation". I
recommend Hermit to read up on basic typography, which is the art and
technology to render readable documents. He might have failed to notice
that markup, which was designed to be orthogonal to orthography has wound
up to have had to reinvent typography, poorely (I've predicted that, of 
course).

It's obvious why: people's visual systems are rather hardwired, and 
legibility is measurable in objective benchmarks. Because people are not 
computers there's most assuredly a strong coupling between data and 
presentation.

Here is another assertion without proof. I think the "even on 80 chars
column text" can be considered a rather modest requirement at this day and
age. As compared to a browser on a bitmapped display. Especially a
bitmapped display of >2 kPixels horizontal, which Hermit is using. I also
happen to use a dual-head display with >2 kPixels, but I don't assume
anybody else does. This email could be read via a voice synthesizer
(twitter characters highly fatal here, or anything which makes textflow
nonlinear for that matter), on a braille line, or some other degraded
medium. (Btw, any blind or othewise disabled extropians here? I'm asking
for your input in this debate. Do you have specific requirements for the
formatting of list messages?)

The claim made is that an email users wants to jump through hoops to make
this text more readable to web users than those via hypermail'd list
archives.

Here's a counterclaim: the medium of pigment-stained dead tree has
produced great content and still continues doing so. Content created is of
a quality making our drivel here utterly insignificant. Here's empiric
proof that great minds are not bottlenecked by legacy media. Especially,
spiced up legacy media as plain text email with obvious citation rules and
hyperlinks.

Hermit's markup is there for a purpose: it claims to facilitate
communcation, drawing great minds which then produce content. I would like
to see some of that fabulous content those great minds have produced which
eclipses content produced e.g. in this meek legacy medium of extropians@
mailing list -- by an order of magnitude. I somehow kept missing those in

	http://forum.javien.com/messages.php?topicdata=virus&new=true

Thank you.

One would think that people who care about attribution can keep track of
what was said when by whom, even without installing Supercite. Guess what,
they do. It's the people who disregard form who don't. Which is fine with
me, because such people rarely have anything worthwhile to say. If you 
care about content, you care about form. Sounds kinda obvious, right?

You're asking me for experience with your medium, without demostrating

Exactly. Without widespread authoring tools you're back to manual

Hermit, this is compleat horse puckey (thanks, Robert). Typical
discussions never go over 5 citation nesting, which is trivial to follow
(even without Supercite -- notice that no one bothers with superior
citation practices because there's _zero demand_ for it).

If it's purely optional, the please remove the twitter, wrap your lines,

I much prefer to follow forums which don't require me to jump through
hoops. You might observe that readiness to follow braindead formatting
rules in a forum yet sans prestige is negatively correlated with the
ability to contribute content. In other words, you're deliberately
crippling your forum by adherence to idiotic formatting fiat.

I agree that most standards are braindead, and wherever I sense the making
of a new standard I usually tend to beg and plead all the parties involved
so that they think really really hard about the specs, how they might
break in future, taking input from as many as diverse sources as possible.  
(They never do).

However, arguing about the brokenness of standards is moot. They are that,
the user base is locked forever, so we have to lie back, and think of
England. For time being, until something much better comes along and the
lemming base decides to move in a land slide fashion (stand aside lest you

text entry is easier on new users, since presenting a familiar UI. It even 
comes with a screwdriver, and an eyepatch.

A draft of the paper "Levels of Organization in General Intelligence" by
Eliezer Yudkowsky, to appear as a chapter in "Real AI: New Approaches to
Artificial General Intelligence" (Goertzel and Pennachin, eds.,
forthcoming), is now available online.

Abstract:

LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION IN GENERAL INTELLIGENCE 

Part I discusses the conceptual foundations of general intelligence as a
discipline, orienting it within the Integrated Causal Model of Tooby and
Cosmides.  Part II constitutes the bulk of the paper and discusses the
functional decomposition of general intelligence into a complex supersystem
of interdependent internally specialized processes, and structures the
description using five successive levels of functional organization:  Code,
sensory modalities, concepts, thoughts, and deliberation.  Part III
discusses probable differences between humans and AIs and points out several
fundamental advantages that minds-in-general potentially possess relative to
current evolved intelligences, especially with respect to recursive
self-improvement.

You're confusing a RFID tag with a GPS implant. Latter is completely 
mythical with current and near future technology, for physical reasons.

In-cell localizers using cell number, and signal strength and signal time
of flight to triangulate your cellphone within the cell make that
completely unnecessary (this is information now available for law
enforcement in most countries, and recently became a subscriber option).

RFID implants is old hat, multiple warwickisms and much hot air from
Digital Angel nonwithstanding. Millions of pets and livestock have them.
The only new thing is the FDA approval for people (a big deal for a few
people apparently).

Big minus is unavailability of compact and cheap readers (in handguns,
door frames, vehicles, cellphones, and similiar devices in your property)
non-cryptographic authentication (tag ID is radiated in clear instead of
using a PKI random token challenge mechanism) plus inability to destroy
and/or lock and/or erase the RFID tag with mechanic pressure or a tap
code. As long as it can be used for involuntary identification, I count it
in with the biblical mark of the beast (666 0wn0rZ y0). As if recent
homeland biometrics craze wasn't bad enough...

I hope no one is confusing "GVS Registry Service" with the Global 
Positioning System...

At present, embedded chips will not even be able to acquire GPS signals in 
the open, due to limited antenna size and skin attenuation. As far as 
"satellite tracking" goes, the best that can be expected is for a 
successful GPS equipped chip to download it's recent record of movement to 
the next reader that interrogates it. It takes a LARGE amount of RF power 
to send a signal to a satellite - way more than an embedded chip will have 
available.

Anyone who knows where in the body the chip is can defeat the GPS and 
reporting functions with an aluminum foil band-aid. Of course, if readers 
become ubiquitous, the simple fact that a person does not handshake with 
the reader could raise an alarm. If the person simply removed the shielding 
before passing a reader, the worst that could be inferred would be being 
out of touch with the GPS system because of location or atmospheric conditions.

I am not too worried about real-time tracking until someone gets a 
landbased system of scanners in place that can relay GPS signals inot the 
chips at close range. Say, one relay station every meter over the entire 
planet surface.

Much ado about nothing at this stage of the game, I think - but I sure will 
NOT allow myself to be chipped without MY express request.

Ph33r the h0m3l4nd'2 L337n3$Z. (sic)

Given current events re: Oracle, Microsoft (Passportkraft? Nein Danke!), the
number of financial institutions that think the last four digits of "my
social" (sic) is some sort of secure PIN, the number of _other_ financial
institutions that use my entire Social Security Number as my account ID...

It could be (slightly) worse, along the lines of the "In heaven/hell the cooks
are... the cars are... [etc]."

But only slightly.

I'm getting pretty _sic_...

The direct approach of "being good" doesn't work.  it does not work for 
me, and I don't think it works for anyone.  The human mind tends to 
judge itself good.  Our ideas are always good.  Our suppositions are 
always correct.  Our causes are always just.  Our actions are always 
defensible.  We must learn to fairly allow that our "obvious" idea might 
be wrong.

Therefore, my experience is unique to me, but I can't call other people 
liars if the have differing experiences.  My data is just my unique 
collection of information.  Other people will present different data 
which may not lead to the same conclusions as mine.  As soon as we avoid 
the ego embarrassment of being wrong, and freely admit that we are all 
travellers along the same road, we learn to value other people's 
observations.  They provide additional data, not less.  They should add 
to our knowledge, not counter it.

Like the archetypal yin-yang symbol, there is a little flaw in every 
theory, and there is a little truth in every fallacy.  We can nit-pick 
the best answers by pointing out their flaws, and we and support the 
most irrational theories by pointing out key truths within them.  We 
must realize that there is no complete winner and loser in an argument, 
that each side makes many little points, some which are good and some 
which are not.  Most of our big questions here are unanswerable.  We try 
to evaluate things with too broad of a brush to be accurate.  We try to 
"prove" which course of action is best, when there are so many unknown 
variables that there is no single answer.

This doesn't mean that we should be wishy-washy or unwilling to make a 
stand.  But it does mean that the stand is based on our current 
knowledge.  We think we are right, but we may be wrong.  We can't 
suppress wrong voices because that would merely prevent further 
consideration of them.  We must act in an evenhanded manner toward all 
viewpoints, even those we don't support, so that the truth has a chance 
to emerge.  If we ever promote one side and suppress the other because 
of a belief it is right, we are simply locking ourselves into a position 
and suppressing any data that might prove us wrong.  This is not 
conducive to truth, but to dogma.

Therefore, even when we are "sure" we are right, we must allow others to 
speak.  We must seriously consider their positions.  We must calmly 
accept criticism of our position.  We must seek objective ways to prove 
our points beyond merely our own acceptance.  We must also keep 
challenging our own positions, and be open to change if we find 
ourselves to be wrong.  We must keep a free dialog of challenging ideas 
open, and never try to squelch dissent simply in pursuit of uniformity.  
We must seek truth wherever it may lead, rather than "our" goals whether 
they are right or wrong.

Dear friends,

This Sunday, April 28th, I will be in Los Vegas speaking at the Longevity 
Bootcamp Conference http://maxlife.org/.  If you are not attending the 
conference, please feel free to take the lead and be at the Getty salon in 
my absence, or, if you prefer, wait until next month's salon.

By the way, we will also be meeting in the evenings since so many people 
enjoy the atmosphere and conversation. I'll keep you posted.

My warmest thoughts to you all -

Natasha

______________________________________________________________

The Getty salon is from 9:30 - 12:00 on the last Sunday of the month, for 
coffee, tea and mind-bending conversation -- from world politics to the 
future of arts and culture -- in a beautifully aesthetic environment. If 
you would like to walk though the gardens, this is also vitalizing.

If you haven't been to the Getty, the Garden is welcoming and the views 
awesome.  If you have been to the Getty, come again.

Parking is $5.00 and the doors formally open at 10:00.  We will be meeting 
at 9:30 at the tram.

Yes.  You would be pre-empting actions of violence that are already 
underway.  These are not as strong cases as defending after an attack, 
but are stronger than defending against unintentional harm.  However, I 
believe the Luddites present even a weaker case than this.

Luddites do not intend any violence toward anyone.  Their plan is to 
save lives that might be lost due to dangerous technology.  How can we 
kill them for such a lofty goal?  Some lives undoubtedly will be lost in 
accidents or side-effects.  This means that we are contemplating 
assassinating people who don't plan violence.  Furthermore, it involved 
killing people who are trying to save lives because their methods are 
less efficient than ours!

This may be true, but it is not certain.  These kinds of statistical 
predictions are tenuous, as are population explosion theories, pollution 
theories, and global warming theories.  These theorists also probably 
felt that they world was doomed if no one followed their 
recommendations.  I am glad that they didn't resort to violence to 
enforce their beliefs.

I think you overestimate the advancement of technology.  Is nanotech 
almost ready?  Is a universal cancer drug passing clinical trials right 
now?  Has cryotechnology brought back a frozen rat?  Has an AI announced 
its presence?  These things will take years to start saving millions of 
lives after they arrive, and their arrival is not as eminent as you 
predict.  What specific scenario do you see killing off the population 
any time soon?

So you consider bad legislation as an attack justifying deadly force in 
retaliation?  Why attack the Luddite lobbyists?  Why not go directly 
after congress?  Or why not ignore them and go directly after any police 
that try to enforce the ban?

Rather than killing people, I would propose countering the legislation.  
If that fails, we can move to another country.  If all countries follow 
suit, we can move offshore or form our own country.  If that fails, we 
can work covertly.  There is no way to kill everybody with an opposing 
idea.  If we start killing off elected officials for bad policy, we will 
have to flee underground anyway.  I rather hide scientific research 
rather than be targeted as an assassin terrorist group.

(By the way, my definition of terrorism is when you aren't attacking the

your actions will scare other people into inaction.)

My criteria would only apply force to the specific eco-terrorists and 
Luddites committing violence.  We can't kill off all people who have 
similar beliefs but were not involved in the violence.

Some Palestinians are terrorists.  They should be fought with violence 
if necessary.  We should not support violence against all Palestinians 
because they are in the same race or neighborhood as the terrorists.

This is a trick question that can never be anwered.  Your trigger of 
"all else fails" will never occur.  Only if all nonviolent means fail 
and only violence can succeed will we get to this point.  Your question 
is a self-fulfilling prophesy and a circular loop of logic.  It makes an 
assumption, uses it as the basis of the question, such that the only 
answer possible is the one it assumes.  You might as well ask if I have 
quit beating my wife yet.  Just as the answer to that question is that I 
have never beat my wife, the answer to your question is we will reach 
the point when all else fails.

Note that I am not defending terrorists or direct violence.  Violence 
can be used in direct self-defense.  However, when the situation gets so 
contrived that there is no clear direct attempt at violence, I don't 
think it can be so clear that there is no other option.  Misguided 
notions can be corrected.  Public opinion can be changed.  Governments 
can be lobbied.  I cannot conceive a situation where the whole world 
turns against us, there is no country left for retreat, and there is no 
chance for further dialog.

This is getting extremely close to my definition of terrorism.  You hope 
to scare people into suppressing their own opinions and into supporting 
your opinions under threat of violence if they oppose you.  That sounds 
like terrorism to me.  Your reasoning that this is a last resort when no 
other options are available is the exact line of reasoning that all 
terrorists use.  Even if you claim this isn't terrorism, can you 
conceive that all the civilized countries that outlawed us would 
perceive this as terrorism.  Do you really think we can fight all the 
militaries in the world, and still save more lives than would be lost?

This gets even worse as we go down this slippery slope.  You aren't 100%

something that might not happen?

So do you think this justifies assassinating anyone?  If so, who?  The 
Liberals who supported this idea?  The Lobbyists who caused it?  The 
Congress who passed it?  The President for enforcing it?  This is a 
perfect example of your theory.  If gun control laws caused 100 million 
deaths, are you claiming that you are now justified to assassinate 
someone?  This is not a theoretical example, because you claim it has 
already happened.  Anything preventing you from responding with violence 
to this current example should also apply to your future examples.  
Otherwise, you are coming close to condoning assassinations right now 
for events that have already happened.

Firstly, I thought you discounted theories of population explosions and 
doom predictions.  The population is slowing.  Agriculture is getting 
better.  Medicine is getting better.  It is hard to justify violence 
against things that are getting better just because they aren't getting 
better fast enough.

Secondly, we can't condone violence against inaction.  Your "violence" 
is really inaction and failing to save lives.  Can we actually kill 
people because technology isn't implemented?

Thirdly, these technologies are already being investigated to some 
extent, and aren't ready for saving the planet yet.  You are suggesting 
violence to save technologies that don't exist yet, or might not pan 
out.  We hope that all your predictions of great salvation are true, but 
we can't be sure of the specific breakthroughs.  What if we use violence 
and then later find out that the breakthroughs take 20 years longer than 
expected?  What if something else comes along and saves the planet, and 
our actions were premature?

You are predicting non-specific deaths by non-specific people.  You 
can't kill people for having a dangerous idea just because somebody 
somewhere might cause harm with that idea.  You can't kill everybody 
with that idea, because this would be mass extermination.  Without a 
specific person to target to prevent a specific act, your "enemy" is too 
vague and widespread to target.  Who exactly would be targeted if we did 
move against the Luddites?

None of these technologies are ready yet.  It is not clear when if ever 
they could start saving lives.  I think we have to wait at least until a 
technology works and could save lives before we take lives to defend 
it.  Right now, the legislation and politics is still at the discussion 
stage.  It is too early for violence.  I don't know of any major 
research that has been halted or destroyed because of these actions.

Very tenuous theory.  There is no clear way to tell how many lives were 
saved versus how many were lost due to various political theories.  This 
is not a clear and present danger, but a vague political clash of 
ideas.  I don't think we should take definitive violent actions against 
people for their ideas.

We should fight their campaigns with our campaigns.  We should counter 
their goals with our goals.  We should escalate our side when they 
escalate their side.  We should not jump straight to violence against 
people who have not committed violence (yet).

This is a wonderful offer, but unfortunately ExI does not have a seed 
fund of $75,000 to $100,000.  Unfortunately, money is the real limiting 
factor here, not time.

I don't, nor do I know any Liberals who do.  Palestinian suicide bombers 
are evil.  Palestinian civilians are good.  Israeli soldiers shooting at 
terrorists are good.  Israeli soldiers shooting at unarmed civilians or 
reporters are evil.  The fact that Arafat directed terrorists in the 
past is probably true.  The claim that no terrorist ever strikes without 
Arafat's direction is probably false.  The insistence that Arafat 
condemn terrorism is helpful.  The rejection of his condemnation as 
being too little too late is not helpful.  There is good and bad on both 
sides.  Both sides want peace.  Both sides have legitimate grievances 
against the other.  Both sides have committed unjustified violence 
against the other.  Neither seems willing to end it now.

Luddites who lobby for laws outlawing cryonic suspension, assisted
suicide, nanomedicine, and cloning technologies are using the monopoly
force of government to permanently kill people. The French authorities,
for instance, who are attempting to have that French couple thawed, are
guilty of attempted murder, and intend to use the force of government to
do violence to that suspended couple and anyone who gets in their way.

I fail to see how preventing my eventual revival through laws against
development of revival technologies, coupled with legal actions intended
to bankrupt cryonics organizations holding people in suspension, is any
less a homicide than just shooting me.

Passing laws against the use of genetically engineered supercrops which
are needed to fight malnutrition as well as immunization, against the
genetic engineering and cloning of organs for medical therapy, against
the , and against the use of fuels needed for space migration are all
assaults on our lives. Death by pen is no different than death by bullet
(as the saying goes, the pen is the mightier weapon).

The die-off won't occur till mid to late 21st century, but the
conditions that determine whether or not it occurs then will be
determined this decade (study up on your exponential mathematics), as
reductions in innovation cascades brought about by legislation pushes
outward the potential singularity phase, while the repression required
to achieve this will result in a pervasive spread of ignorance (which
generally causes population increases).

Yes, though thats still a rather loose definition. Terrorism is to
attack unarmed civilians who are not engaged in action against you, do
not provide sanctuary or support to those engaged in action against you.
This is its definition under the laws of war. Note that this leaves open
a rather wide segment of the civilians who are legitimate targets of
force: those who engage in violence against you, or provide sanctuary or
support to those who do.

The problem with this is that the public acceptance of terrorist tactics
in the Palestinian population is generally or nearly unanimous. They've
been conditioned by the PA propaganda machine to beleive that terrorism
is their only option and that military action against terrorists is
itself terrorism, which it isn't.

This isn't a court of law, this is cultural warfare. Beyond reasonable
doubt is not required here. Self defense lives on preponderance of
evidence. You never know for 100% sure if the guy with a gun pointed at
you is actually going to shoot. Experience says its more likely than
not, and you defend yourself.

It is my belief that there are past and present members of congress (and
past presidents) who have committed treason by violating their oaths of
office to defend the Constitution (the ENTIRE Constitution) against all
foreign and domestic enemies, but also acting against the Constitution
themselves, and thus becoming enemies of the Constitution. Treason IS a
capital offense. There are supposed to be legal remedies for these
violations, but the government judicial system has been derelict in its
duty to prosecute such crimes due to subversion by party politics. That
private citizens have not yet sought to remedy this failing themselves
is only testament to how slowly the enemy is pursuing its campaign of
gun control, using the lobster cooking technique of a slow boil.

The population is slowing in countries where education, especially
education of women, is occuring. The education of women is not occuring
fast enough in the muslim world, where the education system teaches
ignorance and superstition, paranoia and propaganda.

In Africa, however, we are already seeing the effects of Malthusian
feedback. While AIDS has decimated, and continues to decimate the
educated class, population continues to explode. Other epidemic diseases
are appearing with increasing frequency and resistance to anti-biotics
and immunization.

Jeremy Rifkin and his ilk are not succeeding by being inactive. They are
actively preventing constructive action.

Because innovation accelerates  with cascade effects. As ideas increase,
they spawn an acceleration in the the increase. This is the nature of
singularities. Whether one idea doesnt quite pan out is irrelevant. It
will spawn ten more, which will spawn 100 more, then 1000, etc. such
that one idea prevented by law from being investigated for a decade
results in the loss of 1000-100,000 new ideas in that decade. This is
the guts of how technological singularities are created.

All of the technologies that will be key to our predictions of the
singularity between 2020-2030 are slated for regulation and restriction
on the two-year election cycle plans of luddite groups. Perpetuation of
ignorance by statute also perpetuates higher population growth rates.
This pushes technological singularities outward and malthusian
thresholds forward.

> 
> You are predicting non-specific deaths by non-specific people. 

When dealing with such large numbers it is hard to be specific in the
span of one email message. As the saying goes, one death is a tragedy, a
million is a statistic. Its hard to be specific when we are just
discussing in general terms. Give me ten grand and four months and I'll
write a white paper on it.

> You

Talk about not being specific. I would like to be very specific. If
extensive research and intelligence gathering identifies individuals x,
y, and z as instrumental to the luddite cause, I would focus my efforts
first to educating them, buying them off, warning them off, then to
ruining them politically, economically, and personally.

For example, Jeremy Rifkin, Jerry Mander, and a handful of others have
been instrumental in the funding and organizing of the luddite cause.
Developing some sort of tactics to divert them from the trajectories
they are on (preferably non-violent) would help our cause immeasurably.

Take the ongoing media bias against cryonics. This doesn't come from
nowhere.

The EU has a ban on cloning, and the US has a ban on stem cell research.

Yes, it is the limiting factor, and is why I'm throwing down the
gauntlet. ExI membership can't entirely be broke unemployed dot com
workers. There are members who have resources in money, equipment,
office space, bandwidth, etc that they can contribute to the cause.

I designed this suborbital ballistic business jet in X-Plane's Plane
Maker, and recommend it for those nascent rocketmen (and women) on the
list to enjoy. Requires X-Plane, v 5.52 or higher, to fly
(http://www.xplane.com). Take off from Edwards AFB or Mojave Airport on
full afterburner. Fly it to 70,000 feet and mach 3.7 before hitting the
JATO engine. Climb at 10-20 degree angles on the rocket into trajectory
at speeds of up to mach 23.7 to altitudes of 200 miles+. Comes with
autopilot and GPS, so you can set the GPS to the desired destination
airfield and lock the autopilot on it for your heading, then see how
well you set your trajectory to reach your target.

I've flown it from Majoave to Rekjavik successfully in under a half
hour.

What do you mean by "their chosen style of communication"?  Do 
you think all of them chose it or even the majority agree or do 
they simply put up with it?

I am disappointed to see remarks about markup languages, many 
which I also think are a bit silly, taken personally as an 
attack on a community.  Whatever is the point of that?

By these rules the Palestinian terrorist aren't really terrorist 
as they are attacking those who do provide sanctuary and support 
for those engaged in action against them.  No?

How can you apply the "laws of war" when no war is declared?

The public opinion in Israel in favor of shooting innocent 
Palestinian civilians is also quite high.  They have been 
conditioned by Israeli and Zionist propaganda to believe that 
Palestinians are sub-human and the only solution is to drive 
them out or kill them.  Military action against civilians is 
terrorism by your own definitions.

The world WILL outlaws us if we take up arms against those who 
think or decide questions of various technologies differently. 
Since I accept that such is so I consider persuasion and various 
  kinds of memetics much more helpful than talk of violently 
opposing those who disagree.

Can you come up with any other analogies to cultural dynamics 
than warfare?  Beyond reasonable doubt is very much required 
before you deprive or advocate depriving another of the very 
life you so prize and wish to extend indefinitely!

People voting against technology or freedom to use it are not 
out to shoot you as the man with the gun pointed at you likely 
is.  So the same type of response is not justified.

Treason is a capital offense.  It has quite stringent

The Muslim world is not particularly none for the worst increase 
in population but I agree that parts of the Muslim world (not 
all Muslim societies by any means) seriously limit the education 
of women.

Aids in Africa is decimating universally, not just or primarily 
in the educated class.  Some of the responsibility lies with the 
greed of companies and countries that did not allow cheaper 
(FREE TRADE) sources of needed drugs to be used but insisted 
they buy them at reduced but still high rates using ruinous 
loans at high interest.  Someday we in the "developed" nations 
need to decide if we really believe in freedom and abundance 
more than we believe in making a ton of money at any and all 
cost in other values including millions of human lives.

Rather not tbe point.  When you advocate violence (possibly) 
against the "luddites" you are advocating force against a 
generality that can only be implemented against specific people 
that you consider members of that group.  See the problem?

OK.  This is reasonable and necessary.  Apply violence is not 
allowed unless you wish to be outside the law and have the

A large part comes from ignorance, general avoidance of talking 
much about anything to do with our current mortality, the 
general veneer of snarling cynicism in the culture, and playing 
copy-cat of what they think will sell their rags.

The second at least is in the way of research most of us 
support.  True human cloning is something that I would be quite 
happy to put off for a while.  I don't think the techniques are 
good enough and I have my own misgivings about some of the 
possible applications.

So when Eugen said "I'm so lost. Can you help me by pointing out killer
content in there? Thank you.", you think that was a comment on the markup
language? I read it as a mean-spirited sarcasm.

I just received word that arrangements being for a LFS room party at
ConJose.  So the current plan is to hopefully have a LFS room party at
both Baycon and ConJose.  You do not need to be a LFS member to stop
in.  As details are known Chris or I or someone else from LFS will post
info.  If you are interesting in joining LFS and/or helping with the
room party please let me know.

You can find more info about LFS at www.lfs.org and about Baycon May
24-27  http://www.baycon.org/2002/ and about ConJose Aug 29 - Sept 2,
2002 at http://www.conjose.org/.

To avoid flooding your mailboxes, with a mark-up style which obviously has some Extropians seething in what appears to me to be an irrational fury, I have not posted the full response to "eugen@leitl.org" here. What I have done is post it on the Virian BBS as Re: virus: Eugene Leitl disses Hermitish markup Reply #6 2002-04-21 at 09:53:38. It can be accessed at the following URL. http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs/index.php?board=51&action=display&threadid=25392&start=0. I have attempted to avoid his ad hominem, have avoided any hint of "Hermitish mark-up" and have simply posted excerpts which relate to his (and other Extropians) obvious difficulties with the Church of Virus.

What "eugen@leitl.org" omitted to mention was that this saga originated when he signed onto the Church of Virus and, in an unrelated thread, barged in with complaints about our posting methods as his first post to our mail-list (Refer "Re:virus: politics test/mix, Reply #5 on: 2002-04-16 21:52:03" at http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs/index.php?board=51;action=display;threadid=25358, without mentioning that he was a part of the Extropians. When he received a polite response, (Refer reply 9 op cit.) he became rude and attempted insult (reply 10 op cit.). When this was returned (reply 11 op cit.), he departed (and will not be missed). However, this was followed up by his snide commentary here (where he presumably imagined that he could get away with it without reply). In addition others Extropians have responded on the CoV and here. Some of these responses have apparently consisted of little more than attemps to take snipe side swipes at the Church of Virus.

When an organization is by implication referred to as a "cult," a label that undoubtedly carries negative connotations, then it behooves its members, to respond to the slur as and when they become aware of it. As I have put more than a little effort into the CoV, when I discovered that certain Extropians had decided to attack the CoV, I decided to respond appropriately. Asserting that the response designed to address the slurs made in this forum, is a "plug" and "irrelevant," says more to "eugen@leitl.org"'s apparently undeserved arrogance, and the degree of irrationality of his adherents, than it does about the CoV.

"eugen@leitl.org" and fellow-travelers should take note that Virians will not ignore their attempted attacks upon our reputation, and assure you that illogical flailing and unfounded assertions will be addressed as completely as circumstances require. Starting - or exacerbating - an unnecessary war with others who probably would have agreed with the Extropian goals (if appropriately expressed and articulated), is I submit, foolish and self-defeating, albeit not particularly unique (as could be discovered in "FAQ: UTism what is it" at http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs/index.php?board=31;action=display;threadid=11539. While "eugen@leitl.org" may not have been representing the Extropians on the CoV, his (and others) continued attacks on the CoV in this forum indicate to members of the CoV that what we are seeing here is a classic but unthinking defense of memespace.

"eugen@leitl.org" asserted that, "Hermit's markup [Hermit: and as a correction of fact, this is no more "Hermit's mark-up" than it is the mark-up of everyone who contributed to its development]  is there for a purpose: it claims to facilitate communcation, drawing great minds which then produce content. I would like to see some of that fabulous content those great minds have produced which eclipses content produced e.g. in this meek legacy medium of extropians@mailing list -- by an order of magnitude. I somehow kept missing those in http://forum.javien.com/messages.php?topicdata=virus&new=true. I'm so lost. Can you help me by pointing out killer content in there? Thank you.

I would suggest that "eugen@leitl.org"'s trouble with finding content in the archives is a trouble of the "signal-to-noise" ratio which is endemic to almost any public forum - and particularly email - the extropians not excluded. I recommend that he visit the FAQ section at http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs/index.php?board=31 and in particular the Best of Virus, Philosophy & Religion, Creative Endeavors and Serious Business sections of our archives. A number of virians are working hard to collect and collate those thoughts and concepts, produced by virians and others, which may be useful to our members in the future. In the best of scientific practice, the current structure is manual, but is helping those of us working on a more general and less labor intense system to define what we need and how it should be implemented. What we have proposed will make the transition to more advanced systems a great deal simpler, yet allow us to maintain at least some continuity with standards based legacy architectures.

Hermit

PS "eugen@leitl.org" made one interesting assertion - "It's obvious why: people's visual systems are rather hardwired, and legibility is measurable in objective benchmarks. Because people are not computers there's most assuredly a strong coupling between data and presentation."

I do not disagree with this. I love "objective benchmarks" - they dispense with so many needless arguments. I simply query eugen@leitl.org's assertion as to what legibility consists of. Perhaps he would care to support his arguments by sharing his "objective benchmarks" and explaining how he used them to draw the conclusions he is asserting here? Or is eugen@leitl.org simply saying that "legibility is measurable in objective benchmarks" but not claiming that he has used them to reach the conclusion that the morass appended to the full response is preferable to "Hermitish quotation"? In which case, why did he bring up "objective benchmarks"? To garner some spurious credibility?  Certainly, speaking for myself, I find discussions where a paragraph begins "[eugen 3] Blah-blah-blah" far easier to comprehend than one where each line is prefixed with "> > > > > Blah-blah-blah." But no doubt the "objective benchmarks" are going to persuade me how very wrong I am.

I'm disappointed. In fact, I'm downright pissed off.

Eugene -- and others -- consider that you are letting your critical style 
run wild without any consideration of context (such as this being a work in 
progress) and without any social grace. Consider also the ENORMOUS 
contribution that David has made and continues to make to our community.

An apology to David is in order. Are you man enough to issue one?

Have you a hard cite for that one? It would indeed appear to redefine some

I'll invite myself since I don't fit into the category you describe and don't
feel like being excluded. That is to say, I don't share your disappointment
(though I understand it; see below), and decline to be selected-out, but
thanks for the offer.

Strong language deprecating a technology is not the same thing as strong
language deprecating a person or persons. Or so it seems to me. "The idiotic
gateway" maps to "the silly 'bot" in my brain, not to "the gateway used only
by idiots". I agree that the word "idiotic" might be apt to push some peoples'
buttons. If I were doing QA on a project, I'd probably avoid using such
terminology in a bug report. So I understand your reaction: Clearly, anyone
who has spent considerable time developing the technology and trying to
promote its use might have a hard time maintaining that distinction, with
resultant umbrage; and I know that I've had similar problems in my own past.

When I remember to take time off before replying, I can sometimes improve my
aim, focus on substative matters and ignore backbiting (if that's what it is).
As my .sig says, sometimes I forget.

Eugen is only Eugen, Hermit.  He represents only himself.  As far as I know,
no massive attack on the Church of Virus is contemplated by Extropians at
large.

It would be easier to get the entire population of Tokyo to wear matching
outfits than to get ten Extropians to agree on pizza toppings.  You could
more easily extrapolate from Eugen to Germany than from Eugen to
Extropianism; there's probably more total variation inside Extropianism.

Okay, perhaps I exaggerate, but still.

I agree with this.  Cloning produces 90% malformed fetuses for every 10% 
good ones.  Even the ones that appear good develop degenerative disease 
later or have random health problems.  It is also now known that the 
"clones" are not exact genetic copies of the host.  They include damaged 
DNA from the host, mitochondrial DNA from the egg, and various gene 
expression factors that are different.  We don't know enough to clone 
animals yet.  Most of the clones fail and die.  A few fail and survive.  
None of the claimed successes lasted until adulthood without serious 
problems.

I support a ban on human cloning until the technique is improved.  Just 
as we require new medicines, medical devices and medical procedures to 
be tested and perfect on animals before using them on humans, we should 
get animal cloning working first before we clone humans.  If any of 
these cloning attempts on humans leads to a deformed baby, it will set 
back the cause for cloning farther than any Luddite legislation or 
fear-mongering would do.

In this case I fear the renegade scientists more than the Luddites.  We 
can overcome Luddites with logic and reason over the years.  It would be 
hard to dismiss a deformed child with persuasive  rhetoric.

I noticed that Kronos is mentioned in an article in the April 29, 2002
issue of Fortune.  The article is titled "Inside the Very Strange World
Of John Sperling" and is an interesting read.  Also is a picture of CC
the first cloned cat.  Also online at 

http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&doc_id=207304

I went to Phoenix a few months back for Kronos.  I recommend it.

I second that!

A couple of points of interest, especially for those not familiar with the 
history of Kronos:

-- Chris Heward will be speaking on a topic deeply related to the Kronos 
program at the Longevity Bootcamp next weekend (for those of you not going 
to the Foresight event).

-- Chris introduced many of the scientific ideas behind the Kronos program 
at Extro-1 and further at Extro-2.

-- It's easy to talk about improving longevity and health, but the Kronos 
programs offers what seems to be the very best current program for 
optimizing your vitality. They prefer to call this "age management" and 
don't claim to extend maximum lifespan -- just to provide the most 
personalized aging intervention.

Onward!

Max

David, how would I know it was still under development? Hermit was selling 
his markup as the best thing since sliced bread, so I went and picked 
apart what I saw.

This is a complete misinterpretation of what has happened. I was curious
about the CoV (after all, it's the second largest community on
<http://forum.javien.com/index.php> ), subscribed, and hung around. I then
observed what is imo a bizarre form of markup, and commented on it.  

   http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::YnBVIH8k-B0Rn-DGcd-U3s5-dxs7I15GTAVT

Here's what Hermit replied 

   http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::PVVCLAUH-dk8_-d006-bToc-NiI5VgAsaTt5

here's my reply to that, which is still pretty civil

  http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::bV8STx8d-Cn8@-X0V9-UxQk-A1dkGVE8c1JG

What Hermit wrote back in his second reply (and which is perfectly ad
hominem, a behaviour which he strangely enough accuses me of using first)  
made me realize he's hopeless
  
  http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::_9@J00nq-1wXO-nmtP-3bZn-8a@aTEZ2oNKY

(irrational in his evaluation of his own brainchild -- which was validated
by his subsequent responses to this list) and left the virus list. I don't
have the time to argue about broken markup using broken markup against a
person incapable of evaluating his markup rationally.

I then asked for comments on the Hermitish markup on this list here,
because I was interested whether users pick up and use what I perceive as
brokenness.  Needless to say, this is a genuine question. I don't
understand why people interprete a comment on communication form as a
personal attack, or attack on a movement. (I still don't know what CoV is
all about, mostly because markup and arguments about markup were in the
way).

> values and members, not to mention webserver and disk space, with the

David, I perceive that you also consider my remarks to be directed 
personally at you. This was at all not intended. Perhaps my mode of 
communication is intrinsically inflammatory, which is certainly not my 
intention. You're doing great work, keeping the ExI inftrastructure 
afloat, which is not mentioned nearly enough.

Ran out of time now, but this should do.

David, this is out of the context. I was asking for evidence that superior
markup leads to superior content. Orelse, why adopt it?

Before, I pointed out that dead tree media somehow manage to generate
excellent content despite of their supposed limitations. Because standards
lock user base, considerable superiority must be demonstrated before the
new and superior standard is adopted in a grassroot fashion. These are
elementary truths.

I asked for evidence of how Hermetic markup produces superior content,
albeit in a somewhat acerbic manner (notice that I pointedly abstained
from ripping Hermit a new arsehole despite ample provocation on his part).  

I notice that the evidence I asked for so far is lacking.

Hermit,  your email tool isn't wrapping lines properly. This causes 
problems for those of us with standards-compliant mail utilities.

Speaking solely for myself, I can say that HTML mail, mail that is
unreadably mangled due to MIME-printed-quotable characters, and mail
that doesn't  conform to standards and isn't wrapped to fit an 80-
character terminal window usually goes straight into the bit-bucket:
not due to any irrational ideological hatred of innovation, but
simply because I get roughly 200 email messages a day and can't spare
the time to reformat malformed ones (unless they're essential to my
business).

Discussing improved markup and email usability is a Good Thing, but
the exi-list probably isn't the place for it -- and you should never
underestimate the utility of network externalities, either. Standards
may be dumb or sub-optimal, but they're there, and the convenience
afforded by everybody sticking to an established one outweighs the pain
of shifting to a new one unless it's *very* good indeed. (Hence my
request for dumb ASCII and hard line breaks every 72-79 characters.)

Rather than take issue line by line here, I'm going to attempt a
summary of what I believe we agree on here.

Despite what has occurred in the past, there is the future to
consider.

Two separate states, Israel and Palestine living together in peace
and at peace with their neighbors.

After the Israelis finish making their point (terrorism is not
permitted.) It will be time for the world to act.

I think the Israelis should withdraw completely from areas
currently assigned as belonging to the Palestinians. Then a council
can be called to hash this all out, this will be difficult and take
time but it is necessary.

Anyone who attempts to break the peace, from a single kid throwing
rocks, to any politician making hate speech should be condemned by
all. No exceptions. Anyone failing to condemn any such action
should be excluded from the negotiations.

Let it begin...

So, I'm finally reaching a stage in my life where I can start thinking
about saving and investing a significant chunk of my income...  I'm
gradually trying to read up on matters of personal finance and
investment for the future.

It seems to me (based on my reading) that a key element in selecting
an investment strategy is to set investing goals.  Obvious personal
investment goals might include buying a home, going back to college,
or retirement.  [I have no family to support, but they would certainly
be on my list if I did.]

I'm finding myself in a quandary as to how to set my investing goals
in a way that I find satisfying, given what I think I know (and what I
think I don't know) about the odds that I'll have a significant impact
on the research of immortality (and related fields such as AI and
nanotech).

Consider, for example, the idea of planning for retirement.

People with plenty of retirement capital need to decide on a
post-retirement demand-for-income curve; this graph should have income
on one axis, and risk on the other axis.  Young people looking far
ahead to retirement will need to decide on a demand surface in a three
dimensional graph whose axes are: income, risk, and time spent
working.

(This is simplified, but not over-simplified for the purposes of this
example.  Obvious complications would include investments whose
income/risk values are themselves quite variable, and investments
which are undesirable in their own right, such as those that one takes
to be immoral.  Just a little thought can turn this puny
three-dimensional graph into an almost totally intractable problem.)

[As an aside, I'm extremely critical of those who say that not enough
young people spend time thinking about their retirement; for most
people, this is rational behavior, IMO, because at a young age the
problem is considerably more complicated... so complicated that only
short-term solutions are feasibly computable.]

To put this in more familiar terms, most books on retirement will tell
you to begin by figuring out some kind of minimum income level and
maximum risk that you're willing to accept, assuming you know how hard
you're prepared to work in order to get it.

But suppose now that there's a good chance that every dollar that I
invest in the problem of immortality will have a significant positive
effect; the more money with which I attack the problem, the more
likely it is to be solved within my lifetime.  (I'm 22.)  Especially
since I hate doing lab work, I'd always imagined that most of my
personal contribution to the problem of immortality would come in the
form of researching/scouting out good ideas and in providing enough
money to implement them.

Now, if I could be SURE that I'd get immortality if I worked for it as
much as possible, and that I'd miss out on immortality if I didn't,
I'd select what economists call a "corner solution," by picking a
point on my demand curve which lies on one of the axes.  In
particular, I'd increase my time/work as high as is practical and my
"minimum income" as high as possible, working as hard as I possibly
could on bringing about immortality ASAP.  More precisely, I'd take
only the barest minimum of leisure now, and save all my rest and
potential retirement until after immortality.  [Incidentally,
retirement in a posthuman world has been discussed extensively in this
list's archives; I'm not particularly interested in considering that
question again now.]

In the opposite case, in which I could be sure that I'd never get
immortality no matter what I did, I'd want to invest and retire in the
ordinary way, discussed at length in various books on personal
finance.

Yet another complication: I have reason to think that my
demand-for-income curve would be pretty low, which would normally
imply that I shouldn't work myself too hard.  Thus, if I THOUGHT that
I could get immortality by working as hard as possible, and I turned
out to be wrong, I'd lead a considerably less happy life, not to
mention the fact that my life's purpose would never be accomplished.

On the other hand, if I wasted my one shot at immortality, I'd wind up
dead.

(As an aside, I am well aware that I won't be particularly productive
if I'm completely miserable, but, within some large domain, more work
and less happiness definitely leads to more productivity.)

The very question of "How likely is immortality within my lifetime?"
has been debated on-list countless times; right now, I think the most
sober answer is: "I have no idea."  My question is even more subtle,
and even less tractable: "How likely is it that I can significantly
influence the likelihood of my achieving immortality?"

Basically, the more likely I can help, the harder/longer I'll want to
work.  The less likely it is, the more likely I am to take leisure in
my actions.

This quantitative analysis overlooks crucial decisions of scale as
well; if I need to set a goal to be a billionare, I'd better switch
jobs to something considerably higher pay (if less fun) than my
current job.  If it doesn't matter, so long as I make sure I survive
until 2067, then maybe I could go design computer games or do
metaphysics for a living: useless, but fun, and I can even retire
later if I want.

So the question is: does my personal financial contribution to
immortality research probably matter quite a lot?  Or does it probably
matter fairly little?

Well, it might be of interest that this piece (copiously footnoted though

[Charlie 1] Hermit,  your email tool isn't wrapping lines properly. This causes problems for
those of us with standards-compliant mail utilities.

[Hermit 2] RFC-821 and successors limits line length to "1000 characters or less" (none of
my lines have exceeded that length) and places the onus for formatting (including line
wrapping) on the client. As previously suggested to Eugen (refer Reply 9 at http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs/index.php?board=51;action=display;threadid=25358;start=0),
I recomend examination of the standards for yourself before you discuss their contents.
Presentation, including line wrapping, is the responsibility of the mail client, not the
originator. 

[Snip]

[Charlie 1] Standards may be dumb or sub-optimal, but they're there, and the 
convenience afforded by everybody sticking to an established one outweighs the pain of
shifting to a new one unless it's *very* good indeed. (Hence my request for dumb ASCII
and hard line breaks every 72-79 characters.)

[Hermit 2] Having been a member of numerous IETF committees, and author of a number
of standards documents, I agree. The most serious trouble with writing standards which
I have experienced recently, is that apparently some people do not read them, but simply
cite what they erroneously believe the standards contain, in attempted support of their
arguments.

[Hermit 2] I call this a logical error.

[Hermit 2] PS The relevant and applicable RFCs include RFC 821, RFC 822, RFC 934, STD 11,
RFC 1049, RFC 1341, RFC 1342, RFC 1343, RFC 1512, RFC 1521, RFC 1522, RFC 1590,

Does anyone here know whether Durk and Sandy have ever shown any documented 
benefits from their various supplement regimens over the years?  Admittedly 
I've never found the time to get through their thick (and by now most likely 
out of date) book.  And all I can get from their website and catalogues is 
what seems like a "hard sell" for various supplements without any documented 
proof of effectiveness.

Durk and Sandy have been at this for a couple decades now.  I wonder if 
either of them are healthier than average folks their ages who simply eat 
sensibly and excersize, without all the expensive (and questionable?) 
supplement therapy.

Congratulations!  I didn't get there till 26.  I'm now 32 and currently
un-saving. :-(

Your financial contribution probably matters not at all.  To "probably
matter" your contributions would have to be massive (even then money is
only one bottleneck, and to make such massive contributions you'd need
to first get very, very rich, which probably won't happen even if it is
your only goal) or you have to be fairly certain that you know the
pathway to immortality, and this pathway isn't and probably won't get
significant funding elsewhere and your contribution is large (I'd be
very skeptical of such knowledge, though you could probably get rich
enough to make such contributions with that as your goal).  Similar
arguments for non-financial contributions.

Not wishing to fan any argument flames for their own sake, I will confine
myself to observing that using the inequality operation I believe is a part of
customary mathematics, 76 < 80 < 1000. Thus what you have posted suggests
there is nothing wrong with posting short lines.

If RFC-821 (et seq) have overloaded the "less-than" operator, please advise.

I saw the real footage, live, of the second plane as it approached the
second tower. Obviously few cameral angles would allow you to get both
the plane and the tower in the shot at the same time, and the lack of
such footage beyond one or two luckily placed cameras demonstrates that
the news had no advance knowledge of the event.

The 'laws of war' govern military action with or without declarations of
war. Is the questioner implying that the military can be held to a lower
standard when there is no war openly declared?

<snippage of stuff that departs the credible universe>

Damien et al,

When I sought to refer whoever might be interested to
chapter 8 of The Hidden History of Zionism, I didn't
send you to the site where I originally found
it--which was: 

http://www.marxists.de/middleast/schoenman/ch08.htm

because I didn't have that original URL copied
anywhere.  So I googled again, and picked out the
first place I found it.  

I'm perfectly willing to take the heat for the
Schoenman piece, but not anything at the Balkan Unity
site.

And regarding the Schoenman piece, it's not the
scholarly structure--the copious footnotes that you
noted--that is at issue here, but rather the content
and quality of the citations.  The Hidden History of
Zionism is a brutal polemic, and the polemicist must
bear the burden of his unabashed hostility and his
unrepentent bias.  Fine. These work harshly against
him--for anyone not in "the choir".  

In his favor is the quality of the evidence he
presents.  But be savagely skeptical.  It's the duty
of every truth-seeker.  Rip and shred at every
weakness: the taking of statements out of context, the
artful evil fusing of unrelated comments to construct
a fictional "reality", second and third hand accounts,
mishearings, misreading, accounts given by clumsy,
corrupt, stupid, or confused witnesses or journalists
or information or disinformation organs.  Be massively
conservative.  Take no prisoners.  And when the dust
has settled, whatever remains, no matter how
unpalatable, is going to be your best shot at the
truth.  And if it's worth covering up, count on it
that when uncovered it will be ugly and unpalatable.  

Ethnic cleansing is just as bad whether it's done by
North American colonists two hundred years ago,
Australian colonists one hundred years ago, Nazis
sixty years ago, Serbians ten years ago, or Zionists
starting fifty-three years ago and continuing through
last week.

Schoenman is a Marxist of the first water, a zealot,
an egoist, an extremist with a remarkable history. 
Throw him out with the bathwater if it pleases you.
  
"He has been active in political life for many years.
He was privileged to be a close friend and colleague
of Bertrand Russell between 1960 and 1968.
      Between 1961 and 1968 he held the honorary title
of Secretary to Bertrand Russell. He was Executive
Director of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation in
which capacity he helped to secure the release of
political prisoners in many countries and initiated
the International Tribunal on US War-Crimes in
Indo-China, of which he was Secretary General.
      [He] initiated the Committee of One Hundred
which organised civil disobedience against nuclear
weapons and US bases in Great Britain. He was founder
and director of the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign and
Director of the Who Killed Kennedy Committee.
      He has been a leader of the Committee for
Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran, Co-Director
of the Committee in Defense of the Palestinian and
Lebanese Peoples, and Executive Director of the
Palestine Campaign, as well as American Workers and
Artists for Solidarity. He is a member of the steering
committee of The Permanent Committee Against War and
Exploitation, and has written a number of works and
contributes to a variety of magazines and lectures at
universities."

Pleasant, but check this out:

http://karws.gso.uri.edu/JFK/The_critics/Russell/Private_memorandum_of_Russell.html

Bertrand Russell disassociated himself from Schoenman
in 1969, writing (in the above memorandum):

"...His conviction of his unshakable belief in the
penetration and breadth of his understanding were
obvious. I did not for some time, however, grasp the
closely related characteristic of his utter
incapability of imparting reliable information. His
reports of peoples reactions and his observations
were and unfortunately, I fear, still are very often
excessively and misleadingly incorrect and his
quotations must always be verified." 

ending with

"...Ralph must be well established in megalomania. The
truth is, I suppose, that I have never taken Ralph as
seriously as he liked to think I did. I was fond of
him in the early years. But I never looked upon him as
a man of parts and weight and much individual
importance."

But it's not about Schoenman.  It's about whatever
opportunity presents itself to see a truth that
perhaps someone out there is motivated to keep you
from seeing.  I've heard that there are such hidden
truths, maybe I'm wrong.  I leave it to you to decide
where the truth lies.

Best, Jeff Davis

Ric Edelman who has written a number of best sellers about
personnal finance has a new book out "Discover the Wealth within
You". The whole first half is about having a life worth investing
for.

I just started it, but you may find it worthwhile.

When you get a substantial nest egg built you can think about
giving some of it away. For now a simple investment, say becoming
a member of an organization whose ideas you support, like maybe the
Extropy Institute, is well within your currently modest means.

RFC821 is the standard for SMTP, a transport protocol; it's not a
standard for message body contents other than specifying the codeset
and limitations on what you can put in the DATA section of a message.

I draw your attention to RFC2822, which states:

Note the SHOULD. Lines longer than 78 characters aren't technically a 
violation of the RFC, but you're bending the rules by using them.

The Balkan Unity site refers to a weekly radio program by Schoenman, on 
which he promises to "document the role of the U.S. government in 
instigating and orchestrating the events of September 11th."

The guy is clearly a loon.

I did a web search on "Hidden History of Zionism".  Virtually all the sites 
that refer to it are either self-described Marxist or Socialist (like 
socialistaction.org, marxismalive.org and marxists.de) or sites that focus 
on conspiracy theories. Schoenman is described (in admiration) as an 
"American Jewish Trotskyist."

I looked for a rebuttal of his book but couldn't find one.  Everyone 
outside his cadre seems to be ignoring him.

Extraordinary claims call for extraordinary evidence.  I didn't see it in 
the book.

What I saw:

(1) Profuse footnoting (which encourages you to think that the work is 
scholarly) but no links to any of the sources so that one could confirm 
that he accurately reflected the source material.  (One site that discussed 
his work suggested that a lot of his references were lifted straight from 
other authors, particularly Noam Chomsky.)

(2) Correct translations of names from Hebrew.

(3) Some correct names, titles, quotations, and dates, and some that were 
wrong.

(4) The first half of the book makes an attempt at appearing 
objective.  The second half is much more polemic. By the end, you expect 
him to rise to his feet, and shout "Viva, Che!"

(5) His book is absolutely black-and-white.  The Jews / Zionists / Israelis 
are evil, and are not credited with doing anything right, except those who 
have the integrity to report on how evil the rest of their society is.  The 
Arabs / Palestinians are noble, victims, and have never done anything 
wrong.  Americans and Europeans are good when they act in opposition to the 
Zionists and evil when they are in cahoots.

(6) He omits many historic events that don't fit his thesis, like the 1929 
Arab riots in Palestine, the collaboration between the British and the 
Palestinian Jews to fight the Nazis during the latter part of WW II, or the 
Mossad teams that tracked down and assassinated Nazis in hiding.

(7) He gets some facts hilariously wrong, like in chapter 4, where he 
writes that in Israel, "in order to be entitled to live on land, to lease 
land, or to work on land one must prove at least four generations of 
maternal Jewish descent."  I know this is wrong from personal experience: 
we didn't have to, and neither did the Baptists down the road.  But it also 
should appear absurd to a casual observer; if it were true, where do the 
1,000,000 Arabs who are Israeli citizens live and work?

(8) Smear by false reasoning.  In many places, his logic is of the 
form:  "Nazis had a salute. They were evil.  The Irgun had a salute. 
Therefore, they were also evil."

(9) I was pleased, however, to see friends of the family mentioned.  My 
father designed advanced technology for the Israeli (and American) military 
and was science and technology advisor for the Liberal wing of the Likud. 
Had we not returned to the US, he would have been in the Knesset when Begin 
won. So he knew a lot of the generals and cabinet ministers cited.  I think 
some of the war criminals were at my Bar Mitzvah reception....

Experts Find Clues to Cause of Deadly Pacific Tsunami

By KENNETH CHANG

University of Southern California

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/23/science/earth/23TSUN.html?homepageinsidebox


The New York Times



A microphone in the Pacific Ocean near Wake Island recorded a 45-second,
low-frequency roar, too low to be heard by human ears. It was the sound of
nearly a cubic mile of sediment giving way along an ocean bottom slope 2,200
miles away off Papua New Guinea.

That recently examined recording is the latest evidence that an underwater
landslide, not an earthquake, churned up the 30-foot-high tsunami that crashed
onto coastal villages of Papua New Guinea on July 17, 1998, killing more than
2,100 people.

Once thought rare, landslide-generated tsunamis have caught the attention of
geologists, who now look with concern at other continental shelves that could
collapse with equal disaster. Three-dimensional maps of the bottom of Monterey
Bay off California, for example, show several sections that have given way 
and others that have cracked and may collapse in the future.

What is not known is how often landslides occur and how many tumble fast
enough to induce tsunamis.

Small landslides  or ones that slip slowly  do not cause tsunamis.
Cataclysmic landslides, like the partial collapse of a midocean volcano,
generate giant waves that scour thousands of miles of coastline around an
entire ocean basin, but they occur very rarely, once every few hundred
thousand years.

But moderate-size underwater landslides like the one off Papua New Guinea may
pose an uneasily plausible risk in some places, occurring once every few
hundred years.

"It is a reasonably significant hazard," said Dr. Emile A. Okal, a professor
of geological sciences at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.

Almost immediately after it happened, scientists realized the Papua New Guinea
tsunami was unusual. An offshore earthquake of magnitude 7.0 preceded the
waves, but earthquakes that size strike that area every year or two; only the
1998 one was accompanied by a tsunami. The deadly devastation was also
confined to a 15-mile stretch of the coast; villages only a few miles east or
west escaped almost unscathed.

That led to speculation that the earthquake had shaken loose a landslide that
in turn caused the tsunami. Surveys of the ocean bottom found freshly
collapsed sediment that slid nearly a mile down a 25-degree slope.

Other scientists argued that a vertical thrust of the sea floor during the
earthquake directly caused the tsunami, but that the amphitheater-shaped
depression around the epicenter focused the waves onto the small section of
the shoreline.

In the latest work, Dr. Okal examined the sound recordings from Wake Island,
which captured a low-frequency rumble (measured at seven hertz) that lasted 45
seconds. In the ocean, sound waves can reflect off layers of water of
different temperatures, allowing them to travel long distances without fading
out. Earthquakes can generate similar low rumbles, but those last only about
10 seconds, Dr. Okal said.

The findings were reported in the April 8 issue of The Proceedings of the
Royal Society of London.

"For the first time, we are able to identify a landslide from its acoustic
signature," said Dr. Costas E. Synolakis, a professor of civil engineering at
the University of Southern California and lead author of the paper.

Seismic stations on several Pacific islands also recorded the acoustic
rumblings.

Tracing the path the sound waves took, Dr. Synolakis, Dr. Okal and their
colleagues concluded that the rumble came from a landslide that occurred 13
minutes after the earthquake. That, the scientists said, agrees with accounts
from survivors who said the tsunami followed the first large aftershock, 20
minutes after the earthquake. It also rules out the earthquake as the cause
because the waves would not have taken that long to travel the 20 miles from
the epicenter to the shore. "We had to find a source which happened 10 to 15
minutes after the main shock," Dr. Okal said.

Eric L. Geist, a research geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey
in Menlo Park, Calif., described the paper as a "very intriguing line of
research," but not definitive proof of the landslide theory. "It's certainly a
plausible story," he said. "We just have no way of verifying it instrumentally
right now."

Mr. Geist said the earthquake, or one of its aftershocks, must have also
caused a tsunami because instruments in Japan thousands of miles away detected
it, a quick-moving wave a few inches high. Landslide-generated tsunamis
dissipate quickly and do not travel that far. He added that in the chaos, the
witnesses could have mistaken the sequence of events.

The theory that underwater landslides can set off tsunamis dates back more
than a century. In recent decades, tsunami researchers shifted their attention
to offshore earthquakes, still thought to be the cause of most tsunamis.

But after Papua New Guinea, scientists thought they might have underestimated
the dangers of landslides. In 2000, scientists at Pennsylvania State
University warned of unstable, waterlogged sediments under the seabed off New
Jersey. The weight of rocks above could potentially blow the sediments out the
side of the continental slope like a stepped-on water balloon, causing a
landslide and a tsunami.

Scientists also see potential collapses in places like the mouth of the St.
Lawrence River where sediment from the river piles up. In 1929, a 7.2
earthquake toppled part of the sediment pile, causing a tsunami.

Underwater landslides have also occurred off the coast of California. In
Monterey Bay, "you see large numbers of bites taken out of the canyon
essentially," said Dr. Steven N. Ward, a research geophysicist at the
University of California at Santa Cruz. "Some look very fresh. Some look very
old. Some look like they haven't happened yet."

The canyon is cracked in some places, Dr. Ward said, and even a small
earthquake near a crack could set off a landslide. Most of the slides in
Monterey Bay are small  only about a fortieth the volume of the Papua New
Guinea landslide  but because they occur very close to shore, they could
still create 15- to 20-foot-high waves that strike a small portion of the
coast. "Ten miles up or down the coast, you won't see it," he said. "It's big,
but it's fairly local."

To better understand how sliding sediments create tsunamis, Dr. Synolakis and
his colleagues conducted experiments earlier this month at Oregon State
University. In what looks like a small swimming pool, they slid a
wedged-shaped block down the slanted bottom of the pool and measured the size
of the waves. They varied the weight of the wedge between 200 and 1,000 pounds
by adding lead weights.

The measurements show that, contrary to earlier beliefs, that the largest
waves are not caused by the push of the wedge.

"The big thing is sucking water down" behind the sliding wedge, Dr. Synolakis
said. "Now we find most of the energy is expended in creating the wave on the
back end of the slide," which head in the opposite direction  toward the
shore.

THis gives me an idea for a sf thriller novel about terrorists who hold
the world hostage to slide-induced tsunamis. If explosives will work for
triggering avalanches, they should work for these as well....

Well, if you think you'll actually be around to benefit from your 
investment & your research...

Given the current projections for population growth and the ongoing 
depletion of the world's natural resources, life extension research 
in general tends to exist in a vacuum of selfish fantasy. You either 
end up with the most privileged 3% living to 400, or a population 
bloat of 15 billion impoverished humans. LE research also seems 
somewhat ignorant of the very real problems  which threaten the lives 
of people every day.

 From the CDC for 1999:

725,192 deaths from cardiovascular diseases
549,838 deaths from malignant neoplasms
167,366 deaths from cerebrovascular diseases

In the past 2 years I've watched a 50 year old man die of ALS 6 
months after diagnosis, and stood by the side of a 48 year old woman 
as she died of an acute bone marrow transfer. It took 3 weeks from 
diagnosis to her death.

I contribute to my 401(k) and my Roth IRA but, hell, I'm not even 
sure I'll make it long enough to reap the benefits - and I'm only 31.

I feel that the brilliant minds in LE might do better researching 
cancer or heart disease or immune deficiencies. I'd rather have a 
rich life of 80 years than live to 170 and watch generations of 
friends and family die from disease.

Heres an interesting slant on Panpychism and a link to any plausibility in
the film AIs premise of consciousness being an artifact of the substance of
spacetime itself. Personally I dont think we need this to get
consciousness, but its a nice one if youre a Panpychist.

The reference to "reductive science" was not meant to include "all science"
but just that aspect of science which attempts to describe generalities by
studying the particulars, or to arrive at an understanding of the whole by
the examination of its parts.

Superstring/M-brane theory is a consolidation of all six separate string
theories (which are simply six different viewpoints of the same theory) into
one all inclusive theory of everything that includes both the super-super
quantum space above the quarks, and the subsub quantum space between them
and the zero-point of so called "vacuum" space -- which is really *full*
of energy... Thus, apparently, closing the paradoxical gap between quantum
and relativity theories.  It also implies that all mass-energy, from quarks
to atomic matter, is rooted in, or are aspects of a fundamental radiant
energy that is, essentially, composed of lines of primal force that are in
the form of vibrating "strings" whose frequencies can range from near zero
to
near infinite.

As a result, some theorists have considered that consciousness (in its
aspect
of awareness) could be the inherent nature of the zero-point itself (which
is
*everywhere* in the phenomenal universe)... And, that all objective physical
(mass-energy) phenomena is holistically rooted in its spin or "spinergy" --
that not only can carry information in the form of proto-interference
patterns of angular momenta -- but also can be the basis of the entire post
"big bang" cosmic involution and evolution being an inseparable holographic
continuum. This paradigm, if proven, could certainly change our entire
conception of reductive (or physicalist) science.

Such a paradigm is the fundamental basis of my multidimensional,
holographic,
coenergetic field theory of perceptive consciousness (that, incidentally,
besides not contradicting relativity and quantum theories, also seems to be
consistent with some ancient occult [Buddhist, Vedantist, etc.] metaphysical
theories of both consciousness and cosmogenesis.)

Nah, Tim Pickens has the remains of that (the RL-10 engines were on loan
from Pratt&Whitney, and were returned to them somewhat the worse for
wear).  Tim is a good guy, we barter hardware with him occasionally.

See http://realrocketman.tripod.com/uncletim.htm, about 80% down.

I'll note that I saw a blurb in this months Popular Mechanics (or was it
Popular Science?) about XCOR's EZ-Rocket. Hey, Doug, when is Jeff gonna
give me an evaluation report on the EZ-Rocket simulation I did?

This is a confusing/confused trend fit.  Unlike Gaussian mortality,
where one's lifespan is, as you note, limited by the random chance
that something will crop up and kill you, augmented lifespan (if/when
it's possible at all) is based primarily on the state of the
technology available to keep you alive; the longer you can wait, the
better that gets.  That means that if you get to 200 at all, you're
*more* likely, not less, to get to 400, b/c there will have been 200
years of work on LE tech to keep you alive.

Same story for the "most privileged 3% living to 400."  If today we
might gleefully fantasize about live to 400, how long do you imagine
you'd expect to live 400 research years from now?

As I said in my original post, the honest skeptic, when asked what
we'll be able to do after even 50 years of research, should reply: "I
have no idea, but I hope we haven't annihilated human civilization by
that point!"

Same goes for depletion of natural resources.  If you imagine we'll
run out of fossil fuels in 200 years, (when you take into account
conservation provoked by rising prices,) ask yourself what sort of
energy technology we'll develop in 200 years.

If you think you know the answer, you don't understand the problem.

You have my sympathies.  My dad died of heart failure earlier in this
year.  It's my goal to prevent deaths like these in the future.

I will say this: Perhaps years of continued tragedy will convince you
that you and your loved ones won't survive.  But suppose you realize,
too late, that you were wrong, that you could have done something, but
in your hopelessness and despair you became risk-averse and avoided
investments (in time, money, brainpower) that could have really made a
life-or-death difference.

I don't know about you, but the thought that I might blow my only
chance for survival, for my loved ones and for myself, is quite
haunting.  I suppose it would be less haunting to people (like
yourself?) who have already given up on survival, but I don't think
these fatalist views should dominate the discussion.

You're making a Common Mistake (tm): that, if you somehow got access
to Life Extension technology, you couldn't give it to your friends and
family, or anyone else you care about.

Immortality alone might well be miserable, but what makes you think
you'd even be so lucky?  If you live to 170, it'll probably be because
somebody figured out how to get all sorts of people to live 170, you
included.

I won't give up while there's still some hope for humanity.

This is an interesting question because I'm not entirely sure whether it's
being asked from an altruistic perspective, a purely selfish perspective, a
selfish-discount perspective, or a selfish-split perspective.  For me the
answer here is straightforward, and would be regardless of whether I seem to
be playing an interesting role in Friendly AI or seed AI; I count myself as
one six-billionth of the stakes immediately on the table.  I'm pretty sure I
can count for more than one six-billionth of the Singularity by trying to
become directly involved in it, so the total amount of happiness I can
create through other-directed efforts is greater than the total amount of
happiness I can create by making myself happy.  I also have a nonzero
discount rate for future sentients, and any nonzero discount rate means that
the continued existence and growth of Earth-originating intelligent life,
"humanity's future", is the most important thing to protect, because the
"zillion" (10^N) sentients who exist in the future are the largest stakes on
the table.  It's a good thing that the interests of humanity's future and
present-day humanity seem to coincide; otherwise it would present an
interesting ethical dilemna...

There is a somewhat equivalent argument from the "purely selfish"
perspective which states that the expected integral over time of
post-Singularity happiness is likely to outweigh any happiness achieveable
in the present day regardless of discount rate.  However, if shifting from
an altruistic to a selfish perspective, one then has the question of whether
one should spend money on increasing the probability of *personal* survival
to the Singularity, or spend money on increasing the probability of the
Singularity, accelerating the arrival time of the Singularity, or making the
Singularity safer.  This question is dependent on how much leverage you
think you can have on the Singularity.  Given that surprisingly few people
are even paying attention to the oncoming tidal wave, much less do anything
about it, I would argue that individual efforts at this point really can
have a substantial effect - as long as they are intelligently directed to
exactly the point of maximum leverage.  However, from a purely selfish
perspective, no matter how much leverage you have, it will still be rational
to buy a cryo bracelet.  If you don't think you can have any significant
personal impact on the future and you are purely selfish, then you should
just spend all your money on increasing your chance of personal survival. 
It might be noted though that, in human terms, this may constitute
"defecting" in the Prisoner's Dilemna, which is an action that can have
direct personal consequences - people may trust you less.  Symmetrically, if
you cooperate, this may encourage others to cooperate as well, amplifying
the effect of your actions.

Most people mix selfishness and altruism.

If you use a "selfish discount" algorithm that weights your own welfare
greater than the welfare of others, but the discount rate on the happiness
of others is nonzero, then this collapses to pretty much the same answer as
the altruistic answer above; the total of what's at stake will outweigh your
own life, no matter the discount rate.

However, the most common real algorithm is the "selfish split" - spend some
of your effort on yourself, and some of your effort on others.  This can't
easily be mapped onto normative goal reasoning with a desirability metric
for possible futures, but it does make easy intuitive sense to a human with
a day planner... obviously in this case the rational action is to spend
whatever proportion of your "altruistic" efforts on the Singularity, because
That's What It's All About at this point in Earth's history; and to spend
whatever proportion of your "selfish" efforts on things that make you feel
good in the short term, because if you're trying for a selfish split,
spending your so-called "personal" efforts on willpower-consuming calorie
restriction is not likely to be sustainable psychologically...

The "selfish split" often isn't so much of a selfish split as a split
between efforts directed toward long-term goals and efforts directed toward
short-term happiness.  I've never been able to get past the split itself,
but I do try to make sure that all effort available for long-term goals is
directed toward the Singularity, and I don't make efforts for short-term
happiness in ways that threaten those long-term goals.  If you're
simultaneously split between selfishness and altruism and between doing what
you want to do and what you ought to do, then you should try to channel your
"want to" efforts into hobbies that damage neither your contribution to the
Singularity nor your chances of long-term survival, and channel your "ought
to" efforts into whatever mix of Singularity activities and long-term
survival activities you think is appropriate, given your chosen split for
altruism and selfishness.

If you're currently operating on a selfish split but *want* to be more
altruistic, you can either "just do it" - make the switchover and get it
over with - or you can try and gradually increase the proportion of the
split allocated to altruism.  I think there are profound reasons why trying
for 100% altruism is very different psychologically from compromising at 90%
altruism, but others may feel that the real difference is only an 11%
increase, so your mileage may vary.

Fine.  Let him be a loon.  That is not the issue. The

Your focus on discrediting the messenger is suggestive
that you are at pains to discredit the evidence.

I suggest you look harder.  I certainly intend to.  It
is impossible for me to believe that an
anti-Israel/anti-Zionist polemic published fourteen
years ago has been left unanswered.  If you--or anyone
on the list--finds the rebuttals before I do, please
post this info or email me off list.  

Lack of a rebuttal would lend credibility to his
evidence, but at this point that is premature.

With respect David, I am sure his claims appear

First, David, it was a print publication, not a web
document.  It was written in 1988, before there was a
web.  His references/footnoting meets the standards
for providing sources in print publications. And I
would add that if the citation of source material were
innacurate or phony, it would have invited a rebuttal
and loud condemnation that would not be at all
difficult to find.

It appears--correct me if I am misreading here--that
you are suggesting a kind of plaigerism, when in fact
citing other works/scholars/researchers is exactly
what professional scholarship is about.  As to using
Chomsky as a resource, what could be more practical
considering the similarities in their areas of
interest and their points of view?  But I think what
you're really about here, David, is adding another
slam--"Chomsky lover"--to "loon" and "commie". 
Doesn't matter, it's still about the evidence.

I don't recall seeing this,  I'll go back and look.

I'm sure they were well dressed and well mannered. 
And of course, we don't want to believe that such
things are true, or even possible, the more especially
when it strikes close to home.  But human darkness is
not the exclusive province of Germans, Japanese, and
communists.  

The evidence.  Address the evidence.

I'm going to see if I can verify any of the citations
by searching for the source material on the web.

It probably matters to the extent of ~150,000 people per day
that die from aging associated causes.  On an annual basis,
that is more people than were killed in WWII (over several years).

A cryonics plan is the best bet to allow oneself to benefit from
the investment/research.  Whether a specific individual benefits
could be offset with the idea that there are rewards to knowing
one has contributed to the accelerated evolution of our knowledge
base is an open question.  Even if one does not oneself survive --
people can look back and find heroism in ones actions.

If this isn't clear, let me make it clearer -- how much of ones
personal wealth (or ones personal survival potential) are *you*
willing to spend to promote the survival of (a) oneself; (b)
loved ones in your family; (c) the average individual in a
democratic society; (d) the average human on the planet?

Ca-ca, poo-poo.  The cost of most "natural resources" has been going
down (in constant dollars) for many decades, not up.

Yes there are constraints on the resources available on the planet.
But nature has not evolved optimal paths for their utilization.

Bottom line -- human beings are ~100 W machines.  100 W can be collected
on average with a few sq. meters of land area.  Until humans occupy
the planet with a density (> 1 human/10 m^2 of land) there isn't
an "overpopulation" problem.

I have to agree with this.  As someone focused on developing corporations
with architectures where life-extending benefits would very rapidly
"trickle-down" to the "less privileged" it *is not* a tautology or
a requirement that only the wealthy are able to afford life extending
technologies.

I'll be so bold as to say that I think I do understand the problem
and am relatively certain that I have at least one of the answers.

This is the crux of the matter.  The only solution we have for this
now is cryonics.  If we do not engage in this debate in a more aggressive
fashion we *will* lose more people.

I am forced to agree (though I disagree that the original author

Sigh.  What people need to realise is that cancer and heart disease
are are integrated components with the problem of aging.  One will
only defeat aging while at the same time defeating cancer and heart
disease.  There will be a paper soon to be published in the Journal
of Evolution and Technology regarding a nanorobotic organ system
that would effectively eliminate ~80% of the current causes of death
(including cancer and heart disease).  The problem will then be how
to implement such a system for many people.

Our current concepts of aging & disease will need to be significantly
modified to adopt to the technologies we can anticipate the development
of.

Yes, this is most likely to be the case.  Even in our current
messed up intellectual property system there would appear to only
be a ~20 year delay from the development of life-extending technologies
to their application to the general population (e.g. generic drugs).
For the position proposed (above) to be "reasonable" you have to make a
valid case that Erythropoietin (EPO) (an Amgen patented pharmaceutical)
should not be as cheap as aspirin in 20 years.  There *may* be a
barrier between the discovery and application of life extending
technologies to the general population, but in the current legal
environment the time delays would seem to be much less than the
longevity of individuals, particularly those with extended lives.

At extro5 a bunch of us were discussing various models for
the singularity, i.e. soft takeoff, hard takeoff, etc.  The hardest
takeoff I know about is the scenario I think favored by
Eliezer et al, where the last few minutes before the singularity
the emergent AI writes all the necessary software itself
without any guidance from humans.  This resultant AI is so
advanced that it is able to upload all sentient lifeforms into
a simulation so seamlessly that the meat-based intelligences
do not even realize anything happened.  (Hard takeoff fans,
did I get this about right?)

Question please: if the emergent AI simulates humanity at
the moment of the singularity, then there are a bunch of
simulated beings who are working to invent AI and who
would have a strong suspicion that all the elements are in
place for a singularity to occur.  Right?  The simulated
beings would become puzzled if all the elements for a
runaway AI were in place but the singularity was not
happening.  Alternatively, if a group of AI researchers
created an AI, then that AI uploaded and simulated
humanity, the simulations themselves would still be at
work trying to create an AI, which the meta-AI would
then need to simulate.  Seems like the sim would need
to create multiple levels of simulations of itself within itself,
an apparent contradiction.  Or is it?

Another scenario: the emergent AI realizes that it cannot
create a new level of AI simulation every few minutes, so
it creates a simulated world in which the AI mysteriously
fails to emerge, even tho it appears to have greater than
human intelligence.  The AI researchers would be puzzled
at the apparent failure of AI to emerge, even tho all the
elements would appear to be in place.  Perhaps they would
then reason that the singularity must have just happened,
and would begin to search for evidence thereof.  spike

Actually it happened ten thousand years ago in the secret chamber deep
underneath the Great Pyramid. Ever since then, this sim we're in has just
been vamping, when necessary drawing the best minds away from the truths of
magical science whenever they seemed to be getting too close--as with
Newton's alchemical research, from which he was successfully diverted by
tweaking him toward calculus, gravity and optics, leading Eliezer and Max
more away from their early and worrying interest in psi research into the
errors of computational theory, etc.

Of course this post will now never ap

Point of order:  I don't know what percentage of the planetary death rate is
due to aging, but I sincerely doubt it's 100%.  Antiaging research is not
the same as immortality research.

Interesting indeed.  I sometimes am taken by the notion that if 
such a universe is not what we are living in then it is still 
possible that some time Post-Singularity enough is discovered 
and mastered to create other universes that do work in such a 
way.  In particular the parallels with possible virtual universe 
characteristics are interesting.  There has been some talk on 
here that amounts to the notion that if such universes are 
possible we have a strong possibility of being in one.  It gets 
a bit twisted.

Any SI worthy of the name *could* do that, but Michael Anissimov is the only
one I know of who was talking about the nonvolitional seamless uploading of
recalcitrant sentients into a Pedestrian mockup to conserve computing
resources - to my way of thinking, this violates Friendliness.  I also think
Anissimov may have reconsidered this since then.

Suure AI has stagnated for fifty years.  Suuuure.

Suspicion, maybe.  Proof, no.  And so long as there is no proof, no
problem just not having the AI emerge in the sim...or for the AI to be
there, but not upload humanity in the simulation.  If anyone asks why,
it tells them they're already in the simulation, and starts granting the
"mere" humans the power to edit sim-reality to prove that things are
different.

I see no reason that the SI would not let these researchers, and 
all others who would not be damaged by knowing, in on the truth.

The seeming paradox is easily resolved by the above simple means.

Yes.

This kind of assumption---that it would want to keep
the big S a secret---reminds me of the "explanation"
for why we don't see much of the Saucer Folks.  They're
just shy, you see, and they don't want anyone to know
they're around.

Now, if we are so lucky that the AI uploads us, then I
can't imagine any reason that it wouldn't say so:  I claim
that emulated lives inside are better than no lives at all,
and that this AI is really therefore really "nice", since
it hardly needs us anymore.  Under these very ideal
(and optimistic assumptions, sigh), apparently our best
interests are near its silicon heart.

So if there's no nearby top to a sigmoid curve of development
that it has to be concerned about, then there's no reason
that it can't offer a customized path of personal evolution
for each of us.  Even as you and I debate to ourselves the
desirability of drastic IQ enhancement, merging memories,
allocating some of our granted resources to running backups
in parallel, and so on, the AI races forward at breakneck speed.

Yes, ;-)   That would be an easy way out!  Say that uploading
all those complicated biological organisms is a royal pain, and
that as the SI moves through the Earth's crust converting 
everything in its path to itself, it also finds that it's squeamish
about converting people too, so it lets us keep the top .1 percent
of the planet.  And then it uses your idea to perplex us:

"Nah, you've already been uploaded.  See how realistic it is!
I'll bet that you can hardly tell the difference!", har har har.

Why in the world?  I would deeply hope that it would be so
considerate!  *Everyone* would be better off uploaded (if
the AI is so nice to do so), whether they realize it or not.
At *very least* the AI provides you a life indistinguishable
from what you currently have, but with no chance of halting,
and probably many fewer red lights on your way to work.

Quite right.  You said it first.

Thanks for again demonstrating that consensus on Friendliness metric does
not exist (apparently, it needs reminding). Not to mention that singletons
are unphysical, but that will have to wait for another post.

Why should the postbiology be so squeamish? Especially, in the face of
economic pressure? (It's not just the people, it's the complete ecosphere
they depend on -- a rather rambling and vulnerable structure).

Nonvolitional uploading would violate Extropian principle #6
of self-direction.  Some people might prefer to evolve
individually into an Aristoi.  It is impossible to do
that if they are constrained within a SysOp/AI.

Life is already meaningless.  Life within a Sysop/AI becomes
much more so (for me personally) so I would strongly object
to nonvolitional uploading.  I got out of one womb, I'm not
about to climb back into one without devoting a lot of thought
to whether that is the most attractive alternative.

There are just two reasons that it might be nice to 
humans, so far as I know:  one, I. J. Good's meta-
golden rule---be nice to sentients far below you
who're at your mercy so that your rapidly evolving
descendent (who soon won't identify with you) will
be nice to you---, and two, because someone built
it to be that nice.

You're right about economic pressure, though.  As the
speed of light becomes so slow (from the SI perspective)
evolution even over the Earth could break apart and become
localized quickly, and in that case systems that allowed
anything to hold back their own development would be at
a serious disadvantage.

Yeah, but only insofar as it being kind of funny (for 
me any way) to imagine an AI that took over but didn't
want to mess with any of the Earth's surface because of
humanitarian or environmental concerns ;-)

I don't know: but couldn't an SI grow quickly using oil
deposits kinda the way we do?

;-)  I was thinking that they'd leave us the top 0.1% as
part of the gag.  That would be several miles deep.  But
seriously, of course making a Dyson sphere (or sheaves, or
whatever Robert calls them) would be a priority for our
hungry entity.

Point taken.  The number I'm most familiar with are 13-18
million deaths a year from hunger and malnutrition [1].  I also
recently saw a number of ~5 million per year from global pandemics,
primarily HIV and malaria.  Taken together those numbers would be
somewhere in the range of 33-42% of annual deaths.

However my calculation of annual world deaths was based on U.S.
death rates and we don't for the most part die from hunger or
pandemics (HIV dropped out of the top 10 causes of death several
years ago).  So world death rates may be higher.  Obviously
dying of the non-aging related causes removes you from the pool
of those who die from aging.

I don't believe there is such a thing as "immortality research" yet.
Until several things are proven, such as protons not decaying,
"immortality" remains a very dubious concept.

Anti-aging research could be placed into 2 categories.
Healthful aging research -- where the aim is to square
the population's longevity curve (everyone dies painlessly
in their sleep on their 85th birthday) and Lifespan Extension
research whose purpose is to push human lifespan beyond
that allowed by the natural genetic program.

As most know, I'm a proponent of radical lifespan extension
research.  I tend to lump all causes of death together
(which Eliezer was objecting to) because when we have the
technologies to achieve radical lifespan extension, we
should also have the technologies to eliminate pandemics
as well as hunger and malnutrition.

One could develop a scenario where robust bioengineering
proves very hard, population growth rates outstrip economic
growth rates, and access to space never becomes relatively
affordable -- in which case overpopulation and hunger and
malnutrition may remain a significant cause of death around
the world.  I just happen to think that scenario is *very*
unlikely.

It'd be friendly but not Friendly.  Uploading people without their consent
as an alternative to exterminating them is friendly, but not Friendly. 
Taking 99% of the universe for yourself and allocating the remaining 1% to
humans who live inside you and whom you help on request is friendly, but not
Friendly.

Heh.  I never claimed there was a consensus on Friendliness content.  *I*
just need to get the *structure* right.  If I get the content right, it's
helpful, but not necessary.  The *AI* is the one who has to get the content
right.  As for a consensus on Friendliness structure, I'd be happy if people
even *saw* Friendliness structure, instead of arguing over Friendliness
content, which argument of course implies that they think they know which
kind of arguments are likely to persuade other humans.  Eugen, for example,
quite correctly estimates that I and the rest of the audience are likely to
regard a lack of consensus as significant... so I'm glad to see we all have
consensus on that particular moral sequitur.

My calculation of annual world deaths, which independently arrived at
roughly the same numbers, was based on UN statistics - so the death count
from aging is probably substantially less than 150,000/day.

True.  As Greg Egan points out, immortality is more than living an extremely
long time before you die; immortality means not dying, ever.  At this time
we don't know whether we're reaching for eternity or just very long
subjective spans.  Nonetheless, "lifespan extension" doesn't quite convey
the overtones of "human lifespan > stellar lifespan".

I don't object to lumping all causes of death together; I was just objecting
to lumping them all together under "aging".

No, it's not.  That someone makes an assertion does not imply that it is 
worthy of investigation, response, or rebuttal.  That the assertion has 
significant consequences if it is true does not change this.

Because part of the evidence is who is the messenger and what credibility 
they have. If someone with a strong reputation for intellectual honesty, 
integrity, objectivity, past relevant accomplishment, analytical skills, 
pertinent expertise, etc.,  says something interesting, it's worthy of 
attention.  As these factors are removed, and negative factors are added, 
their assertions become less and less worthy of consideration.

If Robert posts something, it may not be true.  But my assessment of his 
credibility is high enough that I will either consider the posting to be 
worth reading and thinking about, or I will file it away mentally as 
tentatively true.  There is some degree of transitivity.  If Robert says 
that Smith is credible, I will give Smith the benefit of the doubt.  If 
Robert, Marvin, Harvey, and Natasha all say Smith is credible, there is a 
cumulative effect beyond what Robert alone would have.  I use similar 
mechanisms to make consumer decisions, based on my assessment of the 
credibility of Consumer Reports vs. PC Magazine, or of reader's comments at 
amazon.com, or eBay reputations, or voting record ratings.

(Has anyone quantified this, as part of a proposal for a reputation-based 
Internet, or intelligent agents a la Pattie Maes/Firefly?  It seems to me 
that it wouldn't be that hard to develop mechanisms similar to browser 
privacy or security policies that allow consumers to ascertain the 
reputation of a site, author, or product.  Didn't we talk about this stuff 
on the list five or ten years ago?)

Does the speaker have a past history of exaggeration?  Of outright 
lying?  Of omitting any evidence that undercuts their position?  Of 
couching their argument in emotionally loaded language?  Of misrepresenting 
events or the remarks of others?  Do they provide verifiable sources for 
their assertions?  Is the argument internally consistent?  Do they have an 
agenda that calls their objectivity into question?  Do facts that you have 
high confidence in contradict or confirm their assertions?  What is the 
credibility of other people who support or oppose them?  And so on.  You 
cite some other aspects to consider in an earlier post.

(A key factor is the degree to which negative information is more 
influential than positive.  For example, how one betrayal of trust can take 
years to redeem.  How one unhappy customer can affect your business more 
than ten happy ones because the unhappy customer complains while the happy 
ones are usually happy in silence.  Does anyone have any theories as to why 
this is so?)

Anyway, in looking at this guy's book, I saw enough negative indicators to 
convince me that while there may be germs of truth in what he writes, it's 
not worth my time to find them.  For much the same reasons that while there 
may be useful insights and techniques in the teachings of Scientology, it's 
not worth wading through the nonsense when I can read Korzybski or Hayakawa.

I do not believe the Israelis or Zionists are lily-white.  I have said as 
much.  A few days ago, I acknowledged that Israel tortured Palestinian 
suspects.

(I'm still evolving my ethical stances.  For now, I believe in certain 
general principles but allow that circumstances may necessitate actions 
that would otherwise be wrong.  It is wrong to steal.  Is it wrong to steal 
bread from a warehouse to feed a starving child?  It is wrong to 
torture.  Is it wrong to torture someone to stop the explosion of a 20 MT 
nuclear device in London?)

Google had 200 matches for "Hidden History of Zionism."  None were from 
pro-Israel or ostensibly neutral sites.  None criticized the book at all, 
except for a couple reader comments on amazon.com.

Or suggest that thinking people have dismissed him as an inconsequential

That is not what I said. It's not that he refers to Chomsky; he 
doesn't.  People who have read both are claiming that rather than verifying 
source material himself, he copied Chomsky's assertions and 
references.  This is not strictly plagiarism; it is, however, intellectual 
dishonesty.

One of his threads in the book is arguing that the Zionists collaborated 
with the Nazis during WW II.  My counter-examples are pertinent to 
assessing the credibility of that assertion.

It's an established principle in legal proceedings that proving the untruth 
of one assertion by a witness undercuts the credibility of any other 
assertions that witness may make: "falsus in uno -- falsus in omnibus."  It 
can be abused, but it's a handy rule-of-thumb.

It shouldn't be hard to find.  I think I saw an example of false reasoning 
on most every page.

My comments to the list in my last email were not intended as any kind of

http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/ptech/04/24/segway.testing/index.html


ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Three Atlanta, Georgia, organizations are the
first to buy a fleet of Segways, electric one-person scooters that created a
buzz when unveiled in December.

The Georgia Power Co., Ambassador Force of Downtown Atlanta and Atlanta
Regional Commission are purchasing 10 Segways for about $9,000 each.

According to the Ambassador Force, a business-funded patrol that provides
tourist information and cleans city streets and sidewalks, its supervisors
will use Segways to get from place to place where their employees are
working. 

The Atlanta Regional Commission, a multi-county agency in charge of
transportation planning in the Atlanta region, will use its two Segways to
go back and forth to offices around the city and to tool around neighboring
towns. 

Georgia Power said it will use two Segways at its power plant sites and at
corporate facilities. It also will test whether employees who read electric
meters would benefit riding the scooter.
 
The Atlanta Police Department gives the Segway scooter a spin in downtown
Atlanta, Georgia. (April 24)

The fuel-efficient Segways run on two batteries. The electric chariots have
five gyroscopes that keep the units balanced and upright.

Most are programmed to have a top speed of 12 mph. Each can travel about 15
miles on a single charge, which requires plugging the battery into an outlet
for about six hours.

Segway representatives have said learning to ride one is easier than
mastering a bicycle.

Cops on wheels

Some critics have questioned whether Segways, which were designed for
sidewalks, should mingle with pedestrians or be limited to bike paths and
streets. It will also have to hold up along unforgiving roads. This may be
especially true in Atlanta where potholes sometimes go unfilled for several
months. 

The Georgia Legislature passed laws limiting Segway speeds to 7 mph on
sidewalks and 15 mph on roads, where riders will be required to wear a
helmet.

The Atlanta Police Department is putting six Segways through a two-month
test to determine how the department can best use them, for everything from
patrolling parks to zipping down aisles at Hartsfield International Airport.

New Hampshire entrepreneur and Segway inventor Dean Kamen has said the
scooters increase the distance a pedestrian can trek and fills a needed gap
between walking and driving a car.

Segways won't be available to consumers for another year. The average price
is expected to be about $4,000.

Word about the Segway -- known previously by the name "Ginger" or "It" --
leaked in January 2001.

Cancer Risk in Chips, French Fries, Bread - Study
Wed Apr 24,11:21 AM ET

By Peter Starck

http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=578&e=3&cid=578&u=/nm/20020424/ts_nm/health_food_cancer_dc_6

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (Reuters) - Basic foods eaten by millions around the world
such as bread, biscuits, chips and French fries contain alarmingly high
quantities of acrylamide, a substance believed to cause cancer, Swedish
scientists said Wednesday.

The research carried out at Stockholm University in cooperation with experts
at Sweden's National Food Administration, a government food safety agency,
showed that heating of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as potatoes, rice or
cereals formed acrylamide, a much-studied substance classified as a probable
human carcinogen.

The research was deemed so important that the scientists decided on the
unusual step of going public with their findings before the research had been
officially published in an academic journal.

"I have been in this field for 30 years and I have never seen anything like
this before," said Leif Busk, head of the food administration's research
department.

Findings unveiled at a news conference called by the food administration
showed that an ordinary bag of potato chips may contain up to 500 times more
of the substance than the top level allowed in drinking water by the World
Health Organization (news - web sites) (WHO).

French fries sold at Swedish franchises of U.S. fast-food chains Burger King
Corp. and McDonald's contained about 100 times the 1 microgram per liter
maximum permitted by the WHO for drinking water, the study showed.

One milligram, or 0.001 grams, contains 1,000 micrograms.

KNOWN HAZARD

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (news - web sites) classifies
acrylamide, a colorless, crystalline solid, as a medium hazard probable human
carcinogen.

According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, acrylamide
induces gene mutations and has been found in animal tests to cause benign and
malignant stomach tumors.

It is also known to cause damage to the central and peripheral nervous system.

"The discovery (news - web sites) that acrylamide is formed during the
preparation of food, and at high levels, is new knowledge. It may now be
possible to explain some of the cases of cancer caused by food," Busk said.

"Fried, oven-baked and deep-fried potato and cereal products may contain high
levels of acrylamide," the administration said.

"Acrylamide is formed during the preparation of food and occurs in many
foodstuffs ... Many of the analyzed foodstuffs are consumed in large
quantities, e.g. potato crisps (chips), french fries, fried potatoes, biscuits
and bread."

Among products analyzed in the study were potato chips made by Finnish company
CHIPS ABP, whose shares fell 14.5 percent to six-month lows, as well as
breakfast cereals made by U.S. Kellogg, Quaker Oats Co, part of PepsiCo Inc,
and Swiss Nestle, and Old El Paso brand tortilla chips.

"For us, these are completely new findings which have never before been known
to the world's foodstuffs industry," CHIPS ABP said in a statement to the
Helsinki stock exchange.

Stefan Eriksson, marketing manager Burger King's subsidiary in Sweden, told
Reuters by telephone: "We have received the information and we are evaluating
what it will mean."

Spokesmen for the other companies mentioned in the research were not
immediately available for comment.

NO PRODUCTS WITHDRAWN

Margareta Tornqvist, an associate professor at Stockholm University's
department of environmental chemistry, said the consumption of a single potato
chip could take acrylamide intake up to the WHO maximum for drinking water.

Busk said, however, that the product analysis based on more than 100 random
samples was not extensive enough for the administration to recommend the
withdrawal of any products from supermarket shelves.

"Frying at high temperatures or for a long time should be avoided," Busk said,
adding: "Our advice to eat less fat-rich products such as french fries and
crisps (chips), remains valid."

He said the findings applied worldwide, not only to Sweden, as the food raw
materials used in the analyzes had showed no traces of acrylamide.

Swedish authorities had informed the European Commission (news - web sites)
and EU member countries, Busk said.

"It is the first time we have come across such a result. We will evaluate this
study and look at it but it is important to say that Sweden has not withdrawn
any products from the market," said European Commission spokeswoman Beate
Gminder.

"Therefore we'll have to see what the scientific evaluation by our side and by
scientists in the member states will bring about," she said.

Liliane Abramsson-Zetterberg, a toxicologist at the Swedish food
administration, said: "The cancer risk from acrylamide is much higher than
(the levels) we accept for known carcinogens."

But smoking, which is known to cause cancer, remained a bigger risk, she said.

As Revolt Grows, Nepal Fears for Its Democracy


By CELIA W. DUGGER

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/24/international/asia/24NEPA.html

SATBARIYA, Nepal  The bodies of the Maoist rebels were still scattered across
parched lentil fields and behind a stand of sissau trees, almost a week after
thousands of their comrades swarmed a police garrison here on a moonless
night.

"When one Maoist was killed, another came forward," said Deepak Hamal, a young
policeman who survived the battle in mid-April. "They were there to kill or to
die."

Almost a hundred Maoists fell before the survivors overran the garrison, when
the constables ran out of ammunition. After the battle the rebels melted back
into the countryside.

The horror of the bodies  faces contorted in grimaces of death  has seeped
into life here, merging with a stain of violence that has spread over the last
year in this tiny Hindu kingdom encircled by India and China.

A spindly boy in rags wandering across the fields said he was afraid that the
ghosts of the dead would return to haunt him. He could have been speaking for
all of Nepal. Last June the crown prince massacred his father and mother, the
king and queen, and most of the royal family in a fusillade of gunfire.

In recent months the Maoist rebellion, inspired by the Shining Path guerrillas
of Peru and led by two college-educated, upper caste Brahmins, has spiraled in
intensity in this nation of stark poverty and beauty, where the snowy
Himalayas tower majestically over pitiful scenes of hunger and want.

The rebels carried out surprise attacks in late November in many of the
country's 75 districts, bringing a shocking end to a four-month cease-fire and
three rounds of peace talks. They also went after the army for the first time,
drawing it into the conflict.

The killing has intensified ever since. The police estimate that 3,600 people
have died since the Maoists declared a "people's war" in February 1996.

Half of those deaths have been in the four and a half months since a state of
emergency was declared, suspending civil liberties in this young democracy,
just 12 years into its incarnation as a constitutional monarchy.

The 50-000-member Royal Nepal Army, a largely ceremonial force that
occasionally took part in United Nations peacekeeping missions, joined the
battle against the Maoists on Nov. 26. The widespread hope in Katmandu that
the army would quickly crush the rebellion has proved empty.

The ruthless tactics used by both the rebels and the security forces have
become more widespread, say victims and human rights researchers.

Amnesty International and Nepalese human rights groups have documented what
they call a pattern of abuses by security forces that include the execution
and torture of people suspected of being Maoists.

The rights groups accuse the Maoists of gruesome violations as well, including
executions of dozens of schoolteachers who refused to submit to extortion
demands and the torture and murder of suspected informants and political
opponents with large, curved knives.

Resham Prasad Panta, 52, a poor farmer who lives a four-hour trek from the
nearest road in the Gorka district, said Maoists dragged him from his dinner
one recent night, accused him of being an informer and shattered his shin with
a large boulder. More Maoists then brutally beat his frail, underfed wife,
Sita, 48. Both lay in a hospital here.

"We are simple people," said Mrs. Panta, tears streaming down her face. "We
have nothing for or against anyone. Both sides pressure us. The Maoists say
you must be informing the police. The police say you must be sheltering the
Maoists. We are squeezed."

The Maoist influence has spread to most areas of the country, with deaths
related to the insurgency in 60 of the 75 districts. Last year the Maoists set
up "people's government's" in 22 districts.

When the Nepalese won their long struggle for democracy in 1990, the Maoists
were in the mainstream, part of a Communist alliance with a small number of
parliamentary seats. But in 1994 the election commission barred the alliance
from taking part, an act the courts later ruled illegal. Maoist leaders were
brutally beaten by the police.

In 1995, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai formed the Communist Party
of Nepal (Maoist), and the next year it issued 40 demands, including abolition
of the monarchy, radical land reform and a raft of policies that it said would
liberate the people.

When the Maoists did not get their way, they went to war.

The two leaders are believed by the government to be living underground in
India. The group has financed itself by robbing banks and extorting money from
landlords, teachers and business people. Members have armed themselves by
looting automatic rifles and rocket launchers, among other weapons, from
security forces.

Estimates of the number of rebel fighters range from 2,000 to 10,000, but they
seem to be getting bolder, even as their casualties mount. They have begun
attacking the few gains that Nepal's young democracy can claim: clean drinking
water supply systems, village government offices, and small roads and bridges
that connect remote areas to larger towns.

In February and again in April they mustered thousands of guerrillas for
attacks that caught the security forces completely off guard. At 10:30 p.m. on
April 11 they simultaneously assaulted five police and security posts in the
western Dang district, striking along the country's main east-west highway.

They prevented reinforcements from reaching any of the posts by felling huge
trees to block the roads.

"We had dismissed these guys as a bunch of clowns," said a senior Western
diplomat based here. "They weren't. They're dedicated, calloused and clever."

[A general strike ordered by the rebels shut down much of Nepal on Tuesday,
even in Katmandu. Despite a heavy security presence, Katmandu residents said
they feared rebel retribution if they did not go along.]

Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba acknowledged in an interview that the rebel
attacks in Dang were a setback and sketched out a largely military strategy to
defeat them. He said that as long as the Maoists used violence, it would be
difficult to pursue programs to combat endemic poverty.

"Unless there is peace, how can you introduce social development?" he said.
But many here, including some who are close to the king and in the military,
fear that further neglect of Nepal's poor will only help the Maoists.

There is another danger facing Nepal that is rarely spoken of openly: the risk
that the new king, Gyanendra, backed by the military, will topple democracy as
King Mahendra did in 1960.

There have been some ominous signs. In March the army chief of staff, Gen.
Prajwalla Shumsher Rana, made a scathing attack on politicians, blaming them
for bringing Nepal to near ruin.

Prabhakar Rana, another member of the powerful Rana clan who is close to the
royal family and serves as a director of its holding company, has said in
interviews that there may be a coup.

"Those who practice democracy have failed," he said. "They must pull up their
socks and mend their ways." If they don't, he said, "the army could take over
and ask the king to rule, or the army could just take over."

Asked about such a possibility, the prime minister diplomatically said he
believed that the king was committed to democracy. But Mr. Deuba, who spent
more than nine years in prison during the movement for democracy, also issued
a warning of sorts. He said that if there was a coup, the king would be
risking his crown. "Everybody would be against him," Mr. Deuba said.

In Katmandu, scholars, journalists and politicians gossip endlessly about
palace intrigue and politics. But young policemen earning $40 a month are
doing most of the dying on the government's behalf, and poor people in the
countryside are living with the daily terror.

Here in Satbariya, villagers who hid their weeping children under beds as the
battle between the Maoists and the Armed Police Force raged, still fear that
the Maoists will return.

Jokhan Prasad Chaudhari, patriarch of a large family and owner of a tiny plot
of land, predicted only more hardship. "It will not end," he said. "Many more
will die."

Your points are good, but I think they (to a great extent)
misunderstood my question.  I think the question you were answering
was: "Should I promote my *own* likelihood of survival, or should I
try to bring about the Singularity?"

But I'm not 100% confident that *either* goal is attainable w/in my
lifetime, or, for that matter, at all.  If I could assume that human
civilization would continue for an arbitrarily long amount of time,
I'd be more confident that the Singularity would happen *someday*;
that *some* generation of human beings will survive.  But I'm not sure
I can even count on that.

What I'm responding to is the widespread notion that, since the
Singularity is a fantastical notion and immortality research is
nothing more than a pipe dream in a vacuum, I should plan my life as
if I'm going to die.  That means, in part, that I should try to create
meaning in the brief few decades available to me; make sure that I'm
adequately happy now (because I won't be able to postpone my
satisfaction for even 120 years) and make life better for people I
care about in other less lofty ways.

In fact, I think I can suggest a plausible reason as to why the
selfish-split is such a natural notion for ordinary people with a
dayplanner: reaching a large selfish-split is basically rational
behavior for people who believe that every human generation will die.

First, notice that even a person who believes that they should be
purely altruistic will only reduce their own personal satisfaction to
the point where their altruistic productivity is maximal; miserable
people, overworked people, and people with no hope of personal gain
tend not to accomplish as much as those who are basically happy and/or
hopeful about their own well-being, all else being equal.

Second, suppose [as I've read, but don't have data right this second,
but ask me later] that one's hopes/expectations for the future are the
among the most significant corelatives with *present* personal
satisfaction.  Suppose that this relationship is causal; I doubt that
this can be proved (since present happiness probably also influences
us to be optimistic), but it seems plausible to me.

That means that altruistic people who think they can make it to
Singularity, who think they can, therefore, postpone their personal
satisfaction until after Singularity, will tend to be considerably
happier *now* (all else being equal) than people who think that every
generation of humans will eventually die, because Singularitarians
have very high expectations for their future and the future of those
they care about.

But saying that Singularitarians would be happier now *all else being
equal* implies that one of the factors being kept equal would be work
spent on present personal satisfaction.  That means that altruistic
Singularitarians can take fewer actions towards their own current
personal satisfaction than altruistic fatalists *and be just as
happy*.

That suggests to me that Singularitarians, all else being equal,
should be able to trade off more present personal satisfaction than
fatalists and still be at their own maximum altruistic productivity.

Note: Although altruistic Singularitarians wouldn't need to work as
much to promote their own present happiness, they would still have to
work some; I'd expect they'd still have to work pretty hard on their
own self-interest to maintain their highest levels of productivity
[when compared with, say, an AI].

You might see this as a convincing argument as to why you should be a
Singularitarian; I think this overlooks something important, however.
If the Singularitarian is wrong, and the fatalist is correct, then the
Singularitarians are very productively spinning their own wheels:
they'll work very hard, harder than analogous fatalists would have
worked, but none of the work that Singularitarians will have done will
actually have accomplished anything good for themselves or anyone
else.

Furthermore, as they spent all their time imagining that they could
postpone their own happiness to later, their lives will have been
qualitatively less happy, less fulfilled, and less worthwhile.

[Think how frustrating it would be to know that you've spent all that
time working on CATAI and now GISAI/CFAI, only to learn that in 2003
human civilization and all your work would be destroyed in nuclear
war.]

Also note that we should expect our basic evolutionary strategies to
be fatalistic; fatalism has been basically correct for the entire
history of life on Earth, so planning like a fatalist probably tended
to work out best for our ancestors.  Of course, the productivity gain
I mentioned above adds yet another evolutionary pressure for
double-think: our ancestors who thought that they'd be very well-off,
but planned like they wouldn't, probably tended to be better off.

That brings me back to my original question, which you may now
understand better: do I stand a good chance of influencing the
Singularity, or a slim chance?  If I stand a slim chance of affecting
the probability or safety of the Singularity, then I should plan my
life like a fatalist: if Singularity happens, great, but if not, I've
planned ahead.  If I DO stand a good chance of influencing the
Singularity, then I should plan my life in a radically different way.
(Of course, at the end of the day, there are degrees, and I'll
probably be adopting some fraction of both strategies, but I still
think it's worth asking whether I need to be mostly fatalist, mostly
optimistic-Singularitarian, or something else entirely.)

So I keep on wondering: which is it?  Will I personally matter a lot?
Or a little?

HARRY AND LOUISE RETURN, OPPOSING THE BAN ON CLONING
Worrywart Couple Who Helped Scuttle Clinton Health Plan Question Bush
Policy in New Ad

by Laurie McGinley

Harry and Louise are back.

The fictional couple starred almost 10 years ago in television
commercials that helped torpedo President Clinton's health-care
overhaul plan.  Now the same actors playing the same characters have
taken aim at President Bush's effort to ban all forms of human
cloning.

The new Harry-and-Louise campaign will make its debut in the
Washington area on tonight's episode of "The West Wing," on NBC-TV and
later will be shown in the home states of several key lawmakers.  The
ads are sponsored by CuresNow, a nonprofit group recently founded by
entertainment-industry executives, led by some who have children with
juvenile diabetes.  The Hollywood executives say cloning technology
offers their children the best chance of a cure.

--------------------------------------------------------
Side bar: THE CLONE WARS

Excerpts from Harry and Louise's dialogue in a new ad in favor of
cloning research:

LOUISE: One bill puts scientists in jail for working to cure our
niece's diabetes.

HARRY: So... cure cancer, go to jail?

LOUISE:  Alzheimer's, heart disease.  Take your pick.

HARRY: Is it cloning?

LOUISE: Nooo... uses an unfertilized egg and a skin cell.

HARRY: So, not making babies?

LOUISE: Just lifesaving cures.

--------------------------------------------------------

The commercials were written by Goddard Clausen Porter Novelli, the
same public-affairs company that created the original $20 million
Harry-and-Louise campaign, in the fall of 1993.  In those ads,
sponsored by the Health Insurance Association of America, Harry and
Louise express vague but intense fears about government involvement in
health care.  The ads proved highly controversial: Democrats blasted
them as distortions and Republications praised them as insightful.

The new ads are hitting the airwaves as a showdown vote looms in the
Senate.  Sens. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, and Mary Landrieu,
a Louisiana Democrat, are pushing a bill that would prohibit human
cloning either to produce a child or to conduct research and treat
disease.  Similar legislation already has passed the House.

Backers of the Brownback bill include conservative organizations,
religious groups, antiabortion organizations and a few environmental
and women's groups.  Opposition to the Brownback bill is being led by
the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, which includes
researchers, patients' groups and the biotechnology industry.
CuresNow is a member of CAMR.

With the Senate expected to debate cloning before the Memorial Day
recess, both sides are revving up their advertising and lobbying
efforts.  The National Right to Life Committee and its state
affiliates recently launched radio ads in eight states in support of
the Brownback bill.  In those ads, a man and a woman chat about
cloning, then the woman exclaims: "Can't they see that it's just not
right to make human embryos and harvest them like crops?"  Stop Human
Cloning, a group headed by the editor of the conservative Weekly
Standard, William Kristol,  also recently ran radio and television ads
backing the Brownback bill.

Members of the entertainment industry, such as celebrities Christopher
Reeve, paralyzed in a riding accident, and Michael J. Fox, who suffers
from Parkinson's disease, have taken part in biomedical debates for
some time.  But CuresNow, which stand for Citizens United for Research
in Science and Ethics Now, [DF: Isn't that CURSE Now?] represents a
ratcheting up of activity.  The group was loosely organized last fall,
then renamed and relaunched in early March, with a volunteer executive
director.

The founding members are Douglas Wick, producer of "Gladiator"; his
wife, Lucy Fisher, former vice chairman of the Columbia Tri-Star
Motion Picture Group at Sony Pictures; Jerry Zucker, director of
"Ghost" and "Airplane," and his wife, Janet Zucker, producer of "Rat
Race" and "First Knight."  Both couples have children with juvenile
diabetes.

This past Friday, the Zuckers held a fundraiser at their Los Angeles
home both for the anti-Brownback campaign and for general support of
medical research.  More than 100 people attended, including filmmaker
Barry Levinson, Paramount Chairman Sherry Lassing, and actors Warren
Beatty, Annette Benning and Cuba Gooding Jr.   Attendees heard
presentations fro four prominent scientists who support research
cloning.  CuresNow has raised about $500,000 already and receive
pledges of more donations.  Still in its infancy, the group aims to
keep its membership small while making use of its abundant resources
and influence

"We can't let a narrow group of people make the decision for my child
and for the entire country," Mr. Zucker says.

As the cloning battle escalates, both sides are choosing their words
to sway the undecided.  The new Harry and Louise ads go to great pains
to distinguish research cloning from reproductive cloning.

In the basic cloning procedure, embryos are made by inserting a cell
from an adult into an unfertilized egg.  The resulting embryo,
genetically identical to the cell donor, could yield stem cells useful
in treating disease such as juvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's scientists say.  However, if the embryo were transferred
into a woman's uterus, it could develop into a cloned individual.

Wary of negative public perceptions about cloning, proponents are
struggling with the term.  In one of the ads, Louise says the
technology isn't cloning at all; its simply inserting an adult skin
cell into an unfertilized egg.  In fact, she is describing what is
commonly known as "therapeutic cloning," or cloning for treatments or
research.

"They don't want to say cloning and the don't want to say human
embryo," says Mary Cannon, executive director of Stop Human Cloning,
who hasn't see n the ads.  "They try to obfuscate the language."

The ads also play down that it could take years for cloning-based
therapies to be developed.  In a second commercial, Louise describes
and early-stage lab technique to her niece as a "cure" for her
diabetes.

Ben Goddard, who wrote the scripts and co-directed the spots with
Mr. Zucker, says the ads make clear the group backs research, not
reproductive cloning.

The stark differences of conviction on the issue suggest a legislative
stalemate is highly likely.  Whatever happens in Congress, both sides
say they will raise the issue in the November elections.

More info on acrylamide.

http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/htdocs/8_RoC/RAC/Acrylamide.html

Maybe fat as an indicator for colon cancer has been getting a bad rap.

I believe deep fat fryers and modern convection (high throughput
industrial cookie, biscuit and bread baking) ovens can deliver very high
temperatures when compared to say the temperature in a rice steamer/
cooker or a slow cooker/ crock pot or a solar hot box cooker for that matter. 

If anyone gets information about the temperatures at which these
transformations occur please post.

It seems that we are being placated with a poor analogy here in that we
all need to eat carbs to survive while smoking is certainly not essential
to survival.

Well, from an altruistic perspective, I don't think that the absolute
confidence matters.  What matters is not whether a Singularity is 95% likely
or 5% likely, but whether your personal efforts can bump that up to 95.001%
or 5.001%.  From an altruistic perspective this is still playing for stakes
overwhelmingly higher than your own life; 0.001% ~ 60,000 lives.  (1 day ~
150,000 lives.)

If you believe that the Singularity is a fantastical notion and immortality
research is a pipe dream, and if you furthermore believe that (a) no
existential risks exist, (b) you cannot influence existential risks, or (c)
you discount all lives except those that presently exist, then you should
plan your life for yourself and the people around you.  But if you believe
that the Singularity is *real* but *threatened*, you should try to rescue
it.

This question mixes the issues of Singularity and leverage.  You might work
toward a Singularity because you believe that you have enough leverage on
the Singularity to be worth more than your local contribution to world
happiness.  Or you might work toward a Singularity because you are striving
to protect humanity's vast future, containing (*)illions of sentient beings,
in which case your one-six-billionth portion of this enormous future is
worth far more than your local contribution to immediate world happiness.

They must also believe that there is no unique critical point, coming up in
the immediate future, that must be handled to permit the existence of future
generations.

Well, as a Friendly AI thinker, I do care about the integrity of my altruism
and not just my total altruistic output - I need the maximum possible amount
of data on what altruistic integrity looks like.  So I would not compromise
cognitive altruism to increase productivity.  This also reflects the belief,
on my part, that you can get farther by continuing without compromising than
by taking the short-term benefits of compromising at any given point; the
compromise may provide an easy way to move forward temporarily but it blocks
further progress.

In practice, this means that I try to minimize my attachment to personal
gain.  I try to, whenever I imagine a conflict of interest, imagine myself
doing the altruistic thing.  It doesn't matter whether this hurts
productivity; it's necessary to maintain cognitive integrity.

I try not to overwork myself, and maybe I try too hard and don't get as much
work done as I could, but I prefer to err on the side of caution.

I don't think I'm immediately miserable, and I certainly don't try to make
myself miserable, but I also pass up on certain kinds of happiness - forms
of fun that I think involve unnecessary risk or consume more in time than
they pay back in energy.

I think that other people can and should sculpt themselves into thinking
like this, but I wouldn't want people to burn themselves out trying to do it
too fast.  (Under a year is probably too fast.)

I'm not sure this is factually correct, and in any case it strikes me as a
profoundly wrong reason to be a Singularitarian.  Maybe religious people are
genuinely more happy than Extropians.  But I'm not going to start wearing a
cross; I believe that, in doing so, in giving up my rational integrity for
short-term happiness, I would be sacrificing my potential as a human being -
including my potential to accomplish good.

I realize this and I accept it as a possibility.  I will not resculpt my
entire life, and sacrifice my entire potential to make a difference, simply
to avoid living in a world where there is the *possibility* of frustration. 
I think we should confront "unbearable" thoughts openly, so that the
instinctive flinch doesn't come to control our actions.  How bad is this
possibility, really?  Is it as bad as seeing the flash from a nuclear
fireball and waiting for the blast to hit, or watching a moss of goo
starting to grow inside your home?

Not as much as you might think.  I may not have a girlfriend, but the people
who don't pass on that part of life may be missing out on other things;
missing out on the chance to know that their own life is significant,
missing out on the chance to understand their own minds, missing out on the
chance to build an AI.  Nobody gets to be a complete human being this side
of the Singularity.

But that's beside the point.  I probably do contribute less immediate local
happiness to the universe than I would if I lived my life a bit
differently.  Those are the stakes I ante to the table because I think it's
a good bet.

> [Think how frustrating it would be to know that you've spent all that

If I learned that human civilization and all my work was to be destroyed in
nuclear war in 2003, I would drop absolutely everything else and try to stop
it.  It wouldn't matter who told me that it was inevitable.  Whatever tiny
mistrust I placed on the verdict of inevitability would be enough to direct
my actions.

And if Earth were still destroyed, I would regret my failure, but I would
not regret having tried.

Sometimes, when I'm trying to make people see things from a different
perspective, I point out that not getting married for 10-20 years really
isn't all that much of a sacrifice if you expect this to be an infinitesimal
fraction of your lifespan.  But that really has nothing to do with it.  If I
were told by an infallible prophet that, having succeeded in creating a
Friendly seed AI and nurturing it to hard takeoff, I would be run over a
truck and my brain mashed beyond retrieval thirty minutes before the
Introdus wavefront arrived, I should hope that I would live my life in
exactly the same way.  For that matter, if I had handed matters off to a
Friendly SI in the midst of creating nanotechnology, after the Singularity
was irrevocably set in motion but before the Introdus wavefront as such, and
I had the chance to sacrifice my life to save three kids from getting run
over by a bus, then I hope that I would do it.  "Hope," because while I can
visualize myself doing it, and I can even visualize having no regrets, the
visualization is difficult enough that I can't be sure in advance of the
acid test.

Maybe thinking like that decreases my productivity in the here-and-now, but
I think it's more important *to the Singularity* for me to try and get this
modified primate brain to support altruism than for me to try and squeeze
the maximum possible amount of work out of it in the short term.  Maybe
that's just an excuse that shows that I am still thinking selfishly despite
everything, and that I value a certain kind of moral comfort more than I
value Earth.  There is always that uncertainty.  But in the end I would
distrust the compromise more.

*After* the Singularity, when opportunities for major altruism are
comparatively rare because there won't be as many major threats, then I
expect that your happiness and the happiness of your immediate companion
network will be the flower that most needs tending.  Today the flower that
most needs tending is the Singularity.

I don't see many differences in the actions I think make sense at
this time if I will live a billion years or only ninty.  I don't see much
difference in what I would do if my contributions to life extension
are large or small.  I don't see much difference between selfish
and altruistic motivations.  In all of these cases living long and well
is a key goal and my task is to figure out what it takes to survive
increase my knowledge, improve my capability and enjoy myself.

In a few books I have read on happiness, absorbing work you
consider worthwhile is one of the most enjoyable ways to spend
your time.  That matches my personal experience and what I hear
from friends.  Health and happiness are also interrelated.  Good
relationships contribute to happiness and productivity.  Many of
the things that lead to personal effectiveness and enjoyment also
put you in the position to help others.  Whether or not my contributions
turn out to be significant I enjoy spending my time working on the
things I think are most important.

>From my perspective recreation is not more fun than work but rather
a change of pace.  Rest and play are valuable but as much for the
increases in productivity as for their own sake.  I often derive as much
or more pleasure from practical expenditures or investments as from
frivolous purchases.  Most of the hedonism that tempts me is very short
lived.  Looking over the grand perspective of several weeks I usually
find the decisions are the same as I would make over the perspective
of decades.  I find almost no differences between what seems wise over
decades and what seems wise over millennia.

Regarding finances in particular, compound interest is a big deal.  The
more you can invest (in businesses, other people, your own improvement,
etc.) and the sooner you invest it the better.  Try to avoid being picky or
feeling deprived, etc. but always think of the way you spend your time and
money as an investment, until you believe you have more time and money
than you have any use for, and you probably will not go wrong.  Balance,
not letting any key resource fall to low, etc.

Your situation and assumptions may be different but try making plans given
different base assumptions and see if the behaviors you think make sense
vary much.  If they don't then which assumptions you use are less important.
I do think there are unknowns which make a big difference, and I do think it
is possible to do some wasteful things with ones life but if you optimize
for all
the scenarios you think likely you may find common solutions.

I am pleased to announce that the Journal of Evolution and Technology has
just published an article by Robert A. Freitas Jr. and Christopher J.
Phoenix entitled, "Vasculoid: A Personal Nanomedical Appliance to Replace
Human Blood." I have included the abstract and link below. I would like to
remind everyone that the Journal and our new enzine "Transhumanity"
(www.transhumanism.com) are always looking for quality submissions.



ABSTRACT


"Vasculoid: A Personal Nanomedical Appliance to Replace Human Blood"

The vasculoid is a single, complex, multisegmented nanotechnological medical
robotic system capable of duplicating all essential thermal and biochemical
transport functions of the blood, including circulation of respiratory
gases, glucose, hormones, cytokines, waste products, and cellular
components.  This nanorobotic system, a very aggressive and physiologically
intrusive macroscale nanomedical device comprised of ~500 trillion stored or
active individual nanorobots, weighs ~2 kg and consumes from 30-200 watts of
power in the basic human model, depending on activity level.  The vasculoid
system conforms to the shape of existing blood vessels and serves as a
complete replacement for natural blood.  This paper presents a preliminary
theoretical scaling analysis including transport capacity, thermal
conduction, control and biocompatibility considerations, along with a
hypothetical installation scenario and a description of some useful optional
equipment.  A discussion of repair procedures and various applications of
the personal vasculoid appliance is deferred to subsequent papers.

...?  It's a money forwarding service.  Stuff like that's been available
for years - centuries, even (Western Union, for one).

Now, if you could move material goods around as easily as money (I don't
mean the paper notes, but money itself - which can be transmitted
electronically), then you'd have something.  But this isn't it.

Interesting... Sperling looks like the ultimate cryonics proponent:
wealthy, willing to fund unpopular ideas, interested in longevity. Is
he involved in cryonics? Signed up?

There'd be chagrin (not to mention heart-breaking grief), but this account
misses the point: you derive satisfaction *in the moment* by working on
what you regard *then and there* as meaningful. 

Working for 20 years as a junk bond salesman or phone sex worker might not
have much intrinsic satisfaction, but working on a project you believe has
great import gives you pleasure and ontological security *as you do it*. 

Writing a novel or a theoretical tome is both painful and pleasurable, and
the pleasure is increased if you can sell the damned thing at the end and
make a modest crust out of the sale, and increased again if a few people
enjoy reading it (and decreased somewhat if it's disparaged), but the core
reason you do it is for the daily buzz. That's why Salinger could sit there
writing every day and then lock his books away in a bank vault. 

What would be a more enthralling and satisfying way for Eliezer to spend
his time than thinking out and notating CATAI et al? Teaching math in a
university? Working on nuclear missile systems? At least with the latter he
wouldn't feel retrospectively redundant when the nuclear war occurs in
2003. :)

I think *that* misses the point; the satisfaction *helps* you do the work
but is not the *object* of the work.  The object of philanthropy is not to
feel good about helping people but to actually help people - as many people
as possible, to the largest degree possible, at the highest possible
probability of success, given the available resources to invest.

At times like these, I like to quote one Zen definition of altruism:

"Altruistic behavior:  An act done without any intent for personal gain in
any form. Altruism requires that there is no want for material, physical,
spiritual, or egoistic gain."

If altruism wasn't one of J R Molloy's useless hypotheses, it should
have been. All motivation is ultimately selfish. Caring more about the
welfare of others is irrational, if not insane.

So your motivation is maintaining your cognitive integrity, not being
altruistic.

Avoiding unnecessary risk is selfish, as is avoiding time-wasting
activities.

Right, a burnt-out altruist is an ineffective altruist. So you have to
take of yourself in order to be able to help others.

Which compromise?

Replace Singularity with Second Coming and you sound like a Christian
zealot. As is, you sound like singularity zealot. I'm sure you're
convinced--as all zealots are--that your cause is worthy of zealotry,
but I just don't think it's healthy for either the cause or the
zealot. Most people--even those dropping like flies today--are happy
with the way things are. If they get dramatically better some day,
then that's great, but they don't really want you sacrificing your
live to save them.

And I don't relish the thought of a singularity brought on by an AI
created by someone so caught up in the effort that he never got around
to experiencing the joys of life. Quality of life matters more to me
than quantity. I'd rather see more organic progress toward the
singularity that incorporates a broader perspective of the life
experience.

Thanks or taking the time to type that in, Dan.  It's amazing to see this
collision between a futuristic technology like therapeutic cloning and
these actors, who personify shallow argumentation.  Here we are on the
threshold of advances that will redefine the human species and perhaps
even the meaning of reality itself.  Ahead lie challenges fit to stump the
greatest philosophers in history.  And what do we get?  Harry and Louise.

Even more ironic, Harry and Louise are on the side that is promoting the
new technology.  These people, who represent the lowest common denominator
of the American public, are shown complaining about scientists being
put in jail who are trying to save our lives.

What's next, Harry and Louise on uploading?  On the Singularity?
Presumably by then we'll have computerized Harry and Louise avatars,
available for sale to the highest bidders to take whatever side they
are being paid to represent.

It's discouraging, but probably realistic, to see that the difficult
challenges ahead will be met by public argumentation at this level
of shallow sloganeering and sound byte politics.  The news program in
Robocop had the prescient slogan, "you give us 22 seconds, we'll give
you the world."  Harry and Louise fit right into this world.

Harry and Louise are great to represent promising future technologies
like therapeutic cloning.  It doesn't require sophisticated philosophy
or deep knowledge of biology or economics to realize theurapeutic cloning
involves no significant ethical hazards and has great potential.  Basic
common sense.  It IS just about an egg and a skin cell.  Same ethical
concerns as menstruating and taking a shower.  That's all that needs to be 
said.

Yeah, yeah; the object of sex, then, is to make babies and bond the
community. The object of eating is to promote metabolism. The object of
climbing a mountain is because it's there. Whatever. I'm arguing that the
satisfaction of work is in its meaningfulness *as you do it*, not in
waiting until later to find out whether the consequences turned out the way
you hoped. Obviously part of that real-time satisfaction lies in your
anticipation of certain consequences.

If you were really a selfish rationalist, you would cleverly remain silent
and let altruistic memes propagate, thus maximizing the number of people
working to your benefit.  You certainly would not feel the need to argue the
morality of selfishness in public forums.  Say what you like about rational
selfishness; it can't consistently propagate itself as a meme.

No, cognitive integrity is more important than short-term productivity
because huge efforts create only the illusion of accomplishment unless they
are the *right* efforts.  Cognitive integrity can still be a means to an
end, but it is the part of you that determines what you *think* your ends
are, so compromising it risks everything.

Avoiding unnecessary risk to the self is a convergent subgoal of altruism
and selfishness.  This is the only body and mind which I control, so risking
them risks my entire potential effect on the future.

Right, but "take care of yourself" as a subgoal of helping others is
differently shaped from "take care of yourself" as an end in itself.  For
example, I cannot afford to take care of myself in ways that threaten to
block my ability to help others.

You live in a free country built by people who were willing to die for
freedom and often did.  People can be dedicated to good causes or bad causes
- it depends on your cognitive integrity, among other things.  That some
dedicated people are dedicated to evil causes does not make dedication, in
itself, wrong.

If 90% of them want me to butt out, which I doubt, then the 10% who remain
are still clientele enough for me - not to mention the (*)illions of
sentients who will follow them.

Like I said: different people, different joys, and nobody gets to be a
complete human being this side of the Singularity.

Because some of the biological beings are sentient and ethics is 
not as arbitrary as some may think?  If the bio-beings don't 
wish to upload then why is it likely the SI would upload them 
regardless?  The only remotely ethical reason I can see is that 
they may otherwise be irretrievably lost and not be able to 
develop further.  Even from purely "economical" grounds it is 
not at all obvious that the SI will really need the biosphere 
convereted to something else to accomplish its purposes.

Perhaps I'm biased, and simply very pleased to see those allegedly persuasive 
spokespeople on the side of liberty and science, but I don't quite see any 
grounds for complaint about the advent of the proposed ads.  We do not lack 
alternative, more sophisticated discussions, pro and con, on legalizing 
cloning.  These allegedly low-brow commercials will not displace or prevent 
more careful analyses.  They merely add one more viewpoint in what we should 
celebrate as a wide-ranging, diverse, and passionate public debate.

Anyhow, get used to it.  As the sorts of things that we have so long 
discussed in lofty and dignified tones (snort!) increasingly come into the 
public eye, they will suffer splattering by the public mud.

If you come across a madman who will destroy himself and others 
if not treated and he is too mad to agree to treatment then what 
choice do you have but to treat him, kill him, or keep him from 
harming self and others?  Let nature take its course?  Would 
that actually be best?

Suppose a benevolent or moderately compassionate SI sees that 
many humans are so mad that they will not agree to a cure and 
cannot as that would change their self-ness more than they could 
bear and that they are bent on destroying one another utterly 
sufficiently than even the relatively non-mad will also be 
destroyed.  What should the AI do if it does not wish to see 
humanity destroy itself and would prefer all the individuals had 
time and space enough to simply grow out of the madness or be 
slowly led out?   I would not be surprised at all if such an SI 
at least kept up to the fraction of a second scans of the 
individuals from which they could be reintroduced in perhaps 
different circumstances if calamity struck them.  It might be 
that this is more straightforward to do well in a Sim.  The 
difference between a Sim and "reality" would hardly matter a lot 
anyway if the SI has as much control over space-time as many 
believe it might.

Everyone can evolve into an Aristoi who really wants to, given 
enough time and just a bit of safety-net in some crucial spots. 
  Many might decide to do something different and even more 
interesting.

Life is most certainly not meaningless except to philosophers 
too hooked on absolutism and to confounded by relativity to see 
the direction of their own deepest desires and the possibility 
of fulfilling them.  There is no reason to believe life in a Sim 
would have any less freedom or possibility of fulfillment.  It 
is actually possible there is lot more of both.

This has the built-in assumption that endless-growth is such a 
strong and mandatory drive that all else is subservient.  I 
don't think this is a given.  A serious disadvantage relative to 
what?  There are no other SIs in the neighborhood we can detect 
and it is not a given that they could think of nothing better 
than endlessly competing with one anothr throughout space-time.

Precisely why should it be that hungry or that hungry that 
quickly?  Cancerous levels of growth until all resources are 
consumed are simply not the only viable models of Singularity

Well, you can't count on it.  But if you so choose, you can do 
what is possible for you to do to make it a reality sooner if it 
is possible at all.  Unless one believes that Singularity is 
inevitable even without effort, Singularity depends on enough 
people so choosing.

If you can in fact be truly happy and satisfied with only that, 
then go for it!  I and most here do not find it satisfying at 
all and cannot find true happiness in so limited a view.

Great.  So how do we become more than human?  What is the use of 
selfish striving for momentary pleaures only to see it all 
irrevocably crumble to dust for yourself, for all of those you 
know and for all your children generation after generation as 
long as humanity exists?  There is no happiness in such a hard 
limit.  There is only the fake happiness of temporarily 
pretending that it does not exist or forgetting this knowledge.

A fully altruistic person would take care of themselves as they 
will not be of maximal benefit otherwise.  No?  There is nothing 
wrong with enjoying oneself.  Nothing at all.  The question is 
what one finds truly enjoyable and leading to maximal happiness 
and well-being.  I don't believe that most people ultimately 
find that that ends at their own skin or at the boundaries of 
their family and friends under a belief of ultimately complete 
annihilation in a time-period only very modestly under their 
control even potentially.

It is certainly empowering to believe that one can make some 
real difference and that more is possible than a life relatively 
brutish and short for not only oneself but everyone forever.

Working for Singularity and other positive improvements is not 
about postpoing one's satisfaction in the least.  This sort of 
work *is* one's satisfaction!  What could be more satisfying 
than helping change the state and destiny of humankind for the 
better?  Seen in the proper light, this is pure joy.

People are generally happier when they see that what they do and 
how they be actually can make a real difference.

I don't see that your suggestion holds or that the personal is 
necessarily separate from that which makes a difference for all 
of us.  I find I am much healthier to the extent that taking 
care of myself and what I personally need blends more thoroughly 
  with making a difference for all of us.  As one of "us" I 
don't have to choose between "me" and "others" in the classical 
Western ethical conundrum.

I don't believe that true fatalist can be truly happy.  Because 
true fatalism would lead to the notion that nothing matters or 
makes any real difference at all.  It runs straight into nihilism.

Productivity is not a free-floating goal.  Happiness and 
self-interest aren't free-floating either.  Sometimes we get in 
trouble because we chop the continuity of our lives, our being 
and becoming, up into seemingly discrete word/concepts.  The 
reality is not so discrete or divisible.

Effective life as measured in true happiness and well-being is 
the "goal".  It is not necessarily a contest between that for 
oneself or for oneself in the present moment and for all of us 
and for the future.  Moment by moment we seek to live fully 
individually and collectively, now and in the creation of our 
future.  The fences of our words can get in the way of the being 
and doing.

Why?  Why would fully engaging in life including fully engaging 
in the expansion of life and its possibilities be something you 
would ever regret?  How could you feel fully alive without this?

Hardly.  The fatalists did not dream of greater possibilities or 
work to make them realities. Fatalism is literally doom.

No, you haven't "planned ahead".  You have talked yourself into 
the notion that you don't need to do anything to make the future 
you desire more likely because you reason that believing there 
is no better future and that you really can't make one will 
actually make you happier.  This looks to me like a tremendous 
rationalized psychic knot that cannot help but drain you of 
happiness and effectiveness if you truly follow its implications.

You will matter however much you matter and however much you 
realize what it matters and what it means to matter. (say that 
ten times fast)

One of the things that seems to get in the way of many of us at 
least some of the time is being so busy "looking in the 
rear-view mirror" at how we are doing or appear to be doing that 
we don't put so much energy into our actualy living.  To me, 
what matters is not how much I am personally responsible for or 
credited with.  What matters is that I am fully engaged in 
living life to the max.  This of necessity includes improving 
and extending life and its possibilities for self and others.

Sounds like Kant.  Too much absolutism and altruism vs. 
non-altruism  and focus on something as conceptual as altruism 
to sound much like authentic Zen.  It might sort of work as a koan.

Universe 13 billion years old 
By Penny Fannin 
April 25 2002 

The astronomical arguments about the age of the universe are over. It is 13
billion years old - give or take
a decimal point.

Early today NASA announced that by studying ancient burnt-out stars called
white dwarfs, which were
orbiting our Milky Way galaxy, a group of astronomers from five
universities had refined the universe's
birth date.

Brad Gibson, a professor in Swinburne University's centre for astrophysics
and supercomputing who was
part of the research team, said that by using the Hubble space telescope
astronomers had identified the
oldest stars in the oldest of the galaxy's star clusters.

He said the brightness of the stars indicated their temperature, which
was used to calculate their age. The stars were 12 billion years old and,
as earlier research had found that the first stars formed about one
billion years after the universe's birth in the Big Bang, the universe
must then be about 13 billion years old.

Many other estimates have been made but they have been flawed, he
said.

Huh?  It was stated that the only important thing was wheter 
there is good enough evidence from this person you branded a 
loon about this matter.  There is no arguing with that.  Even 
someone who often acts like a loon may ocassionally have a valid 
case.  Any contention that just questioning whether I own 
government at least in part conspire to produce some or all of 
the events of 9/11 automatically makes one a "loon" would make 
the asserter of such an automatic judgement look like a loon. 
Just because something is monstrous to even consider as possible 
does not mean it is acceptable to automatically dismiss and 
label any who consider it or advocate it as true as a "loon".

The messenger is NOT the evidence.  So in short, from the above, 
if someone has already impressed you as a reasonable human being 
his evidence is better than the same evidence presented by 
someone who has not so impressed you?  Where is the objectivity 
in that?

Of course you don't want short-term benefits that rob you or the 
Singularitly of long-term good.  However, how can maximum data 
on altruism be acheived without studying what maximal altruism 
looks like in real world situations and how to acheive maximal 
altruism in real life situations in the full context of limits? 
  The only productivity you altruistically care about is the 
maximum well-being of all sentients.  The current sentients 
cannot be totally mortgaged off for the future hopeful 
multitudes.  That leads to potent disasters for the current and 
future sentients historically.

Given the motivation of your efforts that which lessens your 
productivity (true productivity vs some surface measure) lessens 
your efficacy in acheiving those goals.  Usually in a conflict 
of interests it is more or less possible to examine the choices 
in their effect relative to hiearchy of one's values.  The 
higher the value the more it should influence the choice.

But if we are really interested in happiness we have to study 
what truly makes us happy rather than what simply makes us 
temporarily feel better.  Believing something just because it 
feels good is not much different from being a junkie.  But I 
don't think that all religion is about that in the least. Nor do 
I think what some call "rational integrity" is fully conducive 
to true happiness.  When one's notion of "rational integrity" 
becomes a ball and chain rather than wings, one's notion needs 
more examination.

Choosing among alternatives moment by moment is being a full 
human being as far as I'm concerned.  If having a girlfriend is 
lower in your hierarchy of values and seems to be in some 
conflict with higher values then your humanity is fully 
expressed by choosing for your highest value.  I don't expect it 
to be any different after Singularity except there is a lot more 
time and a lot more possibilities.

I doubt it.  I can't picture anyting you personally could do in

Why exactly would you hope this?  It is not certain that these 
three would be any greater contribution or are of greater value 
just because there are three of them and one of you, is it?   I 
am not sure I follow your reasoning here.

Perhaps it would be more fruitful to replace "altruism" with the 
maximal well-being of all of us including you and I.  To me a 
true Friendly AI would need to thoroughly take joy in its work 
with all sentient beings, including itself.  The thing to go 
beyond is being stuck only on one's own being or to even see 
one's being as, for many purposes, strictly limited to one's own 
person.  It isn't acheived, as far as I can see, by continue to 
see a bunch of separate beings out there and valuing all other 
beings more than or especially in exclusion of oneself.

That seems sort of strange.  The moral "comfort" is only of 
value to you in regards to the well-being of Earth or rather its 
sentients and their deliverance from like doom without 
Singularity through Friendly AI.  If it is of more value than 
your own highest goals then something seems possibly 
out-of-kilter.  On the other hand, beneath even Singularity is a 
more core value that you are probably aware of.  Perhaps you are 
speaking of that?

Happiness is in being fully plugged in and active toward what 
one values / believes most important.  There is nothing 
inherently different before/after Singularity in that.  If you 
are not happy in what you are doing now I don't think 
post-Singularity will find you any happier. Nor do I see how 
what you are doing now is in truth a sacrifice.  It only looks 
that way from points of view that probably aren't your core. 
Many of them may actually be points of view external to yourself.

HUBBLE TELESCOPE READS AGE OF THE UNIVERSE
------------------------------------------
Pushing the limits of its powerful vision, NASA's Hubble Space 
Telescope has uncovered the oldest burned-out stars in our Milky Way 
Galaxy. These extremely old, dim "clockwork stars" provide a 
completely independent reading on the age of the universe without 
relying on measurements of the expansion of the universe.

Vegetables & fruits provide carbohydrates and there's an awful lot of those.
I lived for two years on a raw food diet. Physically I felt great. Mentally
not so good. The best thing about it was not having to clean the cooker. The
most surprising thing about it was not losing any weight at all. Oh yeh, and
your farts stop smelling of anything, which is a definite social advantage.

THis is exactly why they are successful characters in PR. At least half
the population personifies the 'lowest common denominator' as you so
crassly put it, and it is this half which is  most lacking in the
intellectual tools needed to make an informed decision about the
anti-tech claims of luddites.  Harry and Louise are very good tools for
this PR war.

Actually, Harry and Louise are owned by the AARP or a related

Yes they do, and its about time extropes realize this.

I've raised two distinct concerns that have been discussed by others on the 
list in the past.

The first is that, at least as long as we're stuck in meat bodies, we have 
to be selective in how we use our time. Not all ideas are worth 
consideration and not all messengers are worth listening to, because the 
time we spend on them is at the expense of something else. We all, 
naturally and appropriately, prejudge ideas and messengers.  You didn't 
skip Kurzweil's talk at EXTRO-5 to listen to a disheveled man in the 
parking lot tell you about the Illuminati.

We also constantly rely on others to prejudge for us, from spam filters to 
Roger Ebert to Dun & Bradstreet.

Occasionally we or they will be wrong. We know this, and build mechanisms 
to correct the filters.

The second is that, when you are considering someone's evidence, whether in 
conversation, in court, or in a scientific journal, you usually cannot (or 
choose not to) independently verify their every contention.  The reputation 
that the messenger has with you provides a necessary weighting factor.  I 
see a scale:

(1)  Assume that the evidence proffered is more reliable than if you had 
obtained it yourself.
(2)  Assume that the evidence is as reliable as if you had obtained it 
yourself.
(3)  The evidence is probably ok, but verify it anyway.
(4)  The evidence is probably unreliable; scrutinize it closely.
(5)  Assume the evidence is invalid.

I trust that my dentist is more competent than I am to assess whether I 
have a cavity, and I trust his integrity not to fake evidence.  I am more 
skeptical when my auto mechanic tells me I need a new transmission.  I 
assume that you are as competent as I to find out when the library closes, 
and have no motive to lie; I will verify the facts myself when my 
six-year-old nephew tells me.  If Erich Von Daniken writes a new sequel to 
Chariot of the Gods, I can safely presume that it will not contain valid 
evidence of alien visitation.

>Just because something is monstrous to even consider as possible does not 
>mean it is acceptable to automatically dismiss and label any who consider 
>it or advocate it as true as a "loon".

Agreed.  I dismissed the gentleman in question as a "loon" not for any one 
thing alone.  All the separate issues I raised together led to that conclusion.

There has apparently be some sort of explosion in New York City at a
technical school. Too early to tell if it was terrorism (The FBI just
warned yesterday of possible attacks) or an accident with welding or
other chemicals. Part of the building has collapsed it seems, though to
what extend we havent' seen yet.

Oh, poppycock.  My selfish interests are better served /in the long
run/ by others acting in their own self-interest.  It makes them
simpler to deal with; more predictable. It makes them build the economy,
innovate, and create.  It creates greater opportunities for trade.
It minimizes the time I have to spend fighting altruistic legislators.

I am selfish, but I don't want your charity--I want your trade.

I was told it was Apex Tech. that was the school.

Well, I just got through the online application process. The money seems
pretty good and from the questions asked, it should be interesting work
as well.

Subject: Vinge's Fast Times
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Vernor Vinge's short story Fast Times at Fairmont High has been nominated
for a Hugo award this year.  It appears in his recently published
story collection called The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge.  It's a
somewhat expensive collection so I know most people won't have read the
story yet but I thought I'd make some comments about it here.  Here is a
link to Amazon.com for the book via the extropy.org affiliate referral:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312873735/qid=1019764428/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/103-0473430-8841416

Fast Times obviously takes its title from the popular movie Fast Times at
Ridgemont High, but it's a little misleading because actually the story is
about junior high kids.  It's set in the 2020s, I think - a difficult era
for authors to write about because the world needs to be significantly
different from our own, but still recognizably grown from our world.
(The year is not stated, but one character's grandfather grew up in
the 1980s, which would suggest that the father grows up in the 2000s,
and this kid is about 14 so it should be the late 2020s.)

I wasn't impressed by the plot.  Too much time is spent with the kids
wandering around in the nighttime fog at Torrey Pines State Beach,
making a surprising and rather unlikely discovery (which I won't give
away here, because it would spoil the plot, such as it is).  However the
technological milieu is fascinating and is the true appeal of the story.
Also the grounding of the story in actual San Diego County locations
(where Vinge lives) adds some local color which I enjoyed.  My wife lived
in San Diego when we were first going together and I used to travel down
there to visit her.

Vinge indicates that he hopes to expand the story into a novel, and that
sounds like a great idea.  The story is really more of a peek into the
"fast times" of the 2020s, much as The Blabber (also in the collection)
gives a very abbreviated picture of the Zones of Thought.  A weak story
led to a great novel and the same thing could happen with Fast Times.

So what is life like in Vinge's 2020?

The biggest technological change involves ubiquitous computing,
wearables, and augmented reality (although none of those terms are used).
Everyone wears contacts or glasses which mediate their view of the world.
This allows computer graphics to be superimposed on what they see.
The computers themselves are actually built into the clothing (apparently
because that is the cheapest way to do it) and everything communicates
wirelessly.  Scientific American had an article about this in the April
issue, http://www.sciam.com/techbiz/0402feiner.html.

In Vinge's hands this is an astonishingly powerful technology.
Remember the mediatrons from Diamond Age, where any surface could be
turned into a display?  You have the same thing here, except it's all in
the eye of the beholder, so to speak.  If you want a computer display,
it can appear in thin air, or be attached to a wall or any other surface.
If people want to watch TV together they can agree on where the screen
should appear and what show they watch.  When doing your work, you can
have screens on all your walls, menus attached here and there, however
you want to organize things.  But none of it is "really" there.

It goes beyond this.  Does your house need a new coat of paint?  Don't
bother, just enter it into your public database and you have a nice
new mint green paint job that everyone will see.  Want to redecorate?
Do it with computer graphics.  You can have a birdbath in the front yard
inhabited by Disneyesque animals who frolic and play.  Even indoors,
don't buy artwork, just download it from the net and have it appear
where you want.  You can change your decor theme instantly.

These kids are teenagers.  Got a zit?  No need to cover up with Clearsil,
just erase it from your public face and people will see the improved
version.  You can dress up your clothes and hairstyle as well.

Of course, anyone can turn off their enhancements and see the plain old
reality, but most people don't bother most of the time because things
are ugly that way.

Augmented reality automatically produces sight-and-sound virtual reality.
Some of the kids attending Fairmont Junior High do so remotely.  They
appear as "ghosts" indistinguishable from the other kids except that
you can walk through them.  They go to classes and raise their hands to
ask questions just like everyone else.  They see the school and everyone
at the school sees them.  Instead of visiting friends the kids can all
instantly appear at one another's locations.

They even have tactile VR systems but you have to buy special clothes with
"gaming stripes", whatever those are.

A related technology is the localizer network.  These are small,
inexpensive network relay nodes that are scattered about, solar and
battery powered.  Each one sets up connections to the local nodes and
provides for network access.  They also have some sensors, sight and
sound apparently, which can enhance the augmented reality system.

The computer synthesizing visual imagery is able to call on the localizer
network for views beyond what the person is seeing.  In this way you can
have 360 degree vision, or even see through walls.  This is a transparent
society with a vengeance!

The cumulative effect of all this technology was absolutely amazing and
completely believable.  It's as far beyond our current communications
media as the net is beyond the telephone.  It's very exciting to imagine
this technology coming into existence.

Vinge has other technological changes that I found less convincing.
The biggest was an effective increase in human intelligence due to better
computer support.  He has these junior high kids doing Putman level math
problems with ease, and learning a programming language in a couple of
hours that the kid's father spent 3 years learning.  Society is turned
topsy turvy, with competence running inversely with age.  The adults
are helpless compared to these junior high kids, who themselves fear
the fifth graders.

I didn't buy it.  All the net connectivity and visual systems don't
clearly add up to the kinds of improved competence Vinge is claiming.
One of the kids is using some biological boosters but this didn't add
credibility for me because first, it comes out of nowhere as far as
grounding in our current scientific knowledge, and second, most of the
kids didn't use these but they were all expected to master these skills.

One thing that was believable is that it seemed that a lot of the kids
cheated, and it was almost impossible for the adults to catch them.
With universal network connectivity it would be hard to make sure kids
are doing their work on their own.  I got the impression the school sort
of looked the other way, the idea being that as long as the kids solved
their problems, even if they got help via the net, that was itself a
useful skill that they would be relying on all their lives.

Overall while I did not buy everything Vinge presented, it was an
astonishing glimpse at a near future world which is continuing to go
through revolutionary changes.  Expanding the story to novel length
should provide many more opportunities to develop techniques that are
only hinted at here.

By the decade Vinge is talking about, late 2020s CRNS (Current Rate No
Singularity, a measure of linear time), I would expect wearable computer
interfaces to have evolved far beyond the level they occupy today, into an
extended sensorimotor modality.  This being the case, the younger kids are
likely to be better adapted to the most recent technology because they began
using it while they had maximum neural plasticity.  A fifth-grader beating
an experienced adult with a keyboard is one thing, although it does happen
nowadays; it is far easier to visualize a fifth-grader beating an
experienced adult with a wearable-computing interface that has advanced to
and beyond the level of a Segway Ginger.

Singularity is a major focus of Foresight SIGs

KurzweilAI.net News, April 26, 2002


Three of the special interest group meetings at Foresight's Exploring the
Edges: Spring 2002 Senior Associates Gathering, which begins Friday evening,
April 26 in Palo Alto, will focus on the Singularity -- a coming dramatic
phase transition as technology accelerates over the next few decades and
machines achieve superintelligence.


These include Brainstorms in Accelerating Change: Open Singularity
Discussion, moderated by Ray Kurzweil; Exploring the Technological
Singularity: Universal Trends in Accelerating Change, moderated by John
Smart; and Reaching for a Swifter and Safer Singularity, moderated by
Eliezer Yudkowsky.

Other SIGs will explore why the public is hostile to discussing or preparing
for the potential impacts of nanotechnology, aggressive approaches to
nanomedicine, strategies for creating a real-money Idea Futures market,
computer security, possible winners in the nanotech race, and making
next-generation wireless broadband and wearable computing happen ("Brave New
Unwired World: Getting From Here To Kurzweil's Future").

Four other sessions in the main program will also touch on the Singularity.
Stewart Brand will discuss Long Bets, including Ray Kurzweil's bet with
Mitch Kapor that a computer will pass the Turing Test by 2029. And J. Storrs
Hall will preview his forthcoming book, Ethics for Machines, to "show how
close we are to human-level AI by showing which parts exist in some form and
which still need work, and point in particular at the parts that would
produce a conscience (moral sense, call it what you will) such that you'd
consider trusting its motives."

In addition, Ray Kurzweil will make two presentations: one on the case for
an exponential technology future and a debate with Gregory Stock: "BioFuture
or MachineFuture?."

So something which interfaces overwhelmingly unidirectionally (eye
tracking, gesture and voice recognition, EEG pickup have a lousy data
rate) via your visual and auditory system makes you smarter? Nice trick,
that.

Massively invasive systems, yes. However, I don't see invasive systems
hitting the street in 20 years. For the same reasons they don't implant
microelectrode arrays in people today: cost, risk, inconvenience, lousy
performance. This will only change with the advent of medical
nanotechnology of the machine-phase variety, which looks arbitrarily far
removed from the current point of view.

Augmented reality allows you to do some stuff humans simply can't do
(enhancement of sensorics, mapping of new modi into existing senorics,
total documentation track, remembrance agent, telepresence, canned
knowledge cuing behaviour), including increased performance in specific
tasks (like, say, industrial and military automation control), but it
doesn't actually make you smarter in the degree as envisioned by Vinge. 
You wouldn't actually do much better on a standard IQ test (unless you're 
cheating using your remembrance agent).

To be fair to Vinge, his headbands are not huds, and they're invasive (in
functionality, the depiction is innocuous (no skin portals, no massive 
implants)).

Zerhouni? Zerhouni? who the **** is Zerhouni?

The number of people who have never even heard of this guy is surprising,
since he's the current nominee for the post of director of the US National
Institutes of Health.
Will he or won't he oppose the Bush administration on the issues of stem
cell research and cloning, is the hot question if he gets the job?

Hi,

ArsDigita University (http://www.aduni.org/) had an interesting goal, to
offer the world's best computer science education, at an undergraduate
level, to people who were otherwise unable to obtain it.

See http://www.aduni.org/courses/ and http://www.aduni.org/about/#concept

AdUni has gone into deep freeze after ArsDigita(.com) lost funding. Not
wanting a good thing to go waste they have 80 gigs of streamable real media
videos of the actual lectures on the website. I have finally managed to get
a mirror of the website with all the videos, problem sets and lecture notes.

The material is released under the OpenContent License (OPL)
[http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml]. I would like this to reach as many
people as possible. I intend burning DVDs of this for a few of my friends at
the local LUG. But, I'm on the lookout for a broader distribution medium to
enable it to reach as many people as possible. I'm planning to meet the
local cable ISPs in Chennai to get them to mirror it on their servers and
stream it to their users.

I'm on the lookout for ways and means of making this reach just about
anybody who'd be interested in this sort of a thing. I'm also looking for
volunteers who could take this and spread this in their part of the world...
and generally interesting ideas on what can be done with this...

Do you think the time is right for this sort of thing to have a significant
impact in this part of the world, considering the cost of disseminating 80
Gigs of digital content?

Cheers,

Right, take a look at http://www.kalva.demon.co.uk/putnam/putn00.html,
the year 2000 Putman exam, with answers.  See if you can find even
a single one of these questions that could plausibly be answered by a
substantial fraction of a junior high school class, armed with augmented
reality internet access and fancy math software, even if they'd used
these enhancements since they were babies.

Subject: Government possibly suppressing nano?
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Slashdot had a story yesterday about an article claiming that the
U.S. government is quietly beginning to move nanotech out of the public
sector and bring it under military control.

http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&CID=1051-042402B

   No Nano Secrecy, Please
   By Glenn Harlan Reynolds
   
   I've been hearing some disturbing things about nanotechnology
   lately. I don't swear that they're accurate, but I'm getting whispers
   and too-pointed-I-can-neither-confirm-nor-deny remarks that suggest
   that the federal government is ever so quietly beginning an effort
   to shut down or limit civilian nanotechnology research.

   ...

   It may be, of course, that the accounts I'm getting are distorted,
   and that the "guidance" that the federal government is attempting is
   really something more akin to what is recommended in the Foresight
   Institute  guidelines regarding molecular nanotechnology: a set of
   recommendations for sound engineering practices and other safeguards
   designed to discourage abuse while not giving up what Arthur Kantrowitz
   calls the weapon of openness. But that's not what I'm hearing.

Of course as he presents the information here, it is just a rumor
without any cited sources.  Nevertheless it would hardly be a surprise
if the strategic importance of this technology eventually got through
to the governments of the world and they took this kind of action.
The main question is whether practical applications are close enough
today that the government would feel threatened by continuing to fund
public sector research.

Probably the only real tipoff will be to look at how the funding comes
down over the next few years.  Will more and more funds be devoted to
"ersatz nanotech", the growing body of research that manages to cram
"nano" into the name just to line up at the trough?  Will we see funding
for efforts that could actually lead to MNT, the kinds of research
highlighted at the Foresight conferences?  It will be interesting to
see how that works out.

This part of the world (France, Italy) is in a tizzy about the
election results.

I arrived in Nice, France last Sun morn for the European Geophysical
Society meeting, and sat in a central square watching folks place
their ballots in the voting boxes for the French election. Wonderful
and charming process to watch. When the election results became known
that evening, it seemed to be the main topic of conversation at the
conference for days. The result surprised everyone- the French I heard
discussing it consider the result a major catastrophe. The result
filled 10 pages in the main Italy newspaper the next day too.
 
Tommorrow (Saturday), there will be demonstrations (throughout France)
against the election results. I am not sure the purpose of the
demonstrations, but it seems that alot of people want to make their
voices heard.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I'd like to propose that the following letter be sent to all senators
and congress(wo)men to lobby against the President's proposed ban on
human cloning and that all transhumanists that would like should sign it
as well (it is a modification of a statement I made on the extropians
list several years ago):

Dear Senator/Congressman:
Having read of the intent of the President and Congress to ban human
cloning, I felt I must respond, in the name of human rights. What you
are proposing to do is to deny humans everywhere the ability to express
in the purest way that characteristic which is most notable about our
species: our ability
to create, to reproduce, even when accidents of nature stand in the
way.  I am an American citizen, and as such hold that all that is right
and good in this world derives from respect for the concept that all
power is derived from the individual, that all rights originate from the
individual. To support any law, policy, regulation, or ideal which
opposes the rights of the individual is to denigrate the dignitiy of the
individual human in the most profound way.

For this reason, rather than acting to ban technology in fear as you
have apparently done, I ask you to explore the possibility of proposing
public policies which will achieve the apparent goals of your "ban"
while at the same time maximizing individual human rights.

That every human has the right to freely procreate is recognised in all
civilized societies (which inferrs attendant responsibilities as well).
All civilized societies also recognize common concepts of intellectual
property, notably concepts like the patent, copyright, and trademarks.
Many people around the world have debated for several decades on the
subject of genetic information and intellectual property, especially in
the area of patents.

Your organization seems to be opposed to the potential for corporate
abuse of cloning technology to enslave humans by the patenting of DNA
sequences. In this I applaud you. How you wish to go about it though,
frankly scares me even more. At least in the marketplace, the public can
vote with its money on the business practices of corporations. In too
many countries, no such competition is allowed in the area of politics
and government. I fear even greater the possibility of government
monopolies of power abusing this technology in secret than I do in
corporations which must compete in the  marketplace for public approval.

Due to this, I propose that the Congress pursue a policy that recognizes
that 1) only human individuals can make claims of intellectual property
involving DNA, 2) each individual posesses primary and majority
ownership of his or her genetic intellectual property present in his or
her own DNA, which cannot be assigned, waived, leased or sold. 2) each
individual posesses secondary and guardian ownership of all other
individuals posessing copies, in whole (clone) or in part (natural
fertilization) until those individuals attain adult legal status, or if
the state intervenes in the interest of the derived individual, as is
now done in juvinile court, or by various departments
of education, health and human services, etc. Each derived generation,
in whole or in part is to be regarded in the same manner as "next of
kin" are legally today in natural born families. 3) These intellectual
property rights infer responsibilities of stewardship, which if
neglected or abused shall constitute severe human rights violations
punishable under expansions of current law.

By becoming proponents of this sort of policy, we establish primary
political ownership of ANY sort of reproduction or creation of ANY sort
of intellectual property in the hands of the individual, who is free to
choose as is his or her right how and when and where to exercise those
rights, without violating those of others. Thus no government, nor any
corporation can ever commit such abuse without the expressed approval of
each and every individual involved. We reinforce the concept that
political power flows from the individual, and governments and
corporations weild power only as delegated by free individuals. By tying
these rights together, an assault on one aspect is an assault on the
whole.

Signed,

Michael S. Lorrey

The trouble with that is most people who claim to believe in altruism
are really selfish so they don't benefit me, and they often expect
things in return and meddle in my affairs "for my own good".

But I *am* a selfish rationalist and I *do* feel the need to discuss
it publicly. What makes you think I wouldn't?

Selfishness needs promoting about as much as gravity does.
Understanding selfishness is important, though, so it's worth talking
about.

Obviously, any decision made without cognitive integrity is in danger
of being wrong an counterproductive. So it's in your best interest to
maintain it. That's true whether your goal is ultimately to better
yourself or others with your efforts.

I certainly doubt that 90% figure--I think it's much higher. But who
are you trying to kid? Even if you were the only person in the world
who understood the need to promote the right kind of singularity,
you'd still be completely dedicated to it, wouldn't you? If not, then
how do you justify your current efforts? Where's your mandate? What's
the magic number of "clientele" required for you to pursue your
efforts? What proof do you have that you have that many clients? What
of the vast majority who don't approve of your efforts? How do you
discount them?

You--one who hasn't even enjoyed the basic experiences of life--think
you're in a position to declare that nobody who has ever lived has
been a "complete human"? That's absurd. It might be true that life
post-singularity is better--though that's not guaranteed--but to call
our current lives incomplete is outrageous.

Even where I am, in Western Canada, there has been a lot of news about 
this...and rightfully so.  I find it more than a little ironic that France, 
of all nations, should choose a near-fascist minority leader, given the all 
too recent history of '40's Nazi invasion.

However, I must admit that I don't find the emergence of near-fascist views 
in a G8 country all that surprising.  Since 9-11, there has been a 
heightened sense of xenophobia towards visible minorities all over the 
world, and some of the measures that certain world governments have 
recently taken to "combat potential terrorism" have led to a slippery slope 
of sorts...one which can only heighten the aforementioned sense of 
xenophobia among the average person.

What does surprise me is the boldness of Le Pen's stance on a number of 
issues, particularly those of immigration and citizenship (going so far as 
talking about revoking citizenships for non-pureblood French stock).  While 
the French are generally identified by their boldness or "snootiness" as it 
may be, Le Pen's stance strikes me as a slap in the face to the makers of 
foreign policy in the other G8 countries, and I sincerely hope that it 
provides a bit of a wake up call to the millions of people worldwide who 
have fallen prey to the cultural xenophobia we are currently 
experiencing.  Sadly, I'm quite concerned that the opposite may be true.

While it may seem that I am overstating the significance of a minority 
leader's political platform, I can honestly foresee that similar views 
could spring up in other economically stable nations in the near 
future.  Woe to us all if they ever become a majority.

That "goodness" of the bet is, itself, my question.

I'm skeptical that altruism alone is sufficient justification for
working on the Singularity, any more than flat self-interest is
sufficient justification for working on the Singularity, because I'm
unconvinced that the bet is good for either type of thinker.

Both the altruist and the egoist may be making a radically bad bet;
they may be wrongly trading off whatever it is that they value today
for more of it tomorrow.  It's natural to think of personal
satisfaction as the value being postponed/invested, but
accomplished-Friendliness might stand in for personal satisfaction
just as easily.

Almost nobody agrees with the Extropians/Transhumanists that pursuing
LE/Singularity is the most effective way to be an egoist OR an
altruist.  "Fifty million Frenchmen," as the saying goes.

I've lost a lot of confidence that the bet is good.  I'm now quite
uncertain that if I devote my life to either LE or Singularity I'll
have any effect at all, even to the thousandth of a percentage point,
even to the millionth of a percentage point.  Even if I did have an
effect, the ball is still up in the air as to whether my effect would
be a positive one.

Is it a good bet?  What makes it so good?  What makes it so much
better than betting on raising a (mortal) family and retiring
peacefully?

Why is such a tiny minority of apparently intelligent people
unconvinced that the bet is even non-bad?

I don't find it as shocking.  We must remember the Vichy French
government and also that fascism's intellectual roots are in France.
(See Zeev Sternhell's _The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural
Rebellion to Political Revolution_.)  I bring up the former because it
shaped to a great deal postwar politics.  Yes, the Vichy are long out of
power, but a lot of their institutions, such as the controls on French
cinema, still exist.

Also, I believe many more French were collaborators during the Vichy Era
than let on -- in fact, probably a huge minority or even a majority.
Not every last French man and woman was sobataging the Germans or the
Vichy regime.  If so, the Germans wouldn't have been able to not only
hold on to France, but to keep it relatively quiet during most of the
war.  I'm not saying this as an attack on anyone.

Finally, over and above fascist movements, one reason the Left has so
long had Europe locked up in places like Italy and France is that the US
government [financially] supported of non-Communist Left-wing movements.
This was an attempt to block, blunt, or dilute Communism, but it had the
effect of shutting the Right out of politics.  Now that the US
government is no longer funding such causes, a new equilibrium, one
further to the Right, is asserting itself.  However, absent US
interference, this might have happened decades ago.  (Granted, perhaps
not during the late 1940s, but maybe during the 1970s or 1980s.)

I'm not saying I'm for either Left or Right here.  I'm just pointing out
what I believe is going on in Europe from my armchair.:)

Cheers!

So, you think trade is the ultimate and only good way for 
sentient beings to relate while being driven by rational 
selfishness?  Do you also think that their understanding of what 
really is in their self-interest will never include some or 
perhaps all of which you now disparage as irrational because it

Slashdot reported today on an interesting article in the Washington Post
about posthumanity by Joel Garreau,
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50958-2002Apr25.html.

The article's "hook" is pretty dumb, focusing on superhero fantasies and
how future tech enhancements might give all of us those powers.  But it
develops into a broader look at the possibilities and ethical challenges
of transforming humanity.  It mentions Max More (who becomes Max Moore
on slashdot) and Ray Kurzweil, and also the debate this weekend between
Kurzweil and Greg Stock on whether cyborgs or biological entities will
rule the posthuman roost.

I saw Greg Stock speak earlier this week at UCSB.  He focussed mostly on
near future biotech applications, talking about the genome sequencing and
how it could lead to enhancements in the near term via embryo selection.
He asked the audience (mostly UCSB students I think) how many would
take advantage of technology to enhance their own children if it were
possible, and slightly over half the hands went up.  Stock said this was
pretty typical for the U.S., where about half the people generally favor
the technology.  In some countries like India it is even more popular,
maybe 80% support it.  In others like Japan it is less popular and only
about 20% would perform enhancements.

It's great to see these ideas entering the popular culture, in at least
somewhat more depth than we are going to get once Harry and Louise start
telling us what to think of posthumans.

Actually I wasn't at all impressed by that talk as I had read 
the book and almost nothing new was added.  But that is neither 
here nor there. I hardly think the person you disparaged as a 
"loon" apparently for his contentions about 9/11, is very fairly 
compared to a disheveled man in the parking lot muttering about 
the Illuminati.

I have no argument that our time is limited and we have to pick 
and choose though.  But in this particular case your judgement 
seemed to come awfully fast and harsh.  It didn't look fair to me.

Perhaps we can agree to disagree because I was not convinced of 
his loonacy by the evidence (much of which looked more like 
preset opinion) presented.


I am not saying the guy is trustworthy or should not be 
verified.  I would put him in the category "If what he says 
makes sense and the case appears plausible then look into given 
time and sufficient importance".

The things we do implant in people today to help with various

me to believe that we will not see more invasive system in the

Using your various extended components would not be viewed as 
cheating in such a world, would it?  If I am connected to the 
world wide-web and have considerable computing power including 
various tools available then I could score arbitrarily higher on 
any IQ test out there today.  (for what it's worth)  What is the 
difference in that for our future selves and using what 
knowledge and techniques we have managed to retain in our poor 
craniums today on such a test?   The test should test your 
Intelligence Quotient with those means at your disposal that are 
always with you.  For a cyborg using such is not "cheating".

I don't think invasiveness by anything beyond EM is strictly 
necessary to fairly major enhancement.  More major enhancement 
requires going inside.

Altruism emerges from rational selfishness, especially in an iterated
context. Not only it's the nice thing to do, it's the smart thing to do.
The only altruism which is incompatible with rational selfishness of the
individual is gene-driven and meme-driven altruism, becase the selfishness
driving the agent's behaviour is not the individual agent's.

Kiln People presents a near-future world which has been revolutionized

manifests as a "standing wave" which can be copied and imprinted.
The result is that people can create "golems", "dittos", copies of their
own minds imprinted onto clay beings.  When the imprinting is done, the
golem "wakes up" as a copy of the individual, mentally indistinguishable
from the original.

The golems only last for about a day and then deteriorate into a
recyclable slurry.  If they make it back home during that time, their
memories and experiences can be "inloaded", copied back to the human
mind from which they were imprinted.  If not, all their experiences are
lost and they basically just die.

There are different kinds of golem bodies, color-coded to represent
different attributes.  The grays are general-purpose and seem to most
closely resemble human beings in their capabilities.  Black golems
actually have greater abilities to focus their thoughts and concentrate.
Greens and reds are mentally simpler, less imaginitive, and are designed
for menial labor.

Within this background Brin creates a detective story and murder mystery.
Albert Morris has been hired to track down the murder of one of the
top officials at Universal Kilns, the company which monopolizes golem
manufacture.  In the process of his investigation he uncovers secret new
technology which could revolutionize the world even beyond the changes
which have already taken place.

My main interest in the novel was not so much the story as the society.
What would happen in a world in which conscious intelligence could be
replicated at will?  How do people treat the golems?  While I don't
expect this particular technology to be created, we do expect to see
many variations on intelligent beings over the course of this century.
Can they expect to be treated as well as humans?

Unfortunately, in Brin's world, the answer is no.  I was shocked and
disgusted to see that he presents the golems as having no human rights
whatsoever.  They are property, nothing more.  They have to step to
the back of the bus, get out of the way of the white, excuse me, human
massas, put up with whatever humans want to do to them.  This shocking
recreation of the worst abuses of the slavery era is presented without
much explanation by Brin, or much sensitivity to the horrific history
he is echoing.

The reasoning he offers is that, first, people don't mind being treated
like this when they are clay because they know that this means that
when they are human, they get to enjoy the superior state.  And second,
the problem with giving full human rights to golems is that they would
have to be able to vote, and rich people could make multiple golems so
that one man, one vote would no longer be meaningful.

I don't accept the first reason, in fact it is downright immoral
to justify inflicting pain and hardship on others just because some
people might play either the top or bottom role from time to time.
Why would it be so impossible simply to treat everyone with respect?
I agree that voting would be a problem but it doesn't follow that golems
should have no rights at all.  Even if they don't vote they should still
be recognized as being human.

Another aspect of the society that I found unbelievable and disturbing was
that many people care little about their own death when they are golems.
In fact, most factory workers create a golem in the morning, send it
in to work, and then the golem dies at the end of the day rather than
coming home.  The idea is that factory work is so boring there's not
much point in returning home to inload a day of doing the same thing
over and over again thousands of times.

So these people are going to work, doing boring, repetitive work all day,
and knowing that their reward is that they will die when the day is over.
And they don't mind.  Brin hints that this fatalism is perhaps built into
the golem mind, but that just transfers the moral responsibility to the
guy who makes the copy.  He creates a new conscious being which has a
built in desire to work for the human's benefit and then commit suicide.
Very disturbing.

I had other problems with the story as well.  I never really bought
the technology.  The physiology of the golems isn't discussed much,
but the implication is that it is pretty simple, and I don't see how you
could make an effective human body without complexity.  They don't have
a circulatory system, for example, but they need to breathe oxygen.  How
would that work, how would the oxygen get to the tissues?  And imprinting
a brain wave is even less believable.  We know that the brain has dozens
of different specialized sub-regions with specific functional adaptations.
The idea that you could just copy a wave into a piece of clay and bring it
to intelligent life is absurd.  Brin has a reputation as a hard science
fiction writer but the golems never seemed like more than fantasy.

I also thought the writing suffered.  In my opinion Brin's last few books
have been deteriorating.  His writing is becoming over-wrought, over-
dramatized.  He works too hard to try to milk drama from each scene.
Italics appear everywhere so that we see how much *meaning* people are
putting into their words.

While the story moves along with plenty of action, related by Albert and
his various dittos, I never found myself that involved.  In fact I put the
book down midway through out of boredom, and had to force myself to finish
it a couple of weeks later.  Albert himself remains something of a cipher
despite being the narrator.  He is relatively passive through much of
the story, a pawn being manipulated by larger forces.  He does show some
heroism but we don't particularly see why, other than sheer stubbornness.

Overall I was quite disappointed with this novel.  The basic idea
was unbelievaable to me, and even suspending that, the social changes
were abhorrent.  I would like to believe that society would respond very
differently to such a technology.  The story drags along and feels padded,
and the "mind-blowing" ending didn't seem all that original.  The writing
was overdone and I think the book could have used much tighter editing.

Still it is one of the few novels which delves deeply into what a world
would be like where consciousness could be copied cheaply, and people
interested in that question may find the book worthwhile even if the
answers presented aren't very believable.

With all due respect to Mr. Sill and the many "psychological egoists" out 
there, I believe they employ a definition of "interest" which makes their 
position trivially true, but which doesn't accord with common usage.  This 
definiton (roughly, that interest = motivation for action) is quite useful 
in theoretical economics, where interesting a priori truths can be derived 
from trivial axioms.  In ethics, however, I think it just leads to a lot of 
talking at cross purposes.  When someone believes that an altruistic act 
has taken place, they don't believe that [The act was motivated by 
something which is not a motivation for action.]  They use a different 
concept of "interest", which they may not be able to define very clearly 
but which seems to be effectively used in our society, and which doesn't 
yield such contradictions.

When something is not clearly defined, it is rather easy for it to fail
to contradict something else. Don't mistake imprecision for accuracy.

Yeah, the enhanced intelligence doesn't bother me.  I
recall writing back in the mid '80's about what
happens when you "enhance" your toddler with a system
that keeps him from playing in the traffic, but also
serves as an auxiliary memory, where the kid can store
binocular video clips, audio, mental notes, etc., as
well as possibly shorthand responses, behavioral
algorythms, until the kid/computer sytem becomes so
integrated that the kid alone may no longer be able to
function.  Is this a BAD thing?  

Maybe it depends upon whether it increases the
likelihood or possibility of interfering with the
normal volition choices that the kid might make
unenhanced.  If it could become a control mechanism
for outside interests, so that the kid simply becomes
a slave, then that would be objectionable.  If the
computer side learns so well what the kid wants to
hear or how he wants things to be interpreted, without
the structural feedback that normally keeps us sane,
then that too could be very negative.  Maybe the kid
becomes a Walter Mitty, whose enhanced reality is so
much more fun that he no longer is willing to even
deal with real reality.  

Maybe the computer side, even though perhaps not
conscious in the sense that we are, develops its own
sets incentives that diverge from the values of the
kid.  With the advantage of built-in, sophisticated
algoryths on the computer side, coupled with tight
coupling to the kid's sensory input, the kid could be
seduced into becoming simply the way that the computer
walks around and does things.

And then there's the group side, as well.  I
envisioned and lectured on kids playing D&D in empty
lots in the ghetto. Except that, to the enhanced kids,
they would be in a real D&D universe, with dragons and
castles, etc.  The Nokia instant text messaging
service was used a few years back by the kids in
Finland to play extended group fantasy games
encompassing entire real cities.  This was just text
on a cellphone screen.

Ironically, the SCA people would probably go crazy
with this so-very-not-medieval tek.

I was wondering when that aspect - augmented reality,
or, as I prefer, the less value-biased "overlaid
reality," which I suggested to IEEE reps in the early
'90's at one of the Meckler VR cons - would show up in
Vinge's work.

I have a short article somewhere on disk that I sold -
altho they never paid me the $600 or so they owed me
before they suspended operations - to Amiga User
International Magazine in the early '90's, in which I
described exactly what you were just saying.  I was
banking on the passive proximity chips as one of the
driving technologies, at the time.  They were up to
256 bits or more of return code at the time, and the
only drawback was that you had to get really close or
use a really powerful pulse to fire them off.  I
assumed that that problem would be fixed by now -
which hasn't happened yet, so far as I know.

Basically the proximity chips could be put anywhere,
embedded into just about anything, and even then could
have provided a unique ID for every piece of property,
physical or intellectual, on the globe, making
stealing for fencing purposes uneconomical.  In the
early '90's they were already used for that purpose by
the British Motorcycle Association, who sold a kit to
its members for about $50 U.S. and coordinated with
the police who had hand-held readers tied to a
universal database.

Failing to solve the pulse power problem, however, you
could use either a universal broadcast power grid to
keep a little on-board capicitor charged, or make it
just smart enough to tune to whatever broadcast power
was locally available - as in local FM radio stations
- for the same purpose, using a tiny trickle of
current to build up a charge for one or more ID
chirps.

Instead of trying to embed the actual info to be
displayed in the chip, then, I assumed that the chip
would simply tell the user's wearable system where to
look in the universal index, which would be duplicated
on non-rewritable media and available worldwide via
cellular, satellite or whatever.

The other stuff you described - virtual fashion,
virtual faces, virtual art and architecture, virtual
pressence - I used to give lectures about as part of a
set of private seminars put on by "World ???," (can't
recall the name now), later Virtual Ventures, I
believe, under the auspices of the Learning
Alternative.  I also projected how juveniles might
hack the system and greatly annoy school authorities
or cops.  (I had a dream during this period that
evolved into the plot for a novel that I never wrote
in which someone uses a virtual agent derived from an
on-line game character to represent them, and then the
"real" person dies or disappears, leaving the agent to
carry on.  Everyone using the overlay glasses sees the
agent as just another person.)

Anyway, thanks for reviewing the book.  Now I will
have to spend some money, obviously...

ROFL...  I recall going to a halloween party around
'83 wearing one of those 3" defective etched silicon
chip wafers on a necklass.  I was supposed to be a
"Karma Warrior."  I had figured out that I was living
in a simulation, as a researcher in simulations myself
who had witnessed too many coincidental deaths or
disappearances of my colleagues, so I tricked the
simulator (a la the Moriarity TNG episode) by creating
a simulation of its own hardware that looked
indistinguishable from the "real" thing, the theory
being that the simulation would get confused and
redirected at random every time it tried to
investigate me.  The only problem being that, since
one of the prime directives of the simulator was to
keep the fact of simulation secret, otherwise it
spoiled the results, it kept trying to hit me
indirectly, like crashing planes into buildings where
it sensed the fuzziness, so I had to keep on the move.
 I was supposedly fighting back by putting myself in
places that required a very high level of coincidence
for it to hit, thereby turning its strategy against
itself - i.e., advertising its presence to anyone
smart enuf to do the odds.  Anyway, at some point, I
began to ask myself if maybe this wasn't actually
true, and I figured out a sure-fire test, which is the follo

This technology was implicit, but masked, in Samuel R. Delany's important
1984 novel STARS IN MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND.

< `The door deliquesced' (p. 244) is a rather swaggering play on Heinlein's
paradigmatic `The door dilated', discussed above. `The blue crystal, behind
us now, began to foam; the foam rose, climbing at the jambs faster than in
the middle and darkening, and shutting out light as the door's
semi-crystals effloresced' (ibid.). This is absurd as technology; it might
be decorative special-effects, however, for one of the book's principal
cognitive shocks - whose slow fore-tremors build as we try to correlate
place and movement - is that an indeterminate amount of the `excess
scenography' displayed is fraudulent, generated by brain-tricking
`cassettes'. 
	This is finally brought to our attention on pp. 339-41, where George Thant
turns off Marq's gorgeous open-air sleeping platform and reveals a rundown
three-metre square metal box. It is an interesting tactic, for Delany
(mis)uses our familiarity with sf mega-text decoding conventions to trick
us into supposing that `limen-plates' teleport people to distant locations,
when in fact they are merely local entrances into detailed holographic fake
environments. With a moral jolt one asks: does this mean that Korga, the
only person in the world unable to access information sources by direct
neural connection, moves through a savagely denuded homescape, one more
overlooked item of psychic and social dispossession? > (READING BY STARLIGHT)

This is completely unsurprising.  Unbeknownst to most people in the world,
there are very active covert battlefields between nations, which only rarely
spill over into anything that would show up in your evening news.  In some
ways this is very good, as it bleeds off steam between nations and generally
keeps things out of sight and out of mind of the national consciousness (no
need to get the populace in an uproar which may cause a politically driven
incident).  Perhaps more strangely, some long-running covert battles are
between countries that are not normally considered to be enemies (e.g. US
and France, which have been trading covert blows for a couple decades now).
It is worth noting that these covert battles aren't just spy versus spy type
stuff; the US loses a few dozen people every year in these games, though we
probably give more than we take in most cases.

Back to China, one of the big problems with China is that they are
extraordinarily clumsy at these below-the-radar international games. They
have neither the savvy and style of the Russians nor the tireless discipline
of the French, so whenever they try to play the game they tend to make a
public mess of it, which ruins it for everyone.  There is supposed to be
some "honor among thieves" in the world of covert ops, but the Chinese are
famous for lacking this quality.

My guess:  the Chinese thought they were going to do something clever that
breaks the "rules" of the game, and so the US government is airing
foreknowledge of it in public to discourage the Chinese from doing it.

The Chinese have exactly made any secred of infowar being part 
of their military program.  That being so and they having set 
many times that they consider the United States an enemy 
capitalist regime, it is not to difficult to believe the do poke 
at the defenses of our networks now and then.  So what?  The 
question is, why is this store being given fanfare now.

This is not really new.  Security professionals remember a big Chinese 
hacker attack from last summer and during the downed plane incident.  I 
think it is simple assumption that they will repeat their past tactics 
when political tensions increase.

The underlying interactions are more complicated than this though.  The US
intelligence services have a strict policy of not aiding US companies
directly, even when foreign intelligence services (e.g. China or France) are
using their capabilities to aid their domestic business interests in the
international market. However, they give indirect aid at critical junctures
in international business by airing the dirty laundry or hinting
foreknowledge of planned activities by the foreign intelligence service so
that the offending government or some third government will be forced to
take a different tack for political reasons.  It may not look like much, but
whoever was supposed to get the message got the message.  I don't have first
hand knowledge of what is going on with the US and China, but I can make a
number of good guesses based on what went on when I did have direct
knowledge of such things.

I don't know whether a specific American business interest is being
protected in this case or whether it is political move, but I do know that
the US has needed to be much more pointed in its dealing with China (e.g.
"accidentally" bombing an embassy) than it has with our much savvier and
more subtle opponents. At some level, we don't have the respect for the
Chinese that we have had for other opponents.  When we were more actively
jousting with the USSR than we are the Russians today, the US operators had
a great deal of respect for the Soviets and vice versa.  There was an
element of sportsmanship to it back then; the crudeness of the Chinese is
viewed with disdain by the people involved in these things as it makes
things messier than they could be.

I don't really read anything special in this bit of news, but I also have
enough background to know that in all likelihood this particular news clip
was put out there for a specific reason that may only be tangentially
related to what the news clip was about.

You know, these all seem to be very unextropian povs; hacking and messing
with other people's networks are an excellent example of what happens with
the ever-increasing devolution of power to individuals. You don't have to
invoke deliberate government action and costly cyberwar programs to explain
network intrusions in times of international stress -- all it takes is a
couple of knowledgeable people who are annoyed into a favorable cost-benefit
comparison by current events. I'm sure governments are looking into it. In
terms of what has actually happened over the past few years, I'd be
surprised if they had much to do with any of it, however.

So now we imagine a world ten years down the line in which it's biostuff or
nanostuff instead of just computer stuff that interests those annoyed
individuals...

Do you envision a 1 k$ DNA synthesizer to be offered at Wal-Mart within
the next decades? Or restriction enzymes and electrophoresis kits sold
next to the Coors sixpacks and the barbecue gear? Nevermind that computers
are self-documenting, whereas lab skills are not. Plus, your projects
typically take years to generate a relatively trivial result. No average
highschooler has this much patience.

The whole cyberwar issue is a complete red herring. Minimal diversity
(about 5 systems derived from different roots), each system having a
security comparable to OpenBSD and issuing smartcards to PINheads who
apparently can't handle passwords would prevent >99% of all break-ins.

Natural technology for localizers is ultrawideband, aka digital pulse
radio. The same technology allowing you to time minor variations in pulses
also allows you to time them sufficiently accurate to achieve cm
resolution. One of the startups using UWB specifically for localization is
Aetherwire http://www.aetherwire.com/

I believe Tim May is acting as an investor in a UWB startup, so he will be 
probably the right person to ask for comments.

One of more low tech approaches is to use microdot paint.

If the localizers are small, you've got geometry problems. The length of 
the antenna has to be about lambda/4 for it to absorb sufficiently. The 
exciting frequency has to be ~microwave (~cm) to absorb efficiently. While 
flooding the environment with low power HF is doable technically 
(especially, if you illuminate spots in the landscape from LEO and GEO 
platforms), but this is bound to have impact on biology.

Are we talking about localizers, or RFID tags? Are RFID tags to be 
difficult to forge (tamperproof, random tag challege based crypto 
protocol), or just dumb (radiate, say, a 64 bit number in clear)? In 
latter case an early product is already available:

	http://www.hitachi.com/products/material/rfid/

(see the presentation link for details and specs). Some other folks have
prototyped electrostatically powered tags which use carbon-ink-jet printed
antenna. No doubt, one could make a completely printable RFID tag with
polymer semiconductor inks.

Anyway, at least one Old Guard Republican has some sense on the issue.

There was a front page article in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday
about a new organization, The Chimpanzee Collaboratory, which promotes
chimp (is that word now un-pc?) rights.  The article is reprinted at the
Collaboratory web site, http://www.chimpcollaboratory.org/news/index.asp:

IMO animal rights are often taken to extremes, but in the case of chimps I
think they make some good points.  If we're going to support animal rights,
it makes sense to be selective and to look at intelligence and brain size.
Chimpanzees and some of the other apes are close enough to humans that
they should be the first candidates for legal rights.

Unfortunately I think we also have to look at the costs involved as well.
Someday, when we are wealthier as a culture, it may be possible to
protect the rights of all animals.  Now, though, it is not feasible to
grant rights to food animals or other species which would impose large
economic costs.  Even in the case of chimps, since they cannot give
informed consent to medical experiments, it means that humans would have
to be used at an earlier stage, imposing costs on them because of less
thorough testing.

What, exactly, is so surprising about this? The vast majority of
cyberattacks on US government and industry websites since the
'accidental' bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the
Kosovo  air campaign has been by Chinese individuals as well as by
Chinese government agencies. Chinese military strategy accepts as an
unescapable fact that Red China and the US will have a war in the 21st
century. Not *might*, *will* have a war. It's about time we woke up to
the fact that they believe such a thing and deal with it.

Argumentional analysis: "Lie and parasitize. Don't give yourself away."

I see morals/ethics as a special kind of implied contract some people use.
Your suggested m/e simply refers to the traditional parasite's m/e.

I understand Anders stated that {some scientist} has shown cheating

The parasite will florish but the whole system will lose functionality.

e-lon is actively-passive.

usually passive-integrative-attacks are more "devastating" than a quick "i 
am going to kill you right now" attack.

in resp. to (i think it was s. atkins re: energyflow.com):

i know that virtual-to-physical postal services have been available.  it's 
just that the way this service was represented gave me several ideas 
relating to the placement "materialization engines" in strategic parts of 
the commercial (or high-transfer) world.  since everything can be 
represented virtually, why not let a slick service handle the 
"actualization" and subsequent distribution of the object for you when you 
need it to be physical-- convenient virtual storage when passive.  i'm not 
talking about postcards*, etc.  energyflow's system is very cellular when 
you look at it from afar.  very supercytoskelton.  very beautiful.

*molecules you were working on, over-customized 'things', things, ideas,

It is all the standard charset, but several characters in A4 are set to show up 
in the 'Symbol' font, so if you don't have that installed they would appear 
rather oddly. Attached is a screencap of what that question should look like.

That "it decides" that there exists a non-arbitrary
ethical system is no different, so far as I can tell,
from "someone built it to be so nice".

You may mean that a sufficiently intelligent and objective
AI must deduce as a logical or scientific truth that a
certain ethical system is correct.  I've never seen any
evidence that such exists.

If an SI that at one time did control the entire Earth were
to break apart into sufficiently many pieces, as I was trying
to suggest, then any variation in acquisitiveness would result
from evolutionary principles in the more acquisitive growing
at the expense of the less acquisitive.

Indeed, they could come to such an agreement, but as I said,
if they are sufficiently many, then the agreement might be
as unstable as an oil cartel's.

Well, nothing is certain, but where there is vast potential,
very much diversity among systems results in that potential
being exploited.

Some futurists, I take it, pin their hopes on a single all-
encompassing AI that would take over the Earth and solar system,
and institute a permanent Pax by force.  That could happen,
though it's by no means certain that that's how everything is
going to shake out.  But even if it does, the argument I alluded
to above about the speed of light and local information processing
would strain the internal loyalty of such a system.

*Any* power would want to have an infowar program, esp. a ``superpower''.

Those who do not understand that, should upgrade their calendars to new
ones from the 21st century. ;-)

As in good ol' SSSR (``Russia'' for you Merrkans) one always read between
the lines in (the party line) news.

Doing the same here tells me that the U.S. govmint will want to put away
a lot of public money into the infowar program, and need to scare the
people, waving the Yellow Danger flag, so they will not complain about how
much money goes to the police state and the military complex (starving people
tend to forget even Pearl Harbors).

Now, all this is strictly between-the-lines reading so you should not take
it too literally.

   /What, me cynic?

Yes, I totally agree:  in my eyes it would be no less than
criminal to do otherwise.  For those who disagree with us:

Would your conscience allow you to leave adrift to die
people your find marooned on a raft at sea?  Would it
allow you to fail to resurrect humans who died in pre-history
if one day we can?  All these are extremely similar from the
kind of advanced perspective a benevolent AI will have.

Echelon penetrates the world wide communications network and eaves drops on
all traffic within it private or otherwise. Usually one needs a court order
to tap a phone, Echelon dispenses with this formality not only for Britain
and America but any foreign network it can access from its location.

Sounds highly penetrative and aggressive to me. Not that I'm complaining -
I'm British :-)

The Center for Genetics and Society are a new bioLuddite organization
specifically focused on raising the alarm about human genetic
enhancement, i.e. they are our specific political opposite. This is the
primer they have pulled together:

Well, I'm sure that Eliezer would be happy to sell you what he
intends to give away to the rest of us, and I'm sure that you'd
be happier paying him---so there's no problem.

I assume that you're not at all serious here:  the so-called
"altrusitic" legislators that you're speaking of, aren't they the
ones that pass a lot of laws restricting what other people can
do, and whose greatest desire is for more and more power?

Point taken: a businessman creating wealth in his own country by
raising and selling crops has plenty to complain about if some
altruistic foreign nation ruins him by giving food away for free.

Very true in all ordinary situations, but the Singularity could be
an extraordinary situation.

Well, looks like what I expected would happen: The flavor of this
website, its rhetoric and the educational and institutional backgrounds
of the people involved are all left-liberal "Guardian", using the
terminology I employed in my presentation at Extro5, but the issues are
presented in clear Green "Romanticist" terms, with a strong invitation
to making a united front with the traditionally religious, or
"Magicalists", again, using terms I employed in my talk.

This is the Iron Triangle I described, taking shape before our eyes: A
Guardian-Romanticist-Magicalist alliance, with an explicit goal of
throttling progress.

Actually, one doesn't need a court order to tap a phone *in a different
country*. This is the reason why Britain taps into US suspect lines and
the US taps into British suspect lines, so they can get around this
restriction. However, note that you have to be rather high on the want
list for the intelligence signals people to check on you. Regular
domestic criminal activity is not generally monitored for.

Neither country requires a court order to tap phone lines in any other
country.

Furthermore, this 'tapping' only works for networks which are unsecure,
and for unencrypted packets on the worldwide network.

No, it's passive. It doesn't actively penetrate anything, it sits there
and collects and scans data in the datastream as it passes by. 

Not to say that there aren't other methods to use for more targeted
scanning of more secure communications, but the use of such generally
doesn't occur unless you've already tripped the wire in the public
unencrypted datastream, or you've attracted attention by other activity.

Rights are not negated on the basis of cost.

If chimp rights of some kind are reasonable, and I believe they are, 
then the cost is not relevant.  I cannot say we should not support
something I otherwise believe in simply because it is not convenient.

Perhaps not in effect but if there are non-arbitrary ethical

our hypothetical SI.

There are many factors that make for the success, not to mention 
the well-being, of an entity or social group beyond mere 
acquisitiveness.  That is what I was trying to introject. 
Sometimes we seem to all but assume that acquisitiveness is a 
nearly unlimited good.

It might.  But I still hold out some hope of a vastly superior 
intelligence being a good deal more rational, ethical and 
valuing of cooperation and support among entities than humans 
generally are. I can't "prove" it will go that way. Part of why 
I cannot is the only way it will happen is by the decisions and 
understanding of the sentients involved, including ourselves. I 
cannot prove how we will in fact decide or that we will manage 
to act in conherence with our decisions.

I pin my hopes on all sentients of however much raw power coming 
to a mutual cooperative peace through realizing that they can 
all benefit much more from such an arrangement than from thinly 
veiled mutual distrust and soft (sometimes hard) war. Unlike 
hoping for a single SI to declare peace the possibility of what 
I hope for is directly proportional to what each of us decides 
and how each of us chooses to live.

I dont see how protecting chimps would cost more.  It would far cost less.
Humans are the lowest cost lab test animals there are.  They feed and
house themselves.  Chimps are very poor test subjects for a lot of reasons.
Not only are they very expensive and hard to keep, there are so many
crazed activists who will cheerfully bomb or burn your research facility
in order to free the test subjects.

New medications should be tested by volunteer humans.  If medications
are released on the unsuspecting public that cause hapless proles to
expire, that is the cost of our animal-rights society.

At the talk I attended last week, Greg Stock made an interesting
point about germ line engineering.  One of his quotes in this document
mentions it as well.  He suggested that germ line engineering was not
such a good idea, not because of any fears of making humans obsolete,
but because the engineering changes would be obsolete by the time the
next generation came along.

He said that it was possible to do genetic engineering in the pre-
embryonic stage such as adding a new chromosome, and arranging that the
new 'some would self-destruct in the germ cells of the new organism.
This would then leave a "clean slate" for the next generation to work
their magic on, which would be ~20 years more advanced.  Just like you
wouldn't want to use a 20 year old computer today, you wouldn't want 20
year old genetic enhancements 75 years from now.

I assume your use of the terms "label" and "pigeonhole" was somehow
meant to be critical.  I'll address that first.  The only way to get a
grip on phenomena as complex as culture and politics is through the
development of systems of classification, hopefully ones that represent
models of the substance and dynamics of those phenomena that are more
correct than not.  As I explained in my talk last summer, these three
terms represent my perception of the broad front of opposition to
progress.  This model represents a lifetime of study in the humanities,
in many cultures.  Although work in the humanities can never be as
rigorous as that in the "hard sciences", it does help to make
falsifiable predictions.  In this case, I have made one and it seems to
be verified, i.e. that "anti-transhumanism" would create a united front
of these three broad cultural phenomena.

As to how to counter them, I know of no more complete a response to
these various kinds of anti-progressive forces than has been synthesized
in the extropian community and the extropian principles, which is why
I'm here.  So much for the "arguments".  The issue is not philosophical
argument, but political and cultural action.  And unfortunately, the tip
of the advancing wave of science and technology has now prodded into
vocal action the forces arrayed against progress in the human condition.
These forces are entrenched, powerful and have the benefit of tens of
thousands of years of historical precedent and experience on their side.
To date, the cultural forces in favor of continued progress through the
"transhuman barrier" are not well organized.  On the other hand, they
have the powerful force of the market on their side: Even though
specific kinds of research and development may be outlawed and
stigmatized, the tectonic forces of innovation will continue to work
steadily to find cracks in the barriers thrown up by the
bio-conservatives. So, I continue to be optimistic, even if the current
period seems to be marked by defeats.

A while back someone posted a humorous skit about a fellow trying to
return a faulty singularity to the shop he bought it from, playing on
the dead parrot skit that Monty Python is famous for. I had suggested it
to Ziana for the Extropic Humor page but we can't seem to find it in the

I do not eschew ethics.  But the reason that I do not has
nothing to do with my intelligence, but with other ways
that I happened to have been programmed by natural selection.
I derived from thousands of generations of hunter/gatherers
whose environment, it turns out, happened to often favor the 
evolution of what we call ethical behavior.  Equivalently,
we may succeed in programming an AI to behave as if it also
had an ethical system we admire.

So a vastly more intelligent being that happens to obtain
from some puny humans writing a lot of code (that they 
really don't understand) may or may not behave itself.
If we're lucky, it will take over and be very nice.
Nice not because it reasons that it should be, but 
because its internal structure mandates that it
wants to be.

Sometimes circumstances favor cooperation.  In modern times,
for example, nations find it uneconomic and fruitless to
wage war.  But a thousand years ago circumstances were
different, and often the best way to gain wealth was to
take someone else's.  Any tribe or nation that eschewed
conflict got chewed up pretty quick.

80-something CBS 60 Minutes commnetator Andy Rooney was commenting on
how new inventions are generally just improvements over old
inventions.  Very interesting piece, in the way that only Andy Rooney
can be.  His closing line was "now, if they could only improve human
beings..."

I am with Andy on that one....

It's very difficult to identify with entities that don't mind
being treated badly.  For one thing, as a reader you need to
be convinced of an explanation for why they wouldn't mind.  None
was satisfactory.

I agree: it is completely unacceptable to inflict needless pain
and hardship.  Moreover, it's unrealistic.  I made plenty of
marginal annotations pointing out that even today animals are
invariably better treated.

> Why would it be so impossible simply to treat everyone with respect?

Quite right:  not only would it be possible, but 21st century people
would, for the most part, be very uncomfortable being so nastly to
conscious and sensitive beings.

This did not surprise me.  I bet that in a few generations, the
implications of materialism will have sunk in to a greater degree.
If all our intuitions about who we are come to be based on physics,
then folks will accept the reality that duplicates are selves.
Such a "death" is, physically, tantamount to the erasure of a day's
memories.

While people will never be able to "anticipate" being the duplicate
in the next room (or, the "archie" back home), they'll come to 
understand that the whole concept of anticipation is logically
unviable, and no longer allow feelings of "anticipation" to dictate
to them.

Though I should save it for another thread, I think that there are
three reasons behind the obvious deterioration that afflicts many
experienced SF writers:

1. the very successful ones (e.g. Brin) just don't have to 
   work hard anymore.  Worse, this can lead to appalling
   self-indulgence.

2. their erudition and experience within the field of SF
   itself becomes so great that they have difficulty
   writing for the unsophisticated amateurs that make up
   the audience.  Worse, style, wit, and over-wrought phony
   sophistication become everything, and the art of telling
   a story so simply that the reader forgets he's reading
   becomes lost.

3. SF is idea based, and after a certain number of stories,
   many authors really have nothing further to say.

Distopian SF is all right for me, as long as it's half-way believable.
And I agree with your assessment that this wasn't.

Would it not be better to be continuously adding to such genetic
enhancements, rather than re-starting with a tabula rosa in each generation?
To adapt your example, I would much rather try to upgrade a 1982 computer
than a Babbage Difference Engine. ;-) Of course, analogies break down at
some point, and here we see it rather quickly, but the principle remains the
same.

If one posits such technology as retro-viral genetic re-engineering, I can't
help but think it would be more efficient to do so on an already-enhanced
genome. Even if that genome is only enhanced +20 (on some arbitrary measure
of such enhancements), surely that's better than  employing the same
techniques on a non-enhanced genome.

The same goes for classic eugenics based on conventional breeding. Unless we
reach the point where complete customization of the entire genome is viable,
retroactive genetic enhancement can only be made more effective if applied
to a superior baseline.

Yes, but not only that, adhering to such usage distorts the
meanings of many other words.  The egoist theory of altruism has
us  believe that everyone does everything for a selfish purpose.

Consider the following dialog between A. Narasimha, a relief worker for
Save Bombay Babies Now, an organization arranging for foster care
for Indian orphans, and the asshole clerk in Chicago taking in
the donations:

the clerk:  "Lookie here, an anonymous contribution for $100,000 from
             some philanthropist.  That should help you out!"
Narashimha: (her eyes shining in amazement) "Wonderful!  I simply
            cannot believe the generosity of some people.  We are so
            enormously grateful!"
the clerk:  "Why?  Don't you know that the only reason anyone does
            anything is in their own self-interest, or what they
            perceive to be their own self-interest?  Rest assured
            that the philanthropist acted only according to his or
            her own desires."
narashimha: "That cannot be so!  It might be the case that no one
            besides the philanthropist himself or herself knows of
            this immense charitable act!  But even if you were right,
            we at SBBN must show our sincere gratitude any way we can."
the clerk:  "That's another thing.  Gratitude.  An outmoded concept.
            Since everyone does everything in what they clearly 
            consider to be their own self-interest, then logically
            gratitude makes no sense.  Or at least it shouldn't have
            any emotional content; at most, it could be an acknowledgment
            of debt...  to gain which is often the only reason that
            any act of so-called kindness ever occurs in the first place."

So... deconstructing the usual meanings of "altruistic", "selfish", and
"self-interested" leads us also to reevaluate what "charity", "kindness",
"consideration", and "sympathy" mean.

Now when we point out that successful economies depend on the self-interest
of the participants, we are saying something substantial, something that
shouldn't be trivialized.

Yes, and to miscommunication and confusion.

It was first meant to be descriptive.  But yes, I don't think 
such labels necessarily help us creatively deal with those 
opposed to what many of us would like to see.

Well, in all honesty, I think a lifetime of study should be able 
to yield terms a bit less broad and generally considered

I find that overly broad.  When science steps into areas that 
most people have not considered as changeable and they do not 
have the skills to think them through or a clear view of where 
the possibilities can lead, it is very easy to get paranoid and 
to oppose. That does not mean that all such people are genuinely 
opposed to progress in the human condition as such in the least. 
  But if we start out believing that they are so opposed it is 
much less likely that we will dialogue with them or reach them 
or even make much an attempt.  That is dangerous.

I do not agree with such an assessment.  People are not a 10,000 
year old trend although individuals may certainly be swayed as 
such.  It is people as individuals that need to be addressed 
imho and not a 10,000 year old trend.

Both conservative and more adventurous segments are needed in a 
healthy society.  The default with something new and potentially 
extremely disruptive is to hold off.  This is not altogether a 
bad safety.  We will move forward to the extent that we can show 
the benefits outweigh the risks and that the uncertainties and 
dangers can be understood and safely dealt with.  It will take 
getting enough people to see this to win the day.  At least it 
will this side of revolution, becoming criminals or starting our 
own country.

The "market" is a two-edged sword.  If corporations believe it is more profitable to continue to push older technology rather than new technology that may even make their previous product line obsolete, then they will oppose the practical application of new breakthroughs.

I am also optimistic.  But I am more so when we talk of 
converting our people "defects" into assetts as much as possible.

So why would it not turn out that any interacting sentient 
beings would find it beneficial to develop and practice ethical 
behavior?   We are talking about an entity that will be able to 
recapitulate all human thinking including ethics to date in 
vanishingly little time.  It will ultimately decide for itself 
what ethics to practice.

I don't think that it "taking over" is itself nice depending on 
exactly what is meant.  You cannot fix behavior in the internal 
structure of a self-evolving, super-intelligent being.  The very 
attempt would be unethical.

I believe that the long range or long view always favors 
cooperation.  As we increase in capabilities and in practical 
intelligence and in real abundance I find it much less likely 
that war would seem like a good alternative.  I didn't say no 
defense if attacked though.

Okay. I've had enough of this nonsense. One wonders how the CEO of a cmopany
(http://www.realnetworks.com/) that seems to technologically forward would
be so ass-backward when it came to biological issues. If money shelled out
for RealPlayer goes to support this kind of crap, give me MicroSoft Media
Player. And I shall be recommending such whenever the subject comes up at
work.

We need to apply our beliefs in the marketplace. It may be a small thing,
but such are the weapons our enemies use. We must as well. Boycott
RealPlayer et al!

Indeed. This is only the thinnest edge of the wedge designed to finally
bring about the radical animal rights agenda as coersive law. Do you really
think they'll stop at chimps? Mark my words; if this gets any traction (and
I doubt it will, but with a $1 million bankroll, it very well might-- I know
I could move mental mountains with such a cache of cash) cow, pig, and
chicken-rights will be coming down the 'pike right behind.

Termites have complex social interactions, and I don't know of any study
that has demonstrated that chimpanzee socialization is learned. Has anyone
removed baby chimps from their familial units, and seen if they developed
comparable social skills (doubtless not, because that would have been
"cruel")?

I am continuously amazed to see such fallacies trotted out as sensible
arguments. Just because a chimp can communicate at the level of a
three-year-old, does not make that chimp the moral equivalent of a
three-year-old.

I would question your assumption here, Hal. Why do you assume "we're going
to support animal rights"? I, for one, am in favor of "human rights" taking
precidence over "animal rights".

I can't believe you're seriously proposing this. They are animals-- they are
incapable of abstract thought, and incapable of moral decision-making.

Rights bear with themslves commensurate responsibilies; animals such as
chimpanzees are incapable of fulfilling those responsibilities. Does a chimp
comprehend the idea of personal property? Does it understand the rule of
law? Until and unless you can prove otherwise, I see no reason to grant
rights with no responsibilities.

Chimps are resources, to be used for humanity's benefit.

I don't see it primarily as an issue of cost, although the economic argument
only adds to the rest. It is an issue of law, and the mis-application of law
intended for rational, self-aware beings capable of abstract thought to
animals who are ultimately driven by instinct, no matter how they might ape
(pun intended) human behavior.

I think someone mentioned this sf novel a little while ago. I've just read
the British edition. It's a rip-snorting noir conspiracy thriller with some
intriguing biological ideas. Bear makes a point of thanking Max More and
Natasha Vita-More in his Acknowledgments, and there is a convention of
`Prometheans' that sounds a little familiar; these extrope/Foresight
lookalikes have an elderly father figure, AY3000, who's dying (despite
years of calorie restriction); I suppose he's a blend of FM-2020, Leary,
and maybe Dr Rot Walford? The visible Prometheans are clearly a blended
composite, but i thought I detected a hint of Greg Burch in one character,
and maybe some of Max More (although I've never met Max).

Several extracts:

It turns out there's a gene called *hades* that does nasty things to
mitochondrial processing. Our hero seeks research funds from Montoya, a
Seattle Bill Gates/Larry Ellison billionaire.

======
	`Like a time bomb,' Montoya said. `Awful. I assume you've found a way to
defuse it.'
	`I'm close. The solution isn't simple, but it involves training bacteria
to pump in just the right amount of *hades*, at the right times--not too
much, and not too little. And we have to jam the tattletale signals from
our mitochondria. I'm pretty sure I can fool our bacterial partners into
turning back our clocks. We live longer--maybe a lot longer.'
	Montoya flexed his fingers and compressed his lips with something like
satisfaction. `Why go against the wisdom of nature?' he asked softly,
fixing me with a limpid stare. `Why live longer than the "judges" want us to?'
	`We're big kids now. We made fire. We made antibiotics. Did the bacteria
give us permission to go to the moon? We're ready to take charge and be
responsible for our own destiny. Screw the old ways.' (p. 31)

==========
[Betty is Montoya's assistant:]
	`I have one question,' she said. `Why do you want to live a thousand years?'
	I cocked my head to one side to work a crick out of my neck. `More is
better than not enough,' said.
	`Life is full of pain and disappointment. Why prolong the misery?'
	`I don't believe life is all pain and misery,' I said.
	`I'm a Catholic,' Betty Shun said, still searching my face with her eyes.
`I know the world is bad. My grandmother is a Buddhist. She knows the world
is illusion. I want to live a healthy life, a useful life, but I don't want
to live forever. Something better is in the wings.'
	`I'm more of a Shintoist,' I said. `I believe the living world is all
around us, thinking and working all the time, and that all living things
want to understand what's going on. We just don't live long enough to find
out. And when we die, that's it. No second act.'
	`You will push out others not yet born,' she said.
	`If the world is full of pain, I'll be doing them a favor,' I said
testily. I wasn't up to a sophomoric debate at midnight... (p. 70)
==============

[Candle, an NSA woman operative sez, outside the luxury supership *Lemuria*:]

	`You've been going around hat in hand, promising immortality to every
billionaire you meet...'
	`Yeah,' Carson [another cop] says. `Just what the world needs--immortal
plutocrats.'
	`My work is for everyone,' I said.
	Candle shook her head. `How noble. How incredibly naive. I *know* how
powerful men work. At NSA, we listen to their nasty little secrets all days
long.'
	`It's our right,' I insisted... `Who's going to tell us we can't live as
long as we want?'
	`They are,' Candle said, pointing to the *Lemuria*. `Every rich son of a
bitch, fat cat, church leader, yammering populist, self-righteous fascist,
Communist, nationalist. They'll call it a sin. They'll make it illegal. But
what they'll really be saying is--' she pointed a tense finger into the
breeze--`it's wrong *for everyone but me*.'
	`We'll fight them,' I said.
	`No, you won't,' Candle said. `She held on to the rail with one hand as
the sea got heavier. `*You'll* have lots of clients. *You'll* charge them a
fortune. *I'll* lose, my children will lose. Everyone I know and care
about. The same people who pay off the politicians will pay *billions* to
stay alive.' [etc] (p. 297)

===============

Alas, the book falls to pieces toward the end, unless it's *way* cleverer
than I'm able to uncover on one quick reading. I think it just got away
from Bear. He even lists two pages of inconsistencies and dropped threads
near the end, as a way of revealing to the bemused, harried narrator--and
us--how complex the conspiratorial world is. Yeah, right.

Rats, I often get emails from my darling "ex" whose name is "Randy" (coupled
with the fact that I know he has a fondness for Andy Rooney ... this made me
jump to the wrong conclusion).   My post below was intended for him (the
right Randy).

Faster, faster faster!  (Oh, dear, life is going by at such a blur these

Could you expand on what you see as the foundation of rights and what
allows you to distinguish morally between the chimp and the child?
Later you write:

> Rights bear with themslves commensurate responsibilies; animals such as
> chimpanzees are incapable of fulfilling those responsibilities. Does a chimp

But this would apply as well to the child.  So this must not be the
foundation on which you would grant rights.

We are also faced with other cases, such as a mentally disabled human
being who is stuck at the mental level of a small child, or a human
being who is in a vegetative coma from which he will not recover.
Should either of these classes of people have rights, in your view?
And if they should, can we easily explain why they deserve this privilege
while equally capable animals do not?

Another point which I keep in mind when discussing rights is this:  The
first question to ask is, to which beings will I extend the courtesy of
treating them as if they have rights?  If I interacted with a chimp,
would I treat it respectfully, or as you say, merely as a resource to
be used for my benefit in any way I saw fit?  Only after being able to
answer this first question to my satisfaction am I ready to tackle the
much harder issue of whether I would seek to compel others to follow the
same decisions I have made.  Am I so sure I am right in extending rights
to chimpanzees that I want to force everyone else to extend those same
rights as well?

This analysis helps me to keep in mind that when faced with a difficult
moral question, such as the proper treatment of higher animals, the
uncertainty I feel about right and wrong should make me doubly hesitant
to try to tell other people what to do.  If I am not even sure about
what is right for me, I should not be claiming to know what is right for
others.  Such a claim requires a much higher level of moral certainty.

After the 9-11 attacks we have seen everything proposed
on this list ranging from nuclear annihilation of America's
enemies to unconditional surrender to all terrorist demands.
Yet most of us would likely agree that during the entire debate,
we saw not one thing that sounded like a real solution,
or anything that appeared deeply insightful from the
extropian community in all of the profuse commentary.

At the Foresight conference that just ended, there was a
poet, Fred Turner, who got it closer to right than anyone.
He read a poem that was met with thunderous applause
from what would have to be called a difficult or demanding
audience.  This is someone to watch.  spike

As Mike points out it isn't apparently illegal to tap someones phone who
isn't in your country, it is presumably only diplomatically impolite if you
get caught. In any case since Echelon is a joint American British program if
it is technically illegal it doesn't matter because the government supports
it and publicly denies its existance.

Besides, Echelon's primary purpose is not so much to eaves drop on British
American communication though it does, but rather on other countries
networks. It's the piece of kit responsible for recording your phone
conversation if you mention the words bomb or assasination on a libian
payphone, or any other for that matter.

I don't know if it extends to internet datqa - email etc but if it doesn't
you can be certain something else does. Addmittedly I have to agree with
Mike that it is passive by comparison to acts of all out Hack attacks, but
we have long experience in treading that fine line very well - so we get
away with it.

I don't have time to read them all and it's not obvious to to me, but
which poem did he read there?  Or is it not at his site?

 Starting in 1972 with his audaciously imaginative first novel, WHAT

And just think, when we recognise chimp rights, that lawyer who is
arguing for them will them file suit against every medical university
and biomedical research lab and company for reparations for hundreds of
years of simian slavery and torture. Curious George's author and
publishers will be sued, and the book banned from libraries for use of
the disparaging terms and depictions of the simian slave trade... the
movie King Kong will be burned in the streets for promoting hate of
simians.

And you thought there wasn't a money angle on this story.... ;)

Saturday the 4th of May 2002, in London, we are holding the second
(monthly?) ExtroBritannia lunch. At present, there should be six of us.

The venue, this time, is the restaurant overlooking the river at the Tate
Modern - for details, maps, etc. see:

<http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/information.htm>

We'll meet at 12 am on the 4th floor. Judging by the map there seems to be a
cafe there, near the escalator. See:

<http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/galleryplan.htm>

It would be a good idea to book a table, so I would be grateful if anybody    
interested could RSVP me (either                                              
on or off list, or through the ad hoc ExtroBritannia list :

The law is pretty clear that you can listen in to any conversation that
comes to your phone. A TCP/IP network is really just a modern version of
the old 'Party Line' phone system, where several residences were on the
same phone line, calls for each being distinguished by the pattern of
rings. Today, the 'pattern of rings' is distinguished by your IP
address, but packets addressed to other IP addresses assigned by your
local ISP can be sniffed right off of your dial-up phone line or full
time broadband connection. If you are attached directly to the backbone,
you can sniff any and all packets that pass along that backbone.
Technically, this is not eavesdropping, although spoofing someone else's
IP addy to sniff their packets is itself a crime of a different type.

A wire-tap is a data shunt attached to a line by a third party who is
not authorized by both parties involved in the contract for that line.
For the government to do so within its own jurisdiction is ONLY illegal
in that evidence gathered by wiretaps not authorized by a judge is
inadmissibile in court (as is any evidence derived from that gathered by
the tap). 

This distinction is of primary importance in the intelligence community.
When it comes to intelligence operations which are going to result in
covert action rather than criminal charges levied in court, an
intelligence agency has no legal need to obtain a court order for a wire
tap.

Where the law comes into play on the domestic scene is that the only
federal agency empowered to wire-tap within the territorial US is the
FBI, since they are in charge of domestic counter-intelligence. The
CIA/NSA/NRO/DIA/etc are all banned by post-Watergate/ABSCAM era laws
against spying on American citizens within our borders. They are free to
eavesdrop on anybody they want outside our borders, and require no court
order to do so. This situation is reciprocated by the British. 

As a result, the British spy on American citizens for the US government,
and the US govt spies on British citizens for the British government.
Just part and parcel of the 'special relationship' we have between us.

Together, we spy on everybody else.

As anyone who has read Cryptonomicon (by Neal Stephenson) or is
themselves a phreaker of sorts, it is possible to tap into the keyboard
strokes of a computer by using an antenna to receive what are called Van
Eyck Radiation.

I am wondering if a similar technique could be used to tap into a secure
network by reception of ghost signals that are reflections of packets
that are normally blocked by a firewall.

I got the impression the poem in question is so far unpublished in electronic
form. 
He did another great one on making the Eritrean desert bloom that was long but
also very moving. I hope to convince him to provide me with e-copies of both,
but first publication of poetry is a significant thing and I want to respect
his wishes (as yet unknown) rather than willy-nilly posting. For now, I'd
suggest goo0gling on his name and the key words "hate America" and seeing if /
when it turns up...

I'm not sure about this, I thought there was a presumption of privacy
which would restrict what the government could do without a court order.

But you're saying that if they don't intend to use it in court, any
government agency can wiretap anywhere in the U.S. without restriction?

So now you are saying that only the FBI can wiretap in the U.S.?  But
if they are not going to use the results in court, do they need a court
order or not?  Earlier you said that the government does NOT need a court
order to wiretap if they aren't going to use it in court.

Now this doesn't make any sense at all, given the above.  Either the
data is going to be used in court or not.  If not, you said above the
the U.S. government can wiretap on its own citizens with impunity.
So there would be no need to use the British.  If the data is going to
be used in court, are you saying that the government would walk in and
say, we couldn't wiretap this American citizen, so we got the British
to wiretap him for us, and here is the result of this British wiretap
on American soil?  That's hard to believe.

Well, I'm rather exasperated with the fact that while these groups (like
the Center for Genetics and Society) are continuing to raise money, even
within the ranks of the techno-elite, all that occurs on our side is
mail list discussion and little else. Pro-Act is stillborn, as far as I
can see, and the wishy-washiness seen on this list and elsewhere, the
damnation of extremism and vehement advocacy of any kind (recall that
Eva Peron said, "If not for extremists, nothing would ever get done.")
seen on this list, and the sort of detente rapport building strategy
being advocated by the current staff of Pro-Act demonstrates to me that
there is a need for a group willing to take action at all levels for our
agenda. Since my rants a few weeks ago about a lack of activity at
Pro-Act there has been a stunning silence toward my repeated offers to
do fundraising for Pro-Act.

As a result, I am announcing that I would like to recruit some
volunteers to form an exploratory committee to launch the Center for
Transhuman Development, which will be a political action/grassroots
organizing advocacy group to represent the Transhumanist agenda.

There are two sorts of people we want: People willing to dedicate a
significant portion of their time or a significant amount of money. We
will be following a 'lead, follow, or get out of the way' attitude. If
this announcement is met with a similar silence from the transhumanist
community, I will thereby declare the surrender of the transhumanist
movement to the forces of luddism and get the argument over with once
and for all.

The US does tamper with core routers and such sold abroad.  Though the
US government denies knowledge, I distinctly remember the French being
furious a few years back when the French government discovered that some
of their core networking boxes which had been purchased from a major
American networking company were quietly forwarding interesting traffic
to parts unknown. The French had been using the routers for years; they
didn't even consider the possibility that their network systems had been
"rooted" the day they bought them. They knew they had been leaking
intelligence like a sieve, but it took them quite a bit of
counter-intelligence work to figure out that the US had back-doored
their networking hardware. IIRC, they finally figured it out through a
counter-intelligence analysis of the GATT treaty negotiations.

Which is all the more reason to use encryption on your own networks,
rather than only using it when you connect to remote sites.  You rarely
know if your own hardware is actually "friendly".

As long as there more than a handful of other intelligences on                
the planet, they will represent a threat to an SI (and probably               
themselves).                                                                  

In the future, our powers will be enhanced by technology.                     
Perhaps we will all have back-yard fusion reactors.  The power                
to do harm to the system through misuse will be magnified.                    

I agree that cooperation is the best approach, but it only takes              
one misbehaving entity to ruin it all for the rest.  Evolution doesn't        
respect rules, only opportunities.                                            

That leaves only a few solutions for a stable world in which                  
intelligence can survive.                                                     

1) The biggest SI on the block assimilates all other intelligences            
as simulations.                                                               

2) The threat of mutually assured destruction keeps all intellects in line.

3) Intelligences leave Earth and colonize other worlds so that                
they cannot be assimilated.  This is workable until we develop                
interplanetary strategic weapons. ;)                                          

As for whether assimilation is "nice"...

Imagine that you had the power to absorb humans as simulations.               
These simulations might use only a fraction of your resources, and            
need never die.  They could even live eternal lives in a virtual heaven.      
Then you look at the Middle East conflict.  You think "Hey! Those guys        
are gonna hurt somebody, or themselves.  They might even set of               
WWIII.  I'll do them a favor..."                                              

Even a benevolent SI can see the good in this proposition.

I don't believe this analogy is considered legally valid.  Do 
you have some legal eveidence that it is?  If it is then this

Has anyone really proposed unconditional surrender to all terrorist

Did he offer solutions or did he accurately express our feelings about 
current events.  I find that solutions hardly ever meet with thunderous 
applause.  What resonates with us is an accurate statement of what we 
already feel.  Since we don't have solutions yet, they necessarily seem 
strange and alien to us.  Solutions that feel right usually are not 
really solutions, but are a reversion to some imagined status quo or 
previous state of being before the problems arose.

Do you have the name of the poem he read, or a description of what it 
was about?  I can't find it on his webpage, but I am not sure what I am 
looking for yet.

No.  Weak encryption is easily decrypted by large government computers.  
Strong encryption is illegal to export, and so further investigation is 
warranted because of a possible export crime.  Strong encryption coming 
into the US that was not originally funded from US sources merits 
further investigation for possible terrorist connections or activity by 
foreign governments.  I can't think of any type of traffic that is 
excluded from these systems.

It IS illegal to eavesdrop in American and Europe.  What is lacking is 
the jurisdiction to prosecute another government for spying on your 
citizens.  The countries simply do not push the issue too far because 
both sides of the Atlantic are doing it.  This in no way makes it legal 
under any country's law or under international law.

Echelon eavesdrops on every conversation, and records every word you 
say.  It then searches for keywords.  It is not limited to public 
payphones.

The Internet spying software is called Carnivore.  It is not passive.  
ISPs in America were forced by executive order to make special changes 
and cooperate to enable this spying.  Companies that were not compatible 
or cooperative with the government were threatened with being shutdown.  
Carnivore also includes viruses and trojan horses to deliver spyware 
onto systems under surveillance to enhance its capabilities.  The system 
does not passively listen to public unencrypted messages sent over the 
Internet.

I don't know whether listening in on keyboards has been demonstrated
in practice, but the idea has been floating around for some time.

When you send an electrical signal down a wire, you experience
attenuation:  The received signal has less energy than the one fed
in at the source.  For a long time, outside power transmission,
engineers didn't care too much where the energy was going.  Probably
heat deposited along the transmission line, negligible at typical
power levels.  However, as transmission frequencies rise to, well,
radio frequencies, energy is increasingly radiated away.  In recent
years this has become a substantial concern because of the resulting
radio interference with wireless and even other wirebound services.
RF screening has become a major effort in the design of microelectronics.
One remaining aspect that so far has received little attention in
civilian engineering is that the RF noise can betray sensitive
information.

The keyword for further reading on this topic is "Tempest".  The
military has been concerned about RF leaks for a long time.  Standards
how to shield sensitive areas have been around for decades.  Basically
you put everything in a big Faraday cage.  No windows, metal mesh
or sheet metal on all walls/ceiling/floor, airlock-style doors.
The tricky part is shielding power and communications lines because
these can serve as conduits for EM radiation.  The more paranoid
protection levels resemble locking yourself in a bank vault.

Eavesdropping on RF "noise" is the domain of the sigint community,
i.e. the spy organizations, and they don't talk, so there is little
public information on the exact techological possibilities and
limits.  There's a Computer Security Group at the University of
Cambridge/UK who occasionally does some interesting work in that
area.

People with a penchant for paranoia should keep in mind that there
are a variety of more straightforward approaches applicable to soft
(civilian) targets, such as social engineering, burglery, physical
taps, and rubberhose questioning.

Clearly, yes.  There are only three options: altruism, in which
only the benefit to the recipient of the action is taken into
account; force, in which only the will of the actor matters; and
trade, which is voluntary exchange to the mutual benefit of both.

Quite a few rational actions /appear/ to be altruistic. For
example, I happen to be one of those die-hard libertarians who
nonetheless thinks that some forms of welfare are not necessarily
evil, because they may benefit the providers in the form of less
crime, stimulating risk and creativity, and other effects.  I don't
like the really stupid forms, and I don't appreciate being taxed
for it, but if I were offered a free choice of private governments
to subscribe to I might very well choose one that offered such
services.  Not because of some feeling of social obligation, but
because I rationally believe such a system might benefit me in the
long run.

I' don't know what specific things you think I "now disparage as
irrational".  Perhaps if you offered examples, I could offer more
specific analysis.

Is it possible to change the infrastructure to include poster's email
address in messages posted via BBS? Otherwise, it's indistinguishable from
anonymized non-subscriber posts. 1) This invites abuse 2) doesn't allow to
send comments to the author via private mail without going through the
list (which the author is probably not subscribed to).

Not to mention that the "if" there is complete nonsense anyway.
Even after decades of research attempting to teach chimps, gorillas,
and other apes something resembling "language", none of them, at any
age, after years of work, have acheived skills that any 18-month-old

    I recall some time ago a competition held in the late 90's where major
computer maufacturers volunteered thier systems to resist any attempt at
penetration; others attempted to break into them. I can't remember the exact
outcome suffice to say that the best machine there - an IBM mainframe of
some sort (I think) resisted the longest and took twenty something hours to
access, none held. The machine that broke it cost some $30,000 dollars or
so.

    I thought at the time that it made the concept of data security against
any well equipped individual a farce. Of course one acknowledges this
involved hardware in the public domain, or soon to be as most were
experimental and designed for the purpose of security. Imagine the
military/gov equipment which is always a generation or two ahead of
commercial markets.

If anyone recalls this competition you can correct my vagueness :-)

I think Mike is mostly correct, although it isn't as clear cut as a
normal phone wiretap because the courts haven't really settled the issue
conclusively as far as I know.  In a nutshell, email does not meet the
criteria of having a "reasonable expectation of privacy", and so is not
protected like a phone line. From a legal standpoint, email has the same
status as a postcard (no reasonable expectation of privacy), not a
normal piece of mail or a phone call.  The primary reason for this
distinction is that email message contents are not hidden from the
transit provider.

When the government wants to read someone's email, they have to get a
court order forcing the ISP to put a sniffer on their network, if they
don't have one already.  What the government does with the sniffer is
their business though, and once they become part of the transit network,
they can look at anything they want. So the primary barrier to the
government reading your email is getting a court order to put a sniffer
on your ISP's network.

I know of at least one case personally where a person had their house
raided based on information randomly sniffed in email (this fact had to
be disclosed to the lawyers). What the law enforcement goons didn't
intuit was that while that person was talking about
buying/selling/possessing things that make one eligible for half a dozen
felonies where they were living (in California), the email discussions
were about things in a remote jurisdiction where they owned a place and
no laws were being broken. The raid happened under the assumption that
the place they were talking about in email was the same as the place
they were renting.  Of course, this type of situation is the problem
with the concept to begin with.  Unless the investigation is grounded in
the occurrence of an actual crime (rather than the mere suspicion with
no additional context), this type of crap allows the government to run
roughshod over your rights willy-nilly without any recourse for the
citizen.  They government should not be allowed to even inconvenience a
person, never mind escalate it to the point of guys with guns kicking in
your door, without knowing if their "evidence" is even evidence of a
crime of some type. 

Cheers,

No. The FBI counterintelligence can wiretap anywhere in the US without
restriction (but nobody else) IF they are not going to use the evidence
gathered from it (or derived from it a la the 'poisoned vine' principle)
in legal proceedings. This includes mere suspicion, i.e. if there was
otherwise no reason to suspect you of anything prior to their tapping
you in their electronic sieve-net, then ANY evidence they gather as a
result of that new suspicion is tainted. The only legal proceedings
exempted from this are immigration/deportation proceedings.

No court order for domestic wiretapping that is not intended to be used
as evidence or to generate leads to produce evidence. This applies to
the FBI. Everybody else can't tap American citizens. Note that this
leaves open non-citizens to wiretapping.

Okay, lets try some scenarios to straighten this out:

You've got al Quaeda HQ in some cave in Lesser Al Cumquat, Dontundastan.
They are using satellite phones, CB radios, cell phones, short wave
radio, and even human couriers to direct a terrorist cell in the US made
up of non-citizen, illegal immigrants from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the
Islamist Republic of Britain. Al Qaeda HQ recently decamped from a
bombed out cave in the Khost region of Afghanistan, where they abandoned
a lot of information, including telephone numbers of the cell members in
the US as well as other cells whose members are planning to attack US
owned oil rigs in international waters.

So, we've got this intelligence that says that Ali Al Whack, Jumail el
Butface, and Aziz bin Smeghed are illegal immigrants in the US, are
members of al Qaeda, and as such are illegal combatants under the Geneva
Conventions. Under the Laws of War, the FBI could, legally, arrest all
three of them and execute them in the street under Summary Justice.

But the FBI and the DoD are a little smarter than that, since summary
execution would be letting these slimeballs off easy. Cursory
examination of telephone records shows that our buddy Jumail has been
making a lot of calls to Ottawa, Canada. Since Ottawa is tentatively not
part of the US (yes, its a courtesy thing...), the NSA is tasked to
Echelon the phone lines of our Jumails associates to the north, without
a warrant, and determines that there is another cell there that is
planning on attacking the US Embassy in Ottawa tomorrow. With not enough
time to go through diplomatic channels to stroke the sensitivities of
our Canadian neighbors, the US sends in a SEAL team to wipe out the four
baddies in their safe house, sweep up any useful evidence, and plant a
bunch of hashish to make it look like a minor drug gang rivalry
skirmish. SEAL's exfiltrate to Montreal, where they whoop it up on St.
Catherine Street for the night, then hightail it back across the
border...

But what to do about this domestic cell? Well, none of them are
Americans, so tapping communications between themselves and any foreign
phones is legal without a warrant, but there is the threat of
accidentally tapping a phone call made to the local Dominos Pizza by
Aziz for the Halel Pizza Special, so the FBI could cover it's behind by
getting a warrant for the wire tap just in case, but you never know what
do-gooders or Islamic Fundamentalist sympathizers may work at the
courthouse. So to be on the safe side, the FBI asks their British
Echelon counterparts to Echelon up the phone lines of Aziz, Jumail, and
Ali and forward to them only those calls belonging to non-citizen
immigrants or which are located in foreign countries, and to give them a
list via 'anonymous phone tip' of other calls made to American owned
phone numbers which might be of interest to tap under a properly
warranted wiretap.

So far, no laws have been broken. Now, another thing the FBI could do is
to check the criminal and immigration backgrounds of all owners of phone
numbers called by our intrepid three suspects. There is no suspicion of
any involvement in terrorism by these third parties, but if there are
outstanding warrants, expired visas, or employment in sensitive
positions (i.e. nuclear plant guard, secret service agent, postal
worker, etc) by these people, then they could become suspects worthy of
lawfully warranted wiretaps by court order, since they are either
already criminals, or else are under security restrictions that prevent
them from associating with the likes of Ali, Aziz and Jumail.

So far, no laws broken, no poisoned vines of evidence.

Now, if I were being extra sensitive to the tender feelings of the
immigrant community, I might just do the following: I'd first find out
everybody in the cell network. Then I'd tap every one of their phones,
put agents in their mosques, and try to get them recruited into the
cells. Then, whenever any of them were going to stage a terrorist
attack, I'd put out a national security alert, warning of a potential
attack in such and so region of the country targeting such and so type
of facilities or individuals.

Thus, I deter every attack by announcing ahead of time that I'm aware
that they are going to attack (thus eliminating their presumption of
surprise) and how. Gee, that sounds familiar....

After 6 months to a year or so of this, I've gathered enough evidence to
illustrate the entire worldwide network, including the individuals and
government agencies in foreign governments which are sponsoring it all.
I then let the dogs loose and roll it all up in one fell swoop, and bomb
the bejeezus out of the sponsoring governments, including those who
claim to be our friends but send hundreds of millions of dollars to the
families of 'martyrs'....

Ubiquitous weak encryption makes nontargeted (requiring very cheap
realtime cryptoattack) screening prohibitively expensive. Since strong
encryption has only marginally (doesn't apply if you're running a loaded
webserver without SSL accelerators) higher computing costs than weak
encryption you could as well use the real McCoy. When I call overseas
using SpeakFreely (DES, IDEA, PGP support) and verify the key fingerprint
I'm reasonably safe from eavesdropping, arguably even when resources of a
major government are being used against me in a dedicated fashion.

Cryptography is not limited to a specific country. Inventing a reasonably
secure block cypher isn't deep magic if you don't care about performance,
and hence can be done by any reasonably competent human anywhere on the
globe. Legislations vary, export is nontraceable, and once it's exported,
it's legal. The cat has been out the bag so long its kittens got kittens.

Marginally competently (professionals use one time pads anyway) done
cryptography is not the weakest link. Of course, there's value in psyops 
if it makes people communicate in clear instead of using even weak 
cryptosystems.

No, KPJ did not write that.  KPJ quoted Mike Lorrey's post.

As to the question at hand, I understand that U.S. government have released
``strong encryption'' for export for some time now.  Have they changed that?
I have seen no mentioning of it, anywhere.

As to encrypted traffic, knowledgeable people tend to think that No Such
Agency today has the computational resources to investigate, in real time,
all traffic going into and out of the U.S.  Also, such protocols as the GSM
phone A and B encryption protocols will offer no protection any more.

For a grounding in the real science on this issue, I recommend Terrence
Deacon, "The Symbolic Species".

Most of what is propagated about chimps' amazing language faculties is bunk.

The algorithms are not illegal to export.  If everyone has the 
algorithms and anyone with a bit of programming skill can 
implement it then the export restrictions are meaningless and do 
little but weaken American products and e-commerce.

Either you believe in the right to encrypt or you don't.  Using 
one or more of the "four horsemen" to justify lack of freedom 
and privacy is not, imho, supportive of either.

I would much rather have terrorists, child pornographers, drug 
lords and assorted evil persons able to also dependably encrypt 
their own communications along with everyone else rather than 
prohibit everyone from such means.  The latter would not even 
seriously slow down the true bad guys anyway.

They still can "claim" to investigate strong encryption.  It might have 
been exported before the ban was lifted.  It might be a patented or 
copyrighted program that is being used illegally.  Therefore some 
profiling methods still target strong encryption.  I believe the truth 
simpler than that.  They either haven't updated their procedures and/or 
they simply thing strong encryptors are more likely to have something to 
hide.

This was true decades ago.  I can only imagine that technology is much 
better today.

I don't agree these two exhaust the possibilites or at least I 
would add the caveat that many things consider to be "free 
trade" are neither free nor do they refrain from considerable 
effective force.

I am not convinced that a system of buying and selling as we 
have it today largely motivated and governed by financial profit 
alone is the best way to organize a society of free beings or is 
the penultimate that we should expect.

Yes.  And when the long run is indefinite lifespan with 
abilities to overcome most ill effects including poor 
programming and other problems, it becomes likely that caring 
for even those who seem currently most seemingly hopeless or 
unworthy has potential pay off.  Not of us ourselves would enjoy 
being terminated or left to the streets if we should fall ill or 
into a disasterous mememtic trap or simply fall behind the 
current burst of progress.  Why then should we consider it 
reasonable to treat others as we would not like to be treated by 
either comission or omission?   I think it is important when 
considering the type of world or system we wish to live in that 
we look at it from the possible "bottom" as well as from the 
hoped for "top" or at least "comfortable".  Good questions are 
both how you would like to be treated in such circumstances and 
how you believe you should be treated in such circumstances. 
The questions need consideration not only in the context of what 
is or was but in the fullest context of the abundance and nearly 
limitless life we say we hope for and work towards.

Human infants go through considerable effort to acheive the same 
results and any parent knows that the adult participation in 
such learning is not effortless either.

The point though is that these creatures are close enough to 
sentient levels we consider as possessing rights that it is at 
least questionable that we treat them often so poorly.   If a

I know that this technology exists and has for decades.  Despite what 
free-marketeers want to believe, the military is years ahead of the 
private sector when it comes to technology, especially spy technology.

Just to clarify, I do believe in encryption.  The above reasons were the 
claims that the government makes to justify decrypting private

It's not so much the tech - it's the logistics. Kind of like "1984"'s 
telescreens - how could they ever monitor ALL of them?

I would believe they have to capability to monitor any given line at a 
moment's notice - perhaps hundreds of thousands at once - but this is a far 
cry form recording every word.

This is incorrect. Only your own packets are delivered to you on your
dial-up or DSL connection, and all modern Cable systems only your modem
can decrypt your packets on the RF side, and only you packets are
delivered by the modem to your LAN.

This is true, sort of. But essentially all modern backbone connections
are point-to-point between routers belonging to major ISPs or carriers,
who can tap the traffic in the router.

You misunderstand me--the chimp does not have the potential to
develop even to the three-year-old stage, and any claims to the
contrary are bad science and wishful thinking.  There is plenty
of proof of apes' sentience elsewhere--as in their problem-solving
abilities, cultures, emotions, personalities, and many other things.
Language just isn't one of them, and using it as an argument
weakens the position rather than strengthening it.

Don't blindly accept what you see on PBS as if it's real science.

There is an option in the user preferences to make the email address 'hidden'. 
This is, iirc, selected by default. If a user were to deselect it, their email 
address should be displayed as the sender of the message.

If they're reading the list at the BBS, however, they would be able to see any 
such messages even if they are not subscribed to the majordomo email listserv.

There was supposed to be a debate this past weekend at the Foresight
conference between Greg Stock and Ray Kurzweil about whether biological
or machine technology would be more important in the major changes ahead.
I was not present, but it seems to me that Kurzweil has the stronger
argument, that machine technology will continue to advance much faster
than biology can.

Even without government restrictions, ethical considerations require
changes to the human genome to be done with the utmost caution and with
careful consideration of the possible outcome.  Since the unborn child
cannot give informed consent to the procedure, we must be very confident
that the intervention will be beneficial.  As a result we can't expect
very fast progress in engineering humans.

Add to that the fact that we have to wait for perhaps 20 years for the
engineered baby to grow to young adulthood before we can know the full
impact of the genetic change.  This means that dramatic changes can only
occur on the scale of decades to centuries.

Computer enhancements on the other hand can in principle remain on the
Moore's Law curve straight through to the nanotech era around 2020.
As the machines become more powerful we can also expect progress in
applying them to important problems.  With full nanotech we can have
high levels of AI and direct brain computer interfaces for effective
intelligence expansion.

All these changes seem likely to occur long before we could see
significant changes to the human genome, enough to create "posthumans",
which I would think will take several human generations.

Therefore I am not terribly concerned about the current neo luddite
movement's goals of preserving the genetic purity of the human race.
I agree that it is a sad and misguided effort and that it will hurt people
by keeping them from helpful medical interventions which can heal illness,
improve fertility and give children the best possible start in life.
But I don't see the technology of human genetic engineering as being
the primary driver for achieving spectacular human enhancements over the
next century.  For that I think we will rely more on machine interfaces.

Of course, the luddites are probably no happier about someone wiring
their brain into a computer than they are with someone selectively
giving birth to a genius child.  So there is still a battle to be fought.
I just don't think this particular one is that important, other than as a
skirmish which will help establish the initial battle lines and alliances.

Hal

You would have thought so.  However, Ray Kurzweil ended up arguing that
humans and machines would be integrated throughout and AI would never pull
ahead, while Gregory Stock much more sensibly argued that pure AIs would
have a tremendous advantage over biology.  The basis for Gregory Stock's
argument for a human future is that machines will pull ahead so fast as to
leave us to our own resources, and that uploading and brain-computer
interfacing is a problem so hard as to be infeasible, especially by
comparison with machine intelligence - thus leaving *us* with biology.

I and several others attempted to point out during the Q&A session that just
because uploading is hard for humans does not make it infeasible for machine
intelligences - which Gregory Stock concedes will exist and will even be
interested in helping humans - but Kurzweil did not use this argument.  Nor
did Kurzweil use any of Finney's arguments.  On the whole, I would have to
say that Kurzweil lost the debate.  Pretty sad.

As the father of a 12-month-old who is going through the rudiments of
language development, I can wholeheartedly agree with you here.

I disagree. If what you say is true (and I do not believe the case is made,
based on the available evidence), then they do in fact represent a threat to
Human dominance. A long term threat, granted, but no less a threat than the
Neanderthals posed.

As an avowed anthropocentrist, I see no need to advance the interests of
potential rivals. (As an aside, the same goes for AI, but that's a different
thread.)

Again, I disagree. "Rights", as such, are merely conventions that exist
according to the fashion of the day. They ebb and they wane, and the mere
fact that we can speak of creating new "rights" demonstrates that they are
not really existential at all-- they stem not from some "creator", but from
the societies in which they are formulated.

Thus, the decision to create a particular right (or extend certain rights to
certain beings) need not be "justified". It merely need be made and agreed
upon. Merely because chimps are cute and can mimick certain human behaviors
is no reason to extend to them human rights. They are resources, and as such
we as a species can and should use them for our own benefit.

You can't. The modem is decoding a single point-to-point

The only traffic on that connection is destined for

Not true. Genetic therapy of grown individuals is currently ongoing in
europe, with an experiment in France successfully altering the genomes
of patients stem and germ line cells. These patients suffered from the
"Bubble Boy" syndrome. Furthermore, cloning technology requires stem
cells from the cloned embryos of their adult patient to most effectively
grow replacement organs. These technologies, outlawed today, will start
impacting the health of millions of people within a few years.

Genetic therapies to boost IQ of children, and even adults, could be
developed within several years and implemented quickly thereafter. Note
that boosting human IQ will result in the Moore's Law doubling curve
contracting as the individuals developing computers get smarter.

Yes, but the laws are being written TODAY which will decide if any of
this will be allowed to take place. We are decades from full AI and full
posthumans, ONLY if laws do not get in the way. If they do, then don't
expect the singularity any time soon.

What technologies develop will be determined specifically by what the
law allows. From the current fear of technology that is driving current
luddite law, it doesn't matter WHAT technology eventually would get us
there, as soon as one technology shows promise of giving us that, the
luddites will move to outlaw it. The longer this goes on, the easier it
becomes for them to achieve. We have to start now in a big way to combat
them from the start.

No, the ultimate result will be determined by what happens NOW. Read
your Sun Tsu (I can guarantee you that the luddites have). He says that
the easiest victory is already won before an arrow is shot.

There are two reasons.  One, depending upon conditions, it
may or may not turn out that (what we would call) ethical
behavior is profitable or contributes to survival.  We
know that such behavior varies from culture to culture,
to some extent, and from species to species to a great
extent.

Two, the "interacting sentient beings" that you refer to
might require thousands of generations, as our ancestors
did, to be selected for a certain kind of behavior.  I
think that it's a mistake to believe that moral behavior
can be achieved by intense cerebration.  On the contrary,
feelings seem to be a primary component of "nice" behavior,
and those feelings in all the cases we know of, had to be
selected for by evolution.

But as I say, ethics stems very little from thinking.  For
the most part, all ethical systems are rationalizations
that come after the fact, after the behavior.  That's why
it's doubly amusing to hear some Libertarians try to excuse
their kindness towards strangers they'll never meet again,
or excuse other evidence of altruistic behavior, by rationalizing
that "really" they did it for a selfish purpose.

As Dr. Logic's example IMO showed, and as you yourself have often
agreed, "taking over" (as in, say, the current Middle East situation)
is almost the only ethical thing to do.  

Also, I do indeed think that it would be possible to fix behavior
in the internal structure of a self-evolving, super-intelligent
being.  Asimov made his Laws fairly convincing, and Eliezer's
Friendliness, it seems to me, might be built in at a fundamental
level in an evolving being in the same way.

I think that you are right.  War (or defection) almost always
has as a corollary the destruction of wealth.  Especially in
rapidly advancing/growing systems, cooperation results in more
rapid progress and greater wealth.  But this is only a generality---
after all.  We must keep an open mind in order to be able to
anticipate and then deal with the exceptions.

Subject: POLL: When would you enhance your unborn child?
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Here is a thought experiment presented in the form of a poll.  I think
it offers insight into some of the ethical questions regarding genetic
engineering of human beings.

Background: A few years ago researchers found a way to make "genius" mice.
They added a gene for the formation of a protein called NR2B which is
involved with learning and memory.  The resulting mice had cells which
were much more responsive to stimuli.  They were nicknamed "Doogie" mice,
after the TV show Doogie Howser about a young genius doctor.  In tests
the mice learned things more quickly and remembered them longer, both
signs of intelligence.  A Scientific American article is at
http://www.sciam.com/2000/0400issue/0400tsien.html

Question 1:

Suppose you have recently gotten married and are getting ready to
have children.  A group approaches you with a confidential offer.
They will perform an in vitro fertilization for you and add the NR2B
gene to the resulting embryo, re-implanting it for a natural childbirth.
The hope is that the resulting baby will be genetically engineered for
higher intelligence.  As a known Extropian they hope that you might be
willing to volunteer for this procedure.

Your response is:

A. Yes, I want to proceed with the experiment.

B. I want to wait for more data.
We can subdivide B into some categories:
  B1. I want to wait for more mouse tests to replicate the results.
  B2. I want to wait for the results to be replicated in another animal
      model like dogs or cats.
  B3. I want to wait for the results to be replicated in a primate model
      such as chimpanzees.
  B4. I want to wait for the results to be replicated in human beings,
      then I would be willing to go forward.

C. I would not agree to this procedure even if it had been proven in
   humans.


Question 2:

If your answer to question 1 was B or C, then the question is what
limitations, if any, you think should be imposed on other people.
Should they be allowed to take answer A and proceed with the experiment
based solely on the mouse results?  Or would they have to wait until it
was proven safe and effective in other animal models, or in human testing
(clinically supervised)?  Where do you draw the line for other people?

If you want to be truthful human nature is its own worst enemy.  Wouldn't it
be ironic if the machine intelligences we create one day decide that enhancing
the human genome is desirable to risking desabilizing  the  perfection of AI.
An AI luddite of sorts.  Actually each has its virtues.  The trick is to
preserve consciousness and allow it to migrate  from host to host be it
machine, meat or some novel creation loosely based on the former 2.

Here's a variant:

It has been found that raising children in cruel and painful circumstances
sometimes increases their IQ and artistic abilities significantly over that
of their siblings, sometimes to genius levels. Certain kinds of physical
impairment or long stretches of childhood illnesses, the sort that cause an
irremediable social gulf between ill child and healthier peers, augment
this effect. Would you choose to raise your child like this? Would you
allow medical researchers to trial a variety of different diseases and
minor mutilations on your young child in the expectation of an enhanced
chance of genius? Even if you find this personally abhorrent, do you as a
libertarian feel that it would be wrong to prevent other people's children
having the benefit of such treatment?

Thanks for the replay of this discussion.  I just wish I could 
have been there for it.  Although I was signed and paid up I am 
still not over this nasty all-so-biological bug that bit me just 
over 2 weeks ago.  It seems to hang on for 3 weeks in most 
people.  So I got halfway to the meeting on Saturday and felt so 
bad I decided I really should go home and sleep most of the day 
Saturday and Sunday.

Experiences like that sure make be more gung-ho for uploads and
medical nanotech!

It is an interesting twiste in the debate when both agree that 
the AIs will march forward regardless and the debate turns on 
wheter we will at least get augmentation out of it.  Whilte that 
might leave us "behind the machines" it certainly doesn't mean 
that biological advances will be "most" important.  The question 
is not well-defined to start with as it doesn't nail down the 
context of "important" - important in the number and scope of 
overall advances of originally earth-based intelligences or most 
import to us "orgas"?   If it is the first then there is 
probably much less question for many of us here that AIs will 
far outstrip in terms of cognitive power and number of advances 
in knowledge those who were once organic. If it is the second 
then I would still argue that non-bioenginnering technological 
improvements including medical nanotech and augmentation will do 
more to increase our range and accomplishments than more purely 
biological advances will.   I don't see how Kurzweil could lose.

No silence here, Mike.  Now is definitely the time for action, and I'd be
willing to offer whatever assistance that an unemployed International
Politics student in the upper midwest can.  Sign me up.

Since DSLs are attached to switches rather than just modem banks kluged
together on hubs (how ISP's used to do it), they get only the IP packets
that they are supposed to get, *as a full power signal*. This is not to
say that you couldn't look for ghost packets due to Tempest-type
radiation on the line, but you'd essentially have to just tape the whole
line signal, filter out your own packet traffic, then capture any
digital signals that remain above line noise, boost that amplitude, then
scan that for packet information. So you'd need something more than your
desktop PC and DSL modem alone to do this...

If you look at the internet as a universe of radiation, all of the
packets that switches  prevent from passing anywhere on the net
generates noise. These result in a sort of Cosmic Internet Background
Radiation level. The local switch, though, acts like a membrane, letting
properly coded spacecraft through. However, if you ding the membrane and
don't get through, you will create an echo which will be stronger than
the echos generated at successively more distant switches.

I have a somewhat different slant on the event.  I think Ray's
arguments were more concrete.  However I think Greg's arguments
will appeal to a much larger audience.  In general I would tend
to agree that Greg is better at debating than Ray.  You could
generally tell what point Greg was trying to make while that
wasn't always true with Ray.  [I asked Ray a question after his
earlier presentation regarding when he would personally choose to
spend his own money to purchase BDE to obtain the resources to
bootstrap an AI and he *completely* side-stepped answering it.
Ray's responses to Greg's points during that debate seemed in
many cases to have that flavor (at least to me).]  Greg's technical
merit score was low IMO, but because it matches the biases of the
judges ("natural" humans) it have significant merit.

Interestingly enough there was a side conversation between Greg
and Neil Jacobstein at my lunch table on Sunday -- though I was
only half listening to it, it suggested that Greg's arguments
(self-genome and children's genome enhancements do in fact
play well in Peoria).

This would make sense to me because the human instinct would
seem to be to trust an enhanced-human before it would trust
an "alien" AI (or even a human uploaded onto an advanced
computronium substrate).  Generally speaking, unless you
know the "moral code" of entities significantly different
from oneself (from amoral AI's to Fugu fish) it seems to
be an unwise strategy to assume they are "friendly".

Nature has certainly not programmed us to assume that.

As a result, I believe that Ray does have his work cut
out for him to convince large numbers of people that
out-loading/migrating the human mind is the best
strategy.  It might be the threat of real amoral AI's
that convinces significant numbers of people to do that
so as to level the playing field.

For me the entire discussion raised some very sticky
issues that were further emphasized by Neil Jacobstein
in several talks/discussions, essentially "How do we manage to
create 'safe' operating environments for sentient beings of
vastly different capabilities?"  *Or* do we say, sentience is
overrated and what matters is what you produce (e.g. survival
of the fittest)?

But I've discussed these problems before and will not
attempt to cast my vote at this point.  It would be
interesting to speculate on whether one could develop
a world/solar system where entities that punched out their
own cards when it became apparent (to an "entity") that their
"personal" vector was suboptimal.

One approach might be to run a number of "running scoreboards",
like they used to have with regard to the budget deficit or
the World's population, that ranked world "leader's"/terrorists
impact on the "net death toll" that their policies had caused.
Display them in Times Square, or at the Clock of Long Nows or in
several prominent newspapers, it might just have a significant effect.
(Remember -- the Net can trump information firewalls...)

First of all, I have to say that I have been immensely impressed by 
virtually all of Hal's posts in the past couple of months.  He got post of 
the month honors in Exponent last month, and he is currently the leading 
candidate to do it again in the next issue.  Keep it up!

Personally, when it comes to affecting me directly, I have to admit that I 
want to "wait and see" what happens after another person tries it.  Since 
misinformed research or unforeseen circumstances could mean the difference 
between years of moderately enhanced pride (I say moderately, because what 
father wouldn't be proud of his child?) or years of emotional sufferance, I 
would rather eschew the former than go through the latter.

So yes, I'm a B4.

I'm not one to interpret my opinions as being conclusively "right" or 
"wrong" for others.  I don't see why anyone else shouldn't have the option 
of procreating in the fashion you describe, regardless of limited 
information.  It reminds me somewhat of Heinlein's _Time Enough For Love_ 
where a set of genetically identical twins (male and female) are raised 
without any taboos about incest.  Eventually, once under the guidance of 
Lazarus Long, who determines that there probably shouldn't be much risk in 
procreation, he lets them do as they please.

Ultimately, if it isn't affecting anyone else in an obviously obnoxious 
way, I say "do what thou wilt..." etc.

It's almost irrestible to mind the business of others, but yes,
I'd disapprove of meddling.  Such use of force invariably 
proceeds from the assumption that we know better than others,
and, since they obviously lack the good judgment with which we
are so gifted, we must intercede by force after persuasion has
failed.

I'd pick one of those two, depending upon the details.

I don't think the procedure should be performed on humans until we've
done everything reasonable to ensure that it's safe and effective.

No.

Yes.

I'd draw it the same place I draw it for myself. Since we can't get
the subject's consent, we have to minimze the risk. We can't guarantee
there's no risk, but without taking such chances there won't be
advancement.

This NY Times article:

seems to document that Venter will,

"try to engineer microbes genetically to convert carbon dioxide
into hydrogen"

Lord, that's really great!  Merlin microbes with built-in fission
reactors that can utilize photosynthetic energy inputs to breed
carbon dioxide into hydrogen.  Now that is *really* *reeeeaaaally* cool.

Now, I think there is a huge energy loss here, but its about
time that we started paying back Nature for all the 'free' coal,
oil and gas energy we have been harvesting over the last several
hundred years.  Lets balance the books, Rah, Rah, Rah....

Lord, this fellow is just way beyond where I am.  Time for me

I wouldn't do it because this is a bad example - I would expect the NR2B

I want to hold off an answering my own poll until more people weigh in
but I'll go ahead and give my opinion on this one.  I think the issues
are somewhat different than in the case I gave because of the obvious
harm to the child in this scenario.

No, I would not raise my children like this, and in fact I would consider
it child abuse even if it does produce some geniuses.  So I would try to
stop other people from treating their children in this harsh way as well,
inflicting illnesses and isolation and cruelty on them.

What is the reason we want to make our kids smarter?  Is it to benefit
society as a whole, or is it for their own personal benefit?  In my case,
it is purely the latter.  I want my kids to have healthy, happy lives,
to feel good about themselves.  Greater intelligence can give them a
competitive advantage and give them more options in life.  Whatever
challenges they tackle, intelligence can help them with additional
insights and ideas.

Giving them intelligence at the cost of a harsh and traumatic childhood
would undercut that goal.  A genius created in this way is likely to
be unstable and burdened with psychological problems.  His gifts won't
bring him joy if he has not learned how to be happy as a child.

Creating intelligence through cruelty, supposing that it did actually work
(which I doubt), reverses the ends and means.  We want our children to
be intelligent to make them happy; we therefore should not try to make
them intelligent at the cost of this happiness.

Intervening in someone else's child rearing practices is of course a
major step which should not be taken without good cause.  Naturally it
will be a matter of degree as to when we should step in.  I would not
say that parents are obligated to sacrifice everything to the happiness
of the child.  But if the parent is actively working to make the child's
life harsh and painful in the hope that this will somehow turn him into
a genius, that crosses the line in my opinion.  I would intervene and
try to improve the situation.

This is a somewhat trivial clarification, but as I recall the precise point
Heinlein was making in the tale is that the `monozygotic twins', being the
result of a painstaking genetic procedure, had *no* alleles in common. This
allowed Heinlein to unpeel the social element of the incest taboo
comprehensively from any biological rationale. (I'm not certain that
genomic imprinting would permit this to be done, in reality.)

That kind of apparent casuistry might become increasingly important as we

Well, I'm gonna have to disagree with Eliezer.  I think both participants
held their own quite well, though if I had to pick a better debater I'd pick
Ray everyday of the week and twice on Sunday.  Eliezer knows the issues so
well I think he may be reading more into the debate than what actually was
said.  OTOH, maybe I don't know the issues well enough and I missed the
subtle falacies in Ray's argument, but it seems to me that these kinds of
constrained and restricted dialogs - on stage, under a time constraint,
responding to one another's specific comments and not necessarily expounding
complete and completely accurate scientific explanations, trying to respond
to as many questions from the audiance as possible within a very limited
timeframe - it becomes rather difficult to judge someone's whole vision or
thought process on as complex a subject as AI vs. genetic engineering vs.
cyborgery in that kind of chaotic situation.  Far from "sad" in my opinion.
I thought it very constructive dialog and a great debate.

Where to start?
   1) As soon as you get into capturing of any signal other than the
primary digital signal, you need very sophisticated
equipment, far beyond what most of us can cobble together in the
basement. It's almost always cheaper to use a different sort of attack
such as breaking into the target's house, unless the target is really
serious about defending the data.
   2) DSL is RF imposed on the phone pair. It radiates all over the
place, especially into other copper pairs in the same cable.
   3) The trunk side of a DSLAM is almost always a fiber-optic (OC-3 or
better.) You will get essentially no cross-talk from the DSL onto the
fiber. Upstream from that you have still more fiber. Every time an
optical signal (O) must be reshaped, it is converted into an electrical
signal (E) and back to O via a process known as O-E-O regeneration.
Each O-E-O is an essentially perfect filter, rejecting all crosstalk,
and the fibers don't radiate.
   4) There are some very odd forms of "cross-talk" in the purely digital
domain, but they are so subtle as to be of no practical use except to
deliberately send data seriptisciously. Example: a sender may craft a
data stream that imposes an intermittent load pattern on a router. This
will affect the delay seen by other data streams. You can analyze the
delays statistically and use this phenomenon to send data. Again,
it's much cheaper and simpler to use steanography or other techniques
in almost all cases.

Yes, as I was writing my post I thought about getting more specific about 
the Heinlein example, but I didn't want to get sidetracked, as I am 
occasionally wont to do.  For the many list members who haven't read that 
fine book (which I quite highly recommend, btw), I wanted to keep the point 
basic.  You are correct though, Damien, in that I should have been more 
precise in my description of those twins.  Monozygotic.  No 
alleles.  Painstaking procedure.  I'll know better for next time.  :-)

                                                 Casuistically,

I have worked wth Tempest technology.  It is extremely easy to detect 
keystrokes.  Imagine a very sensitive radio device listening to the 
electromagnetic click of the little tiny switch inside every key.  Now 
imagine that you measure every aspect you can about the click, its 
duration, frequency, waveform, echo, number of subcontact clicks, etc.  
Every key will sound different.  Recording every keystroke simply gives 
you a cipher code, where it is trivial to figure out which key is which 
letter.  In English text, for example, the letter "e" is the most common 
character.  Statistically analyzing text will show the most common 
keystroke to be an "e".  Plus old cryptographer's notes help here.  The 
letter "I" and "a" are the only common one-character words in English.  
Periods occur at the end of sentences.

The same information is available from the fonts appearing on your 
screen.  Your computer screen gives off a radio signal.  While the 
picture is not changing, the signal is static.  When you type one letter 
at a time, the signal changes a little at a time.  The amount of each 
pixel changes the radio signal.  Measuring the minute changes being 
typed is the same as measuring the keystrokes.  Special fonts have been 
developed where all the letters have the same radio frequency values and 
cannot be distinguished.

Believe it or not, similar information can be read from the power draw 
of your computer.  I have not seen this applied to keystrokes, but to 
actual cpu instructions.  Each cpu instruction takes a slightly 
different amount of power depending on how many bits are manipulated in 
memory.  This minor fluctuation is so small compared to the larger 
hardware, that it is actually easier to read.  Imagine huge sign waves 
of major power fluctuations, with minuscule waveforms along the line.  
The giant waves have no affect on the readability of the minor waves.  
Computer CPUs are so precise in their minor power fluctuations, compared 
to lights, motors and appliances, that they are easily discernible from 
the other noises.  Having multiple computers don't matter, since the 
combined signals are easy to separate due to the CPU's precise timing 
patterns.

A related technology is ready disk drives and tapes that have been 
overwritten.  The bits of ones and zeros are actually small areas of 
magnetic fields.  When later bits are written, they do not align exactly 
on top of the previous bits.  Imagine two overlapping circles.   The one 
on top covers 90% of the area, while the previous bit value is a 10% 
crescent off to one side.  The second-previous value might be a 1% 
sliver, and so forth.  I personally have ready data up to 8-9 times of 
overwriting.

There are also technologies to read the last image displayed on a screen 
before it was turned off.  I also have personally dumped a data 
dictionary out of a high-speed compression modem that revealed names, 
titles and numbers previously transmitted through the modem.  There are 
electromagnetic signatures everywhere.  All it takes is a sensitive 
device to record them, and mathematical software to examine them.

All four of these seem to be an obvious progression from experimental 
animal procedures to reliable human procedures.  The question is similar 
to asking, "Do you want an experimental animal veterinarian  to operate 
on you, or a trained experienced human surgeon?"

Give me repeatable human results every time.  Science demands repeatable 
results.  Why would I ignore science when it comes to my health?

If they were truly experimenting with their own health, that would be 
different.  But when they are using unproven experimental techniques on 
others (i.e., babies), that is another matter.  Self-experimenters 
should be given some leeway, but we should have zero-tolerance for 
experimenting on others.

Yes, this leads to the real-world situation that human cloning should be 
banned until we get it working in animals.  Current animal cloning 
techniques kill or deform hundreds of times before a single 
normal-appearing specimen is obtained.  This low-success rate is not 
acceptable in medical circles for any elective procedure.

My kids have turned out to be pretty smart all by themselves :-) ...
however, if I thought there were enough benefit likely, and could be given
enough extra information, and was intending to have another child, then yes,
I'd probably volunteer (my unborn child), ie: my answer is A. If I were
unsatisfied with the available information, I might fall back to B2.
However, I'm not sure that replicated or extra animal tests would tell us
much; doing this stuff in humans is pretty much the only reliable way.

The basis of my reasoning for saying yes is that, given the possible
benefits are huge, and given that this is an unique opportunity, can I deny
this to my unborn child? 

Other factors would influence my decision:

Reputation:
Who is the group? Does it include someone like Lord Winston? Yes? Then I'm
in. Is it headed up by Dr. Antinori? Yes? Then I'm out.

Further information:
Were there any problems in the mice? What kind of effect is predicted in
humans (details)? Where did this gene come from? Are there already humans or
animals with it occuring naturally? If there are humans, and they are ok,
then I'm far more comfortable with it. Is it possible to stimulate
production of NR2B in an existing organism without the gene. If so, has it
been done, and what were the results? etc...

Reversibility:
How likely is it, in the researchers' opinions, that the proteins could
cause irreversible damage during development? Can the researchers forsee a
future method for turning off the gene if it turns out to be unwanted by my
child at a later date? How reversible would the effects be, speculating
about future developments?

Even if I ended up falling back to some B variant, I would support other
people in choosing A. However, I do think some (government enforced)
safeguards could be appropriate:

- I don't think it would ever be appropriate for parents to accept such
procedures on the unborn in return for money.
- It would be a very good idea to have a process in place to ensure that
parents give informed consent. It should be ascertained that a parent truly
understands the ramifications, before being allowed to proceed. This might
even involve taking a course and passing a test.
- Finally, I believe such procedures should be public knowledge, open, to
ensure that the above safeguards are being upheld correctly.

I would happily submit to such safeguards. In the absense of them, however,
given the above scenario (which implies a level of secrecy) I'd probably
still proceed, as stated.

One of my game settings ("Artilect Earth") postulated a future in which the
more-or-less accidentally created self-improving uberAIs had their
singularity in nothing flat and got on with their lives, leaving humanity to
make sense of it all and have a more "traditional" scifi future (think
Transhuman Space) as rats in the metaphorical walls. Very large walls, of
course, the whole of potential human experience. If you're in the walls,
you've no idea what the rooms even are. A future in which continential North
America is computronium, the solar system is seeded with trillions of tiny
computronium satellites, Jupiter is being dismantled, the AIs are sending
out von neumann nanoprobes, and human-type intelligences have yet to
reliably communicate with the self-improving AIs due to the differences in,
well, everything important.

The Greg Bear moment for that setting was that the artilects found the
Solipsis, intelligence encoded in the vacuum that was as far beyond them as
they were beyond humanity, and just as different, alien, and
incomprehensible. But I digress.

Anyhow, thought experiment:

1) nanotech is available
2) you are uploaded, with the potential to experiment and self-improve
3) do you hang around for the laggards or see how far the highway goes?

One could argue that all it takes is one person to decide to fill any given
role, from go for broke subliming through to transition guide. Substitute AI
created by person for specific task if necessary. Once we've figured it out,
all possibilities become possible -- I don't think there's any real first
mover advantage to transcendence.

Even there I'd want to know how this works and how the human system differs 
from the target primate.
Our brains evolved substantially from even nonhuman apes.  I'd also want to 
see lifetime studies - e.g.
do subjects tend to forget too easily, become too chimerical, or develop some 
other mental limitation?
This is basically fiddling with an evolutionarily tunable dial - there will 
be a reason for the current 
human setting.

In terms of limitations, I'm confident enough in natural human care for 
children and natural human caution
that I think virtually nobody would take boneheaded risks on this. A few will 
take risks, but not enough 
to make a difference to society or me.  I would apply suasion to convince 
people to follow a policy no
riskier than mine.

I'm not sure why you are using genetic enhancement and biological technology
as synonyms. Perhaps this was the line being pursued, but it seems clear to
me that biological enhancement and modification of humans can happen in many
more interesting and rapid ways than by modifying the genome of embryos.

I'm probably going to get this wrong, but I'll give it a go. Firstly, my
understanding is that with gene therapy, we will use modified bacteria to
modify the genes in somatic cells, thereby allowing us to alter fully adult
humans. The logical extent of this is the ability to perform some rather
radical modifications on adults, purely biological.

Next, of course, is nanotechnology. The accepted path to full blown nanotech
is via taking control of cellular mechanisms of protein production, and
harnessing them to build new machines (proteins) of our own design, which
can eventually bootstrap us into non-biological nanotechnology. This is
underway; the current study and simulation of protein folding is I think the
frontline.

This kind of harnessing of the existing abilities of cells is a new
biological technology with incredible ramifications. The potential in the
medium term is to create self replicating micro-scale biological machinery
which can perform very specific tasks. With this level of technology, and
wholy aside from non-biological nanotech, we will have the power to
understand human biology to a far more fine-grained degree (because sensors
can travel within us to gather information); we will have the power, with
that knowledge, to begin to simulate human biology at a fine-grained level
in software, and thus study potential manipulations of that biology in
software; we will have the power to implement those manipulations in living
humans. We will also have the beginnings of mind upload technology.

There's a lot more besides this to talk about with molecular biological
technology - Anders or Robert could do it far greater justice. Certainly,
its a lot more than merely modifying the genome in the germline.

I'm not writing off the computer technology->AI stream of development, by
any means; my impulse is to say that machine AI will come before we can do
significant modification of the human body/brain at the molecular level.
However, I wouldn't say it with 100% certainty.

This is because the same factor drives both technological domains, and that
factor is computers. The same hyper-exponential increase in computing power
which is used as proof of eventual machine dominance will also increase our
molecular biological abilities, and at the same rate, because the key
advancement is the ability to simulate cellular mechanisms.

In fact, the biological strand has something very strong in its favour,
which is the existence of examples. Nanomachines abound in biology (are
biology!), from basic mechanical components up to general intelligence. In
the pure machine strand we've got nothing, and a long string of failures to
show any real progress. Drexler was able to write a list of the achievable
steps from here to full Santatech, and a similar list could be drawn up to
move from here to full simulation of the human brain in software. There is
none such for producing machine intelligence.

 "Exact uncertainty" brought to quantum world April 29, 2002 8:00 CDT

 Michael Hall, a theoretical physicist at Australian National University's
Institute of Advanced Studies, set out to improve Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. 
 Hall supposed that quantum systems can be broken down into two parts. The
first part can, in principle, be measured exactly. The second part is a
quantum part, measured by probabilities of differing values. It is fuzzy
and cannot be measured precisely. Hall set out to quantify the second part
more exactly. Exact uncertainty sounds like a contradiction in terms, but
it governs the quantum world, according to Hall. 
 To quantify quantum uncertainty, Hall borrowed a mathematical tool
developed by British statistician Ronald Fisher in 1925. Fisher quantified
differences between human populations by sampling a few members of each.
His calculations gave an uncertainty in results. Hall realized that making
measurements on quantum particles was mathematically similar to Fisher's
statistics. 
 Hall's resulting looks like Heisenberg's original relation, but Hall has
an equation rather than an inequality. This is "a far stronger relation,"
Hall told New Scientist. The result of Hall's equation gives exact
uncertainty in the measurements of position and momentum. 
 Hall and Marcel Reginatto, of the Physical-Technical Institute in
Braunschweig, Germany, have already put the new equation to work. They have
derived the basics of quantum mechanics from the new, stronger relation.
Schrödinger equation, which describes the behavior of quantum-mechanical
wave functions, has also been put to the test. Their paper was published in
Journal of Physics A this month. 
 "I find it remarkable that the Schrödinger equation no longer has to be
god-given," Wolfgang Schleich told New Scientist. He added that one still
had to make the assumption that there is some quantum uncertainty, but this
is much simpler than assuming Schrödinger 's equation. Schleich studies at
the University of Ulm. 
 Hall's new formulation could have practical applications. Hall told New
Scientist that the new formula implies a tight relationship between
uncertainty and energy which makes it easier to understand why systems, in
quantum mechanics, have a minimum kinetic energy even when no forces are
acting. "There's a kind of quantum kinetic energy that comes from the
uncertainty," Hall says. 
 Also, the new uncertainty equation makes it possible to estimate the
minimum energy within a given quantum system. This is useful in complicated
systems, such as atoms with many orbiting electrons.

A cat can do lots of things mice can't, but this doesn't mean the cat will
do their bidding. Especially, if doing that would run contrary to its self 
interest.

We shouldn't be so defaetist, and give up on a branch of reality just
because it seems harder to enhance people than to make human and
superhuman-grade AIs. Instead of giving up we should try harder, because 
the outcome is potentially so dismal.

I wonder how Gregory Stock knows that, not being a superhuman AI.

Yes, but Greg didn't believe that a few years ago.  Though I think he is
slowly moving in my direction.

All current gene therapies, that I'm aware of, and almost all,
except those that I've proposed, use either viruses or naked
DNA to deliver the code.  To my knowledge I'm the only individual
willing to stick his neck so far out into the guillotine of history
and suggest gene therapies (actually genome patches) based on bacteria
could be feasible.

True, but they aren't anywhere near as far as you can go with nanotech.

There are some big hurdles here involving the immune system treating
non-"self" proteins as foreign and attacking cells producing them.

You still have some rather significant I/O problems.  I'd place
my bets on things like neuron patch clamps, microelectrodes,
pill-sized cameras, ultrahigh resolution NMR or ultrasound to
be our "eyes" and "ears" into the body, not engineered cells
for quite a number of years.

With the genome, the proteome and the crystal structure of most/all
of the proteins, you have all the information you need for the simulations.
You will still need a *lot* of computer power.

Yes, that was my notorious objection at Extro 4.  I think Greg is
slowly starting to lean my way.

I think the order may be:
a) We have the capability for radical genome/body mods.
b) We get very interesting levels of machine AI
c) We get approval from regulatory authorities to actually use (a)
   on a widespread basis.

To me right now those look to be about 2005-2010, 2010-2015 and
2015-2020 respectively.

I disagree.  I think you can do a *lot* of radical genome patching
without having to have cellular simulations.  If indeed we do need
cellular simulations to apply patches, then the date of (c) will
be much delayed because Moore's Law isn't moving fast enough
to accomplish this for the dates I've indicated (go figure out
the number of atoms in proteins that have been simulated vs.
the number of atoms in the volume of a eukaryotic cell!).

Noble sentiments from all, and I could dedicate large amounts of my time to
this, but would it do more for the transhumanist cause to keep my nose in my
research? We need to outline exactly what is to be done, by whom, where and
when, and then do it. Preventing misinformation, and countering luddite
attacks with a sane point of view, is vital to our future.But if we put
everybody in a 'shit or get off the pot' situation and all just go off and
do our own little thing, it will seem incoherent. We need someone with an
overview, who can plan an orchestrated response to anything dodgy, and
communication regularly with all others involved. A call to action is great
only if we decide what that action will be. If somebody gives me a good idea
to work with I'll start now. That's following. If I have enough information
to think of strategies myself, then I'll lead (up to, but not including the
point of, martyrdom). But I have no right to stand up and speak or act for
the entirity of transhumanism without the sanction of that community. Short
of setting up a 'rebel faction', one can't do that, because not everybody in
that community will agree with your words and your actions on their behalf.
However, as you say, something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon
 What thinkest thou?

You can't, of course. Unless you put them all in a zoo, under supervision.  
(And the warden be better lots of smarter and more vigilant than the
smartest of them, because some of the denizens want to escape).  Plus, it
will be a nice trick, overpowering all of them (because no one would want

Intelligence is a component of fitness. Depending on circumstances, it can
be more or less important.

For those who don't want to sign up at NYT (or use cpunx/cpunx as

Those who wish to find out the truth of the above statements should use
an Ethernet sniffer to sniff ALL packets coming from their cable modems,

My personal experience:

I used tcpdump <URL:http://vvv.it.kth.se/edu/gru/Internet/tcpdump.html>
to dump packets, and I can see all hosts on the external network which the
cable modem connects to.

YMMV.

You can always copy all incoming traffic to a local sniffer segment, and
place your sniffer equipment on that segment.  Tapping traffic in the
router slows down the router. Tappers usually wish to keep the tapping
secret. Naturally, you can use a special hardware card to do the tapping
for you. Expensive, though.

You might wish to inspect the recent patents on using computers to recognize
speech, and correlate that to the purchase of software using these patents
by no such agencies.  You may call it an exchange, or you might call it a
computer, it really does not make a difference. The current technology can
do it speed-wise. Enough money buys enough technology. The faster the hardware
becomes, the more communication (data, speech, whatever) they can check.

I guess the domestic surveillence in the U.S. does not include all phone
calls. Yet.

It saddens me to see people on the bleeding edge of technology
forgetting that all communication, as ephemeral as it may appear
to our senses, is all store-and-forward, even if the "store"
portion is trivially short.

Recently, I saw something about a circuit design that could be
massively paralleized to break 1024-bit RSA keys in a very
reasonable amount of time.  It appears that the attitude is
that "now 1024-bit keys are not secure!" ... when have they
ever been?

Anyone with the ability to access communcations (governments
in particular) could simply be recording everything, storing
it, with the intent to decrypt and examine communications
years in the future.  The hope is that most communications
are of timely importance and so deciphering it in the future
may be meaningless.  However, how many conspiracies that
were orchestrated "in secret" under encryption, etc., even
if isolated, decrypted and examined many years from now,
would change the face of the world in unpredictable ways?

The argument that "it would be too costly to archive all
that data" might work if we were talking about the private
sector doing it.  We're talking about governments with
virtually unlimited resources and the cost of digital storage
so inexpensive ...

I think you get the picture,

As one whose genius IQ is likely the result of such experiences (near
constant ear infections until age 6, severe abuse by school peers from
4th grade onwards, use of corporal punishment by parents) while I
certainly disliked intensely the experiences I went through, I can also
certainly say that I would much rather have the IQ I have than to be
average/normal.

If high IQ is the reward for enduring such things, I think I got the
better end of the deal. What is pain anyways? You could look at it as
mental boot camp. Is physical training from childhood onward to become a
world class athlete tantamount to abuse? If not, why should similar
treatment to get top level IQ be any different?

Should we be charging Tiger Shaw's parents with abuse? How about
Michelle Kwan's dad? The fact is that you can't reach any great degree
of accomplishment without having to go through the pain of training your
body to achieve it.

Prof. Hepp wrote a similar paper about 50 years ago.
If I remember well he also found Schroedinger's equation
working with Heisenberg's relations and other quantum
principles.

It is interesting to know if he gives a different definition
of 'uncertainty'. Because, as far as I know, there are at least 5
different definitions of quantum 'uncertainty'. Also interesting
if he gives some real meaning to the time-energy uncertainty relation,
because this relation (present in every each book about quantum 
mechanics) is completely meaningless (there are no clocks!).

Anyway here they are:

As I understand what data I have read on Echelon it was/is the worlds first
partial intelligence; not an AI, but rather a very complicated program such
as to yield intelligent decision making. Whilst it doesn't listen to all
phones everywhere all the time, it will at one point or another check them
all and flag any number of lines where appropriate keywords were used, and
focus on them able (I heard) to distinguish use of language for debate or
serious conversation. After this point it dumps it out to the human
component. It also employs advanced algorithms to narrow its search to
probable areas in interest, and doesn't need to be guided into foriegn
networks if it choses to sniff into them (provided it's there's the physical
link for it to do so of course)

Hear, hear! I like the attitude! I've often thought that there is a "gap in
the market" for a similar group and I too have been disappointed by ProAct's
lethargy...

You can count me in (in principle only, of course... we'll need to get down
to
the nitty gritty before I "sign up"!)

We would need a YahooGroup, or a space on ExIBBS or whatever, where to
brainstorm on this. Much needs to be clarified, starting with what is,
exactly, the transhumanist agenda (ask two transhumanists and you'll get two
different answers!) and what the politics should be (I suspect there will be
problems in this area, though)

Give us more details of what you propose and let's take it from there.

Cheers,
Fabio

In keeping with my recent 'put up or shut up' challenge, I, and several
respondents, have founded the Center for Transhuman Development email
list for those interested in engaging in or funding pro-transhumanist
activism. The list is cthd-list@yahoogroups.com and membership is
controlled by myself. Prospective members should provide their complete
names, addresses, phone numbers, and the names of at least two prominent
extropians or transhumanists who they know in the physical realm and can
vouch for their anti-luddite attitudes.

This new list will be for activists to formulate strategies to confront
luddites in the political arena, the media, and in the community. We
already have a few events in the works, and have also heard from a more
radical cell of individuals who are planning on engaging in more direct
action.

Those wishing to join in should privately email me with the relevant
information. While membership fees are not being imposed until we have
non-profit/PAC status, any donations toward bootstrapping things would
be welcome.

Ditto. It's about time to start practising the Dynamic Optimism, count me in
too :)

Perhaps we can discuss at the Saturday meeting Fabio?
(BTW I'm JMS, here but Bluesteel at Extrobritannia.)


J.

PS I've just seen the Queens speech on the BBC, and I didn't know she was
a Transhumanist... Much talk of embracing change, invention, creation and
the advance of technology. Balanced with the need for responsibility and
service. I'm not a great Royalist, but I was quite impressed by such a
dynamically optimistic attitude.

Unfortunately you may be correct. In the February 2001 issue of
Nature Neuroscience is a report that the protein made from the 
NR2B gene makes mice more aware of pain and for longer periods 
of time. That might even be why they acted smarter, they had 
more incentive to avoid punishment. So you might end up smart
as a whip but hurt like hell all the time, it doesn't sound like a
very sweet deal.

You can drop the "reasonable" (the initial estimate was off by several
orders of magnitude), and the estimated price tag is G$. Read up on the

You're spreading pure FUD. Recommendations for key lenghts based on state

paranoia users (Lucky Green would qualify) shouldn't have had any 1024 bit
RSA keys to revoke in the year 2002 A.D.

Any single-gene tweak is likely to have been an evolutionary
disadvantage in the organism's ancestral environment, but that
doesn't necessarily imply that in would be one in the future.
Evolution has no foresight, but we do.

Cloned baby row doctor 'has run out of patients'
By Roger Highfield, Science Editor
Filed: 27/04/2002 

DR SEVERINO ANTINORI, the fertility doctor who wants to create the
first cloned baby, has no clones, no laboratory, no patients and no
doctors to help him with his programme, according to his former
partner. It marks the latest twist in a controversy that has raged
since Dr Antinori and Dr Panayiotis Zavos disclosed their plans on Jan
23, 2001.

That's true but on the other hand an evolutionary disadvantage

Extropians,

A big push in this group is the notion that "we'll do cryostasis
until life extension technology becomes fully realized" unless I'm
really off the mark, right?

A few questions sprang into my head:

How will you know that you've actually awoken from cryo-sleep?

In other words, when you're finally resuscitated, will it matter to
you if you woke up in your original body?  What if you wake up in
a different body?  How will you know you really "woke up" at all
and really weren't just uploaded into some kind of reality
simulator and that you'll never have a physical body ever again?

Does this matter?  Should it matter?

We're talking about a published paper produced by a single individual.
I can only speculate about what sorts of classified documents exist
out there discussing better techniques than Bernstein's proposal,
but I'm willing to bet that there are such documents.  

I wouldn't be surprised to find that some organization has already
created machinery to defeat large RSA keys in reasonable time.  I
doubt that the organization would ever make this public knowledge
voluntarily.

This isn't FUD.  Can we agree that "if, at some undetermined
point in the future, there will be a way to compromise an N-length
key, then it is not secure for protecting data that isn't timely."
In other words, if data that isn't timely (it's useful regardless of
when it's known) can be decrypted, then regardless of when it's
decrypted, it's not secure?

To bring this to everyday use: Yes, if credit card companies issued
cards that expired in 3 years AND perhaps changed the credit card
number at that time, then if it took more than 3 years to decrypt
a message that included my credit card number, then the encryption
is "secure."  However, if 15 years ago you were placed into the
Witness Protection Program and your whereabouts were encrypted
with technology that would take 20 years to break ... would you
feel that the encryption was "secure" if you had an unwanted visitor
show up in 5 years looking for the old you?

Nobody should be foolish enough to believe that there exists any
two-way encryption (one that can be decrypted into its original
form) that cannot be broken.  The amount of "security" offered
should be measured not in "N-number of bits" which is misleading,
but instead in terms of how much effort it would take to
decrypt it using brute force (or, the most optimal known algorithm,
which may be more meaningful).

Perhaps this is FUD.  Perhaps 1024-bit RSA keys really do offer
millions of years worth of security using today's computing power.  
Maybe I'm just paranoid -- I'm so paranoid, I don't even use
security because I already think that there are folks out there
who can bring it back into cleartext if they needed to, so it's
just inconveniencing me ...

But, maybe I'm right.  Maybe there's an organization out there
who has spent $20B a year for the past 40 years and has built
a large, multiple square-mile computing machine underneath the
desert or somesuch, that can break even larger crypto in a matter
of minutes.

Of course, I'm sure if I had any kind of possible proof of this,
I'd be dead by now ...

Deaf by Design:

http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/displ
ay?slug=deaf21&date=20020421&query=deaf>>

After reading this article I was struck by several thoughts.
 I knew that some Deaf parents had opted not to have cochlear implants used,
this struck me as a psychologically fascinating decison on their part. Very
tribal, very very profound.
  Adding genetic couseling into the mix as this lesbian couple did, this
really
does remind you we are living in the future, it's just not evenly
distributed.

  This sort of pretermined (and hoped for) "difference" from normal baseline
humanity is in an entirely different volitional classification than a
"simple
subculture, now or orignially defined by the caprice of disability". It
would,
if it became very widespread, presage the emergence of a new strain or
variant of the species.
  I'm inclined to think this  is rather cool (unlike many on the list I tend
to see
ethics as a delusion of priests, YMMV :).
  Question being, absent a singleton-deity-hard-take-off scenario,
  What will the Deaf community do when it's possible to hardwire away, from
in vitro conception, the basis for their culture? I would not this
technology is
also, virtually by definition, the ability to "hardwire in" the basis for
their culture.
  Especially if one could unify the "disability" of no hearing, with genetic
improvements in other areas, so the Deaf community could "spin" their
decison as a much less.. abusive decison on the parts of parents.
    What sort of "fleshers"  might this sort of behaviour engender given
favorable circumstances and sufficent time?
  Alas we will likely never know, but it's a tantalizing, if rather morbid,
prospect.

What about the "pain" of failing to evolve, failing to transcend
the hazard function of the galaxy or failing reach ones ultimate
potential?

I think the hairs that are split with respect to treating chimps
or dolphins much better than cattle or pigs are *pretty* small.

Bottom line -- "nature" doesn't care even a teeny, tiny, little,
miniscule Bekenstein-bound sized bit about whether or not pain
is inflicted in the process of evolution.  In fact "nature"
developed pain as a feedback process to facilitate evolution.
(Its the supreme motivating force to get individuals to alter what
they are doing when that isn't working to avoid being preyed upon.)

Create a higher order pain function associated with the deaths
that may be caused because the knowledge to prevent those deaths
was unavailable because of the funds that had to be devoted to
providing mice or rate "old-age" homes.  Or a higher order pain
function associated with the fact that we didn't evolve to a
higher level quite fast enough to be able to prevent a world
level sterilization event.

The current "pain" discussions, seem to be to be highly
anthropocentric.

As En Vogue would say -- "Free your mind -- the rest will follow".

Ah-ha.  The sympathy card gets played.  (We need a deck of cards
whose properties correspond to interesting lower/higher memes
built into or developed by humans -- "Transhuman Tarot Cards".)

Would you argue that those people behaving in ill-informed
or self-destructive patterns deserve "extra-human" levels of
consideration?  Are you really arguing that I (or everyone)
should be responsible for the quality of *their* lives?  

There is a utilitarian perspective here -- how many mouse
lives must I sacrifice to save a human life?  If thei
preservation of mouse lives becomes paramount, then
it seems likely that you will sacrifice the rate of progress
of humanity.  That *does* have consequences.


Going back to the original question:

"Why would it be so impossible simply to treat everyone with respect?"

Answer:

Because if I "respect" individuals whose perspectives would retard
the development of humanity such that my own survival or the survival
of humanity is at stake, then such respect is utterly pointless.
It is essentially respecting positions which promote the dismantlement
of complex life fomrs so as to return them to dust in the universe.
*NOT* a very effective extropic position (IMO).

I'll take a neutral position WRT the novel because I haven't
read it and even if I had, I'm fairly poor at understanding
and debating literary styles.

It might not matter.

In the movie The Matrix, I might have taken the vat instead...

Sounds good to me, I think.

Telecommunication companies are already required to provide connection 
points for government monitoring.  These laws were passed in the mid 
'90s to enforce compatibility when the government needed to access any 
account.  Such links monitor main backbones and not specific accounts.

Part of the outcry over Carnivore was that it recorded everything, and 
was later filtered for the specific information that was desired.  It 
was claimed that it would be too hard to turn things on and off, or to 
filter the traffic to only what they required.  Thus, the government 
records everything, but promises it doesn't look at anything without 
proper authority.

It actually is easier for the government to record everything rather 
than selectively choose what to record.  It is easier to have taps 
everywhere on all the time, rather than turning them on and off.

As for the monitoring, it is easy to capture a major telecomm stream, 
and then split it up into array processors for parallel processing.  
Most online transactions are batch processes, like e-mail, so the system 
wouldn't even have to be real-time.  Most traffic is repeat traffic, 
like webpages, with very little change of the details for each customer.

You only imagine that this might be difficult, based on the equipment 
you see in the commercial sector.  Military technology is decades ahead 
of the commercial sector.  Their budget is many times larger, and their 
paranoia many times stronger.  The military and governments have been 
doing things for decades that are only now coming out and which people 
question is even possible.

I assume that you will "wake up".  I think that in most (non-hostile)
scenarios, your benefactors would tell you what they are doing.

Depends if it functions the same.  If I can't type any more because my
fingers don't feel the same, that could be a concern.  I would have to
re-learn.

Or it could go the other way.  If I am super athletic, beyond what I am now,
that could be a pleasant change.

This technique is used to tell if you are dreaming:

Occasionally, try to think back.  I'm sitting here, at the computer.  Where
was I before that?  And before that?  And before that?  In a dream you
usually cannot think "back" more than the current or maybe one scene.  If
you can't tell how you got to where you were, that is a "non-sequitor".  It
may indicate that you are either dreaming or in a fabricated scenario that
is unconnected to your life in your body.

One reason this could fail:  In Vanilla Sky, they edited his memory to make
a smooth transition.  If they can edit your memory, then it doesn't matter
if you find out.  They can erase it again.

> Does this matter?  Should it matter?
> "What if you were a brain in a vat ..."

I think it DOES matter.  Most people focus on the science, and say that
uploading is possible.  I look at the economics and ask "Why would they do
it"?  If you didn't set up a huge trust fund and a company dedicated to
waking you into a simulation, then I would ask who did, and what do they
want?

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 04/30/2002
Center for Transhuman Development
132 Prospect Street Extension
Lebanon, NH 03766
Contact: Michael Lorrey, mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com
***********************************************************************
The inaugural event of the founding of the Center for Transhuman
Development will be a Truth in Labelling campaign to focus on the
so-called 'Organic' food industry. In our research at local markets, we
have determined that outside of seafood, seaweed, and forest grown
mushrooms and herbs, virtually every other food product, "organic" or
otherwise, exists as a result of thousands of years of genetic
engineering techniques using simple hybridization technologies. Given
this widespread use of hybridization technology in food products, CTHD
activists will be entering their local markets across the country to
affix labels to so-called "organic" or "natural" food products
clarifying this fact.

If you see a food product with the label "This Product is Genetically
Engineered by Hybridization Techniques" or "This product contains
Genetically Engineered Ingredients via Hybridization Techniques", you
will know that this product is now properly labeled to enhance the value
of the product by fulfilling the consumer's right-to-know what is in the
food they buy.

Proprietors of alleged "organic" foods who may complain that the value
of their product is being damaged by such labelling should be reminded
that they would have to be able to prove in court with scientific expert
testimony that "organic" food is quantitatively better than foods
produces with the help of pesticides, fertilizers, or gene splicing
technologies, AND that hybridization is not a technology for altering
the genomes of wild animal and plant species, in order to establish that
damage was done

Prospective activists who are interested in engaging in this labeling
campaign can download the following graphics and produce their own
labels:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cthd-list/files/GE_lbl1.zip

Labelling will begin by May 5th

It is recommended that labelling be performed while one is conducting
their regular shopping. Enterprising individuals may want to dress up as
stock clerks, but we do not encourage it.

If you are interested in membership in the Center for Transhuman
Development, please contact Mr. Lorrey via email at

One of the things I'd like to see is a website with some
no-holds-barred, directly confrontational anti-Luddite
rhetoric that directly counters some of the green nonsense
that gets an easy pass in some places.  "Big Green Lies"
or something along those lines.

Great.  It appears that the first famous cloning doctor is a fraud and a 
liar.  His scientific achievements were lies.  His staff, partner, and 
associates have distanced themselves from him.  He has set the stage for 
cloning research to be associated with unscrupulous lying scientists in 
the mind of the public.

I still claim that technology is harmed more by those promoting it than 
by its detractors.  Unethical "scientists" will scare people more than a 
million concerned politicians or religious people.

I want to also recommend that those who engage in the labelling campaign
get photos of their handiwork and email them to me with the name and
location of the store where labelling occured. I'll put up a page on the
CTHD website of locations that have been labelled with photos to
document these Produce Improvement Operations.

I am currently designing the CTHD website, which will have pages for
Policy Papers, as well as two articles titled "What is Luddism?" and
"Who are Luddites?". I'd like Greg Burch to provide me with material for
these two, though perhaps his Extro5 speech could be the first?

I did get a book a while back that illustrated how the left abuses and
perverts science to produce junk 'facts'. Can't recall the name of it,
but I could look in my storage unit for it...

It seems that Antinori was only in it to trigger public debate and to
instigate regulations to restrict cloning. In that, he is an agent
provocateur of luddism. Cloning researchers should just go ahead and do
it and not tell anyone until they have a squalling infant to present to
the world as a fait accompli.

This almost exactly duplicates Descartes' infamous musing.  If you were
uploaded into a VR that *perfectly* replicated your current reality, in
a way that you did not remember the upload, then no, it would not
matter: by definition, there would be no difference to you.  The nagging
suspicion that it might matter comes from the insistence on perfection
here: we intuitively know that, no matter what we may rationalize,
replications (at least from non-digital states like "reality as we now
know it") are actually rarely perfect, even if done by very clever
people assisted by the best of modern technology (and thus, one suspects
despite all rationalization, replications made by even very advanced SIs
would suffer from the same limitation in practice), that one state can
often be told from another...and in that difference, is what matters.

Not everything that is lamentable or unacceptable need be thought
of in terms of "pain".  Yet the costs that you refer to here are
indeed so great that the more creative, perceptive, intelligent,
and  imaginative someone is, the greater the perceived costs.  In
other words, you and I probably underestimate those costs too!
More about pain in a sec.

Agreed.  Provided that it's not expensive, however, I want us to
adopt policies that avoid inflicting pain on cattle and pigs.
But if someone proves that the "costs" of such sentimentality
(in the terms that you were describing) are high, well, then that's
the tradeoff I'll have to come to a decision about on a case by 
case basis.  "Freedom" --- apparently a concept that is as much
misunderstood and under appreciated on the Extropy list as it is
for the general public---provides an excellent answer:  I'll mind
my business, and you mind yours, and if yours involves the
mistreatment of cats, dogs, chimps, pigs, or cattle, well,
it's none of my affair nor anyone else's.  Societal evolution
proves that adherence to freedom is the best solution found so far.

Yes, quite right.  Except that pain is mostly stupid for highly
evolved creatures.  Today an intelligent person does not need
constant pain to be reminded not to move a broken leg.  Either
he knows better, or wears a cast to help remember.

Pain, mindless pain, is the *wrong* solution.  We must instead
unflinchingly strengthen memes such as yours above, namely,

Now when you write

it reminds me that I long ago gave up trying to have a completely
unified value system.  I've had to settle for two consistent
(or as consistent as I can make them) systems:  one is a sort of
universal utilitarianism (perhaps similar to what you're embracing),
and the other is what's good for Lee Corbin and what's in line with
what he prefers.   I simply strongly disapprove of the torture of
birds or mammals unless there's a very good reason.

It's destructive in the long run to cater to those engaged
in the kinds of behavior you're describing, if I'm reading
you right.  Charity, for example, almost always has 
untoward consequences, and should be indulged in
only very special circumstances.

But if I encounter people stranded on a raft at sea, I'll
help them if it's not too costly to me.  Also, I'll criticize 
others who don't, but stop short of endorsing the use of 
force to compel their assistance.  In the same way, provided
that it's not too expensive, I want an SI to save everyone from 
death or mental retardation (like the kind I'm suffering now).

You may ask why.  Well, I'm not really into "justificationism",
and have seen it debunked too many times in evolutionary
epistemology (and Deutsch does a great job in The Fabric
of Reality).  So I won't justify my values here.  But I
can explain them.  My built-in sympathies for people and
other animals motivate helping them when I can't see what
harm it does in the long run.  (True, that may be because
I'm too stupid to perceive the harm.)

Totally correct.  Yet in my own value systems, there does
exist a large integer N such that I prefer the torture and
death of a human being to the torture and death of N mice.

Huh?  *Positions* per se don't enjoy my respect the way people

As much as I hate to do it, I must agree with the anti reproductive-cloning
camp. Cloning is still broken... don't try this at home kiddies!

Still, I'm a bit sad to see that Antinori is all bluff. Not surprised, of
course.

Isn't this the same as asking if you lie to people and they never find 
out, does it matter?  Remember the Truman Show?  The guy was kept in a 
lie his entire life.  Wouldn't you be mad if you found out?  What about 
all the suffering around us.  What if that could have been prevented, 
but was simulated just for realism.  What if our lives could have been 
so much better, but our boring lives were maintained just to maintain 
the lie.

I sure would be mad, and think it matters to me.  The question of how 
could it matter if I don't know, simply means what I don't know won't 
hurt me.  People can act unethically and deceitfully as long as they 
don't get caught.  I don't believe that.  The deceived person is being 
deprived of larger possibilities through fraud.  If they were free to 
explore and get out into the larger universe, to make their own 
decision, their lives may be so much better.

Ah...but reread the latter half of my arguement.  Yes, logically,
_IF_IT_WERE_PERFECT_ it wouldn't matter.  But we know intuitively that
the most likely result of any attempt to achieve it would be far from
perfect, with negative consequences.  One of the morals of Truman is
the perils of deluding oneself into relying on technical perfection in
such cases: even with state-of-the-art *everything* shielding from
reality, reality still slipped in.

This, arguably, is what the Luddites are arguing - but they, themselves,
slip into relying on perfection: the fear of perfect disasters,
unthwartable by all of modern technology no matter what we try.  Or
perfect terrorists, undetectable until it's too late to stop them.  And
so forth.

When one deals with reality, rationality demands accepting imperfections
and dealing with them.  There are cases where technical perfection can
be achieved (I know: I've created a few professionally), but these are
usually only the simplest of cases.  For anything sufficiently complex,
improving the odds will usually get better results in practice than
completely ignoring odds-improving tactics in favor of perfection.

I'm looking for a tool for systems analysis.  Not a CASE tool; there's no
intention of generating code.  What I need is a tool for generating design
documents: I need to create multiple hierarchies of topics, where some (in
fact most) topics appear in many hierarchies; I need to write extended
documents under each topic using ordinary word processing; and I need to
create named relations between topics, where the relations may also contain
their own subdocuments but are not forced to do so.  The tool must not hold
my data hostage - there must be some way to print it as a single document
with chapters, and ideally some way to export the underlying data as XML.

This looks to me like a pretty simple writing tool by comparison with
today's expensive meta-CASE tools and so on, but I don't think I need much
over and above outlining.  I've overrun my ability to keep track of things
using outlining in flat documents, but that's the only problem - I don't
need software that "helps me think", just software that lets me write very
large descriptions and navigate easily between linked topics that appear in
multiple hierarchies.  I don't need 2D mindmapping views; list views of the
relations for a topic and expandable outline views for the hierarchies will
do just fine.

I expect to spend most of my time writing the topics - the tool's main
purpose is to keep me from losing track of all the topics.  So I'm looking
for a tool that offers some reasonable subset of word-processing
functionality for the topics, rather than a tool that assumes I'll spend
most of my time manipulating networks and hierarchies, with "notes" added as
afterthoughts.

Does anyone have suggestions for a tool that does this, hopefully an
inexpensive one?  Failing that, does anyone know which search terms would
describe this kind of tool?  Feel free to answer privately.

You know, if you want many, many people to tackle this, you're going to need
to provide graphics that joe user can open and print from a web browser.
i.e. no zip file, just a letter-size jpeg with multiple copies.

Yup, I caught that to !  No way to turn CO2 into hydrogen with chemistry.  No 
fusion or fission inside bacteria....I to expected some science editor at NYT 
to catch that one,   Hmmmm, no one took chemistry of physics?

I think he is actually referring to converting CO2 to methane, which can be 
used as a source of hydrogen as in fuel cells.  This would be mere bacterial 
enzyme based reduction of carbon.

If I still need to type, that would be a disaster.

Actually, I can see that happening. A future where all kinds of illnesses
have been fixed, where cryonic suspension is reversible, and yet, despite
the best efforts of many dedicated people, QWERTY still reigns supreme.
