Correction to my comment: yes, the commanders were pissed off. I can't
substantiate _charges_ at gunpoint, with the information I have at hand,
but I have found mention of forced night-time raids with body-count quotas.
Destabilizing, for sure.

Actually, neither is quite correct: for an iterated Prisoner's dilemma,
you have to know at each iteration your opponent's history of dealings
with you, but not specifically who he is.

Lee, you're right that the history needs to be retrievable, and I _didn't_
say that, so you _have_ caught me up... Thanks.

However, 
I maintain that being able to determine the counterpart's past
dealings with you is pretty darned close to "recognizing" the
counterpart. 

I suppose the counterpart could recognize _me_, and post a 
scorecard on his/her forehead before we game... 

or a Godlike Being could whisper in my ear... 

But absent some "recognition" somewhere, how is the retrieval to
take place?

Thanks for making me speak more clearly.

I'm really trying to understand what you are asking, and doing my best
to answer, despite your belief that I am not.  It is not possible for you
to "upset my sensibilities"--they are mine alone.  If I become upset,
that's my fault, not yours.  I answered you specifically, constructively,
meaningfully, and in direct response to your questions.  I did not evade
or equivocate, and I did not impugn your motives--in fact I don't give a
damn about your motives nor should you about mine--and I gave you useful
and complete information.  If it wasn't the answer you wanted then you
need to ask a different question, and I will respond to that.

A much more detailed question, unfortunately it's not answerable.  It's
like answering "Can software be hacked?"  Of course some can, and some
can't.   None of that has anything to do with PICS.  A PICS bureau is a
source of information, nothing more.  I don't know how to answer your
questions any more specifically or accurately than that.  Are there
social implication of PICS?  Of course, the same as there are social
implications of any information.  Will some people use that to keep
information from people?  Probably.  What can be done?  Well, if the
censoring software can be hacked, then hack it; that depends on the
software, not on PICS.  I suspect that in the age of satellite net
conections, it will be practically impossible for such a system to work,
because PICS can only /add/ data to the system, and it's hard to
restrict which software people use when it too is available on the
net and software without restrictions is easier to create and more
profitable than software with restrictions.

[OVERSIMPLIFICATION ALERT]
In a population of 10 people, if 9 play tit-for-tat and one always defects,
the 9 will be defected against 10% of the time, and the one will be defected
against 100% of the time.  This isn't useful for producing descendants.

The reason you don't see 100% honest people is that a) most people don't
consistently play tit-for-tat, and b) hardly anybody _always_ defects
("honor among thieves" and all).

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Bruno Bettelheim used to get his jollies by instructing the young girls 
under his his custody and control to undress and take a shower.

When they came out og the showers, naked and glistening wet, he would put 
them over his lap and 'spank' them in front of all the inmates.

Many of the young girls were very brave, and tried so hard not to cry.

What they didn't realize is that he would go on 'spanking' them until they 
_did_ cry.


It's worthwhile finding out if -- on occasion -- he went on 'spanking' 
them until thy _stopped_ crying, because they had broken psychologically, 
and had given up on any hope of rescue...

Now we can advance to a further level of understanding:

Take two texts:

'The Joy of Sex' by Alex Comfort;

'The Little Fascist' from 'What do you say after you say "Hello?" by Eric 
Berne. Interestingly, this chapter is omitted from the Collected Work...

Next, read * scrupulously * the illustrated literature on the

OK.

This is not a 'popular' case to argue (civil liberties seldom are).

There's an academic study, 'Child Loving' written by (ISTR) William 
Kinkaid [publ. RKP]  which I haven't read.

Let's look at that seriously.

Firstly, at a methodological level:  (Pardon my French!)


Following logician Alfred Tarski, we can say:

"The statement 'Les pedophiles sont particulierement dangereuse aux les 
membres de public' is thrue if -- and only if - paedophiles are, in fact, 
particularly dangerous to members of the public."   Ironically, such 
relationships are known in France as 'Special friendships.'  There's a 
novel of that name, by Roger de Peyrefitte, which is on this topic.  No 
sex in it, BTW.


We do not have a good statistical basis for knowing how many members of 
the population are 'paedophiles.'  The American Academic Hypertext 
Encyclopaedia by Grolier [1993] describes people who find pre-pubescent 
children sexually attractive.  But consider: such preferences are not 
binary.  They range from people being completely erotically indifferent to 
pre-pubescent children, through to finding them (or some of them -- but 
which? One?  All of them?) sexually _irresistable_.


Sexual attraction can only properly apply to a reproductive context. So 
we're not dealing with sexuality at all -- pre-pubescent girls cannot 
reproduce, and boys and men cannot reproduce at all, except with fertile 
females.

So we're really considering unilateral eroticism -- an internally 
experienced erotic attraction, which ranges from (say) zero to a hundred 
percent -- we have no _metric_ for it, anyway -- and reciprocated erotic 
interactions - an exchange of intellectual and sensory experience.

But erotic feelings are internally-experienced 'World II' phenomena -- 
again, there is no external metric.  And they can therefore have _no 
impact whatsoever on other people_ (except insofar as other people can 
sense them at some tacit level).

Insofar as pre-pubescent children actually have no capacity -- knowledge and 
experience -- of and for for erotic arousal, they can hardly either sense 
it in other people, or understand it either.

So we just don't know.  The positivist assertion must therefore be false.

But is it objectively true, all unbeknownst to us?

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Cut to the chase.


People are understandably very concerned about strangers who forcibly 
inflict unwanted physical assaults (of varying degrees of severity) on 
children who never sought out such behaviour.  But this is very rare -- in 
the case of grave genital or anal assaults.  

Insofar as grave physical abuse by strangers _does_ occur, it 
predominantly occurs in situations where the children are deprived of 
liberty -- i.e. in childrens' 'homes' and schools.  There is much 
empirical evidence for this.  Vastly more grave assaults on children 
(genital and/or anal) occur at the hands of their parents, in the home: 
people who have 'legitimate' power over them.

In almost all cases, these assaults can actually be completely prevented 
and stopped, and children need no longer suffer, or -- like Jonbenet Ramsey, 
aged 6, be hideously tortured and then murdered.

[ Either one or other of her parents killed her, or -- vastly more 
probable -- it was a carefully planned and executed 'demonstration' 
killing, carried out by paid psychopaths.  The investigating authorities 
are not making it very easy to discover the facts in this matter].  Time 
will tell.

Asking 'What powerful and unpleasant people has John Ramsey upset?' might 
prove a fruitful line of inquiry.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

        The real-world solution is simple:  equip all children with 
personalized miniature radio 'search-and-rescue' beacons, activated _by 
them_ in crisis situations and emitting a personalized radio alarm signal, 
 This can be instantly picked up, the source location triangulated and 
given Global Positioning Coordinates, and appropriate rescue services sent 
to the scene immediately, by the fastest possible means.

        The small units can be worn as pendants, bracelets, on a belt.  
Anywhere accessible to the child should they be in a crisis situation.  
Training children to use them is simple. They're very cheap to manufacture. 
Come to think of it, we could all do with these -- it results in 
incident-driven policing at the behest of the person under threat. This 
would be most fruitful in reconfiguring policing to be a system of 
delegated self-defence, rather than a means of social control operated by 
the governing hierarchical authorities.

Microlert was offering such a service for US $30 a year in California, in 
the Seventies.  

Advocates of authoritarian and violent parenting and schooling (Gillick, 
Howard, Shephard, Feulner) _hate and detest_ this sort of idea, which is 
now actually being made available to children under threat within their 
homes, in America...

Ask yourself why it is, that the 'authorities' seem to have so little 
concern for the phyical, psychological and emotional well-being of each 
and every one of us -- children _and_ adults.

The exaggerated 'AIDS' propaganda backfired on the 'moral' authoritarians, 
resulting in a vast proliferation of erotic non-penetrative activity -- 
so-called 'safe sex.'

The social-control freaks are _really pissed off_ about this failure.  A  
lot of effort and resources went into the scare.

Stuff called BHT (E321) -- a near-perfectly-safe food preservative and 
anti-oxidant -- zaps all lipid-coated viruses it's so far been tesed on, 
in 250 mg. oral daily doses. No side-effects, no immunocompromize effects.

It's generic, and sells for around five bucks a kilo.

Do a WWW search on 'Fowkes' and 'BHT'

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

The idea of children remaining 'innocent' in the context of modern 
tobacco, confectionery and newspaper shops is quite risible, insofar as 
there are all that many children incapable of erotic responses left. Go 
look at the magazine racks in any shop. Just look at the cover pictures 
and text.

        Orchestrated witch-hunts against mostly harmless and inoffensive 
people is much nearer what the 'authorities seem to want to go in for.  
Coercion. Wonder why?

No civil libertarian should have much of a problem answering that: --

                               MANIPULATION

                              BIGGER BUDGETS

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

I'm hardly any kind of  'paedophile' -- my idea of 'attractive' is the 
glorious Olivia Newton-John.  >:-}


But I did see my best friend lying in a mortuary, with ice crystals on his 
face, stone dead.  He liked emotional involvemet with -- and on occasion 
mutual erotic play with -- good-looking boys between the ages of twelve 
and fourteen.  They seemed to welcome it, AFAIK.  If I'd had any reason to 
think that they didn't, he wouldn't have been a friend of mine for a 
moment longer.


With me was another good friend with similar inclinations.  He went on to 
become a top Royal Navy carrier pilot and a gifted 'TOP GUN' air combat 
trainer.  He trained to fly one-way nuclear mission against the USSR -- 
which would have killed and maimed millions of people, had he been ordered 
to do it.  Quite futile, too -- when someone asked 'but we haven't the 
fuel capacity to get back, they were told: "What do you think will be left 
here to get back to?"

He ceased to have any interest in younger boys as he grew older, but is 
still an 'out' gay in Oz.


I have no reason to think that either of them ever did any kind of harm to 
anyone.  I don't have friends who are like that.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

One of the parents resented their son's attachment to my best friend, and 
'sweated' a 'confession' out of their son... The police were summoned, 
and very commendably seemed suprisingly unconcerned, and he was charged 
with 'indecent exposure', ISTR.  However, they told him he couldn't expect 
to go on 'doing it.'

All too true.


A little later, he was found dead by his mother and sister.

If JonBenet Ramsey were to return, what would she do?

She knows who killed her, and the sort of people they are.

Imagine that she -- and those close to her -- are  Jedi Knights.

Perhaps she'd do a personality pattern matching analysis.

Children are very skilled at this.

Imagine she comes to such people in their dreams, and reiteratively 
seduces them, tortures them, and is tortured to death by them.

Then she starts all over again...

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Here's Eric Berne, on 'The Little Fascist':

"Every human being seems to have a little fascist in their head. This is 
derived from the deepest layers of the personality...


"A fascist may be defined as a person who has no respect for living tissue, 
and regards it as his prey...

"It became less impotant to kill him (or her) than to hear or watch him (or 
her) scream and grovel.  This became the essence of fascism -- a roving 
band seeking male or female pey to torment or deride -- whose art lay in 
probing for the victim's weaknesses...

"There are two by-products of the grovel, both of them advantageous to the 
aggressor.  The biological effect is pleasure and excitement, with the 
victim available to indulge even the most ingenious perversions, the 
favorite of record being anal rape...

"Torture brings about a peculiar intimacy between the torturer and the 
victim, and a profound insight into each others souls, an intimacy

POSTSCRIPT:

Admiral Noel A. M. Gayler designed SIOP, the Single Integrated Oprational  
Plan, America's global nuclear warfighting strategy.  He now campaigns for 
the global abolition of nuclear weapons and a reduction in military forces 
down to police levels. (Ref: Kaplan et. al., "The Wizards of Armageddon").


I know Admiral Gayler a little:

After speaking with him at his home in Alexandria ( the Pentagon's  Flag 
Officers' Desk gave me his home address), I sent him a preliminary outline 
of an alternative Twelve Track Parallel Plan to achieve a world of free, 
peaceful and prosperous individuals, being themselves and living their own 
lives in a world with the absolute minimum of necessary violence.

With the paper, I enclosed a copy of Bryan Magee's crystalline short 
introduction to Karl Popper's work. I knew he'd like it  -- We're 
Kantians.

I was so disappointed when he never responded.

Still, the other day I followed my friend Mac's advice, stuck in a 
prominent position on his Navy twin-jet fighter's instrument panel:

[ FX: "NEVER  ASSUME --- CHECK!!!" ]

So I called the Admiral.

He was most surprised -- my mailing had never arrived...

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

AFAIK, SIOP had elements of 'fail-deadly' launch procedures.

If communications were cut, launch procedures initiated 'automatically.'

In my plan, there are fail-safe procedures and error-checking.

For all we know, BOTH of these Plans are active.

Insofar as this may be so, we all may hope that mine 'gets there' first.

You do have a cite for that, of course? I can't think of any supreme court
decision which says that, except the sawn-off shotgun decision (Miller?),
which seems to imply that citizen-units are allowed any weapon suitable
for militia use.

Even when US cops are twice as likely to kill innocent bystanders as
civilians are, and when they sell guns to criminals (BATF study in
Washington DC)? Even when studies have shown that legal concealed carry
laws prevent crimes and save lives?

So? Where does the second amendment mention hunting? Where does it say 
that "the right to bear arms" doesn't include handguns?

Indeed. Witness the (previously quoted) fact that US cops are twice as
likely as a civilian to shoot an innocent bystander. Taking the cops' guns
away would save a few hunded lives every year.

Indeed, US cops are notorious for killing themselves with their service
weapons (hence the oft-quoted statistic that cops are far more likely to
be shot with their own guns than by a criminal). But if you're referring
to the notorious Kellerman 'study' I think you should read one of the
numerous critiques. It doesn't say what you seem to think it says.

You're really big on this "psycho-sexual" stuff, aren't you? Personally
when I'm holding a gun sex is normally the last thing I'm thinking of; I'm
much more concerned with safe gun-handling. Are you sure this isn't just
something you're projecting on others? 

And you have read what Freud wrote about people who are afraid of guns,
haven't you?

Yep; web-forwarding (e.g. www.anonymizer.com), email-to-web gateways (you
send a message requesting a certain URL and it mails it back to you),
steganography (hiding 'dangerous' information inside inoccuous images, web
pages or sound files). The first two can be blocked by the government, but
it can simply change URL and/or email address and set up at an uncensored
site.  They could content-filter, but that would massively increase the
load on their routers and it still wouldn't catch the steganography.

Any gun instructor will tell anyone incapable of mastering themselves to
stay away from guns...

Also, apparently, Mr Genen ignored my prior post last week that included
the results of a study by Handgun Control, Inc., the leading anti-gun
lobbying group out there. The people they commissioned to do the study
(Profs at the U of Chicago) found from FBI data collected between 1979
and 1995 that violent crime dropped an average of 8% in states that
enacted "right to carry" concealed weapons laws in 1994, to take effect
Jan 1 1995. Considering that the FBI reported a 3% drop in violent crime
nationwide, the 18 states with these laws make up 80% of the reported
drop, while the remaining 32 states violent crime rates only dropped an
average of .6%. I think that the difference between 8% and .6% in a pool
in the tens of thousands is statistically significant, don't you?

Especially when the ACLU, which is self charged with defending our
constitutional rights (supposedly all of them), refuses to come to the
aid of people whose 2nd amendment rights have been violated. They also
refused to involve themselves in this case, even though it was not a 2nd
amendment case, because it involved guns... talk about liberal
hipocrisy....

Hardly, when 60,000 people are wrongly denied access to guns, and only 7
people are prosecuted for attempted purchase? Specious? 

 The high court has ruled on this

There is a vast difference between regulating, and denying. They did not
include this in their decision , BTW, because they have recognised that
the 2nd amendment only applies to the regulation of the militia, not the
regulation of firearms. Where congress gets off with assault weapons
bans, etc. is in the interstate commerce clause.... Get your
Constitution straight...

Hardly, they are only there to catch the guy AFTER he has killed and
raped your family....That in is not self defense, it is law enforcement.
There is a big difference. Self defense is also recognised by the
supreme court as a 9th and 10th amendment right.

Hardly, the most recent review of accident rates by the National Safety
Board shows that not only is the accident rate from firearms at its all
time historical low of .06 per 100,000 population (from a peak in 1904
of 3.4), but that this rate is lower than the accident rate in
automobiles, commuter and private aircraft, and even sitting on your own
toilet.... Don't be a vitcim of propaganda, get the facts first.

No, usually it was economically imposed saturation of a market or a rise in
costs due to diminishing returns to scale.  The mileage of canals in the
U.S. grew exponentially from 1790 to 1836, the mileage of railways from 1830
to 1890, the mileage of paved roads from 1900 to 1950.  After that the
growth leveled off, and in the case of canals and railways mileage
eventually began to decline.  I suppose according to your theory, if it
weren't for those nasty reactionaries, Americans would enjoy billions of
miles of canals and railroads.

It doesn't matter if it was, according to your standards, a "matter of
technology" or not.  The point is that exponential growth does not continue
indefinitely, and it often ends by running into unexpected barriers.  In
1970, who would have thought noise, pollution, or a bunch of Arab
politicians could hve stopped the mighty juggernaut of American aerospace
progess?  In fact, political forces tried to continue the exponential curve
past the point of feasibility, producing the money-losing Concorde.

I don't.  I chose my words advisedly: commercial air transport.  I would
include commercial manned space transport, if there were any such thing.

Well, as long as we're arguing on the basis of "no reason why not": there is
also no reason why those new technologies should not appear either faster or
slower than Mooore's law suggests.  

The recent exponential increase in the cost of fabs to build each generation
of chips is an alarming sign.  Each generation costs twice as much capital
as the one before, and it is only the matching exponential growth in sales
that has kept the price per unit manufactured down.  If this continues, in
three generations, the cost of a single fab will exceed the quantity of
capital that can be feasibly assembled into a single commercial venture
(about 10 billion dollars).  That's why I picked 500 MHz: it's two fab
generations in the future.  It will be perfectly feasible to build faster
chips than that, and Intel probably will.  It just won't be feasible to
build them at a profit.  A 1000 MHz  Pentium can't cost more than three
times a 500 MHz Pentium, or nobody will buy it, because it will be cheaper
to use a multiprocessor machine.

If this happens, I suspect the PowerPC or other RISC chip will eventually
become the microprocessor of choice, because, given a fixed fab technology,
RISC chips are about 50% faster than Pentiums, ande in the absence of rapid
growth, siwtching will make sense.  So in 2001, when the financing for
Intel's $12 billion new fab falls apart, my advice is, buy IBM and Motorola.

	So...if a man has a vasectomy, he is devoid of sexuality as is a woman who
has had a hysterectomy?  Their attraction to each other, since it is not in
the reproductive context, is other than sexual?  They are prerhaps,
perverts?  Or what?

not to mention the incredible range of sexual attractions that

John -

   After reading your above statements I urge you to read Robert Anton 
Wilson for all he's worth.  In the beginning of his book Cosmic Trigger 
he emphasizes to his readers that he "DOES NOT BELIEVE IN ANYTHING".  
Bob is a trickster from the get go.  How much he is putting you on is up 
to you to decide.  Dogma is his enemy, encouraging you to think for 
yourself is his goal.
   Although I respect Carl Sagan for his enormous contributions to the 
scientific community, I have always found him pedantic and dogmatic 
especially with regards to his involvement with CSICOP.  A persons 
scientific beliefs can be just as dogmatic as someone's religious ones.  
Please take the time to read R.A.W.'s "The New Inquisition" for a 
scathing expose on the widespread dogma found in the scientific 
commnunity.
   I also recommend a psychedelic drug experience of your choice, if you 
feel your ready for such a thing.

Warm Regards,

Bobby Whalen

No doubt Marshal Petain would agree with you.
Certainly Pol Pot would find your answer a winning one.
I manage to entertain some doubts.

Dear fellow extropians and michael,

It seems there is always someone who chooses to miss the point.
Possibly, it's out of a simple need to act as devils advocate.
I somehow doubt that either Petain or Pol Pot would agree with me on most,
if not all, political issues. 
It seems that they both advocated conformity of mind and action and could
not tolerate dissent. 
The open mind indicates open discussion and debate of all issues in order
to increase human understanding. 
Shooting or otherwise killing someone does not get them to think.
In fact, the reverse is true.

A.M, you have my genuine thanks for skipping the verbal jousting and
speaking about the real issue. I'll drop the jousting too.

When I encounter such, I get angry, and I try to straighten them out.
Anger is, arguably, closely related to fear and powerlessness; I
acknowledge that.

Fools, we will have always with us, to paraphrase the New Testament.
But I know many honest, civil people, not fools; what of them? 

>As far as I'm concerned, the less guns we have the better off we are.

If I were still jousting, I'd say something like:
Fine. Give up yours, I'll keep mine, the net reduction in number should be
a net gain for society... yes?

But I'm not jousting. So instead I'll say:
A.M., rest assured that I do not apologize for the actions of said fools. I
just resent being lumped in with them because I haven't proven to some
other fool that I can be trusted more than said fool trusts him/herself.

If I had a device that could instantly neutralize all firearms all over the
world--make them inert lumps of metal, permanently... I *might* push the
button that did it.

But I'd think really hard for a long time before I did. And I mistrust
anyone who tells me they would do it in an instant. How about you?

You do have a cite for that, of course? I can't think of any supreme court
decision which says that, except the sawn-off shotgun decision (Miller?),
which seems to imply that citizen-units are allowed any weapon suitable
for militia use.

Even when US cops are twice as likely to kill innocent bystanders as
civilians are, and when they sell guns to criminals (BATF study in
Washington DC)? Even when studies have shown that legal concealed carry
laws prevent crimes and save lives?

So? Where does the second amendment mention hunting? Where does it say 
that "the right to bear arms" doesn't include handguns?

Indeed. Witness the (previously quoted) fact that US cops are twice as
likely as a civilian to shoot an innocent bystander. Taking the cops' guns
away would save a few hunded lives every year. 

> They frequently end up shooting other family

Indeed, US cops are notorious for killing themselves with their service
weapons (hence the oft-quoted statistic that cops are far more likely to
be shot with their own guns than by a criminal). But if you're referring
to the notorious Kellerman 'study' I think you should read one of the
numerous critiques. It doesn't say what you seem to think it says.

You're really big on this "psycho-sexual" stuff, aren't you? Personally
when I'm holding a gun sex is normally the last thing I'm thinking of; I'm
much more concerned with safe gun-handling. Are you sure this isn't just
something you're projecting on others? 

And you have read what Freud wrote about people who are afraid of guns,
haven't you? 

	Mark

Dear fellow extropians,

I won't go into Marks highly questionable "facts" about misplaced shots by
police officers. Particularly, when their is so much data about improper
use of firearms under stress.
I'm not particularly afraid of firearms. What I'm afraid of are all the
fools who feel that they need them and who don't choose to understand what
limited purposes firearms have.
As far as I'm concerned, the less guns we have the better off we are.

As I said, I manage to entertain some doubts that the recipe you describe
is a reliable one.

Permit me to not miss the point you're actually making, regardless of the
point you think you're making:

>>The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our
>>society is best answered by having professionally trained law enforcement
>>officials in each community.
>
>No doubt Marshal Petain would agree with you.
>Certainly Pol Pot would find your answer a winning one.

I seem to recall that the Vichy police and their German masters were
professionally trained, official, and present in the community.
Your point begs the question of what right behavior is if the "officials"
are the predators. Is my point now clear?

As I pointed out in another post, rough parity is needed in order for
cooperation to be a viable evolutionarily stable strategy. This does not
imply violence, merely its capability.

>I manage to entertain some doubts.

I see no reason to change my view here: it's, if anything, more open than
yours appears to be.

>Each community is different. 
>Feel free to live wherever you are comfortable.

I see no reason to change this view either--it strikes me as eminently
tolerant. Feel free to explain why it's not.

>When respect for one's fellow man is strong, arms are an utter non-issue.
>Absent that respect, what remains?

No response from you on this? I rather expected more.

>Dear fellow extropians and michael,

Sarcasm! I bleed, I die! Where is my "second"?

>It seems there is always someone who chooses to miss the point.
>Possibly, it's out of a simple need to act as devils advocate.
>I somehow doubt that either Petain or Pol Pot would agree with me on most,
>if not all, political issues. 

Indeed, but most is not all. Your doubt is not mine. But unilateral power
corrupts, even in the short term, and there is evidence that leaving
self-defense up to authorities is an invitation to same.

More: Perhaps you're unaware of this, but American jurisprudence is quite
clear on this point: law enforcement agencies and officers have, absent
what is called a "special relationship", *no* obligation to protect
citizens. None, zero, zip.

>It seems that they both advocated conformity of mind and action and could
>not tolerate dissent. 

Worse than that: Pol Pot reputedly had people killed because they were
found to be _wearing glasses_. Intellectuals, don't you know.

>The open mind indicates open discussion and debate of all issues in order
>to increase human understanding. 

I was not calling you Petain or Pol, I was saying they'd agree with you. I
was under the impression we were engaging in open debate--that there are
(at least) two parties speaking here... but perhaps it's not open debate
unless I agree with you?

>Shooting or otherwise killing someone does not get them to think.
>In fact, the reverse is true.

"Shooting or otherwise killing...?" Sorry, you just went into left field. I
didn't even mention guns in my post. Only abuse of power and your freedom
to choose to live wherever you're comfortable. And my doubts about police
being perfect guardians.

I did mention _arms_, but I might as well have said "tools", for they are
ultimately indistinguishable.

I'm concerned with helping to create a world that 
a) I wouldn't mind coming back to, and
b) wouldn't mind bringing me back.

I would mind coming back to a world where a select class of armed
individuals herded human cattle around. You may now proceed to convince me
that
a) I'm wrong, and I'd *love* that kind of world, or
b) such a world (or community) can be guaranteed not to come into existence
once

>>self-defense against predators in our

Oh, I beg your pardon, you did say "...best handled...". 
Very well, I humbly retract, I agree with you totally.

Then you have not seen any of my posts, only "abstract" representations

If the value of a bit was determined by the way it was represented then the 
concept of "bit" would be completely useless. The computer revelation started 
when people discovered this is not true and information exists independent of 
the thing that represents it.

When we look at a color we feel a lot of pleasure or a little pleasure or 
no pleasure at all. I don't know how many levels the human mind needs but  
I'll bet a 32 bit number could cover it.

If I have always seen the world in black and red that would be no different 
from seeing the world in black and white, and if I only saw the world in red 
and red I would be as blind as if I saw it in black and black.  Also, I don't  
see how any sensation can be anything but " completely abstract" and I'm  
totally confused why you equate abstract with valueless.

They could remember blue but not black or white or light or dark or any other 
color? No, I've never heard of that.

If I discovered a new color then my understanding of red would change too, 
into something much richer.

Yes, if I wore the glasses from birth. I can't prove it but I'm convinced  
that's true.


        >If such an absurd notion is what you are claiming this is where the

All you have done is assume that the subjective experience is different and 
then claim you have proven it.  I'm saying we can never prove or disprove 
anything about subjectivity unless we accept the axiom that behavior is 
linked to experience.


        >You should try putting on some colored glasses some day and see how         
        >different things feel 
                   

Why, what would that prove? My behavior would be different as well as my 
experience, at least for a while. I do remember reading about an experiment  
where people wore glasses that reversed up and down, after a few days they  
said they hardly noticed the glasses and their behavior was not unusual. 
When the experiment was over and they took the glasses off things looked odd,
it took several more days to get back to normal. By the way, the image the 
human eye produces on  the retina is upside down, our brain just compensates 
for it.            

        >As I said before, an identical duplicate of a physical phenomenon is

Then I don't have knowledge of anything. I thought I "knew" that the earth 
went around the sun and the moon went around the earth but I am not the earth, 
I am not the sun and I am not the moon.
                   

        >This kind of real, non abstract, knowledge is the best kind of         
        >knowledge and the only real or non abstract knowledge.


Do you just mean subjective experience? If not can you give me a specific  
example of "non abstract knowledge"?

Because the only tool we have to investigate consciousness, or even determine

If it accurately predicts behavior that would be good enough for me, but not 
you, you want more proof but you will never get it. How will you ever know if 
your theory accurately predicts subjective experience when you have no way of 
independently knowing what that subjective experience is?

How on Earth could we ever know that? It might correlate to 2 people making  
a noise with their mouth that sounds like "that tastes salty" and I think  
it's reasonable to assume that they also subjectively experience a salty 
sensation, but I thought you didn't accept that. You're assuming the very 
thing you're trying to prove.

If true then you can be certain it is NOT the same sensation because it can 
not possibly be the identical neural correlate, they are different brains, 
and in your same post you said " Only identical physical phenomenon can 
perfectly model every single quality and attribute of another."

Have they really?  So much for the myth that the Supreme Court has

Anyway, this element of the challenge to the Brady Act is not on Second

More often, they end up shooting nobody, because the aggressor flees

are said to shoot the wrong person about eleven times as often as armed 
civilians do.  (I believe this ratio is normalized for total number of 
shootings.)  This suggests that delegating the power to shoot badguys 
was a bad idea.  If shooters are incompetent, some of the blame must 
go to city councils that drive out practice ranges for being icky.

The claim frequently quoted that "a gun in the home is 43 times more 
likely to kill a family member than to kill an intruder" is, even if 
accurate, meaningless.  People defending themselves against violent mates 
are counted among the 43 -- is it better for husbands to strangle wives
than for wives to shoot husbands?  The vast majority of armed encounters, 
in which nobody is killed, are ignored (though surely some would have 
been killed if unarmed).

But logrolling fairs over into deal-cutting, which is the only way anything

Every once in a while, I think term limits are a good idea. Then I remember
Professor Bernardo de la Paz. If I may "channel" him for a moment, I think
he might say, "let them stay as long as they want--but _why give them any
money_? Let them pay for their folly themselves..."

Sorry for the two-pronged reply, but a thought occurred to me. This being
an unusual event (at least to hear some correspondents tell it), I had to
take keyboard in lap to comment.

>Like a lot of aspects of term limits, it's a cost to the district

I wonder. Seems to me that you could model term-limits as an incentive to
legislators to line their own pockets even more flagrantly. "What are they
gonna do, _fire_ me?"

>Logrolling is why porkbarrels are never shut down.

People getting what they think they want is why patronage is never shut
down. Some argue that the alternative is worse. Me, I dunno.

Of course, that book is also somewhat dogmatic about how dogmatic the
scientific community is. Wilson may believe (or want to believe) he
doesn't believe in anything, but he has his own blind spots and
sacred cows: as does all of us.

I recommend reading RAW, he makes you think. He might be wrong,
joking or just imagining things, but he makes you think.

Each planet's orbit is typically of a lower density of space dust, and
as each planets orbit wobbles over time, the planet may wander out of
this region into one of greater density that exists above and below the
plane of the ecliptic. This is thought by some to be a cause of ice
ages, is the greater density is supposed to decrease the amount of
sunlight reaching earth....

Hi, just a quick comment:

Having a hysterectomy does not mean that a person is not interested in,
perform, dream about or enjoy sex or eroticism.  It means surgical removal
of part or all of the uterus. It does not mean that the brain or vagina (the
two sexual organs) no longer work.

Cheers!

First off, I'll note that you have no response to or are purposely
ignoring  the REAL statistics I posted to support my arguments, while
you continue to badger Mr. Butler, who has not posted the sources of his
facts about police related shootings.

The only studies of improper use of firearms under stress that I am
aware of is studies of AMerican troops in Vietnam. They shot over 9,000
rounds on average in order to kill one VC, and normally, 4 out of five
infantrymen never even fired their guns when in a firefight, they
typically just tried to cover their asses. I think these data are more
important in the context of why we had such trouble in that war, and
that the source of this poor performance was more morale related. Most
grunts just did not want to be there and wanted to live long enough to
go home. This has nothing to do with self defense of ones home, person,
or dependents, with firearms, unless the study also examined the
performance of VC troops in defending their homes from the imperialist
agressors, which it did not.

The facts are that over 2.4 million crimes are prevented each year,
according to one statistic I've seen (I don't have the source with me
but I'll dig it up), by the use of firearms by private citizens. This is
typically not reported because 95% or more of the time, nobody is hurt
as the crook typically runs away or is peacefully subdued. THe media
only likes to publish stories of people getting killed by guns, not
being saved by guns. This is why  they always use a gun logo when a news
anchor is reporting a crime, to subliminally implant in viewers minds
the idea that guns=crime. As Goebbels said, "repeat a lie often enough,
and people will beleive it."

I take it from your posts that you are a combat veteran. If so, I highly
suggest that you seek out the help of a mental health expert to treat
your combat related gunshy neurosis. Only once this is done can you
develop a realistic evaluation of the value of guns in society.

John K Clark <johnkc@well.com> continued:

> All models are abstract.

	Yes, in a way I agree with you.  But your missing the real
issue I'm trying to point out.  If one set of physical phenomenon,
like transistors, magnetic memory, wires, and such are organized in
such a way that they model 700 nm light reflecting off a surface it is
not identically and fundamentally "like" the actual physical
phenomenon.  Another set of identical physical phenomenon is much more
like it than something that is merely abstractly like it.

	If we had identical CRTs and computers, and our brains used
the same qualia to represent the information being displayed, our
subjective experiences would be much more alike than if you or I used
a different quale to represent the text that was being displayed on
our screens.  If my brain used a different color quale to represent
the text it would be a different experience, though the behavior and
understanding about the contents of the text may be the same.

	Abstractly or behaviorally speaking, yes.  But if you are
interested in the precise subjective experience and what it is really
consciously like, the particular qualia used, and what it is like,
does make a difference.

	Yes!  Abstraction and independence of the particular physical
representation are very powerful computational and modeling notions.
But this has become one of the issues that is blinding us from being
able to discover precisely what consciousness is and what it is made
of.  It is blinding us to the important issue of what consciousness is
fundamentally like, as opposed to what it merely represents.

	No disagreement here.  Color detecting machines are much
better than we are at detecting and representing what color things
are.  I completely agree that all emotions can also be accurately
represented by sufficiently complex abstract machines.

> I don't see how any sensation can be anything but " completely
> abstract"

	Yes, red is not physically anything like 700 nm wavelength
electromagnetic radiation.  It only abstractly represents it.  But
then 700 nm light, or an abstract 32 bit number stored in an array of
transistors, isn't anything like red either.

> I'm totally confused why you equate abstract with valueless.

	Phenomenal joys have intrinsic value.  They are what give
things value in life.  Actually experiencing a stunning sunrise has
much more value than just abstractly reading about it or representing
such in an abstract virtual reality computer.  Until it is represented
and experienced by phenomenal and glorious qualia it has no real
intrinsic value.  That is why computer motivation has to be
laboriously and complexly programmed while our representations give us
simple, direct, intrinsic, natural, and much more robust motivations.

> If I discovered a new color then my understanding of red would
> change too, into something much richer.

	I simply don't agree with you here.  Red is and always will be
red.  Just like gold will always be gold and always has been gold no
matter how many more elements we have and will discover and/or
synthetically produce.  Discovering or producing a new element has no
effect on what gold is like.

	You can't YET prove it.  When we achieve the ability to freely
manipulate significant portions of the brain and thereby the resulting
consciousness this kind of understanding will become inevitable.  We
will know for sure who's theories more closely predict what we will be
able to do and understand.  One of us will eventually be convinced
that we were wrong.

	Your still missing the point.  You have phenomenal models in
your consciousness that are little round phenomenal earths, suns, and
moons that go around each other in your brain.  But again, that real
moon up in the sky and beyond your senses is not fundamentally like
your subjective and phenomenal representation of that moon that is
produced by your optic neurons, in your consciousness, when you look
at it.

> Do you just mean subjective experience? If not can you give me a
> specific example of "non abstract knowledge"?

	If there is precisely the same subjective qualia representing
text on a cathode ray tube in my consciousness to that which is
representing the same text in your consciousness then we have more
than "abstract" knowledge about what that qualia is consciously like.
Your and my experience would be the same, not merely an abstract model
of each other.

> Because the only tool we have to investigate consciousness, or even

	No, we have much more than that.  All I must do is reproduce
the same sensations in your consciousness in order for me to "eff"
them.  I will say: "Feel this, this is what salt tastes like to me."
Once you feel how salt tastes like to me you will know how it is and
isn't like what you use to represent a salty taste just as you know
salt doesn't taste anything like sugar or any other sensation.  Since
your understanding of the physics will be so thorough and reproducible
in your own mind, you will know that there is no other possibility but
that that is how salt tastes for me.

	and

> How on Earth could we ever know that?

	When we thoroughly understand the physics involved and
objectively watch the neural corelate in our own brain and see how
they precisely map to and predict the feelings we feel, the subjective
will be objectively verified and we will have effing capability.  It's
simply a matter of self calibration, and eventual expansion of our
conscious worlds using these new laws of phenomenally conscious
physics.

	I admit that sensations are complex and intermixed with and
interdependent of each other in the spirit world of our consciousness.
This is one of the problems with understanding all this.  But, my
theory or prediction is, that there are some fundamental physical
phenomenon that each of our brains use, possibly in subtly and even
occasionally grossly different ways, to build our conscious worlds of
awareness just as the complex and diverse world beyond our senses is
constructed of the basic physical elements in the periodic table.  Red
is forever red and no other sensation is like it just like gold is
forever gold and no other element is like it.

Gee Kathryn,
	So are we.    Being sterile has not dampened our attraction to sex and
THAT was the point...not bait...not a foray into Basics (whatever that
is)...just that the original author (Tony?) seemed to be saying that
reproductive context was the only basis for sexual attraction.  Our
experience does not coincide with that.

I heard the same thing.  In about 20,000 years, our star in its orbit 
around the galactic center will supposedly enter a relatively 
high-density molecular cloud.  This will supposedly wreck havoc with our 
biosphere and climate in very unpleasant ways.  Unfortuanetly, I can't 
recall where I read or heard it. If true, one more reason to get our 
butts off the womb planet!

Simple: It takes about thirty thousand genes, each hundreds of bases long,
plus thousands of hours interacting with all the complexity of the real
world, to produce human motivations.  This is simple?  It's immensely more
complex than any AI program I've ever seen the inside of.

Direct: It takes millions of neuron firings in a neural network at least
dozens of levels deep to produce even the tiniest human action.

They seem simple and direct because the conscious mind, whose purpose is to
think about what the rest of the mind is doing, and tweak it, has a very
simple and direct model.  It took modern science to reveal what an
incredibly complicated mess the mind actually is.  Don't let your
consciousness fool you into thinking motivations (or any other parts of
yourself) are simple.  Introspection is profoundly deceptive.  

As for intrinsic, natural and robust, I'll agree with you there.  Evolution
is a more robust designer than humans are, because it's made so many more
mistakes.  And of course the results are natural and intrinsic.

My comments weren't aimed at you, particularly, I was using your

Gerhard Richter, painter and essayist:

'I have committed myself to thinking and acting without the support 
of any ideology.  Nothing can help me, there is no idea I can serve 
or which, in exchange, could suggest what I must do.  No regulation 
determines how, no belief points the way, no construction or vision 
of the future provides an overarching meaning.  Ideologies are always 
the seducers and exploiters of ignorance, they justify war.'

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

Good point.  Is our spiral any more cultish than the Chrysler star?

Or the old Procter and Gamble "moon and stars" logo, which they
stopped putting on their products (but, I think, still use internally)
after a little memestorm among US religious fundamentalists about
its being a "symbol of Satan". This happened sometime in the middle
1980s.

One of the points at issue was the thirteen stars in the logo, and
none of the disgruntled people in this case believed Procter and
Gamble's official explanation that when the logo was originally
designed, the thirteen stars were put in there as a patriotic
gesture symbolizing the thirteen founding states of the United
States.

About the same time as the memestorm surrounding backward-masking of
Satanic messages in popular music lyrics, and the corresponding parade
of horribles marching into the minds of America's youth as a result.
Additionally, Dungeons and Dragons was also the "Devil's Tool," and even
Mighty Mouse was villified for "snorting" a magic "powder" that gave him
super-rodential "strength." 

Wasn't it also about this time that Reagan proclaimed "The Year of the
Bible?"

I'd rather it wasn't. There's nothing quite like seeing esoterica while
in the shower at 6 am.

Anyway, I think the ExI logo looks more like a sports franchise than a
cult -- the Maelstroms or something.

You must know how to contact me, but you don't need to know my physical 
location or know what I look like. You must know one of my names, but I could 
have others. You might have dealings with 2 names with radically different 
reputations and not know and not need to know that both are me. I might make 
part of my money honestly and it's important that I have a good reputation 
for that name so that people will know by examining my history that if make a 
deal they will treated well. I might also make money as a flim-flam artist 
selling perpetual motion machines, but I use a different name for that. 
As long as you make a deal with the first name you're safe because it's 
to my interest to maintain a good reputation for it.

The tit-for-tat strategy is to always cooperate on the first transaction and  
then do what your counterpart does.  If the population is large then most  
transactions will be the first encounter with an individual. This too is an 
oversimplification of course.

Please join us for our second on-line conference discussing topical issues
in cryptography law and policy:   "The Consent of the Governed: The
Worldwide Cryptography Debate." Presented by the Columbia University Virtual
Institute of Information (V.I.I.) and Richard Field, Esq., moderator, in
cooperation with the American Bar Association, Section of Science and
Technology.

Cryptography legislation efforts have moved ahead, in the U.S. and
worldwide.  Bills currently in the U.S. House and Senate are on conflicting
tracks.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that speech on the Internet is
strongly protected, and some courts have held that cryptography is speech.
The White House has released its framework for the Internet, with special
provisions for cryptography.  Major legislation has been put into effect in
Germany and other countries.  Our featured participants will discuss these
and other timely issues.   Add your voice to the debate and join our
featured participants, as well as other interested participants from around
the world.  You can view the discussion and add your comments, all in real
time.  This conference is free and open to the public.  The first 30 minutes
are reserved for comments from the panelists.

Thursday, July 3, 1997, 10:00 am to 12:00 noon, EDT.

Ayn Rand, writer and philosopher:

'In order to live, man must act; in order to act, he must make choices; 
in order to make choices, he must define a code of values, he must know 
*what* he is and *where* he is - i.e. he must know his own nature 
(including his means of knowledge) and the nature of the universe in 
which he acts - i.e. he needs metaphysics, epistomology, ethics, which 
means: *philosophy*. He cannot escape from this need; his only 
alternative is whether the philosophy guiding him is to be choosen by his 
mind or by chance.'

'As a human being, you have no choice about the fact that you need a 
philosophy. Your only choice is whether you define you philosophy by a 
conscious, rational, disciplined process of thought and scrupulously 
logical deliberation - or let your subconscious accumulate a junk heap of 
unwarrented conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions, 
undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown 
together by chance, but integrated by your subconscious into a kind of 
mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: *self-doubt*, 
like a ball and chain in the place of where your mind's wings should have 
grown.'

So there!  : -)

They're both right.  Philosophy vaccinates one against ideology.

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians,

This dialogue, although quite enjoyable, seems to be going off on tangents
of the hypothetical extremes. This is not that bad, nor is it that good.

I suspect, however, that some of us -- myself included -- might be getting
too emotionally involved and loosing our objectivity on the issue of gun
control by becoming involved in somewhat questionable exegesis.

Possibly, we should further consider what is in the best interest of the
continuing  evolution of humankind and its cultures. We should consider in
this context the need for greater altruism in an enhanced humanistic
environment. 

The political context of our dialogue as well should be strongly
considered if we are to believe that we are all capable of care and
concern for our fellow humans and respectful of their their right to seek
individual freedoms without the imposition of their personal constraints
and and other emotional burdens on other members of society.

Quo Vadis?

A.M. Genen

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 328 July 2, 1997    by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein

STORING AN OPTIMUM AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN A
PHOTON or any other quantum particle is possible even in the
presence of noise, researchers have concluded (B. Schumacher et
al., Physical Review A, July 1997; A.S. Holevo, upcoming in
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory).  A photon has many
different quantum states, each of which can be made to represent a
different digit.  Furthermore, one can store many digits
simultaneously in a single photon by putting it into a combination
or "superposition" of many states.  However, quantum mechanics
prevents a measuring device from perfectly distinguishing between
all these different states.  Previously, physicists discovered that the
maximum amount of information that can be read from a photon
can be no greater than the amount of entropy, or disorder, it
acquires when a range of quantum states is created to represent
different digits.  Now, the researchers show that this upper limit can
be reached, even in a noisy environment, by utilizing several
strategies, such as employing only those quantum states that are
most distinguishable.  These findings provide insights into how little
energy is required to store a message.  (For more details, go to

I must plead E-Prime on this one. To ask what man *is* suggests that man
does not *become*. Knowing one's nature and the nature of the universe
in which one exists is IMO the ultimate goal. If I can finally know what
I *am*, then I have stopped evolving. Since time doesn't stand still for
me, I become incorrect about what I *am* only a millisecond later.

Kathryn Aegis quoted:
> >Gerhard Richter, painter and essayist:

and Joshua McMichael retorted by quoting:
> Ayn Rand, writer and philosopher:

A fairly reasonable synthesis of these two views (at least reasonable
enough for me to be experimenting with recently) is philosophical
pluralism. The first paragraph from Rand is a fairly solid argument:

> his only alternative is whether the philosophy guiding him is to be 
> choosen by his mind or by chance

but this last bit is unfortunately not so clear a distinction as
we might want, as long as the nature of 'mind' lies buried in the
mysteries of neuroscience and the ceaseless controversies of
psychology. (Nonetheless, I agree with the first paragraph.)

It seems to me that having worked out in one's mind several different
self-consistent (but not necessarily mutually consistent) philosophies
from which one can choose according to the dictates of reason and
the situation in which one finds oneself, is a great advantage. So
philosophical analysis, exploration, and argument is useful and
even vital, but *commitment* to one particular philosophy or ideology
is perhaps not.

The current hardware platform on which most philosophers run is
Linguistic Monkey 3.24, and I don't see any particular reason to
think that this kludge should be capable of intellectual mastery
of the cosmos in some final, absolute philosophical sense.  (Although
the Buddhists keep looking to me like either they're onto something,
or on something.) To err is human, and refusing to commit to one
particular philosophy or ideology is refusing to commit to our own
errors. I prefer to let my errors die in my stead, rather than
resolutely maintaining them to the last, and I'm fairly sure that
all of my current philosophies will have been demonstrated erroneous
within a few centuries. Call it a hunch, if you like. (If I'm lucky,
I'll have come up with their replacements long before my rivals
have written their refutations. ;)

In the meantime, I get by with the tools (philosophies) that I've
got, and try to use the right tool for the job that happens to be
in front of me at the moment. I am well aware that this treads
dangerously close to instrumentalism, and having long been dissatisfied
with the simpler varieties of instrumentalism myself, I'm not too
happy with it either. This dissatisfaction, though, is quite
satisfactory to me, because without it I might become a dogmatic
instrumentalist, and that would be simply dreadful. There are few
philosophical positions I can imagine that seem worse than dogmatic
mushymindedness.

I am also well aware that openly espousing such a radically
pluralistic philosophical stance might cause some to call my
integrity into question. All I have to say about this is that I
try to base my judgements of the integrity of others on my
observation of their actions more than on my observation of the
philosophical arguments they write. Perhaps this is a mistake,
but it's my current policy.

     Just got some snazzy Win95 wallpaper (okay the resolution could be 
     better) of the composite photo of the Hubble Deep Field, a patch of 
     sky 1/30th the diameter of the full moon and completely dark as viewed 
     by the human eye.  Hubble's images are billions of times greater than 
     what we could see.  The astronomers set their sight on this dark area 
     of the sky only to render a field with hundreds of GALAXIES.  Even if 
     it's not infinity, it's inifite ENOUGH (there's that debate over 
     ENOUGH again <G>) for we present-day pre-immortal beings.
     
     I've just been with that feeling of awe for a few days, the incredible 
     enormity of it all.  We are looking out farther and looking in deeper 
     (both physically and mentally).  It seems that as we become a smaller 
     and smaller blip in the vastness, we become more aware of our 
     fundamental connection to it all.  
     
     This morning, some very unattractive old guy in an even-less 
     attractive clunker of a van cut me off at an intersection.  Living in 
     a dense urban area, one's instinct is to chide, flip off, grumble some 
     protest (which I did).  However, it's starting to hit me more and more 
     that as soon as I say that, something says back "He's you".  Today, 
     this prompted a philosophical question of why/how could he be ME?  Why 
     am I considering that I am not the isolated individual, but part of a 
     continuum where we are just beginning to free exchange ideas, energy 
     and contribution?  
     
     Further, what is selfhood that it could be supposedly preserved 
     chemically and resurrected from deep freeze?  What is life without the 
     context of familiarity?  Does it take only an advanced intellect to 
     re-adapt to an unrecognizeable future to which you suddenly awaken?  
     Or does it take a disconnected heart as well?  Does the person with 
     irrecoverable amnesia, who remembers no past, has no context, no 
     affinity with lovers, family, even children...has that original 
     unrecoverable person died since there is no self context?  Is one's 
     self an energy, an essence?  Or is the physiology of our bodies a 
     conduit and containment field for that which is us?  At the end of 
     life, are we just as willing to give up the notion of the self we've 
     amassed as we would a role in a play and just go onto another role 
     (human, explicitly sentient or not) in the continuum of 
     energy/information exchange in this vastness?
     
     If I had to choose ongoingness of my personal awareness, I'd choose an 
     uploading and storage of my experiences because that's more me than my 
     body which seems to curiously change from year to year.  Freezing my 
     body (or even more whimsically, my head) seems a rather quaint notion. 
      Does extropian thinking focus so much on the physically proven and 
     sound as to consider this the most preferable and viable solution to 
     achieving "immortality"?  As a mental exercise, I wonder what 
     discoveries of the essence, the unforseen would radically change such 
     notions?  That which is beyond the horizon where the fishermen's wives 
     are no longer visible from the shore and you are going on gut instinct 
     and conviction.
     
     The Deep Field photo struck me in somewhat the same way the end of the 
     second Moriarty episode of ST:TNG where they were able to convince him 
     into believing he was no longer a holographically conjured character 
     but a free, sentient and physically REAL person.  But in the *actual* 
     reality, (the Star Trek reality), he was only a program with plenty of 
     storage in a small cube, perfectly content and oblivious to any 
     preconceived limits other than his own perceived mortality.  
     
     Personally, I'm rather curious about what happens to a "self" released 
     from physical containment.  I suppose for some extropians, in comes 
     down to going for the likelier (or preferred) outcome: being 
     resurrected physically in a more advanced future Earth or being 
     separated from a pre-established self and assimilated into the unknown 
     (which could also include just ceasing to "be" in a physical and/or 
     self-aware capacity).  Is life extension enough?  Is even immortality 
     enough?  Seems like life without challenge and quest is apathy and 
     inertia, once assured comfort has become mundane and there's no energy 
     one needs to devote towards the most inane survival issue.
     
     To subscribe to life extension methods such as cryonics, I'd have to 
     be more sure of what "life" is.  Too many details missing from this to 
     make an informed decision.  To me, it's akin to a kid saying, when I 
     grow up, I want to be a firefighter, all because s/he likes the trucks 
     and the uniform and is completely oblivious to the danger and 
     personality type required for such a job.  Maybe that's enough of a 
     notion to go fot it.  For me, cryonics sounds like a better spin on 
     life insurance...you may get to enjoy it.  Gentlemen, place your bets.

SCIENTISTS URGE CAUTION IN AWARDING OF HUMAN GENE PATENTS
Continuing the expression of concern about the manner in which
current U.S. intellectual property laws may interfere with
scientific research, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences has
joined the National Institutes of Health and the Human Genome
Organization in protesting an interpretation of current patent
law that would permit the issuing of patents on what are called
"expressed gene sequence tags". Bruce Alberts, president of the
National Academy of Sciences, warns against "patents that allow
an early group of inventors who have disclosed little new
knowledge to constrain the actions of subsequent investigators."
(Nature 26 June)

SECRECY OF AGRICULTURAL GENOME DATABASES CRITICIZED
If there is one area where molecular genetics is of international
political relevance it is agriculture. Every country is
interested in improving its food supply, and to this end there is
much effort devoted to genetics research, particularly research
to map the genomes of plants such as corn and rice. Plant
biologist Christopher Somerville (Carnegie Institution of
Washington in Stanford, CA US) recently criticized the delays by
some countries in releasing plant genome data to the scientific
community. The laboratories slowest to release data already in
their possession are evidently in Europe, Japan, and China.
Apparently, no release from China of acquired data has yet
occurred. In the U.S., projects underway by corporate giants such
as Monsanto and DuPont have also not been eager to supply data.
The consequence is that plant molecular geneticists are deprived
of scientific information important for their own research, the
results of which are by tradition freely reported and available
to everyone. (Science 27 June)

LEGISLATORS ANGRY AT POSSIBLE NIH-FUNDED EMBRYO RESEARCH
Harold Varmus, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health
(NIH), evidently had a difficult time before a Congressional
investigating committee on June 19th. The issue was the ban by
the U.S. Congress of NIH-funded embryo research. An established
researcher, Mark Hughes, apparently used NIH facilities while
pursuing his investigations of disease-causing mutations in DNA
extracted from single cells from embryos created by in vitro
fertilization techniques. Evidently Varmus and Hughes cannot
agree whether Hughes knew his research was proscribed, and NIH
has severed its connection with Hughes. Meanwhile, the
Congressional subcommittee has warned Varmus to enforce the rules
concerning embryo research more strictly. (Science 27 June)

LACK OF RULES CONCERNING AUTHORSHIP LISTINGS CRITICIZED
Since scientists are usually evaluated in terms of both the
quality and quantity of what they publish, and since most
scientific publications these days are produced by more than one
author (sometimes by as many as twenty authors), there exists
what is called the "authorship problem", which has several
aspects. For example, people who have only a tangential but
influential bureaucratic relationship with a research group may
force the inclusion of their names as "authors" of a scientific
report. Another problem is that some laboratories list the senior
author last, others list the senior author first, and still other
laboratories list all authors alphabetically at the head of the
research report. There are no rules, much confusion, occasional
bitterness, unfair advantages, petty disputes, and so on, and
this week an unsigned editorial in Nature criticizes the
authorship system in general and says any solution to the problem
seems hopeless. Scientists, after all, are members of the human
species. (Nature 26 June)

ASTRONOMERS AGREEING ON THEORY OF GALAXY FORMATION AND EVOLUTION
Among contemporary cosmologists, there are two prevailing models
for the formation of galaxies. One model is hierarchical, in the
sense that small amorphous proto-galaxies are considered to form
first, these evolving into spiral galaxies, and the spiral
galaxies then merging to form elliptical galaxies. The other
model is a completely different picture, considering the various
galaxies to form from the condensation of single massive dust
clouds, with the particular type of galaxy formed dependent on
the nature of the dust cloud collapse. At two recent cosmology
symposia, in view of new red-shift data (shifts to the red end of
the spectrum of light from the galaxies) provided by the Hubble
Space Telescope, cosmologists are apparently forming a consensus
that the first idea, the hierarchical model, is more consistent
with the observed data than the second model. The Hubble Space
Telescope has brought a renaissance to cosmology, and we are only
at the beginning of the new era. (Nature 26 June)

OPTICAL STUDIES OF A GAMMA-RAY BURST SUGGEST FIREBALL MODEL
Studies of the mysterious gamma-ray bursts seen in every part of
the sky daily continue to be reported. This week we have the
results of observations of gamma ray burst (GRB) GRB970508, which
occurred on May 8, 1997 (hence the name). Optical studies of the
source of the burst by M. R. Metzger et al (California Institute
of Technology, US; National Radio Astronomy Observatory, US;
Institute of Space Astrophysics, Frascati IT; University of
Ferrara, IT) using data from the recently orbited Italian-Dutch
satellite BeppoSAX indicate the source of the GRB is extra-
galactic at a distance of 5 billion parsecs (about 20 trillion
miles). Taking into account the recorded energy and its loss by
intervening absorption across that distance, we are considering
an initial energy burst with a magnitude equal to the total
radiation from our Sun during the entire age of the universe. The
computed energy figure is 10exp51 ergs of gamma-rays. A consensus
among astrophysicists is forming that these GRBs involve
"relativistic fireballs" produced by colliding neutron stars,
either two neutron stars colliding with each other, or single
neutron stars colliding with black holes. The various radiant
energy data are coming in so rapidly now, there is a feeling the
physical nature of GRBs will soon be completely understood.
(Nature 26 June)

UNEXPECTED SHAPES FORMED BY COLLOIDS IN MICROGRAVITY CONDITIONS
Colloids are extremely small phases (e.g., solid particles) in
the range one nanometer to one micron dispersed in a larger phase
of a different substance, for example in water. They can be
bubbles, globules, microcrystals, etc. In the 1930s, many cell
biologists were excited by the study of colloids because the
interior of the living cell, protoplasm, has many properties of a
colloidal suspension. These days the study of colloids is almost
exclusively the province of the physical chemist. Although
colloidal particles are small, they are much larger than
molecules, large enough to perhaps be affected by gravitational
forces. This week the results of experiments with uniform
colloidal polymer particles carried out in microgravity
conditions aboard the space shuttle Columbia in November 1995
were reported by Jixiang Zhu et al (Princeton University, US;
NASA Lewis Research Center, US; University of Bristol, UK;
Johnson Space Flight Center, US). It was found that the colloidal
crystallization properties of the particles studied are indeed
significantly different under microgravity conditions.
Theoretical models of the behavior of colloidal suspensions
therefore need to take into account the gravitational forces
acting on the particles. (Nature 26 June)

NEW DATA WEAKENS LINKAGE BETWEEN CLIMATE AND MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION
Paleobiologists have traditionally considered drastic climate
changes to be the major provocation in the emergence of new
mammalian species. But at a recent meeting of the American Geo-
physical Union in Baltimore (MD US), John Alroy (Smithsonian
Institution, US) presented the results of an extensive analysis
of the fossil and climatic record and showed that the expected
correlation between the emergence of new mammalian species is
weak rather than strong, and that the data suggest evolutionary
spurts during periods of reduced extant species, for example that
following what is called "the great impact" of 65 million years
ago. Alroy's work apparently impressed the assembled paleo-
biologists. (Science 27 June)

SECOND HUMAN ANTIBIOTIC ISOLATED FROM SKIN
Although endogenous antibiotic peptides exist in both plant and
animal species, it is only recently (1995) that an endogenous
antibiotic has been isolated in humans (hBD-1). Now J. Harder et
al (University of Kiel, DE) report the identification and
isolation of a second human endogenous antibiotic peptide, named
hBD-2, relative molecular mass 4000, of the protein rubric beta-
defensin. This new peptide is an inducible, transcriptionally
regulated antibiotic peptide resembling those in other mammals.
Human skin apparently contains a chemical shield of endogenous
peptide antibiotics induced by contact with microorganisms. The
authors suggest that human peptide antibiotics might be ideal
therapeutic agents to counteract problems of acquired microbial
resistance. (Nature 26 June)

NEW EVIDENCE FOR POTASSIUM CHANNEL REGULATION IN NEURON DENDRITES
The electrical activity of nerve cells in all species is
essentially controlled by the movements of ions, particularly
sodium, potassium, and calcium ions, across nerve cell membranes.
Some nerve cells, especially those in the mammalian brain, have a
complicated architecture, with extensive branching into dendrites
that receive input from other nerve cells. The broad picture of
ion movements in nerve cell axons (the output extensions of nerve
cells) is rather well-known, but the ion movements in dendrites
are less understood because of experimental difficulties. Now Dax
A. Hoffman et al (Baylor College of Medicine, TX US) have
reported a study of potassium ion regulation in a type of nerve
cell in a part of the brain called the hippocampus. The
experiments involved tissue slices of the rat brain, a standard
technique for studying mammalian brain electrical activity. At
the present time, it is axiomatic that all mammalian neurons
exhibit the same general ion dynamics, which means studies of
neurons of the rat brain can be revelatory for our understanding
of neurons of the human brain. Hoffman and his group found a high
density of transient potassium ion channels in the dendrites of
the neurons they studied. They present an analysis of how these
channels regulate the responsiveness of the studied neurons to
input from other nerve cells. This new data will need to be
considered by all neurobiologists interested in the functioning
of human brain nerve cells. (Nature 26 June)

FIRST IDENTIFICATION OF MOUSE OBESITY GENE IN HUMANS
In 1994 an obesity gene and its protein product (leptin), were
discovered in obese mice. It has been determined that a defect in
the gene causes a severe reduction in the output of functional
leptin by fat cells (adipocytes). Leptin apparently acts as a
messenger to the hypothalamus in the brain, the absence of the
protein causing excessive eating behavior without satiation. Now
a similar gene has been discovered in humans, this gene also
responsible for the production of leptin by human adipocytes.
Carl T. Montague et al (15 authors at various installations, UK)
studied a homozygous genetic defect in two children suffering
from extreme obesity, and have isolated and characterized the
gene, and related it to the previously identified mouse gene
known as ob/ob. As in mice, the result of a defect in the gene is
an order of magnitude reduction in the circulating blood
concentration of the protein leptin. The results do not mean that
all instances of obesity in humans are produced by defects in
this gene, but certainly a new area of research into the
molecular genetics of human obesity has now been defined. In
addition, the authors offer the hope that recombinant human
leptin may be found to correct leptin deficiency in clinical
cases. (Nature 26 June)

DISCOVERY OF GENE IMPLICATED IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Defects in the structure of the protein alpha-synuclein have been
implicated in several human brain pathologies, including
Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. Now a specific
type of familial, early-onset Parkinson's disease has been added
to the list. Mihael H. Polymeropoulos (20 authors at various
installations, US, IT, GR) have identified a mutation in the
alpha-synuclein gene in three unrelated families of Greek origin
exhibiting inherited early-onset Parkinsonism. A consensus is
growing that defects in the structure of alpha-synuclein may be
responsible for an array of human brain pathologies, with at
least some of the protein structural defects caused by inherited
genetic mutations. Alpha-synuclein has been previously shown to
be a presynaptic nerve terminal protein. The early visible
symptoms of Parkinsonism are produced by destruction of nerve
cells producing the hormone dopamine. In later stages of the
disease, destruction of other types of nerve cells occurs. This
new study does not provide evidence for a genetic basis for all
cases of Parkinsonism, but it serves as a pointer for researchers
studying the molecular biology of the disease. (Science 27 June)

NEW STUDY REFUTES CONNECTION BETWEEN MAGNETIC FIELDS AND CANCER
Eighteen years ago, two researchers in Denver (CO US) noticed
small clusters of childhood leukemia cases (acute lymphoblastic
leukemia) and published a report in a medical journal relating
these cases to the presence of high-voltage power lines near the
childrens' residences, ascribing the relationship to the effects
of electrically induced magnetic fields on human tissue.
Although such magnetic fields can be shown by physical analysis
to be insignificant, much smaller than the already present steady
magnetic field of the Earth itself, amplification of concern by
the international media resulted in a near panic in many
countries. What is ironic is that in the first study, and in
later studies which claimed positive results, magnetic fields
were never measured, but were "estimated" using varying criteria.
In addition, the number of cases studied was always small, and
adequate controls were often nonexistent. Nevertheless, the
public concern increased, partly due to a three-part series in
the magazine New Yorker that claimed collusion by industry and
government in preventing dissemination of information about the
"true" state of affairs. Both physicists and physicians cognizant
of physics always denied the validity of the claims of a
relationship, and a number of studies with negative results were
carried out. Now the largest and most carefully controlled study
ever undertaken of this alleged relationship, a study involving
638 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 620 controls,
with actual physical measurements of magnetic fields by
technicians blinded to the cases and controls, has revealed no
connection at all between measured magnetic fields and diagnosis
of childhood leukemia. Results of the new study were reported
this week by Martha S. Linet et al (various installations in the
US). (New England Journal of Medicine 3 July)

MAGNETIC FIELD STUDIES CALLED WASTE OF PUBLIC FUNDS
In an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine,
commenting on the results reported above, and the international
near hysteria that has existed for almost two decades over the
possibility that magnetic fields induced by power lines cause
cancer, Edward W. Campion says, "It is sad that hundreds of
millions of dollars have gone into studies that never had much
promise of finding a way to prevent the tragedy of cancer in
children." (New England Journal of Medicine 3 July)

A DANGEROUS SHORTAGE OF INTRAVENOUS MULTIVITAMIN SOLUTIONS
Vitamins are chemical substances not produced by the body, but
which are essential for many physiological processes. Vitamins
must therefore be taken into the body by one route or another.
Some vitamins, such as thiamine (Vitamin B1), are not stored by
the body, and the input, usually through the diet, must occur
almost every day. Reduction of thiamine levels produces insidious
results, the most notorious of which is perhaps the symptoms of
the neurological disease known as beriberi. Ordinarily, the input
of thiamine and other vitamins is a simple matter of an adequate
diet, but patients with digestion problems, adults and neonates,
particularly those with "short bowels" following gastrointestinal
surgery, often need intravenous vitamin administration. In this
week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine there are
three letters addressing the apparent severe shortage of
intravenous vitamin solution in the U.S. and other countries.
Intravenous vitamin solution is an elementary chemical production
entity, but evidently there are only two suppliers in the U.S.,
production for some reason stopped at the end of 1996, and
intravenous vitamin solution is now almost impossible to obtain
anywhere. The problem is stated in a letter by M. Alloju and M.
Ehrinpreis (Wayne State University, US). In a second letter,
Astra USA, one of the suppliers, says they had design and
engineering problems with new equipment. In a third letter,
Kenneth A. Kudsk et al (American Society for Parenteral and
Enteral Nutrition, MD US) say they have no adequate explanation
for the duration and severity of the shortage. They also state
they know of 22 present cases of thiamine deficiency in patients
receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition, and that in 1988,
at the time of another shortage of intravenous multivitamins,
"several deaths resulted from cardiac failure due to thiamine-
deficient total parenteral nutrition among patients within a few
weeks of not receiving vitamins." (New England Journal of
Medicine 3 July)

The non-static nature of existence is perhaps one of Rand's weak points,
but I don't see it here.  Existence and identity /do/ exist, in the
present tense, in a meaningful way, and this reliance on "becoming" is
in this case an evasion, not a clarification.

Interesting, yes, but a damned poor piece of scholarship.  Lots of
examples of "bad" usage of English and "good" E-Prime, but anyone with
5 minutes reflection can come up with good English and bad E-Prime,
and the fact that he doesn't even try to do so should be a clue to the
quality of the idea.

If you've ever worked for a big company, there are elements of cultism 
all over the place.  From corporate "rah-rah sessions" to "Team Spirit" 
to Company motto's.  I always find it funny that the people most easily 
"brainwashed" by company philosphies are the ones who advance most 
readily up the coprate ladder.

I've been there, I've wondered that. I am the sun on my face, for without
it I would cease to be. I am my friends, for without them I would not be
who I am. Every time communication occurs, the boundary between self and
other blurs.

Speaking only for myself, getting frozen is the second worst thing that
could happen to me. Most afterlife stories seem rather quaint to me.
But I try to remember that from the right vantage point, all adjectives
are "quaint"... they tell much more about the observer than the observed.

Again, speaking only for myself, the best way to achieve immortality (in
Woody Allen's words) is by not dying.

On the other hand, I believe there are some things worth dying for--and
that these things include finding out "what's next"--IF such is your
desire.

Paradoxically, I find myself worrying a lot less about my eventual
demise, and my place in the cosmos, since signing up. It's like "Well,
that's handled about as well as I can manage (as long shots go)... now
what is my _life_ about?"

It _is_ a long shot. Absolutely. I can do very little about the state of
the preservation-of-self art when/if I get frozen; my focus is on helping
create a world, as I mentioned in another post, that satisfies my two
"least criteria":
1) a world that I wouldn't mind coming back to, and 
2) a world that wouldn't mind bringing me back.

Oddly enough, helping create such a world seems to imply living a
virtuous, possibly even Christlike, life. And when I'm doing my best, I
don't mind that much if I don't come back. "A good day to die", in the
overused Native American phrase.

Consider cryonics as a transport protocol: in time, rather than in space.
If bringing someone back someday costs about what a Life Flight medevac
helicopter ride and an overnight stay in a hospital costs today (say, $10k
total)--why *not* do it? The Golden Rule is a *good* I-and-thou myth.

If it's ever _proven_ that recovering _the person_, whatever that turns
out to be, is a fundamental impossibility... Well, I bet a lousy $100k
insurance policy and a dollar a day for my cryonics society membership, 
and I "lost". No big deal, some people spend more on exotic vacations or
powdering their noses. And if I really died _dead_ anyway, then the 
Cosmic Whatsis had its way with me, no? Om shanti.

Now, there's a bare possibility that getting frozen will result in my
becoming a "ghost", unable fully to participate in Whatever Comes Next,
but if the pull of the Cosmic Whatsis is that powerful I expect I'll be
freed eventually.

If that's your absolute top priority, go for it! I respect your right to
choose. Heinlein is reported to have said "How do I know it won't
interfere with reincarnation?" when polled, near the end of his life, by a
significant figure in the Cryonics scene. That man told me the story with
a bitter shake of the head; I just closed my eyes for a moment and nodded.

I'll let you know once I've fully conquered my human genetic apparent 
predisposition for dysthymia (See David Pearce's _Hedonistic Imperative_
Website). Having spent roughly 30 years in an endocrine holding pattern, I
believe I could do with a few hundred of worthwhile striving--and yes, I
do include cooperation in that :).

Einstein is reputed to have said, late in life, "The most important
question a person can ask is: 'Is the universe a friendly place?'."
Either answer allows for plenty room to construct a Meaning of Life, and
as much melodrama/"attachment" as you desire. If you're perfectly detached
and desireless, then relaxing and floating downstream "is not dying"...
and so what?

The myth that I am in here and you are out there is how we live these
days, most of us, most of the time. Sometimes we mung it, and sometimes it
mungs us. If that changes, everything else changes.

Paraphrasing the senior archangel at the end of _Stranger in a Strange
Land_, "Of course 'thou art god'--now quit being so formal and _get back
to work_!"

Absolutely, that's all it is. As I mentioned, I feel freer, able on a more
relaxed way, to discuss and even plan for my own possible eventual
mortality, having hedged as best I can.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

	For terminology, I find I prefer "transference" to "uploading"
to denote that ultimate self-upgrading by extending our consciousness
onto/into a computer, a radically different substrate than our own
aging-susceptible human bodies.

	What I want is not just a facsimile program of my self running
in a computer.  As far as I'm concerned, that would not be
immortality.  What I want is the essentials of my selfhood, whatever I
experience that to be -- not just "copied" or "uploaded" -- but
*transferred* inside a machine -- and literally shuffle off this
mortal coil of my human body.  I believe most Extropians want this as
well, or at least find it to be a very intruiging prospect.

	I grant that anybody who knows about computers can grasp the
concept of "uploading," but it's still a misleading term, because
transference is more daunting than either the problem of AI (your
transferred self will be an AI; we had better know how to run such
programs) or uploading (transmitting a digital copy of yourself to a
computer; we would need to understand the brain) -- both of which are
necessary *but not sufficient* to effect transference, which much
include a sense of continuity of self.

	Also, I find I prefer transference's connotations.  Uploading
has computer geeky, science-fictiony connotations.  Transference
connotes better with a "philosophy of transhumanism."

	What do other list members think?

The terminology doesn't matter much to me, really. We're all talking
about the same thing. However I do think that uploading is the
commonly-accepted descriptive. You are sending data to another platform,
this is uploading. I suppose for the new platform, receiving you is akin
to downloading. Either way, it's a transfer. Nonetheless, I'll probably
stick with uploading. 

As far as geekiness and SF are concerned, uploading/downloading are
everyday terms these days. IMO, non-geeks and even starched
country-clubbers who've never read SF in their life are just as apt to
use them in idle chit-chat as the most net-savvy cybernaut. Moreover,
even if one doesn't use the terms, one probably knows what it means. 

But, of course, I could be wrong.

Hagbard

Wilson's main claim against Sagan appears to be that Sagan initially
ranted against Velikovsky's ideas which were 'clearly' false, and then
when many of those ideas turned out to be true Sagan adopted them as his
own. There's a web page on the subject, but I don't have the URL handy. 

Personally I'm no fan of Sagan, given his love of politically-motivated
science (e.g. 'Nuclear Winter').

Sorry. 

In the situation, the person would not be killed for that reason, as
they have committed much more heinous reasons for which to be erased,
but may be spared if they indicated that they had the capacity to be
redeemed. It is to determine whether the material being judged is
capable of being recycled or should be incinerated that such an
evaluation is made... The criminal must demonstrate their capacity to be
redeemed. If he doesn't, lets not waste further tax dollars on him, fry
the mad dog.

I value human life highly. So highly that I feel that people who do not
value human life do not value their own life enough to go on living.

And if you compare his performance before the board then to his prior
ones in which he was denied parole, you can visibly see a difference in
the earnestness of the character. Before when he is saying "I've learned
my lesson, etc." you can tell he's bullshitting. When he finally says
what you quote, you can see that he accepts the boards authority to do
what they wish. He is essentially broken. They know then that he is of
no further threat to society...

What tangents? Every argument you have made without substantiation has
been countered with statistical evidence, which you continue to ignore
or constest. Is this an admittance of error or merely an aversion to
confrontation?

In an enhanced humanistic environment, the sanctity of the individual
would be of paramount importance. Violation of this sanctity should be
met with deadly force to ensure a proper level of memetic and
psychological deterrence against further encroachment by individuals,
groups, and nations with little respect for the sanctity of the
individual.

Exactly. The irrational fears of emotionally undeveloped individuals
should not justify the imposition of constraints upon my or anyone elses
freedoms, including, most importantly, the right to defend oneself
against the constraints or impositions of others.

"Han Y. Huang" <hhuang@mit.edu> proposed the usage of the word
"transference".

	I kind of like this idea also.

	Another possibility I like to think about is the possibility
of how the subjective experience of "transference" might be produced.

	First off, I'm a representationalists, so I believe everything
we are aware of is represented in our brain.  For me, there is a kind
of 'spirit world' in our mind that is everything we consciously know
via our senses.  We aren't really directly aware of the tree out there
we are looking at, but merely a conscious model constructed of qualia
(or spiritual stuff or whatever you want to call it) in our model of
the world in our conscious mind.

	At the center of this model of the world in our brain is the
model or conscious precept of ourselves.  It feels like we are just
behind our eyes.  This physical location must be due to the way this
conscious model is produced in our brain in this conscious world of
our awareness.

	In some way the entire world of all our senses is unified into
a single awareness.  Our sight, sound, tactile senses are all unified
into a single spirit world of consciousness.  If we understand how to
recreate such conscious worlds of awareness we will also understand
how to expand these worlds of awareness.  For example, if we add eyes
behind our head and the corresponding additional visual cortex, it
would have to be integrated into and expand the world of our awareness
we already have.  Our initial visual cortex would produce our
awareness or model of what we see in front of us and the new one would
add to this, the model of what we see behind us.  All in one unified
awareness space.  Just as the data from both eyes produces one
combined 3d model of awareness.  With eyes around our head our field
of vision could be increased to be 360 degrees wide modeling
everything around us in our consciousness.

	Similarly we should be able to add yet another similarly
integrated visual cortex that could be fed data produced by another's
set of eyes.  Giving us direct awareness, in the same awareness space,
of another entirely different point of view.

	Anyway, what I'm leading up to is, I like to think about the
possibility of synching up the conscious awareness model or spirit
world of the platform we will be uploaded to with our own conscious
awareness before uploading.  In other words it will all be one unified
world of awareness.  It might be possible to architect it in such a
way that our conscious model of ourselves actually migrates, or moves,
or "transfers", within this unified conscious model of space, which
included representations of the two old and new platforms within it
and their sensual points of view.  Everything being universally aware
to this combined consciousness in the same subjective space.

	If we understand how to properly control qualia and build and
expand conscious awareness worlds in this way, like our brain does
with the data collected by our current multiple senses, we should be
able to produce the experience of "moving" between hosts in any of
many possible ways.  It could be made to feel like an "out of body"
experience where our "soul" (the conscious representation of ourselves
in this conscious space) leaves one body and floats to the new
platform.  Or it could feel like our "self" was traversing down the
physical connection as if it was a tube that was unifying the two
conscious worlds into one combined awareness.

	Anyway, these technical descriptions are probably way to brief
but I hope at least some of you can get the idea.  Anyone have any
other thoughts along these lines?

Not entirely true. Much of my response was not statistical. Here's more:

I don't consider fundamentals of human behavior to be tangents, but
postulates.
A.M. seems to be interested in developing what seems to ba a Fabian vision of 
well-mannered perfect(able) abstractions. Wow. 6+ billion and counting,
surely 
a tall order? Well, not if one makes the proper simplifying assumptions.

It's a bit like the old joke whose punch line goes "assume a spherical cat..."
Or like Lenin musing aloud to his crowd, "What is to be done?"

NOTE: No, A.M., I am not calling you Lenin. OK?

I'd love to help engender a world where people respect each other more. 
I hope, by my agnostic vision of godliness, to make some contribution in
that wise.
But, to quote myself,

>When respect for one's fellow man is strong, arms are an utter non-issue.
>Absent that respect, what remains?

I consider the first sentence true, based on personal experience. 
I consider the following question fundamental, not tangential.

There is nothing abstract about a twice-previously-raped career nurse being 
accosted in a parking garage. Nothing *whatsoever*. How _dare_ anyone deny 
her the power to stop her assailant?

Kathryn Aegis and ard-AGAPE discuss the demarcation of Eros, Agape, 
sexualitiy, coercion and consent, and the intimate interactive exchange of 
conscious contact -- and shared sensual experience -- and intelligent 
interconsciousness betwwen people.

Here are some case histories:

Avedon Carol was discussing her being molested, raped and beaten, and her 
discovery of the joys of discovering the joys of masturbation for herself 
at the age of six.

To which I responded: (All of the following is true, BTW)

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Anduril >Well, Avedon, I was subjected to a sexual assault as a child, in our
local woods where I was playing, by a youth who was later given a custodial
sentence for the offence.  I don't remember much, except that I hated running
home over sharp stones on unpaved roads with no shoes and socks on (the guy
had taken them away to slow me down).  I learned (again) that people can do
things to you if they're bigger and stronger than you are.  'Ruined'?  Nope.


    I was much more upset by having creosote thrown in my face (blinding 
me for three days) when I was 9 or 10.  The attacker was never identified. 
But 'ruined'?  Nope.  Unless I'd been permanently blinded, as they feared 
I might have been.


    I was even more upset by being repeatedly and viciously caned on the
outstretched fingers of my left hand at primary school (making it impossible
to write or play the piano for days at a time), in a -- failed -- attempt to
make me right-handed.  Every time i involuntarily moved my outstretched 
hand, 'that stroke didn't count.' I don't recall anyone suggesting 
prosecuting the headmaster who did it.  'Ruined'?  Nope.  He did die soon after, ISTR...
>:-}

At Dulwich College, aged 11 and 12, we had to swim naked (for unexplained 
reasons), while the prefects 'talent-spotted' from the balcony.


    I was even less pleased when, at Dulwich College, we were subjected to
what I guess we'd have to call two-hour sessions of protracted ritual 
torture, for the sexual gratification of the prefects who were doing it to 
us, with other prefects looking on, doing things under the newspapers 
covering their laps.  Some of the better-looking kids were tortured until 
they agreed to provide passive and active sexual services to the prefects. 
I'm a bit upset that these same prefects have gone on to 'run the country' 
now.  But 'ruined' by it? Nope.  Killing them, OTOH...


    I was really angry when, at Geelong Grammar School in Australia, aged 16,
the school authorities set out to destroy my (non-physical) emotional
relationship with a younger boy, aged 14, who had become fond of me.  They
leaned heavily on me, which was totally unproductive, so they set to
repeatedly caning _him_, until he became physically incapable of even talking
to me.  This I consider _unforgiveable_.


I was given a three-day ultimatum a fortninght before my University 
entance exams, that I should submit to being beaten by Robin Gorton and 
his house prefects in the _showers_ (not, note carefully, in his study...)

I'm writing a (screen)play on this.

    I was more worried by what 'the authorities' were doing to kids all the
while; personality-ablation electroshock; psychosurgery; drug 'treatments';
incarceration in 'institutions'; kidnapping them into 'care' institutions
then shipping them off to the middle of nowhere in Canada and Australia to
build the 'White Commonwealth' (this until the mid-Sixties!).  These things
could have ruined my life (they did for tens of thousands).

    And all the while, I was growing up under the shadow of military
conscription ('National Service'!) where the military could (try to) destroy
your very identity by gross coercion.  I might have volunteered to be a RAF
pilot, but I'd have killed to avoid conscription.  This could have 'ruined my
life', I guess.

    All too true.

True, and a bunch of neurons and the strength of their interconnections is 
not identical or even similar to 700 nm light either.

If your subjective experience was different but your behavior was the same 
then consciousness would be useless as far as Evolution was concerned and 
would have never bothered to produce it. To my mind this is one of the 
strongest indications that you're wrong about behavior being unrelated to 
consciousness.

When you drink a cup of coffee not only do some of these silly irrelevant 
qualities chance but your behavior does too. Are you the same person after  
you drink a cup of coffee?

You want to understand the mind but you don't want to use  behavior and now 
you don't want to use the only thing that can explain it, information theory.  
I wish you good luck, you'll need it.

There's that A word again.

Slice open a brain and look at it, not only will you not find any 700 nm 
light in it you will not find red either, it's gray. Open up a racing car, 
you will not find speed inside. I think you're confusing levels.
        

        >Phenomenal joys have intrinsic value.  


The only thing that has intrinsic value is consciousness, by that I mean the 
thing itself thinks it is valuable. If something is not conscious then it 
doesn't think so it has no intrinsic value, although of course it could have 
extrinsic value. Anyway, that's what I think.

Looking at an object made of a new color against a red background would give 
meaning to both colors they didn't have before.


        >Just like gold will always be gold and always has been gold no        
        >matter how many more elements we have and will discover 


That's because an element does not derive its meaning from the presence or  
absence of another element, color is different. Without contrast color is 
meaningless.

Again, I agree but I don't see the relevance. Neither I nor an upload would

You may indeed be able to find the correct theory of consciousness, but there 
is no way you could ever know it was correct or in any way better than the 
other infinite number of consciousness theories. Maybe you do taste salt just 
like I do, but there is no way to know it for sure.
           

        >I will say: "Feel this, this is what salt tastes like to me."
           

And I will say I don't believe you. How do you know that the sensation I'm 
feeling is anything like the one you are, and if you reject behavior,  how do 
you know I'm feeling anything at all?
           

        >Since your understanding of the physics will be so thorough and         
        >reproducible in your own mind, you will know that there is no other         
        >possibility but that that is how salt tastes for me.
           

If you come up with a new theory of Physics the only way to test it is by 
observation. Actually  that's not just true of physics but of all Science. 
If you come up with a new theory of consciousness there is no observation to 
test it on, there are no facts it must explain, that's why you could crank out 
an infinite number of such theories with no way of knowing which one is 
correct.

Science should investigate consciousness, and Science means observation. 
I read  Crick's book, I agree completely with him, and he realizes he will 
get nowhere without studying behavior. It's difficult enough as it is,  
why throw away your only tool?
           

        >When we thoroughly understand the physics involved and objectively         
        >watch the neural corelate in our own brain and see how they precisely         
        >map to and predict the feelings we feel


You can't use your consciousness theory because that's what you're trying to 
test and the only feeling I can objectively observe is my own, so how could I 
ever objectively prove you're conscious? This doesn't bother me much because 
I take it as an axiom of existence that intelligent behavior means 
consciousness.
           
        >my theory or prediction is, that there are some fundamental physical        
        >phenomenon that each of our brains use, possibly in subtly and even        
        >occasionally grossly different ways


I agree, I don't believe in the soul, I think consciousness is indeed a 
physical phenomenon. However, you can never learn anything about any physical 
phenomena unless you observe the way it behaves. I am also convinced that if 
you ignore information theory and assume that the value of a bit depends on 
the way it is stored you're taking a huge step backward into the 19'th 
century.

What do you think would be valid indications that one has the capacity
to be redeemed? The one doing the indicating is the criminal himself.
Are any of his or her indications ever to be trusted and thereby termed
valid?

I suppose we're talking about repeat offenders who have shown no
capacity for redemption. In such a case, how many tries does a criminal
get? Or using the prior discourse, how many times must a criminal
recidivate before he has demonstrated his or her lack of capacity for
redemption?

I (stick neck out) would suggest that all material is capable of being
recycled. Especially as scarce and valuable a material as intelligent
life.

Do you think that people are always responsible for their actions? I
tend to waffle on this point (to a fault), so I hope you might let me
pick your brain a bit.

So then the reason for frying them is not that they do not value other
human lives, but rather that they do not value their own? Or is it a
combination of the two? To take this further along the so-called
tangent, why is human life any different than other life? Unless we are
talking about sentience, life is life is life. I would argue that to
value human life to the exclusion of all other life is not valuing life
at all. It is homophilia, maybe evolutionary, but merely an innate wish
to see the species continue. Do you think that you might be talking
about valuing intelligent life?

Either Velikovsky's work is idiotic or the Scientific method is, there are

The nuclear winter theory may or may not be true, but one thing is certain,  
it has  absolutely nothing to do with human political theories, it has to do 
with the atmosphere. The atmosphere doesn't give a hoot in hell about 
Liberals, Conservatives, Communists, Libertarians , Socialists or even
Extropians. The atmosphere is just interested in Thermodynamics.
              
If Dr. Sagan thought there was one chance in a thousand of being correct it  
was his duty to shout it from the rooftops. If it turns out he was wrong  
there is no disgrace in that, all the great scientists were wrong about 
something important in their careers, its part of the Scientific method. 
The great advantage Science has over other philosophies is that its self 
correcting.

Name any "establishment" and RAW has satired it.

While I agree with you that much of his railing against Sagan seems a
bit unfounded (almost personal?), Sagan represents for RAW what the Holy
Inquisition reprsented to Galileo. RAW argues that any scientific claim
that does not comport with established (?) scientific dogma is a
"damnable heresy" and is branded "pseudo-science" or "poor scientific
method" or some other dismissive.  For this, the scientific
establishment uses the Infallible Method: They only believe that which
can be demonstrated to their reason, and they are able to demonstrate to
their reason only that which they are willing to believe.   

RAW is not a scientist, he's a satirist. Read a few pages of Right Where
You Are Sitting Now and you'll be annoyed with yourself for having
gotten so worked up over it all. It's like being offended at Gulliver's
Travels. His self-ordained mission in life is what he calls "guerrilla
ontology" or "epistemological judo." He seeks only to warp our set
notions of reality into what he calls new "reality tunnels;" much akin
to taking off the lenses we've grown up with, and putting on new ones.
He wants us to question everything. He accomplishes this by mixing just
enough fact with just enough fiction such that the entire thing is
believable. If you take him too seriously, you take yourself too
seriously. 

While others may disagree with me on whether or not he really believes
Sagan is a no-good-shit, one thing is certain: "When the Walls Came
Tumbling Down" is hitting bookstores soon, I'll be there with money in
hand.

If I didn't say, I should have said: the figures I saw were in the AU
range; Earth's orbit, or maybe Jupiter's.  Carl also noted that his GRB
energies were less than that of supernovae, although the numbers below
look bigger.

No, they use ergs, and I think Carl used watts.  Or Joules.  I forget.

In other words, we should be grateful if most of a supernova's energy
goes into neutrinos.  But I'm not sure what "most" means.  50%?  90%?
99%?  A factor of 2 or 3 isn't that much, and implies that GRB's aren't
galactically deadly, since their gamma output would be equivalent to a
supernova, and we've had lots of those in this galaxy.  Not near by, but
they haven't sterilized everything.  (Unless that's the Filter, and
we're the lucky ones.)

Guessing wildly that a supernova is deadly within 100 ly, if a GRB had
100 times the gamma output that would give 1000 ly killing radius.  (I'm
assuming inverse square applies.)

Urrrn.  If supernovae are deadly in 100 ly, shouldn't Sirius be frying
us in a few million years?

Perspective: the main shock seems to be that we see these GRBs from
across the universe.  But I've heard that supernovae can outshine their
host galaxy.  If a galaxy is visible from across the universe then so
are supernovae, and these GRBs aren't that big a deal.  They're just
different and purer.

Or perhaps more frequent, since I haven't heard of a supernova every
week.

16 billion light years!  Do Hubble constant calculations agree with
this?  Not to mention cosmo-evolutionary models?  Although the stars
that form neutron stars and black holes don't last very long, once
formed.

Hypothesis: massive first generation of stars.  All go supernova and
make neutron stars.  Sometime later, neutron stars run into each other.
Boom.  If we'd been earlier we'd have seen lots of supernovae scattered
around the universe; we're later, so we see the second movement of the
death-dance.  Happily surrounded by red dwarfs ourselves.

Reliability: low.  I trust the supernova-neutrino calculations.  I

Subliminal probably refers to velocities slightly below the speed of
light (subliminal = beneath the threshold, usually used in
psychology). 

Yes, gamma rays are photons. Although pair production might turn them
into electron-positron pairs if they get close to another particle.

Sirius? I'm not sure, but isn't it too small to become a supernova? 
Besides, in a few million years we will be farther away (at least a
few more ly). According to my files there are just 10 bright A stars
within 50ly: Altair (A7), Castor A (A1), Castor B (A1), Castor C
(A5), Castor D (A5), Denebola (A3), Formalhaut (A3), Iota Ursae
Majoris A (A7), Sirius A (A1) and Vega (A0). There is also Arcturus,
a K2 giant. None of these strikes me as particularly dangerous, but I
might be wrong.

Not entirely true. Much of my response was not statistical. Here's more:

I don't consider fundamentals of human behavior to be tangents, but
postulates.
A.M. seems to be interested in developing what seems to ba a Fabian vision
of 
well-mannered perfect(able) abstractions. Wow. 6+ billion and counting,
surely 
a tall order? Well, not if one makes the proper simplifying assumptions.

It's a bit like the old joke whose punch line goes "assume a spherical
cat..."
Or like Lenin musing aloud to his crowd, "What is to be done?"

NOTE: No, A.M., I am not calling you Lenin. OK?

I'd love to help engender a world where people respect each other more. 
I hope, by my agnostic vision of godliness, to make some contribution in
that wise.
But, to quote myself,

>When respect for one's fellow man is strong, arms are an utter non-issue.
>Absent that respect, what remains?

I consider the first sentence true, based on personal experience. 
I consider the following question fundamental, not tangential.

There is nothing abstract about a twice-previously-raped career nurse
being 
accosted in a parking garage. Nothing *whatsoever*. How _dare_ anyone deny

her the power to stop her assailant?

Sorry, I guess the present day is just an unpleasant hypothetical.
I'm sure glad that nurse is only in my mind.
Let's plan a perfect future world, it's so much nicer, so much realer. 
Just like Epcot Center.

And regarding Wellsian technocratic "futurist" central-planning
"exegesis":
Be very suspicious of anyone who tells you "I know what's best for you"--
unless you *are* a child.

I really like the three strikes laws, but putting them away permanently
is not the answer. Three strikes should be the point at which a criminal
is exterminated, at a minimum. A heinous capital crime should of course
be a pick your fate the first time routine...

Depends upon the degree to which you mean recycle. As fertilizer, sure.
As a living breathing human being? Maybe not without a lobotomy and/or

Even an alcoholic is responsible for what happens during their
blackouts, as they made the concious choice to drink, to not seek
treatment. A free society demands that its citizens be responsible for
themselves. If one is not responsible for their actions, or cannot be
responsible for their actions, they either need to be institutionallized
as a retarded individual, or exterminated.

Human Life = Sentience. That life may have sentience or not, but
sentience always presupposes life is what separates the two. When I
state "human life" I mean sentience, not life in general. The golden
rule dictates that man treat his fellow man as he wishes to be treated.
If one denies another continued sentience, society must assume that that
one also seeks to be denied sentience.

This does not conflict with the principle of innocent until proven
guilty, as the accused is not necessarily the true killer, but once the
killer is found by a process of evidentiary review by a jury of peers,
society is morally bound to carry out the golden rule.

To expand slightly:

I quoted Richter as someone who has quite succinctly captured within 
verbal parameters that mental place to which I have arrived, after 
many years of shedding various ideologies, some imposed, some not. 
(As such I didn't meant to indicate that his thinking is in any way 
superior to anyone, Rand included, but merely that I relate to it.)

The utter purity of mental exploration without any principle to guide, no 
belief to take refuge in, nothing to separate me from the rigors of 
self-examination--that, to my thinking, forms the basis for true 
freedom. I renew that commitment today, and welcome anyone's thoughts on 
the concept of freedom.

Sin,

I believe the word you are all looking for is "subluminal" as in "less than
light".  
"Subluminal velocities" would then appropriately be "less than c".  
Apparently a run-away typo.

An Upload is not an AI, it would certainly be intelligent but the way it is

Why? You can upload or download a program and have absolutely no idea how it 
works, the program doesn't care, it still does what it does.  I can see why 
in general we'd need to understand how neurons work, and in the particular 
brain to upload we'd need to know the strength of the 10^14  synapses that 
connect the 10^11 neurons in it, but I don't see why we 'd need to understand 
how the brain as a whole works to upload it.

We don't need to understand qualia to do that, we can do it today with 
artificial reality. Your consciousness is where your senses are and to a  
lesser degree where your hand is, the position of your brain doesn't matter 
provided it's no so far away that you have signal delay problems.

Ahem.  Eric, Anders, and James have all pointed this out.  And you know
what?  I didn't even _notice_ that it was "subliminal".  From the
context I assumed that I was reading "subluminal" -- so y'all have
missed my basic point.

How do gamma rays through vacuum go slower than light?

Sturgeon's Law applies to the population of "scientists" just as
it does to everything else.

Modern scientific institutions are curious beasts. Personally, I
think modern science has been dreadfully weakened by the heavy
government funding it has received in most nations this century.
Nothing like modern levels of tax funding for scientific research
can be found in earlier centuries, AFAIK. So most current scientific
institutions (especially those of the scientific "Establishment")
cannot be defended by appeals to the history of science, but only
by appeals to the history of science in this century (which is
still damn impressive).

If I had to give a cite supporting this opinion, I'd cite Freeman
Dyson's many essays contrasting bloated, politically-motivated,
and relatively sterile scientific projects with small, cheap,
experimental, apolitical, and relatively fertile scientific projects.
There are a few such essays in the collection FROM GAIA TO EROS,
and I think there are some in INFINITE IN ALL DIRECTIONS as well.
But I don't know of any real studies that have been done... it's
a very difficult area to study, at the intersection of scientific
epistemology, political economy, and even pedagogical theory.

Its waiting for the sun to wake up.

It used its low gain antenna to broadcast the landing signal, but was
shut down because its battery power is needed to open the petals of the
craft to have it ready for dawn, when it can start generating power
again with the solar cells on the inside of the petals. The low gain
antenna broadcasts at a very low baud rate because it is
omnidirectional, and uses up lots of power to do so. The high gain
antenna uses less power but has a higher baud rate because it is
directional, and can focus the broadcast straight toward earth.

Usage of the low gain antenna will only be used on a regular basis in
case the high gain antenna fails to operate properly, or is damaged,
much like what happened with the Galileo probe. WIth the high gain
antenna, we can receive over 500 stereo pictures a day, while the low
gain only allows a couple dozen mono at most.

It landed 565 miles south of the Viking site on an alleuvial plain made
up of sediments washed down from the highlands.

Oh, great.  And my map showing the Viking sites (note plural) is at the office.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

        Written by Gretchen Peters and sung by Martina McBride


"... Some folks whispered,
     And some folks talked,
     But everybody looked the other way.
     But when time ran out,
     There was no-one about,
     On Independence Day.


     Let Freedom ring,
     Let the white dove sing,
     Let the whole world know that today
     Is a day of reckoning:

   
     Let the weak be strong,
     Let the Right be wrong,
     Throw the stone away,
     Let the guilty pay,
     It's Independence Day


     Well, she lit up the sky that Fourth of July;
     By the time that the firemen came...
     Well, they put out the flames,
     And took down some names,
     And sent me to the County Home,

     Now, I ain't saying it's right, or it's wrong
     And maybe it's the only way

     Talk about your Revolution,
     It's Independece Day."
     
 
Barry Goldwater _warned_ the Rightist Authoritarians:


 "Get off Hillary Rodham Clinton's case."


  Fair warning,,,,

> Misinformation
> =0D
> INTRODUCTION
> =0D
> In early 1992, after the release of Oliver Stone's film JFK
> a media thundercloud erupted.
> =0D
> After early attacks in mainstream media like the Chicago
> Tribune and Washington Post, many other alternative media of
> both the left and right began to run articles on the film
> including outlets like "The Village Voice", for which
> Alexander Cockburn used to write. To the surprise of many,
> when some of these supposed leftist media organs did chime
> in, they savaged the film as wildly as the mainstream press
> did. These outlets were, specifically, The Progressive, Z
> magazine, and The Nation. The writers were, respectively,
> the late Erwin Knoll, Noam Chomsky, and Alexander Cockburn.
> Chomsky then wrote a book, Rethinking Camelot to
> specifically attack one of the main theses of JFK, namely
> that Kennedy had intended to withdraw from Vietnam by 1965.
> =0D
> But of the three, by far the most bitter and vicious
> polemics about the film were by Cockburn in three pieces in
> The Nation dated January 6/13, March 9, and May 18, 1992.
> The first piece was entitled "J.F.K. and JFK" in which he
> attacked not only the film, but the publishers of the book
> by Jim Garrison on which it was based, author Peter Dale
> Scott_who originated the Kennedy withdrawal thesis_and John
> Kennedy himself.
> =0D
> The next two issues cited were Cockburn's response to
> several of scores of letters The Nation received in response
> to the original article. Cockburns's response to the first
> group of letters was less than detached and academic. He
> said that Scott and author John Newman ("JFK and Vietnam"
> and an advisor on the film) suffered from "fantasies" and
> that Scott's letter was basically "silly" and showed
> "evidence of a rather pathetic persecution mania"(P. 319).
> =0D
> But perhaps the worst performance by Cockburn was in the
> last round of letters. He responded to correspondence by
> Oliver Stone, John Newman and Philip Green. He accused Stone
> of being a fascist (p. 678), said Newman's letter was a
> "confession of defeat" and called him "a very bad historian"
> (p. 678)_even though in the earlier issue he had called his
> tome "a serious book" (January 6/13 p. 7). He called Green's
> letter "the silliest of the lot" and full of "self-regarding
> blather" (p. 678). He concluded by accusing Garrisonand his
> publisher, and Stone and his producer, of being in it for
> the money. Not satisfied, he even stated that his colleague
> at The Nation, Chris Hitchens, of liking the film solely
> because he wanted to sell a script to Stone (p. 320). We
> should also add here that he characterized the Warren
> Commission critics as mostly "conspiracy mongers" who were
> either "imbeciles or mountebanks" and that the Warren
> Commission members and staff came to conclusions "more
> plausible and soundly based than is commonly supposed."
> Cockburn's trust of the Warren Commission was exhibited when
> he gave assistant counsel Wesley Liebeler a nearly three
> page interview in the March issue to defend the Commission's
> main conclusions.
> =0D
> Since Cockburn and Chomsky are good friends and colleagues,
> it is fair to say they communicated and compared notes

No, you won't, because it contradicts your beliefs and won't let a few
facts change them. Here's a cite for my "facts", and I was wrong... they
aren't twice as likely to kill an innocent bystander, they're *5.5* times
as likely to do so: 

Silver and Kates, "Handgun Ownership, Self-Defense and the Independence of
Women in a Violent, Sexist Society", in 'Restricting Handguns', p 154-155. 

Kates at least is a criminologist and constitutional lawyer who's been
studying the effects of gun laws for decades. Unfortunately I don't have
access to a law library or I'd find the original article for you.

Cite? Odd that when this data is supposedly so widespread I've been unable
to find it. 

> As far as I'm concerned, the less guns we have the better off we are.

Shame that most of the independent criminologists like Kleck (don't know
if Kates gets any funding from pro-gun groups) disagree: 

"Gun control is a very minor, though not entirely irrelevant, part of the
solution to the violence problem, just as guns are of only very minor
significance as a cause of the problem.  The U.S. has more violence than
other nations for reasons unrelated to its extraordinarily high gun
ownership.  Fixating on guns seems to be, for many people, a fetish which
allows them to ignore the more intransigent causes of American violence,
including its dying cities, inequality, deteriorating family structure,
and the all-pervasive economic and social consequences of a history of
slavery and racism."

There are a few gaping holes in the movie, but it's still oodles better than, 
say, Independence Day. Tommy Lee Jones is an absolute treat and the movie is 
_tight_, not draggy.

See it twice at matinee prices. Enjoy...

More importantly, in a year or two we enter a dust-cloud from a large
comet which is expected to cause problems for some (possibly many)
satellites due to dust impacts and electrical conductivity; I've forgotten
where I read this recently (probably comp.risks), but I'll let you know if
I find out. Apparently it's a regular occurence with this comet, but last
time we passed through the cloud was before Sputnik.

Gary Kleck's study, School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Florida
State University. I find that study a little dubious, but the *lowest*
figure ever produced has been 60,000 crimes prevented each year. AFAIR
Kleck's figure includes any instance in which the individual believed that
their firearm prevented a crime, whereas the 60,000 figure was for cases
where their firearm could be proven to have definitely stopped a crime. 

There are good reasons to believe that the true figure is somewhere in
between, since individuals are likely to be overoptimistic, while the low
figure was the result of a government survey and hence inevitably
inaccurate since so many defensive gun uses are in themselves illegal and
would not be reported. I'd be surprised if the true figure was much under 
a million.

Shawn:

Are you joking, or have you made up your mind about this?
I'm not being sarcastic here--but I have a very mixed reaction
to the notion of "fixing" people, especially without their consent.

Extinguishing them *might* be more ethical. I'm not sure.

I have another series of bones to pick with the entire idea of 
"trials"--they seem to be mostly about making the local mass of 
primates feel better. _Sometimes_ that includes feeling like you'd 
have gotten a fair shake if you were in the defendant's shoes, but 
I daresay that's not prominent in the mind of many of today's jurors.

Is that (palliating the masses' feelings) all "justice" amounts to?

One of the fundamental pivots of my current researches is the whole 
matter of "fairness". I suspect it relates to 1) the universe 
making sense and being predictable and 2) comfort (see #1).

Correction to above re "trials": 
Unless they are trials pertaining to extinction as an outcome.
And then they're not about justice per se, but strategic sessions: 
see the second half of _Have Spacesuit, Will Travel_.

One thing is clear: "banishment" is probably not a viable strategy
once civilizations (or whatever they are by then) span galactic arms...

Not meaning to quibble, but the lowest figure I've seen is 600k. 
Could you have slipped a decimal point?

BTW, Lott now cites the spread whenever he writes (600k-3.6M), which I
consider another mark in his favor.

Dear Sir,                                    4 July 1997

Further to my discussion with your Secretary this day, your 'Dr.' Babikar's 
actions, and the _continued_ actions of your staff even after the GMC's 
position was communicated to them, has damaged my health, and destroyed my 
confidence in the integrity of any 'treatment' you provide.


Accordingly I will be lodging a further complaint with the GMC, and 
instituting legal proceedings against Southmead hospital/staff.

I will be seeking to arrange more beneficial medical services, which would 
necessitate my freely-given and fulllly-informed consent, with full copies 
to me, of symptomatology, presenting problem, tentative diagnosis and 
suggested treatment plan, with ongoing monitoring as to side effects and 
efficacy. [For post-traumatic stress disorder ]

You may expect delivery of all proceedings imminently.


Yours faithfully,



Tony Hollick

Well, as I say, I haven't made up my mind yet. I consider it 
conceivable that extinction would be more ethical.
This is presupposing that the subject of reprogramming didn't 
have a "living will" or some such detailing "what to do if 
I get too weird for you" in the case of what are generally 
called "the mentally ill".

"a violent person would thank you after the reprogramming"--
ah, this is sometimes called "retroactive consent".
"You'll thank me for this later, whoever you are _then_."
You might be right, but would that be the same person?
No worries, we'll just keep tweaking until whatever's left 
*does* thank us.

Ever read anything by Robert M. Pirsig, especially his 
second book, _Lila_?

At a minimum, I'd prefer that such activity be done with 
explicit consciousness on the part of the reprogrammers 
that they _might_ not know what they're talking about. 
Provide perspective to the subject: Keep a copy of the 
old personality around, just in case, and provide some 
A/B - B/A comparisons: do both personalities agree that 
B is better off? If not, then what?

If we're going to stick with the notions of "self" we have now,
I would feel better if everyone could choose integrity or death.
Getting someone else's definition of "fixed" is a third choice.
This is only because I don't know if I know what's best, and I
_sure_ don't know if a bunch of strangers I've never met do.

I come down strongly in favor of this mythical thing
called "choice".

Thanks for the opportunity to think about this.

Given we're talking about reprogramming technologies that don't exist 
yet, I'd suggest another, possibly simpler, technology from science 
fiction. In Iain M Banks non-extropic but nevertheless 
entertaining "Culture" novels, their communist-utopian society deals 
with persistant violent criminals (or says it would, it's not clear if 
it's ever had to) by assigning a 'slap drone' to them. A small but 
physically powerful expert-system/sub-AI robot follows them everywhere 
and physically prevents them from injuring others. Apart from that, they 
are left at liberty.

If they get fed up with this, they can always volunteer to have their 
psychology altered to a 'sane' Culture standard, or just leave Culture 
controlled space.

Seems a justifiable approach to me,

..and if behaviour is unrelated to consciousness, why are we all discussing
it?  To talk of consciousness your behaviour would have to be related to
consciousness, otherwise you would behave as if it didn't exist!

Reprogramming wouldn't make completely different people.  We could increase
intelligence and give these people the ability to look back at what they've
done and see the error in their ways.  However, we could only enhance these
people in the hope that they might be able to correct themselves.
 Reprogramming them to fit in with some notion of a 'good citizen' you or I
may have would be a bad idea (espicially if under government control).

Worth thinking about. But it still presupposes a lot of things staying 
(nearly) the same.

How do you implement a "slap drone" for a Jupiter-eater? 
For a galaxy-eater? Or for a suitably-subtle con man or atom rustler?

How do you implement banishment if the Diaspora has already headed out at 
.99 c? Shipping someone out at .995 c just means they get to the 
fresh raw materials first; not an entirely desirable proposition...?

Hmm... seems to me that the whole purpose of learning is to "immediately

Gary Kleck's study, School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Florida
State University. I find that study a little dubious, but the *lowest*
figure ever produced has been 60,000 crimes prevented each year. AFAIR
Kleck's figure includes any instance in which the individual believed that
their firearm prevented a crime, whereas the 60,000 figure was for cases
where their firearm could be proven to have definitely stopped a crime. 

There are good reasons to believe that the true figure is somewhere in
between, since individuals are likely to be overoptimistic, while the low
figure was the result of a government survey and hence inevitably
inaccurate since so many defensive gun uses are in themselves illegal and
would not be reported. I'd be surprised if the true figure was much under 
a million.

Dear Mark and other fellow Extropians,

Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to eliminate the primary causes of crime
by eliminating poverty and deficient education? Wouldn't it also cost less
overall in both the short and long term?

Actually, eliminating deficient education would go a long way toward
eliminating the latter, but there will always be stubbornly ignorant
morons. THis is not just a figure of speech, either, seeing as how I
live in upstate New Hampshire. As educated as most people are in these
parts, there is still a significant minority of hereditary locals who
never travel more than 25 miles from their home, don't finish high
school, and are proud of their "downhome", "salt of the earth" status.

Another big step would be to decriminalize all victimless "crimes".
Doing so would eliminate the social stigma that forces many who
participate in these activites to gain their livihood from further
criminal activity.

Criminal law should not be used to enforce social norms, but to protect
rights. If you want to practice social engineering, do it with the tax
code.

Emminently more ethical. Give them the choice: execution or
reprogramming. Either way it is the end of that "individual". If a
person does not want to become a nice, polite, pliable cipher of
society, they should be able to choose the alternative. I find it rather
disturbing that the Supreme Court found that government owns our lives,
that we do not.

They are the enetertainment part of "bread and circuses". Personally I
prefer the Canadian concept of blacked out trials. Victims rights is a
moronic concept, as the victim is not on trial. The crucial error that
victims make in feeling like they are vitimized again at trial is that
they make such a huge emotional investment in beleiving that the accused
is guilty to begin with, and feel violated if their beleifs are not
accepted by the court. The Goldmans are an excellent example of this.
Whether or not OJ was guilty, they had decided at the beginning of the
trial that he was guilty, and made sure that the media and the public
understood this.

Although I'm enjoying this topic of discussion, I have yet to hear a 
critique of R.A.W. from people who have actually read him.  Personally I 
cannot do him justice - yet I've read every book this man has published.  
If you have a criticism of R.A.W. but haven't read him, what does this 
say about you?  Please lend credibility to your arguments by reading him 
first.  I look forward to informed debate on this topic.

> [ A comment that RAW's critics here have not read him ]

I haven't finished Illuminatus or Schroedinger's Cat (I have little
patience for fiction in general--I can stay awake through Heinlein,
Stephenson, and Doug Adams but that's about it).  I have, however,
read many of RAW's shorter essays, including "Inquisition", and I
have to call it the most worthless piece of tripe masquerading as
serious commentary I have ever read.  If it aims at satire, it
misses.  That essay takes itself completely seriously, offers no
original ideas, no scholarship, and not even interesting prose.

It says that there is a huge number of things I should study and I only have 
a limited amount of time to do it in, it says I'm trying to determine if I 
should bother to read Wilson or if my time could be better spent doing other 
things. If Wilson really does equate having contempt for Immanuel Velikousky 
with the persecution Galileo suffered then I think I have my answer.
 
I live in a world of spoon benders, religion, bigfoot, astrology, crying  
statues of the virgin Mary, faith healers, pictures of Jesus found in 
spaghetti billboards, Angels, Velikousky, pictures of Jesus found in oil 
stains in the men's room of transmission repair shops, ESP, pyramid power, 
and bug eyed monsters who travel millions of light years just so they can 
stick an anal probe up the ass of some redneck who lives in the middle of a 
swamp.  With all these juicy targets for satire available Wilson goes after 
Carl Sagan, one of the very few who has the courage and intelligence to say 
the Emperor has no cloths and it's all pure idiocy.

Perhaps Wilson is a good comedian, I don't know, but his ideas sound about as 
deep as Bob Hope's.

I've read most of his stuff thats in print. RAW does not deal with
scientific veracity as  scientific phenomena, i.e. objective
discriminate data, but as  socio-psychological phenomena. He follows the
occult tradition of promoting the investigation of all possible beleif
systems, ideas, theories, etc. on an equal basis as a method for
training the mind to be completely open and able to process information
in a way that allows one to develop many possible lines of connection, a
highly associative mode of thinking. He does not promote the acceptance
of all possibilities on an equal basis as a regular practice, which is
where he separates from most New Agers, whose beleif systems float
hither and yon with the winds. Using his terminology, he wants to help
you see the fnords without getting mindfucked.

First of all, my initial post never cited the above text. I merely said,
"For an interesting discussion of E-Prime see..."

At the very least, I'm glad you found it interesting, if not amenable to
your own views on discourse.

> Hmm... seems to me that the whole purpose of learning is to "immediately
> produce high order abstractions". Are you against forming high order
> abstractions?

No, I agree that accurate meta-level abstractions are an important part
of the learning process, not to mention the creative process. But, if
they're inaccurate, I can't see how that helps you learn concrete facts,
unless you ask someone about it and then they give you the correct
answer. That of course assumes that there's someone around teaching you
all the time. Regardless, premature judgements seem to be a bad thing
for the most part. I can't say much more than that other than that what
I originally wrote was:

E-prime is useful in this situation only in that it avoids the incorrect
meta-level abstraction that humanity *is* one thing or many things, and
therefore the premature judgement that it *is* that thing forever. I
don't think its possible, or even desirable to make e-prime a religion.

Actually, eliminating deficient education would go a long way toward
eliminating the latter, but there will always be stubbornly ignorant
morons. THis is not just a figure of speech, either, seeing as how I
live in upstate New Hampshire. As educated as most people are in these

never travel more than 25 miles from their home, don't finish high

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians,

I couldn't agree more with the need to eliminate victimless
crimes. There are several ggod reasons to do so.

Actually, among other good reasons, I think it would be 
preferrable to legalize, control and regulate many of them 
minimally in the public interest.

It would certainly produce sufficient voluntary revenue to help
reduce other forms of oppressive and involuntary taxation.

As regards those local ignoramuses you are complaining about,
please consider their rationalization of claims to joy in ignorance 
as a defense mechanism. It can be overcome, albeit with some 
difficulty after the formative years; but, it can still be overcome 
with some quite worthwhile effort.

I hope you all agree.

Knowledge can be fun.

A.M. Genen

	It would seem that if an entity could be easily reprogrammed the
technology would exist to make them a more complex, and considerably less
easily reprogrammed, entity.  If the entity was considerably less complex
than the party it offended, it could be easily swatted down.  Human level
intelligence could simply be another being's mosquito.
	The concept of individual in the post-human world is also likely to be
rather malleable with high band width connections blurring the lines
between where one begins and ends.  We already have an extremely good
example of this with the brain.  Cut the corpus collosum (an extremely high
bandwidth connection) and each side of the brain has to find out about the
world with it's own half of the body.  Few people think about considering
each half of the brain as separate individuals but they are, they just talk
to each other really fast.
	The offended parties in the post human world could link up, each
contributing resources in proportion to the offense given.  They could then
reduce the offending party to raw materials.  That is unless the offending
party also had friends.  Obviously, violence is not going to work in every
case.  Therefore, polycentric law will be applied.  It will actually be the
only law that can be applied because data flow between entities is so high,
they cannot help but know what each one's goals are (probably survival and
therefore expansion, most everything else would probably be tossed).  This
means that polycentric law will actually be more like agoric computing. 
One would not consider the relegation of a computer program hogging more
resources than its worth to a lower priority slot, or even deleting it, as
"capital punishment."  Executions, more properly prunings, in the
post-biological world will probably be as dramatic, and necessary, as
cutting one's toenails.

An interesting notion. It's true, I don't wonder if my toenails have rights, 
nor even if an astrocytoma has rights. But astrocytomas are considered 
inoperable.

I'm confused, though--you use the term "polycentric law" as if it had a 
fixed meaning, then announce what it will be "more like". Help me out, 
here: what are you on about? How is "polycentric law" any more principled 
than a kangaroo court?

Apart from that, where does the notion of property rights go? "Hogging more 
resources than its worth"[sic]? To whom? Than whom? Them Injuns weren't 
*using* the prairie, they was jest a-*sittin'* on it. Pass the smallpox-
infected blankets. Sarge.

Sounds about as ethical as Salmonella in a petri dish.

[...]
I foresee that the future of computing will encompass
Computer-Brain Integration, Direct Brain Stimulation, and
Full Conscious Control. At this site, Future Fantastic/Brain
Storm, that topic is discussed in a simple, straightforward
manner.

Since I criticize Extropians, Libertarians, Transhumans,
Objectivists, Anarcho-Capitalists, Cypherpunks, and
Crypto-Anarchists, I figure I ought to provide some links to their
material. Let me qualify this by saying that I actually agree with
a lot of what they propose. The extropian principles of Boundless
Expansion, Self Transformation, Dynamic Optimism, Intelligent
Technology, and Spontaneous Order (BEST DO IT SO) are right up my
alley. The only problem is that Extropians and Transhumanists
maintain that free-market laissez-faire capitalism is a form of
spontaneous order (while I maintain that it isn't), and that they
go on to say that capitalism is the only form of spontaneous order
that they acknowledge. So, check out the Extropy Institute, and the
Anders Transhumanist Resources. Those two pages link and explore
in-depth, the issues of Libertarianism, Objectivism, Cryptography,
etc. I'll let them provide the links to those issues, rather than
defile my page with such obsolete, archaic ideas as "privacy",
"secrecy", and "anonymity". Extropians and their pals are masters
of the art of flaming, so don't dare sending them any critical
email messages. Common dismissives range from "Please don't ever
communicate with me again", to "If you had approached me in a
spirit of inquiry, I might have taken the time to prepare a well
thought-out response." (Max More.) More proof of the burdens of a
closed, and narrow mind.

Yes, this is a tricky ethical problem. It is a special case of a more
general problem that crops up in our discussions from time to time,
that of the ethics of changing thinking beings. Is it ethical to
modify the genes of an embryo, since we do not know if it will like
the results? Is it ethical to modify the memes of a child through
upbringing or schooling? These questions get tricky because the
individual which is modified cannot give informed consent (the
criminal might not want to stop being sociopathic, the embryo has no
mind and the child might not understand the ramifications of
education). 

One might argue that such changes "kill" or undo the future
unmodified individual (this argument has been used against genetic
modifications), but in that case education and upbringing are also
destroying potential future personalities. One might disregard
potential individuals completely, and just look at the likely
results, trying to make them as good as possible (measured by one's
moral standards). One might try to find a "value attractor" state: 
the future individual will likely agree that it was a good idea to be
changed (but this is hard to achieve reliably). One might hide one's
head in the sand and simply say modifications are unethical, but in
that case we should not try to influence our children at all, which
is clearly necessary for them to grow up into our culture (or into
functioning adults). 

Tricky questions.

Unfortunately I think you are right. 

I think the problem today is that we get too emotional about crimes. 
What is the (ideal) purpose of a system of laws and law enforcement? 
IMHO it is to make sure crimes (undesirable acts) doesn't happen too
often and have small consequences. Today we are too much thinking in
terms of justice and revenge; they are human ideas and emotions
rather than objective facts.

Perhaps it would be more efficient to put all the money spent on
catching thieves into installing better locks. If somebody commits
murder, the victim cannot be brought back but it is possible to make
sure the murderer doesn't murder more people. 

How to implement something like this, and convince the vengeful
primates about it is a non-trivial problem.

I must admit I don't understand where you're coming from.  I get that you 
identify with the Richter quote (a VERY depressing utterance, IMHO). But 
then you state that you are unsure if this type of thinking is superior 
to any other. I don't know about you, but if I feel that my way of 
thinking about things (my philosophy) is inferior to any other, I set 
about trying to find the superior theory - so I can learn it and 
integrate it. You also said you relate to his quote - meaning that you 
respond in a favorable manner to it. My reaction is the exact opposite - 
I feel that the ideas which his quote represent are depressing, 
frightening, and even a bit dangerous.

If anyone wants to find out why, I've decided to spend the morning 
explaining exactly why below. This is the first time I've done this 
(polemics), so I hope I don't bore anyone...

OK - immediatly in the first sentence I know something is wrong: "I have 
committed myself to thinking and acting without the support of any 
ideology." To commit means to pledge one's self to a *position* on an 
issue, right? An ideology is a group of issues, ideas and opinions (and 
*positions*) about abstract ideas (a philosophy). So in essence, Richter 
is saying he doesn't commit himself to any philosophy - except the 
philosophy that that it's beneficial to operate without a philosophy. Or 
at least to deceive one's self that one operates without a philosophy. 
Smoke and mirrors, right in the first sentence!

Next one. "Nothing can help me..." Uh-oh. "... there is no idea I can 
serve..." He believes WE should serve IDEAS?  "...or which, in exchange, 
could suggest what I must do."  First of all, he says nothing can help 
him. Fine. But then why are we listening to this guy talk about 
philosophy - a set of ideas that is supposed to help man live a better 
life? If he can't help himself with his own ideas, why are we listening 
to him? They he goes on to destroy the concept that abstract principles 
exist which can help guide our actions. In other worlds, he doesn't 
believe that something called ethics even exists. I don't think I'd feel 
comfortable being alone an elevator with this guy...

"No regulation determine how, no belief points the way, no construction 
or vision of the future provides an overarching meaning" Oh, for crying 
out loud. This one speaks for itself.

Is this guy still alive? He sounds so lost, it's almost pitiful. Is he a 
philosopher or does he work in some other field?

"Ideologies are always the seducers and exploiters of ignorance, they 
justify war." Seems like he looked around and found that when people 
fight, they often are fighting about the ideas that they believe in. OK. 
But does this simple fact indicate that ALL idea systems are "seducers 
and exploiters of ignorance" and justifiers of war? No. That's a logical 
fallacy. One needs an ideology - a set of idea of how the universe works 
- in order to integrate new experiences. One must built abstract ideas 
about how to act to achieve one's goals. Richter is a crippled skeptic - 
so afraid of abstracts that he denies the value of philosophy itself.

On a small tangent: I've been interested in fringe beliefs for many years 
- especially cult behavior. One of my favorite study subjects is 
Scientology - one reason why is because so much information is available 
about them on the Internet. Another reason is that Scientology's belief 
system and processes are without a doubt the most efficient and 
debilitating way to remove a person's ability to think rationally. It's a 
very interesting process to link up many of SCN's philosophical beliefs 
with those of modern philosophers(?) like Richter. SCN is an 
opportunistic parasitical organization. Many of our society's beliefs are 
so close to what SCN needs in order to exploit its members that all new 
converts need is a push in the right (wrong) direction and SCN has 
themselves another cult member/slave.

SCN, in its introductory indoctrination routines, attempts in a very 
sneaky manner to internalize the belief system that Richter explicitly 
endorses. Richter encourages the removal of any and all belief systems - 
in other words, abstract concepts are bad, philosophy is bad, trying to 
think and apply abstract concepts to one's life is useless, etc. Trying 
to follow this philosophy is impossible - people must form abstract 
concepts in order to exist. What these ideas encourage is the appeal to 
emotions and feelings as the arbiter of the true, the correct, and the 
good. If one is prohibited from system-building, from thinking about 
abstracts, from adopting a philosophy, all they are left with is 
feelings! Prove me wrong. If a person can't or won't use reason (an 
abstract *systematic* method of knowledge acquisition, which Richter 
opposes) ALL they are left with is their FEELINGS. The only difference 
between skeptics and cultists is that skeptics muddle about in their own 
heads and feelings for truth, and cultists look to their leader and 
fellow group members for truth. For skeptics like Richter, what FEELS 
true to them IS true. For cultists, whatever L. Ron FEELS is true for 
them. Danger, Will Robinson, danger!

How can you explore without constructing a map? Beliefs are refuges? How

Very sorry about that. There's a nasty "feature" in my email program that 
makes it too easy to send out incomplete messages that have been saved to 
disk. I skimmed the article on e-prime and grabbed this quote from it. I

I would venture that the formation of higher-order (meta-level) 
abstractions is the *purpose* of learning. I'm curious to hear your 
definition of learning, and how it doesn't involve the use of high-order 
abstrations.

Wait a second - who said high-level abstractions are inaccurate? Is that

What does "pleading E-Prime" mean? How does asking "What is man?" suggest 
that "Man does not become." What is becoming, and how does man do it? Why 
does one stop evolving if one learns more about one's self? I don't mean

if I agree with it or not.

I admire that you have set these goals for yourself, but I myself shy 
away from ranking sets of philosophy in this manner.  Not only does 
it bring up the E-Prime problem, to heirarchically rank human thought 
conjures the very shades of ideology I seek to avoid in the first 
place.  I prefer to think of it in terms:  'this set of thinking is most 
useful to me in my life'.  If I cannot find a useful philosphy, I 
would develop one!

Not necessarily, and if you based your entire polemic on this 
contention, I ask that you rethink it.  Humans make commitments 
every day, either to a value, to a decision, to a way of thinking, 
otherwise we would not be able to take any actions.  If anything, 
Richter was responding to the demand to commit to an ideology with a 
counter-commitment not to fall into position-based thinking.

There is a procedure in which an entire hemisphere of the brain is removed

problems with motor control, the children are fine.  This is of course seen

Try http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/T0Mpage/PolyJust.HTML          
Polycentric law is just another way of saying privately produced law.  That
has been discussed recently.  Polycentric law applies to a human level of
communication speeds and boundaries between individuals.  Agoric computing,
while now taking into account only the desires of human beings (since the
computers have no desires), will turn into a system that AIs can use to
modify themselves.  Since the boundary between individuals is indefinite,
polycentric law is somewhat inappropriate because the boundary between
centers is blurred and privately produced law is also indefinite because
what is private as opposed to what is public is also rather blurry
(consider, what is going on inside my head right now is a completely
private matter, even if nothing else is, but that may not be the case in
the far future when high bandwidth communications construe advantages to
individuals at least as a great as the advantages of forming eukaryotic
cells was to various microorganisms).  Therefore, agoric computing is
probably the best term.

The notion of rights in general is a confusing one.  If someone has no
mechanisms for protecting their rights, of what use are they?  If rights
must be protected to be possessed, what is the difference between wants and
rights?  Privately produced law dose not care about rights anymore than
does democracy.  What PPL does have is a better chance of coming up with a
libertarian society.  
	In the post-biological world property would not have the same meaning as
it does now.  It would more properly fit in with self ownership.  It could
be said that an entity surrounding a star was the star to a certain extent
because the star is internalized.  As to the ownership of raw materials and
space, they would go to the first entity to get them.  In the end, they
would probably be used in the most efficient way possible as more efficient
uses come in from the far flung corners of the paved universe.  
	Those who cut themselves off from any larger entity would miss out on the
benefits of high information exchange and would probably fall behind to the
point where they are incapable of defending themselves and there only use
to more powerful entities is as raw material.  It is somewhat disturbing to
think of beings more complex than humans as raw materials but think of the
uses fish to humans.  They could do things other than feed us but feeding
us is the most efficient thing they can do by our standards, and we have
the fishing nets.
	As to the Indians, the tragedy of the Indians was that they failed to
unite in large enough groups, and they were the target of hatred, which
sets aside rational cost-benefit analysis.

> Sounds about as ethical as Salmonella in a petri dish.

Very possibly so.  The model for the post-biological future would probably
be the ecosystem as opposed to any system of justice purely human emotions
have devised.  We like to assume equality between individuals but that
simply may not be possible beyond humanity.

Taken in context with the Declaration of Independence...and the Federalist

individual rights...or to put it crudely.....when the government gets outa

The Civil War didn't free the Slaves...It just changed the ownership.

According to Thomas Hume (I think) man's lot in a state of nature is vicious,
brutal and short.

Therefore to counteract that man gave up his individual liberty...traded
freedom for security...and began the path toward a sufficiently high level of
technology where once again individuals could "own themselves"

If I were to own myself there are several things taken for granted in todays
culture that would be unacceptable.

Conscription comes to mind....Also the multitude of "Victimless"
crimes...(Prostitution...Drug Use....Smoking...Pornography...Country Western
Music....), Taxation...serving on Juries...any occurence whereby property is
taken against a person's will or a person is forced to perform actions. (key
words...<forced> <taken>)

Since these things ARE allowed  it is obvious that the government (actually
those in control of same) regard us as no more than slaves.  Slaves of
benevolant masters perhaps...but slaves.

I don't recall having heard of how a society of FREE individuals would
function.  However we'd probably better figure it out....since if Vernor
Vinge's prediction concerning the inevitable collapse of governments is
true.........

We may be talking past each other here. Learning is not about how many
abstractions you can make. The purpose of learning is to *provide a
basis* for further abstraction, extension and investigation. This is not
the same thing as what you are saying. I am arguing that this is
accomplished by acquiring a foundation in the *facts*, or more to the
point, the things that have already been decided as probably true. From
there, abstract yourself into Next Tuesday, but without the facts,
you're dealing with just that, an abstraction.

To say that my definition does not involve the use of higher-order
abstractions is inaccurate, I merely suggest that this is not the
purpose of learning, but a purpose in and of itself.

Notice that at first I said, "Accurate meta-level abstractions are an
important part of the learning prcoess." Then I went on to say, "But if
they're inaccurate, I can't see how that helps you learn concrete
facts."

I think this answers your question.

Discursive construction from my law school days. Would you rather,
"Allow me to apply E-Prime to this one," from my EMT days?

If man is something then he is that thing forever. If not forever, then
for how long? "What is man?" is a question that misses the boat (and
also has no answer because we are evolving). I think, as I said in my
earlier post, that knowing the nature of man's relationship to the
universe is much more fluid and dynamic knowledge that includes my

This is a classic case of words being put in the mouth. I never said any
such thing. I am merely saying that knowing what you are has zero praxis
unless you are staying the same forever. Theoretically, it's nice,
you'll be able to write a grand memoir. But I would rather know first
what my relationship is with the universe and then *become* what I want
to be. It's the difference betweeen hindsight and foresight to me.

Boot camp programs, when applied to criminals, even juvinile first
offenders, according to studies I've seen, experience the exact same
rate of recidivism as the normal prison population. The only difference
is that those who don't recede tend to be more successful, possibly due
to the self discipline aspects of boot camp. If anyone has different
data, I'd like to hear about it.

If one applies the term self defense to mean protection of one's self,
property, and dependents from violators of ones rights, whether they be
individuals, gangs, mobs, or any level of government, then you are
exactly right. Law enforcement agencies are only there to dispense
justice after the fact, not to provide protection services. It operates
by threat of punishment as a deterrent (which apparently is not that
effective), not by threat of deadly force against offense. If the
individual feels that the deterrent of law enforcement (which applies at
local, state, interstate, and international levels) does not meet their
needs, they are free to pursue means of self defense. Since Article Ten
defines the "militia" as any male between the ages of 18 and 40 (or is
it 45?), and also states that local sheriffs are empowered to
temporarily draft from the militia pool for local law enforcement needs
(where the "posse" concept came from), it is apparent that the
constitution intended every member of the "militia" to have authority
and responsibility for law enforcement within the confines of their own
property and family.

Indeed, if you strictly apply the liberal interpretation of the 2nd
amendment, that arms posessed by the people are to only provide for the
militia, being necessary for the security of a free state, then assault
weapons should be mandated for every member of the militia, therefore,
every male between the ages of 18 and 40 or so should be required to
posess such armaments. Perhaps those who refuse to posess meand of self
defense should be fined for deriliction of social responsibility.

of course, saying this to an anti gun liberal typically puts them in
apoplexies of confusion.

I find another funny parallel, in rural Washington State, every county
but I beleive King, Thurston, Pierce, and Snohomish have passed in the
past three years county ordinances requiring every homeowner to posess a
gun and ammunition. Needless to say, studies have shown that crime has
gone down in those counties, while it is unchanged or up in the counties
that have not passed such ordinances.

No kidding?  Not suprised...also not suprised I never heard about over the
National media...I did hear that there was a town in Georgia that did
something similar years ago...with similar results..

Also heard about a study that indicated that states with "right to carry"
laws had rapidly declineing violence....the predators just couldn't see
attacking someone who "Might" be armed....

Maybe that's the reason for the increase in violence against tourists in
Florida a few years ago...Florida had recently passed a right to carry
bill...Florida residents then became too risky a target...so tourists (mostly
from Yankee states with restrictive gun laws) were a much safer target.

        Actually (shameless plug here), my current epic poem "The Dawn of
Realization" is going to deal with a lot of the things mentioned above.
Right now, I have based the second Canto on the whole idea of conscription
as well as voluntary warfare; in addition to these concepts, I will also
tackle religion, irrational pessimism and limits in general, just to name a
few.  The whole poem is estimated to be done in about three years, but you
can catch the first Canto in the forthcoming edition of Homo Excelsior
magazine.

I've done little legislative history concerning the 2nd, but an educated
guess would be that to get it ratified, the delegates made both of those
arguments, and more. Hunting for meat and/or the skins trade was pretty
important both economically and also for an individual's livelihood. And
self-defense has always been offered as a valid reason for weapons
proliferation. Unfortunately, the Congress was secret and the only notes
made were Madison's and Jefferson's (?) so we have a tough time knowing
what they were really trying to do. 

What is crucial is that the drafters offered a reason for the Amendment
within the text itself, "A well-regulated militia being necessary to the
security of a free state..." However, is this the only reason? And what
happens when a well-regulated militia no longer becomes necessary? 

Anyway, I personally feel that the legislative intent is irrelevant.
There are several canons of statutory construction, some placing
emphasis on the "plain meaning" of the words as written, others
emphasizing legislative intent, still others ignoring both and opting
for Constiutional dynamism. I tend to feel that especially where the
original intent is cloudy, and the plain meaning of words such as
"militia", "Arms", and "infringed" is unclear, a more suitable line of
inquiry is "What effect should these words have on our lives today?"
This is a somewhat distilled version of Constitutional dynamism.

The Framers built-in a self-destruct mechanism. This is an entirely new
idea to me, and quite interesting.

Exactly. The definition of "Arms" as it is used in the 2nd is one of the
biggest problems.

I have argued on this list several times that for human beings to
coexist as individuals, on any platform, each must give up a measure of
his or her freedom (freedom to kill, freedom to steal, etc.)
Unfortunately I see no other way to do this, and also ensure that one
gives up no more freedom than another, other than a social contract.
People disagree as to the scope and extent of this contract, but I'm the
only one that seems to think that this is government any way you slice
it. And unfortunately, once you sign the contract, you no longer own
yourself entirely.

Unfortunately, according to current jurisprudence, self-defense carries
with it an objective standard of reasonableness. The standard being,
what would a normal, reasonable, and prudent person do under the same or
similar circumstances. In this situation, a jury would look at the
circumstances, decide what the threat of violence really was, decide
what self-defense was necessary, what self-defense was unnecessary but
justified, and then decide if the self-defense exceeded these
guidelines. It's all annoyingly arbitrary.

This seems as grave a violation of one's freedoms as to disallow gun
ownership completely.

Hardly..... the tourists were mostly foreigners.....

Here's something to think about, if outlawing handguns makes cities
safer, Chicago should be one of the safest cities around.... (legal
handguns were outlawed here in 1983!)

Abstract

Using cross-sectional time-series data for U.S. counties
from 1977 to 1992, we find that allowing citizens to carry
concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to
produce no increase in accidental deaths. If those states
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions
had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177
rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been
avoided yearly. On the other hand, consistent with the
notion of criminals responding to incentives, we find
criminals substituting into property crimes involving
stealth and where the probabilities of contact between the
criminal and the victim are minimal. The largest population
counties where the deterrence effect on violent crimes is
greatest are where the substitution effect into property
crimes is highest. Concealed handguns also have their
greatest deterrent effect in the highest crime counties.
Higher arrest and conviction rates consistently and
dramatically reduce the crime rate. Consistent with other
recent work (Lott, 1992b), the results imply that increasing
the arrest rate, independent of the probability of eventual
conviction, imposes a significant penalty on criminals. The
estimated annual gain from allowing concealed handguns is at
least $6.214 billion.

I am a cryonicist, and I apologize if this is an old, old, conversation,
but nobody seemed too concerned with commenting on it for a couple days.

Several of your thoughts were interesting to me.
You also seemed to have some questions, so ...

   If I had to choose ongoingness of my personal awareness, 
   I'd choose an uploading and storage of my experiences because 
   that's more me than my body which seems to curiously change 
   from year to year.  

This is one of the Great ideas, especially if you have no doubts about 
getting what you want out of the experience with the Tech available at 
the time.  I will, no doubt, find an option similar to what is now 
thought of as uploading an unavoidable necessity, just not any time real 
soon.

   Freezing my body (or even more whimsically, my head) 
   seems a rather quaint notion.

To me, it seems like an extreme notion.  Indeed, I believe that dying 
and being frozen to perserve the physical pattern of my identity is the 
second worst thing that can happen to me.  The reason I am a suspension 
member, is to avoid the worst thing that can happen to me...

     Does extropian thinking focus so much on the physically proven and
     sound as to consider this the most preferable and viable 
     solution to achieving "immortality"?  

I believe, as a newly realized extropian, that the realm of 
thought includes considerably more conservative estimations, and wildly 
more imaginative speculations on the possible. The extropian continuum 
also manifests a stong "gravitational" gradient for the currently
feasible with an eye toward pushing that to the physically, or even 
conceptually possible.

   As a mental exercise, I wonder what
   discoveries of the essence, the unforseen would radically change 
   such notions?  That which is beyond the horizon where the 
   fishermen's wives are no longer visible from the shore and you 
   are going on gut instinct and conviction.

The above is yet another argument for cryonics' 
"ambulance to a doctor 100 years in the future."  If I am to give 
myself a better, or even perhaps a good, chance of seeing one of the 
better solutions to continued identity, I need to excercise the 
options available to me. Even if I had been alive for 400 years,  
I would not cling to the medical traditions of the time of my birth.  
Just so with life extension.  I would much rather make regular 
backups of my pattern (along with streaming real-time backups, if 
available) which were likely to survive my physical existence, 
rather than provide for being frozen.  No such thing is around.  
Cryonics, as imperfect as it currently is, happens now.

   To subscribe to life extension methods such as cryonics, 
   I'd have to be more sure of what "life" is.  Too many details 
   missing from this to make an informed decision.  

Need more time to think...? How about more than your "natural" lifetime?
  
   To me, it's akin to a kid saying, when I grow up, I want to be 
   a firefighter, all because s/he likes the trucks and the uniform 
   and is completely oblivious to the danger and personality type 
   required for such a job.  Maybe that's enough of a notion to 
   go for it.  

Is this saying that a longer life might not be good, or that cryonic
suspension won't be fulfilling?  Any cryonicists want to chime in
with their fond yearnings for suspension for its own sake?

   For me, cryonics sounds like a better spin on life 
   insurance...you may get to enjoy it.  Gentlemen, place your bets.

Well, you must admit, there is a point there.  I feel much 
better about paying my $24.58 a month for the chance that I might 
actually be around to see and take care of my friends and loved ones, 
instead of having a lump sum payment do it alone.

Concerning the inherent assumption that there is another alternative
to a currently understood process for preservation:

Even assuming some chance of existence beyond death without 
intervention, I am not interested in a deity that is angry about 
my attempts to survive. That kind of god is already steamed about 
those antibiotics I took...

Reincarnation can wait until I have some pretty good evidence 
that I will be substantially better off...

Concerning the probabilities involved:

Those who wish to be in the control group need do nothing.  
You are already signed up! 

Since I'll probably be truly dead otherwise,
it's the experimental group for me.

John K Clark <johnkc@well.com>,

	We're starting to repeat ourselves.  It is my feeling that you
are still entirely missing the point I am trying to make as indicated
here:

> You can't use your consciousness theory because that's what you're
> trying to test and the only feeling I can objectively observe is my
> own, so how could I ever objectively prove you're conscious?

	"the only feelings I can objectively observe is my own" is
precisely the point.  We will so thoroughly understand the laws of
physical consciousness and how they correspond and predict what WE
feel as we observe, manipulate and stimulate our own brain that there
will be no other possibility but that others with similar neural
correlates are experiencing similar sensations.

	Also, just as our brain integrates many sense representations
into one single conscious world, eventually we'll be able to integrate
multiple conscious brains into single conscious worlds.  Just like we
know in our own minds that a red sensation is not anything like a
salty sensation, or just like we know that red produced by one eye is
the same as red produced by the other eye, we will be able to design
ways to experience, first hand, what other minds are experiencing.

	These are only two possible techniques to accomplish what you,
for some unknown reason, apparently claim will be forever impossible.
I'm sure if one is creative enough one can think of many other ways to
do this kind of stuff.  Once we understand how to manipulate,
engineer, improve, and upload minds and all that, all this kind of
understanding and proof must come to pass just like we know that the
earth is not the center of the universe because we are finally dancing
around in our heliocentric solar system and beyond.

That is an interesting question.  The interesting part is about
the "rays" being gamma, meaning they are above the threshold for
conversions into e+e- pairs.

To partially answer your question, light does travel "slower than
light" in interstellar space because it is not travelling through
a perfect vacuum, but rather through a diluted gas, mostly hydrogen.
In engineering terms, that gas has a dielectric constant slightly
different from 1, so the speed of light changes accordingly
(c=sqrt(epsilon*mu)).  Since the cross-sections for various
scattering processes change with wavelength, so does the dielectric
constant (i.e. if you hit an absorption line, tough luck).  I
vaguely remember a discussion about estimating the density of
interstellar matter by measuring the delay between the arrival of
neutrinos and visible light from a supernova, neutrinos being the
"control sample" since they don't significantly interact with matter.

Now to the interesting part.  I admit I've never given any thought
to what happens as you cross the e+e- threshold.  A back of the
proverbial envelope calculation tells me that the elastic
cross-section goes down with energy so the velocity of wavefront
propagation goes to c, but you get conversions which snatch photons
from the beam and so reduce intensity.  Therefore, to first
approximation gammas travel at c, and lose intensity; visible
light (and infrared, etc.) travels at c minus epsilon and doesn't
get much dimmer unless it matches an absorption line of whatever
it goes through.  Corrections anyone?

Regards,

I agree that if a theory were developed which accurately predicted the
subjective sensations for a variety of brain types, conditions, and
circumstances, confirmed in their accuracy by the people experiencing
these events, that it would become widely accepted as a valid theory
of consciousness.  There might still be some doubters who maintain that
we have no way of being certain that the theory is accurate.  (Other)
people might be zombies who would claim that the theory was correct when
in fact they had no consciousness at all.  But I think they would not
be any more than a tiny minority, like the people today who believe that
they are the only conscious beings.

(It would, however, be difficult to know how to extend the theory to the
more interesting cases of less-conscious beings, like animals.)

Perhaps so.  In an earlier debate on this topic, I suggested that
technologically mediated mind-reading might similarly allow direct
perception of other people's consciousness.  However it raises complicated
issues of whether I can be said to actually perceive your consciousness
in the same way you perceive it, or whether I am inherently filtering it
through my own consciousness, so that ultimately what I experience is not
identical to what you do.

It reminds me of a disagreement I had a few years ago on
comp.ai.philosophy (where discussing such issues is their bread and
butter) about whether computer simulations of conscious brains would
be conscious.  I suggested that it would theoretically possible to do
reversible uploading.  A brain is scanned into a form where it can
be modelled (abstractly!) on a computer.  It undergoes interactions
and has experiences in this virtual form.  Then, using nanotech, the
resulting consciousness is downloaded back into the brain, the neural
pathways remodelled to the conditions described by the virtual form.
This could be repeated multiple times, transitioning between body and
computer (and in fact this might even be a common form of transportation
under some circumstances).

I argued that people would have the sense that the transition between meat
to computer was not significant, that their memories and experiences would
seem much the same in both circumstances.  Hence it would strike them as
absurd to suggest that they had not been conscious while in the computer,
since they had exactly the same evidence for their consciousness in that
form as they did when they were in a body, namely their memories of their
sense of self.

The person I was debating with maintained that the people might not be
conscious while in the computer, that the downloading process actually
would end up inserting false memories of earlier conscious experiences.
While logically possible, I think the discrepancy between this point
of view and the sense people had of their experiences would make it
effectivelly unsupportable.

I agree. Kathryn's little piece moved me, even if my literal-minded
left brain jumped a little by the reference to light-years. My office
mate just printed out the pictures from the surface and we are
celebrating; this is great news, and it feels wonderful to know that
it is up there right now, exploring and widening our knowledge as I
write this.

I don't think there is a solution in these cases. If the sociopath is

If they are suitably subtle, noone knows a 'crime' has been commited, so

This could be a problem. It depends on the balance between the 
acceleration and the reproduction. Until (or if) we approach the Omega 
point then there is no real reason (that I can see) to stop and use 
every atom (or solar system) we come across. If we find space is pretty 
self-similar, it might pay us to expand out towards 'intersting' areas 
(unusual pulsars etc) and ignore quite a proportion of intervening 
space, just leaving a few monitoring drones to 'stake our claim', if we 
want to. Much of America went unclaimed until the more economicaly 
active regions were filled out, and in an expotentially expanding sphere 
this may take a *long* time to happen. Of course, if 'we' choose to 
reproduce faster than we accelerate, there would be no niches left only 
a few points behind the leading edge.

This was obviously written by the possibly psychotic Ian Cruikshank. I did
indeed ask him not to communicate with me since he was unable to do so in
any style other than exceedly vicious, rude, and irrational.

	Why would they be any different?  I'm sure there are probably
some insects (worms?) that have no conscious experience or phenomenal
subjective experience at all, having purely abstract intelligence.  In
order to know what echo-location is like for a bat we simply must
reproduce the proper neural corelate (or whatever gives the bat it's
experience) in our conscious world.

	Right now we have no idea whether a worm feels pain or not and
what such might be like if it does.  But, once we understand what
consciousness is we will be able to both know the answer to this
question and to eventually be able to modify our brain so that it,
too, can produce similar sensations so we can know what it is (or
isn't) like to be a worm.

	For more complex sensations such as love I'm sure this will be
very true.  But, for more basic sensations like red, or the taste of
salt..., I doubt which sensation our brain uses to represent such
changes much due to experience.  The important thing is that more
complex feelings, though much more involved, fleeting, complexly
interdependent..., are built out of the same kind of phenomenally
subjective conscious stuff.  Knowing what red is will go a long way
towards telling us what love is.

	Yes, comp.ai.philosophy is a great place.  I've had great
conversations with Marvin Minsky, Hans Morovec, and many others over
there.

	Why?  If this was true then I could argue that the artificial
fictional memories implanted in Arnold's mind during Total Recall
prove that the fictional experience was real simply because it
"struck" Arnold that they were real.  Of course, even though Arnold
would not be able to distinguish memories of real events from
artificially implanted memories having no corresponding reality or
history, he could know, through other evidences, which were real and
which were fictional.  Just as we will know that memories reverse
uploaded from an "abstract" simulation of ourselves are not real
memories of real feelings we actually had but that they are merely
from abstract, unfeeling, simulations.

	I think reproduction would expand to fill all available areas as soon as
possible.  This is simply because if one entity decides to do so, there
will
be a lot more entities (or a lot more of that entity, growth is a type of
reproduction) around that think expansion anywhere is good.
	In addition, with nanotech it would be possible to transform an entire
solar
system to mind by leaving a seed no bigger than a cubic micron.  A bigger
seed
could hold even more information (or the additional information could
simply
be sent by the parent, who is hurtling towards those "interesting" spots at
the speed of light so as to arrive at the time it was needed).
	The colonization America is not a good example because human beings cannot
adapt themselves to any environment nor could they reproduce without
significant effort on the part of the parent, both conditions
post-biological
entities will not have to worry about.

This strikes me as an ad hominem attack, regarded by many as
distasteful.  I, personally, find that ad hominem attacks can be quite a
lot of fun from time to time, but felt obligated to point this out given
its inclusion in a missive criticizing another writer for his rude
communication style.

Since you haven't actually read him, your opinion of him lacks 
credibility and in turn decreases your overall credibility.  I'm glad I 
have already read Sagan, because had I judged Sagan's worth based on 
your posts as you have R.A.W.'s - Sagan would not be worth reading at 
all.

I have just now found this list. Lorrey and Genen seem to have touched
briefly on a compelling concept during their dialogue: the tendency
towards the "tangent." I'm replying because just last night
while reading Deleuze & Guattari, a reference to Goux: "Jean-Joseph Goux
rigorously anaalyzes the mathematical phenomenon of the curve without a
tangent, and the direction it is apt to take in economy as well as
linguistics: "If the movement does not tend toward any limit, if the
quotient of differentials is not calculable, the present no longer has
any meaning...The tendency finds no end, the thing in motion never quite
reaches what the immediate future has in store for it; it is endlessly
delayed by accidents and deviations. Such is the complex notion of a 
continuity within the absolute break(la brisure). In the expanded
immanence of the system, the limit tends to reconstitute in its
displacement the thing it tended to diminish in its primitive
emplacement." (Anti-Oedipus, p. 231). I'm attempting to understand this
myself, yet I do know that this break(la brisure) is absolutely
essential
as an axiomatic of capitalism. It is in operation not only in dialogues
such as these, but also in relation to larger social dynamics. One of
the reasons why schizophrenia as process emerges everywhere within such
a system.(Nomadthought@usa.net)I wish to learn more about extropians and
transhumanism. Ciao.

To Fellow extropians-

I just finished reading a delightful book by Lee Smolin, a physicist and 
comsmologist at the University of Pennsylvania titled "The Life of the 
Cosmos".  It is a dramatic departure from cosmology as usual.  His basic 
thesis is that up until now cosmological/Grand Unified Theories have 
been searching for the "Fundamental Laws" that govern our universe.  He 
departs by saying that our extremely arbitrary and coincidental 
"constants" that seem to be just right for life (See the Anthropic 
Principle) are in fact a product of NATURAL SELECTION akin to 
evolutionary biology.  Most striking about his proposals is that he is 
talking pure science by providing methodologies for its disproof.

That Chapters of the Book are:

PART 1 - THE CRISIS OF FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS

1. Light and Life
2. The Logic of Atomism
3. The Miracle of the Stars
4. The Dream of Unification
5. The Lessons of String Theory

PART 2 - AN ECOLOGY OF SPACE AND TIME

6. Are the Laws of Phyiscs Universal?
7. Did the Universe Evolve?
8. Detective Work
9. The Ecology of the Galaxy
10. Games and Galaxies

PART 3 - THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COSMOS

11. What is Life?
12. The Cosmology of an Interesting Universe
13. The Flower and the Dodecahedron
14. Philosophy, Religion, and Cosmology
15. Beyond the Anthropic Principle

PART 4 - EINSTIENS LEGACY

16. Space and Time in the New Cosmology
17. The Road from Newton to Einstien
18. The Meaning of Einstien's Theory of Relativity
19. The Meaning of the Quantum

PART 5 -

20. Cosmology and the Quantum
21. A Pluaralistic Universe
22. The World as a Netwrok of Relations
23. The Evolution of Time

Eiplogue/Evolutions

Appendix: Testing Cosmological Natural Selection.


The book was so compelling I couldn't put it down all weekend!

Cheers,

Bobby Whalen

        I'm watching this evening fire burn away my tears

        All my life I've left my troubles by the door

        Leaving is all I've ever known before


        It's not the way you hold me when the sun goes down

        It's not the way you called my name that left me

        Stranded on the ground

        It's not the way you say you hear my heart when the music ends

        I am just learning how to fly away again


        And maybe you were thinkin' that you thought you knew me well

        But, no-one ever knows the heart of anyone else

        I feel like Garbo in this late night grande hotel

        Cause living alone is all I've ever done well

"The circumstances rendered the NVA vulnerable to the b-52s at a moment in 
the war when experience and technology had perfected the employment of the 
bombers.  The strategic air command had learned during the siege of khe 
Sanh that three B-52s provided enough destructive effect to satisfy most 
ground commanders.  SAC now launched the planes in flights of three rather 
than the original six in order to duoble the number of Arc Lights.  A new 
radar system named Combat Skyspot made it possible to place the strikes 
within five-eighths of a mile of friendly positions. (Rhotenberry and Ba 
did not hesitate to call a strike within 700 yards.)  The location of the 
'box', the target zone that was five-eighths of a mile wide by 
approximately two miles long, could be changed up to three hours before 
the bombs were scheduled to fall.  Rhotenberry kept a list of every B-52 
strike allocated to the battle with the drop time and change time marked 
in order to switch the box to a new location and catch the NVA in it when 
an assault was imminent or underway against a sector of the perimeter...


Ba was able to give the tank-killer teams he formed some psychological 
preparation by having them practice firing the M-72 LAW at junked aRVN 
tank hulls.  The Pentagon had time to respond to an appeal from Abrams and 
rush out an experimental helicopter-mounted system for the American 
wire-guided anti-tank missile, called the TOW for tube-launched 
optically-tracked, wire-guided....

Larry Stern of the _Washington Post_ had met Vann in the mid-1960s throgh 
Frank Scotton.  He came to pleiku to interview him and was astonished by 
the man he found.  He had never seen a person so suffused with rage and 
exhaltation.  Stern remembered the wasy Vann's eyes 'burned' as he 
described how he was wielding the B-52 bombers...


Vann's friend, George Jacobson, stayed until the end.  He left on a 
helicopter from the roof of the embassy not long before dawn on April 30, 
1975, to take refuge aboard a Seventh Fleet ship off Vung Tau an the nVA 
tanks were preparing to move into Saigon.  John Vann was not meant to flee 
to a ship at sea, and he did not miss his exit.  

He died believing that he had won his war.

It was with some trepidation that I posted my earlier mssgs.  

In times past...(going on about 35 yrs) those and similar ideas have been
repeatedly and viciously attacked.  And not just the ideas... I was
personally verbally maligned as well...  ..In the seventies while on Crete
with the USAF I was known as "The Anarchist"...which didn't bother me until I
realized that it was intended as an insult.

Yet here I hear nary a murmur of dissent!  My ideas are even
supported!!..with facts and commentary of which I was unaware.

Have I ,at long last...found an ideological home?

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

In message 0903, Lorrey and Genen have touched on a compelling concept
in transpersonal communications: the tangent. This prompted me to reply
because of readings just last night: "Jean-Joseph Goux rigorously
analyzes the mathematical phenomenon of the curve without a tangent, and
the direction it is apt to take in economy as well as linguistics: "If
the movement does not tend toward any limit, if the quotient of
differen-
tials is not calculable, the present no longer has any meaning....The
quotient of differentials is not resolved, the differences no longer
cancel one another in their relationship. No limit opposes the break(la
brisure), or the breaking of this break. The tendency finds no end, the
thing in motion never quite reaches what the immediate future has in
store for it; it is endlessly delayed by accidents and deviations. Such
is the complex notion of a continuity within the absolute break." In the
expanded immanence of the system, the limit tends to reconstitute in its
displacement the thing it tended to diminish in its primitive
emplacement." (Anti-Oedipus,P.231). This is my first post. I'm aware
that it may run the risk of sounding sensationalistic, or of a
bedazzlement of
some kind. I am attempting to understand it myself. Yet, I do know that
the break(la brisure) is absolutely essential as an axiomatic of
capitalism, and that it operates from within dialogues such as these,
and
also from within larger social contexts, and is not necessarily "the
pause that refreshes." This concept is closely akin to another: that
surplus value cannot be determined mathematically.<Nomadthought@usa.net>

Here is a quote which gives the rudiments of Smolin's idea about natural
selection of universes:

(http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/smolin/smolin_p1.html)

If we wanted to extend this in an Extropian direction, we might assume that
a universe which allows the formation of intelligent life will produce an
extra-large number of progeny thanks to the intervention of those life forms.
There are, however, some problems with this idea.  Why create unpopulated
universes?.

A.M.Genen asks
: Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to eliminate the primary causes
: of crime by eliminating poverty and deficient education? Wouldn't
: it also cost less overall in both the short and long term?

Well, yeah, separating state from economy and education would indeed
have benefits we can't imagine.  But the statists are thoroughly
entrenched in both areas, and won't be dislodged until the crash.
Meanwhile, individuals can't do much about those evils, but we can 
do our bit about crime.  A year and a half ago I bought a pistol for
$493 (including tax and licenses), and I spend less than $40 a month
on target practice.  The welfare state costs half my earnings over
most of my life, and achieves nothing.

Self-government is the toughest kind, because you only get to boss yourself
around.
Lots of people would rather boss other people around, instead.

Will someone more conversant in technical French please let me know if 
"la brisure" is anything other than "the discontinuity"? 

>some kind. I am attempting to understand it myself. Yet, I do know that

I can't quite fathom this. I thought I understood capitalism fairly well, 
but perhaps an axiom has escaped me... as the "category notion" is/was
axiomatic but unnoticed in philosophy for millennia.

(perplexity) One can argue that *value* cannot be determined mathematically.
Many have. I don't want to accuse you of dazzlement, but I hope you 
won't mind "unpacking" your speech a bit. A discontinuity takes place 
across a zero (or arbitrarily small) interval; I see nothing "pause"-like
about it unless you "cheat" and swap axes. But maybe "brisure" isn't 
"discontinuity". I'm also completely unfamiliar with whatever connotative
baggage "brisure" carries with it in French...

As anyone here can attest, I also am a gourmet ad hominem artist, but in
my short dicourse with Ian, I found that he's far more than just rude
and distasteful. This is a statement of fact, not an attack.

If they are legally bound to serve in the militia, then they are
derelict to not comply....being members of the militia, they are
nominally bound under the US Code of Military Justice, as the most
current national manifestation of regulations applying the old Rules of
War, which was an international multilateral treaty even before the
existence of our own country.

Even if you apply an anti-statist position, its still a violation of
natural law to not practice self defense, as stupidity is always a
capital crime...

Seeing as they were the main writers, whatever the rest may have thought
it was in the haggling to get it passed is irrelevant...or nearly so,
with the possible exception of B. Franklin.

One bit of interesting point of debate is where the commas belong in the
sentence... putting one after militia makes for an entirely different
meaning than putting it after state.

One of the biggest points of debate is over the meaning of the word
People. Liberal authoritarians claim that it refers to the people as a
whole, while libertarians say, and most credible constitutional scholars
agree, to the extreme displeasure of the media, that the use of the word
People in the Constitution consistently refers to individual citizens
rights rather than community rights.

Rather a mechanism to ensure constant regeneration and clearing away of
the rot of corruption. An important quote, which was recently used
against Timothy McVeigh because he had it on his T-shirt, was of
Jefferson who said after supporting Shay's Rebellion: "a little
rebellion is good for the country"...."we should see a rebellion every
20 years or so".."the tree of liberty, from time to time, must be
replenished with the blood of tyrants and patriots."

I suggest that everyon reread the Declaration of Independence. You'll
notice that the founding fathers supported the idea that men are morally
bound to rebel against and overturn corrupt and tyrannical governments.

I would say that it is one of its biggest strengths. It ensures that the
responsibility for whatever deterrent power is necessary to ensure the
security of the state rests in the individual.

A number of our founding fathers posessed much more than pistols and
muskets. Prior to the expansion of the US Cavalry, most cannon in the US
were privately owned, especially those built for use at sea, as most
Americam merchant ships had to defend themselves against piracy and the
agressive use of force on the part of England, France, the Dutch, and
Spain to enforce protection of trade monopolies.

In fact, several members of the Continental Congress made their livings
as privateers with fast, well armed gunboats. NOTE: a privateer is
notably different from, though sometimes similar to, pirates, in that
they typically practiced smuggling and blockade running rather than
piracy. In this respect, Washington and Jefferson are not much different
from Clinton in hanging out with smugglers...

Why create dead planets?

This presupposes that those universes most likely to create progeny are
those that develop life, that the odds of any one universe being without
life or being born by a universe without life become exceedingly smaller
as the evolution of the multiverse proceeds.

This conclusion rests on the assumption that intelligent life forms are
eventually able to create far more singluarities than would be likely to
form by normal star evolution. Of course, if constants like the
gravitational constant were any less, there would be no singularies, or
far fewer of them, and with a smaller stellar population, the potential
number of or probability of intelligent life evolving becomes less.

I'm not so cosmologically skilled, but can anyone make any guesses as to
what constants could be different enough to allow a much higher rate of
light speed, yet still allow life?

I just watched "Man Immortal" on TLC and I must say that despite the 
title of their program, their conclusions were disappointing. Something 
to the effect of: "Though man may die, mankind will live forever" and 
sap like that.

They put the viewer on a bit of a roller-coaster ride with segments 
about some new research or discovery with fantastic potential, then 
tempering our enthusiasm with the downside (example: we might be able to 
change our "clock" genes but the free radicals will get us anyway).

They ended off with finding a way to make our cells renew themselves 
indefinately so as to avoid free radical damage. Though they suggest 
this is possible, apparently the cell reproduction goes out of control, 
inevitably leading to cancer. And then you die.

I don't follow their logic however: If the point of cell renewal is to 
replace damaged cells, and our red blood cells (for instance) can do 
this more rapidly than cells in other parts of our body, why couldn't we 
make these other cells work at least as well (once we find the way to 
reprogram them) and keep their reproduction stable as that of the red 
blood cells?

<opinion>
While this has been a problem in the past, I look forward to a day when
even this social convention can be avoided.  Uploadable intelligence makes
the problem of killing the body, at worst, an inconvenience.  Government
itself will become a lost cause ... what punishment can be dealt on the
uploadable (replicable) brain?  What force can hold it in place?  What
agency can permanently remove an article of information from this world?
</opinion>

<opinion knowledege=uninformed>
John Stuart Mill argues that man is essentially striving for happiness;
that society should therefore strive for the happiness of those within it.
But what happens to the utilitarian society when man arrives at the point
to which he has been striving, when he reaches happiness at the throw of a
switch?  Society falls apart; man himself becomes functionless.

What kind of society is left?

I dunno.  He is wrong, and he's quite fanatic about what he's saying...
But he's certainly not insane by any definition I'd like to find in common

about liberals.

Granted, I wouldn't want to argue with him, as he's certainly not open to
new ideas, but I also don't feel the ad hominem is appropriate.

Rick, don't get me started! What I said about Ian Cruikshank was *far* more
restrained than he deserves. Just go and have a conversation with him on
something that you disagree about. I've *never* interacted with someone so
extremely unpleasant. Even his web site partner seems embarrassed by IC's
style of communication.

Dan: My comment was not in response to what he said to Michael, but in
response to what he said to me.

Since others of you will no doubt come across Ian Cruikshank, I'm going to
paste in bits of some of his letters. Since he continued to send me abuse
after I asked him to cease communicating, I have no compunction about
posting this drivel publically:

["Min Less"?! How old is this fellow? I did contact Jim. He turned out to
be reasonable and disapproving of Cruikshank's tactics. In discussion with
him it turned out that he recognized that he was in error and that his
posts had *not* been tampered with. Cruikshank's comments were
irresponsible slander.]

Just to show that he doesn't reserve all his nastiness for me:

I think this has already been done. I know there have been some
simulations done using evolution (although not GP, as far as I know)
and noise. I suggest that you explore the papers from the various
alife groups, they might contain some tidbits.

Hmm....this is a off the cuff guess, not being a medical expert.  But with
the Spleen able to trim off excess dead red blood cells, does it also
regulate the total red blood cell count in the blood stream?  If so, this
would add a regulating element to the bloodstream that would be lacking in
any tissue system that was given similar regrowth potential.

a collective consciousness, and our smaller consciousness exist within this.
 This could also lead to an abundance of counscii making up our own

I'm going to be wildly speculative here:  Could it be that consciousness is a
product of any logic (not just highly complex networks such as our brain).
 Whenever cause and effect takes place there could be a spark of
consciousness, possibly only lasting for a nanosecond and maybe inferior
compared to our own.  Out of this web of conscious thought higher level
conscii start to appear, eventually leading to our own complex perceptions

Of course, consciousness could simply be the product of some chemical, or

To make a promise is to voluntarily restrict one's future actions. But 
there's nothing about making promises that violates one's own self-
ownership. (Heck, one could even posit that a defining characteristic
of self-ownership is the ability to make promises, because those who
do not own themselves simply cannot make promises... they might be able
to mouth them, but they cannot make them.)

So have you gotten around to reading Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom,
Benson's The Enterprise of Law, or Tom Morrow's essay presented at Extro-1
(now available on the web) yet? The existence of these works is the primary
reason why no one on the list has yet bothered to explain to you in 
intricate detail why they disagree with you about this.

Since the conversation between John K Clark and Brent Allsop seems to
have collapsed into agreement on a statement that I vigorously disagree
with, I thought I'd just inject a little noise into the system  ;)

 > "the only feelings I can objectively observe is my own"

Precisely the opposite is true. I can't think of any reason to believe
that anyone could objectively observe anything happening inside the
very instrument they are observing with. One can observe one's own 
feelings, but one cannot do so objectively, at least not without doing
great violence to the ordinary-usage sense of the English word 
"objective" as it is usually applied to the word "observation".

So the proper statement would be "the only feelings I can never hope to
observe *objectively* are my own". I'm not sure whether this supports
Allsop's point or Clark's, but I'd be interested to see what they think
of it.

Yes, as long as it's on a voluntary basis (isn't this basically what the
Kleck quote in the other message said?). Trouble is, I work about a
hundred days a year just to pay the taxes the government charges me, then
waste a fair amount of the rest of the time just trying to keep it's
grubby hands off people's guns and encryption software, which doesn't
leave a lot of time to do anything more productive. If the control freaks
were to stop trying to ban everything they see and worsen poverty and
ignorance through (possibly well-intentioned) government programs, then
we've have plenty of time and money to deal with these other issues.

No, though it might be 80,000... someone mentioned it yesterday on

I'm pretty sure that the final cost of the Channel Tunnel (between Britain
and France) was over $15 billion. Of course it's a massive boondoggle that
is unlikely to ever make a profit, but that's another matter.

	I think you are probably right.  But there must be something
that brings it all together into one conscious world.  Not only must
it exist, it must exist in a way that it can be collected into and
produce the entire world of our complete awareness.  There may be some
elemental part of consciousness in all of physics but until it is
brought into a conscious space or world it isn't of much use.  I would
imagine that integrating multiple conscii is an exponentially complex
problem.  I would bet that there can't simply be a global
consciousness without lots of brain like machinery to make it so.  The
equivalent of shared conscious space between two brains would likely
be many times more complex than a single brain and the equivalent of 4
mind melded brains would be many times more complex than just 4 brains
and so on exponentially.  I would bet that we will have shared
conscious worlds, but as far as a global consciousness... without
infinite computing resources like we might have in an omega point, I
would bet that it would be impossible.

	Logic is simply a set of rules that specify a particular
behavior.  There must be something physical which implements or
instantiates or performs this behavior.  I see no reason why logic
does anything outside of whatever the particular physical phenomenon
that is performing the logic is directly responsible for.  There must
be some actual physical phenomenon that is producing the consciousness
and it is this conscious phenomenon that represents or instantiates or
performs the logic of our minds.  The conscious phenomenon of our
minds are able to perform logical operations, it doesn't arise from
that logic.

	Physical phenomenon don't evolve do they?  But entities
abilities to use various physical phenomenon to better survive do
evolve.

	YES!  YES!  I bet this will be the most significant world
changing discovery to date.

What's this mysterious 'E-Prime' problem that you and Hagbard keep 
bringing up? If it's something along the lines of, "Human perceptions are 
limited, therefore our abstractions, definitions, and philosophies are 
all based on incomplete and possibly false data and can't be trusted," 
then it's not the E-Prime problem, but a problem that Plato introduced 
into philosophy a long time ago. It's the basis of skepticism, mysticism, 
subjectivism, and a whole host of other crippling mental concepts.

Why do you shy away from ranking philosophies? Obviously some 
philosophies are better than others. Likewise, some whole sets of 
philosophies are superior to other sets. I'd venture that the 
philosophies influenced by Aristotle's work have done far more good for 
people than all the philosophies influenced by the Hindu Vedas. Likewise, 
the political philosophy of capitalism seems to be far more successful 
and beneficial than communism if one judges by the ample evidence 
available. Should I seek to avoid ranking these philosophies? Is it wrong 
or impossible for me to say, "Capitalism is a moral political system and 
communism isn't." or "A philosophy which morally sanctions the initiation 
of force is a bad philosophy and therefore inferior to those philosophies 
which prohibit the initiation of force."? It seems to me that you would 
say that this type of ranking is either bad or impossible (judging by 
your statement, "...to heirarchically rank human thought conjures the 
very shades of ideology I seek to avoid in the first place.")

You also state that "I prefer to think of it in terms:  'this set of 
thinking is most useful to me in my life'.  If I cannot find a useful 
philosphy, I would develop one!" Aren't you simply then *judging 
(ranking)* a philosophy by how it makes you *feel* at any particular 
moment?, i.e. "I've been following this philosophy and I feel good. 
Therefore the philosophy I'm following is good." This is a very bad way 
to decide what philosophy one should follow.

I admit I don't understand that last paragraph. First of all, I *did* 
base my polemic on the contention that to commit means to pledge one's 
self to a position on an issue. I think I'm justified in doing so, 
because that's one of the definitions of "commit" in my Webster's 
Dictionary. Your second sentence, "Humans make commitments every day, 
either to a value, to a decision, to a way of thinking, otherwise we 
would not be able to take any actions." I can accept. Then you say, "If 
anything, Richter was responding to the demand to commit to an ideology 
with a counter-commitment not to fall into position-based thinking." OK. 
(now I see that I misread this last sentence and that's what caused my 
misunderstanding). But why don't you think that the "counter-commitment 
not to fall into position-based thinking." is a position itself? If so, 
then it's not a counter-commitment, but just another commitment being 
something like "Accept no philosophies."

What's scary about Richter's "position" of no-positions is that after 
discarding all the abstract concepts that philosophy contains - 
principles, values, ethics, etc. - the only thing Richter will have left 
to decide and judge his actions will be *feelings*. Feelings are not a 
good way to gain knowledge or make judgments. They are certainly not a 
good thing to base *all* of one's actions on - as one would be forced to 
do in order to follow Richter's recommendation to give up all abstract 
thought (to refuse to commit to any ideology - i.e. any abstract 
philosophical system.)

Whaddya think?

Michael Lorrey took the liberty of forwarding email from Ian
Cruikshank to the list.  The most remarkable thing to me is that
Mr. Cruikshank spends so much time denouncing a phenomenon he has
clearly spent very little time studying.  Just in case his rant
raised unpleasant questions in the minds of some people new to the
list, I want to pick out and correct a few of his grosser misstatements.

> ACQUISITIVENESS: extropians affirm the right of infinite property
> accumulation (e.g. Bill Gates).

Considering that nearly all of the observable cosmos seems to
consist of unclaimed homesteadable stuff, I personally don't have
a problem with infinite property accumulation.  But Bill Gates is
a poor example, since a significant minority of extropians thoroughly
disapprove of the means by which Gates accumulated his wealth.  If
we go back to the open letter Gates published in the mid-1970s
pleading for an end to the "piracy" of his BASIC software (a letter
which ended up shaping subsequent thinking, and thereby, subsequent
legal argument about intellectual property in software) we find a
number of dogmatic assertions which are hard to square with most
of the theories of anarchocapitalism and polycentric law that I've
seen defended here and in other extropian publications.

Cruikshank here commits the same sort of mistake he commits elsewhere:
he asserts uniformity and unanimity within extropian thought which
simply does not exist.  The areas in which extropian thought *does*
seem to be fairly uniform and unanimous are precisely those in
which Cruikshank himself agrees with us (except perhaps his disbelief
in the second law of thermodynamics).

> COLLUSION: most also affirm that corporations should exist and enjoy
> "limited liability" and be treated as a "single person".

Current guarantees of limited liability for corporations have been
debated on this list and in other forums more specifically dedicated
to hammering out the finer points of agorist legal theory.  I
personally am skeptical about the possibility of securing limited
liability for the owners of corporate entities in the absence of
an authoritarian state.  Whether or not corporations (or sewing
circles or go clubs) "should exist" is a question of concern only
to those poeople who form the corporation (or sewing circle or go
club)... I can't imagine how anyone calling himself an "anarchist"
could possibly argue otherwise.

> TERRITORIALITY/CLANNISHNESS: extropians advocate creating your own
> utopia of sorts, by only associating with people who share your
> values and pursuits. 

This part is right.  What, does Cruikshank really wish to be *forced*
to associate with people who do not share his own values and
pursuits? Is Cruikshank begging and pleading to be locked in a pit
full of ravening extropians?

Of course we can learn a great deal by associating with people who
do not share our own values.  But since extropians are still rather
rare, most of us experience the questionable pleasures of such
learning experiences on a daily basis.  And when we get together
and talk about the stuff that interests us, instead of football
and McDonald's and how to better prevent people from taking incorrect
drugs, do we therefore necessarily...

> I.e., deny the existence of starving, sick, dying people world-wide, 

To turn Cruikshank's "argument" against him, the same "logic"
indicates that Cruikshank's refusal to be thrust into the pit of
ravening extropians mentioned above would likewise constitute a
denial of the existence of starving, sick, and dying people worldwide.
Just a tad bit incoherent on the segue here.  Fortunately, as long
as Cruikshank continues to argue against freedom of association,
not many people are going to listen to him for very long.  Freedom
of association is as beneficial to the unlucky as it is the fortunate.

> SECRECY: extropians affirm cryptography as a means to allow
> unaccountable agents (accountable at most only to each other) to
> continue to squander the resources of this world for their own
> selfish enrichment.

In the first four words, he has it right, although even here there
is no unanimity, since I have see well-reasoned arguments on this
list in favor of "transparency" over the long term future.  His
assertions about the motivations for extropians supporting cryptography
miss many different points: that encrypting ones speech is a form
of free speech, that privacy and security in ones personal effects
(as guaranteed in the US Fourth Amendment) is a vital protection
against the sort of tyranny that Cruikshank claims to be working
so hard against, and others.

> SELFISHNESS: extropians affirm "me-first, me-last, me-only."
> me, me, me. they talk the jive of "personal responsibility", another
> coded way of saying "no such thing as a free lunch", another of
> their pet dogmas which they ascribe as "laws of nature", for of
> course they represent the "voice of nature", or so they think.

Actually, I don't see much evidence for this claim at all.  Given
that the problem of distinguishing self from other in a reliable
way is recognized by many (not all) as a very deep problem in
philosophy and computer science, and given that since most extropians
are deeply convinced that the implementation of their ideas would
improve things for nearly everyone on the planet (e. g. those who
agree with Julian Simon), one could just as reasonably argue that
extropians are deeply altruistic, since they spend an unconscionable
amount of time studying all kinds of painfully abstract disciplines
and talking about how the systems we find in the world might be
improved for the benefit of all.

Then come the slams on the second law of thermodynamics, which
Cruikshank seems not to have studied, since this is hardly a physical
law at all, but nearly a mathematical one applying to diverse
cellular automata ranging from the very simple to ones as rich and
complex as the particles and fields of our own cosmos.  Of course,
it only applies to *closed* systems... like Cruikshank's mind.

(Yes, that last bit *was* an ad hominem... you needn't point it
out to me.  Stop being so puritanical and allow me my sinful
pleasures.)

	I'm not talking doing violence to the word "objective".  We
will have machinery that will objectively observe complex "neural
correlates" and predict when one is experiencing a common "red"
sensation.  We will objectively understand what this subjective "red"
sensation physically is and why (or at least how) the particular
neural operations produce such a phenomenal experience and how our
brain builds these individual sensations into our unified worlds of
consciousness.

	Eventually we will have artificial machinery that, like
brains, objectively produces such subjective sensations, and uses such
to not only represent and reason about information but also to
motivate and to impart value, love, and other things that are usually
considered "spiritual".

	If we can make machines (other than by procreation) that
produce such sensations, would you not consider such engineering
knowledge "objective" knowledge without doing violence to the meaning
of that word?  Our DNA objectively knows how to do it, we've simply
got to ask it how it does it and then do likewise.

If Extropians view capitalism as the only accepted form of spontaneous
order, then I don't have to think twice about leaving this list. I'd
be glad to debate any of you one on one, though. Actually Virginia,
there's another version of Robinson Crusoe. Yes, as a matter of fact it
does involve a brush with psychosis. When did you start thinking that
the way to mental health was easy? "But the priest did not turn to the

John Lilly, M.D. had a ketamine-induced vision of sci-fi-like future/s 
of Earth a few centuries from now, worth reading. It centers around the 
increasing independence of, and self-preserving/human-controlling 
activities of, the "Solid State Entity", which is roughly the net sum of 
the silicon-based "life forms" on Earth. Check it out in Lilly's 
autobiography, The Scientist.

Or perhaps Velikovsky was correct in some respects and wrong in others.

Hmm, here's a Wilson quote (our Net link is lousy at the moment so I can't
access the pages I wanted to quote from): 

     "Consider next the high temperature of Venus (480C).  As Dr.
     Roger Wescott and others have pointed out, Dr. Velikovsky
     predicted a temperature in this range for Venus when
     astronomical orthodoxy believed that planet much, much colder.
     Sagan tries to avoid giving Dr. Velikovsky credit for this
     confirmation of his model by claiming many had predicted a high
     temperature before the Venus flyby.  Actually, he only names one
     other who made such a prediction, Dr. Rupert Wildt, and Wildt's
     work did not win general acceptance (others try to get around
     Dr. Velikovsky's correct estimate in this and other instances by
     describing him as a lucky guesser.  That seems mere cage
     rattling to me.  One Could as well call any scientist who made
     many correct predictions a lucky guesser ...)...

     "But the final joker came on page 153 of Broca's Brain where
     Sagan writes (and this really deserves caps):

      ONE NOW FASHIONABLE SUGGESTION I FIRST PROPOSED IN 1960 IS
     THAT THE HIGH TEMPERATURES ON THE SURFACE OF VENUS ARE DUE TO A
     RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE EFFECT.  (All emphasis added and deserved)

     "First, Sagan claims that Dr. Velikovsky does not deserve
     credit for predicting high temperatures on Venus because
     everybody knew it, although historical fact shows that only Dr.
     Wildt had made the same prediction before Velikovsky.  Then
     Sagan either tells a double lie or else suffers an alarming
     memory lapse that may require neurological consultation claiming
     that neither Dr. Wildt nor Dr. Velikovsky had made this
     prediction (which they had, and he had noted earlier) -- and
     then he brazenly claims he had originated it himself.  Quite a
     performance wouldn't you say?"
	- Robert Anton Wilson, "The Astronomer Who Abolished Gravity,"
		Cosmic Trigger III, Mask, (Tempe, AZ, 1995),pp. 197-198

Now, I don't believe in Velikovsky's theories either, but if this is true
(and I found, but have since lost, a Web page listing numerous other
occasions where Sagan claimed that Velikovsky was wrong in such respects
then later adopted Velikovsky's opinions) then I'm not impressed. 

>The nuclear winter theory may or may not be true, but one thing is
>certain, it has absolutely nothing to do with human political theories, it
>has to do with the atmosphere.

Nonsense. Nuclear winter theory has little to do with the atmosphere and
everything to do with choice of parameters in atmospheric models. By
choosing different parameters you could create anything from a 'nuclear
summer' to a 'nuclear absolute zero'. Sagan was a big supporter of
limiting the number of nuclear weapons and, oddly, the parameters his
group chose showed that we'd get a nuclear winter. Later, when people
actually did some experiments to determine the validity of the model the
parameters were found to be dramatically overpessimistic. The same model
predicted millions of dead in Asia after the Iraquis ignited the Kuwaiti
oil-wells; the real effect was minimal. Their model clearly had absolutely
nothing to do with the atmosphere. 

Or, in other words, "Garbage in, garbage out". 

>The atmosphere doesn't give a hoot in hell

But we're not talking about the atmosphere, we're talking about
atmospheric models. 

>If Dr. Sagan thought there was one chance in a thousand of being correct
>it was his duty to shout it from the rooftops.

Really? Should he really have gone out to the mass media rather than
suggesting the possibility to the atmospheric physics community for them
to review? Even today most people believe in 'nuclear winters' even though
the evidence seems to show that Sagan was wrong. 

>If it turns out he was

But most of them didn't go out and push their theories on TV, they used
that Scientific Method to discover whether they were correct. Why was
Sagan more concerned with publicity than truth?

I'm not familiar with the details of this controversy, but I can read
what is written above.  Sagan is not claiming to have predicted high
temperatures.  He is taking credit for offering a specific explanation
of the high temperatures, namely that they were caused by a runaway
greenhouse effect.  Wilson is wrong to say that Sagan is claiming that
he originated the prediction that Venus would have high temperatures.

<<  our minds could already be a collective of many independent

Two books to reference :  Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind" and another
 (whose title and authori can't remember exactly) but it's something vaugely
similar to "The advent of consciousness and the breakdown of the Bicameral
Mind"

Key Concept: Memes (memes=information virus running on biological computer)

Everyone is uncouncious about a third of their life (sleep), plus they
operate on "auto-pilot" a fair amount of the time. (How often are you trully f
ocused on what you are doing? Only when engaged in creative endeavor I
suspect.  Problems solving)

Minsky writes that our mind is comprised of a vast multitude of "programs"
running both simultaneously and sequencially.

The author of the books whose title I mangled asserts that mankind as a group
was not "counscious" until  one of the early civilizations (Asyrians?...The
dudes with the clay tablets)  He furthur asserts that there were some
holdouts until rather recently...(how else could Pizzarro and just a few
buddies effectively stomp and entire civilization...I mean we Texans did
pretty good at the Alamo but get REAL!)....The conquistadors were "conscious"
the Aztects (as a whole) were not.

Now suppose that consciousness is a meme.  And suppose that there are
different flavors...like the flu....(are you more conscious than Bubba?  Is
Bubba even conscious at all? Is Bubba even awake?)

That being stipulated...wouldn't it require a language to transmit
"consciousness"...or at least some type of meme vector....(TV transmits
stupidy...is this to much of a stretch?)

Hmm. Any of the "us" that doesn't exist?
I'll be glad to speak to you , one on one, whenever that happens.
I see no reason to tilt at the "capitalism is the only accepted form
of spontaneous order" windmill. 
Last time I looked, crystal lattices weren't engaged in trade.
Any proposition that easily falsifiable isn't much grist for conversation.

Some of my objections to Brent's contention that we will be able to prove 
things about consciousness just like we do about Geometry, may strike you as 
ridiculously unlikely.  I agree, but it's no more bizarre than rejecting the 
link between intelligence and consciousness, lots of things are logically 
possible but not worth considering.

I see no reason why someday we will not have an excellent theory of 
intelligence.  Actually I thing we'll have a pretty good theory of 
consciousness too, but not unless we make a number of assumptions and not
one we can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt to be better than any other such 
theory, just beyond a reasonable doubt.

Because your own consciousness is the only one you can observe you must use 
yourself as a test subject, by performing experiments on yourself you hope 
to develop a theory to " thoroughly understand the laws of physical 
consciousness". Understanding means being able to make predictions, so that 
could not work. Turing proved that a finite state machine can not always 
predict what it will do next, for example if it will stop. If we are 
finite state machines then we can't understand ourselves completely and if 
we are not then we have a soul and Science can not help us in this matter.


        >that there will be no other possibility 
        

Even with something much less exotic and far more tangible than consciousness, 
like heat or pressure, we can't PROVE that other theories currently unknown
can not explain the facts as well as standard Thermodynamics or maybe even 
better. If we can't prove we have the one true theory for something that 
simple how could we do it for something astronomically more complex? You'll 
never be able to prove a rock is not conscious, it might not achieve it the 
same way you do but by some other method you know nothing about.

Similar? If something is similar then it is not identical. If the failure of 
my upload to reproduce apparently trivial qualities like the color of my 
brain, changes consciousness so much that it is no longer me, then how can you 
ignore the much more profound differences between one person and another?  
If you're correct then tiny changes in a brain can lead to profound 
differences in consciousness, even if the behavior changes not at all.  
It would also seem that some very big differences in brain mechanism can 
sometimes have no effect on consciousness, for example, if my brain ran 
backward for an hour and then forward, my consciousness would be unaffected 
even though my brain was operating very differently.

All memories are real, whether they correspond to the physical objects they

You're saying that this theory is so good that I would be able to know what 
it's like to be you BETTER than you do. If I said "I'm sorry Brent but after
studying your brain and using my theory I must conclude you're not conscious" 
then you would have to say "you know best, I thought I was conscious but 
I was wrong". I would have more claim to be Brent Alsip than you do, I know
him better.

Suppose a doctor told you that you were born with a rare brain disorder but
fortunately there is a cure. You take a pill and notice no difference. The
doctor says that you have never in your entire life been conscious until
you took that pill 10 seconds ago, your memories of being sentient before
that were "false" memories. Would you consider such a doctor to be a quack?

Brent, what I was saying was that you cannot "objectively observe" your own
feelings and sensations and neural processes. You come back by vigorously
asserting that it may one day become possible to objectively observe
someone else's feelings and sensations and neural processes. You may be
right, but that is not what I was denying.

Well, I've been trying to look into this, although I'm hampered by my lack
of expertise in astrophysics. The Solar system formed about five billion
years ago. One of the reasons that life could form here is that the cloud
from which it formed was already enriched with oxygen and carbon. The Big
Bang (if that's what happened) produced only hydrogen and helium, and 
happened only some seven to thirteen billion years before the formation of
the Solar system. It would take a certain amount of time for enough large
stars to form and go supernova to enrich the interstellar clouds of our
galaxy with the oxygen and carbon that were available at the time the Solar
system formed. When I try to answer the question "How much time at a
minimum would be required to form and disperse the necessary amount of
heavier elements?" I find I get led into astrophysics textbooks and papers
that are too hairy for me to understand without devoting a lot of time to
it, and they don't present "the Answer" to this question in the abstracts
or conclusions from which a layperson could easily grab it. So to me, it
seems like an open queston. If anyone can close it for me, I'd appreciate
it.

In the meantime, though, it seems entirely possible to me that we just 
happen to be the first on the block, and that's my hypothesis (shared by
several others, some of whom suggested it to me) about Fermi's Paradox.

        I doubt that I am the only list member who winced when s\he read
this...a very good example of an infectuous meme.  This, of course, was
derived from the first post in the "Huh?" thread --an idea sprouted by Mr.
Ian Cruikshank.

        For anyone who has just recently joined this list, I must (as Eric
Watt Forste touched on) mention that the ideas upon extropianism rambled by
Ian Cruikshank are very convoluted.  It seems that the man in question has
either not looked into extropianism to any extent, or has such a narrow and
hypocritical mind that he cannot see beyond the views which he himself has
adopted.  A statement like "...extropians view capitalism as the only
accepted form of spontaneous order..." is not only untrue, but it is almost
an exact antithesis to the open-mindedness of a desirable extropian future
progress.  Whatever works for spontaneous order is certainly accepted.

        Cruikshank has made an assortment of unsupported claims about
extropy...claims which are, for the most part, untrue.  In addition, to
leave the list on the basis of one person's personal opinions is not such
an open-minded move.  Extropy is not at all like a religion or a "cult" as
Cruikshank claims --every extropian has different views on different things
and nothing, save for the desire for progress and freedom, is set.

As I seem to recall, in the dim mists of antiquity (1970s) I got from a book
co-authored by Chandrasekhar (yes, the "Chandrasekhar's limit" Chandrasekhar) 
the story as follows: 

What are called Population I stars (that might be a Roman numeral, I forget) 
are the products of *two* supernovae, and they and their planets are the 
loci for concentrations of heavy atoms. As I understand it, the posited 
fusion processes in a "fresh" (H-He) star going nova can only get you to 
something like Calcium or Silicon. Those elements, present during a 
*second* supernova event, can get transmuted "up the hump" of binding energy 
to yield the heavy stuff, even all the way to transuranics.

Paradoxically, given the names, Pop I stars are *older* than Pop II stars.

If this is still an accepted model, then any civilization developing on 
a Pop II star's planet *might* have a hard time discovering/developing 
nuclear physics & tech. If they don't have very much metal in their planet's 
crust, they *might* not get past the pottery stage. Poul Anderson used 
this as a plot element at least once.

So we might be the first race with the wherewithal to get off their rock.
Wait for the elder race? No time for that, they might be us...

Like Eric, I don't really know what the current story is. 
Maybe Carl F has a clue?

Registrations for EXTRO 3 are coming in at an accelerating pace. 63 people
have already registered. This is far more than at the same stage for the
last conference, so this looks set to be the largest extropian gathering
yet. It looks like we'll have 200 or so attendees from all over the world
(besides the US, extropians are coming from Canada, Venezuela, England,
Germany, and Sweden.

Registration rates go up after July 10, so now is the time to register. We
are extending the deadline for lowest-rate registration until July 12. The
quickest way to register is via the web site:
http://www.extropy.org/registra.htm  All registrations received by midnight
on the 12th qualify. After that the rates go up by $5 to $25 depending on
your status (member/non-member, student, etc.)

Onward!

I can't help being amused by all of This UFO bussines. I mean, I don't
doubt that there is, or has been, life elsewhere in the universe. If you
are an atheist like me it would seem strange, that in this great
universe, that the basis for life hasn't happened in thousand of places.

But I would think that any civilization that could traverse the universe
in something as small as one of the proposed UFO's they would probably
be in such a state of development that they would have reached some kind
of singularity, or at least have developed nanotechnology.

Civilizations like that could just send a seed the size of a grain of
sand to any planets close by to check it out. Much cheaper to send out.
Not something the size of a UFO. Hmm?

Just a thought.

The fact that this nonsense came from a psychoceramic like Ian Cruikshank
should be a clue: it is, of course, nonsense.  No Extropian, so far as I
know, has ever said anything of the kind, and I doubt that he can supply
a quote either.

Some of us, namely me, /will/ say that Laissez-Faire is a fine
example of spontaneous order as it relates to economic systems, and
that no other economic system so far discovered comes anywhere
close to being as effective or as moral.  But there are plenty of
other examples of spontaneous order in the world.

That's no more a "confirmation of his model" than the fact that
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found in a Mars rock are
confirmation of 50s sci-fi films.  Velikofsky was a complete idiot,
made hundreds of blind guesses, and one of them turned out right.
He deserves as much "credit" for that as tomorrow's lottery winner

Any voluntary restriction on your future actions is a donation of your
freedom. Donate a portion of your freedom and you no longer "own"
yourself entirely. "Own" in this sense is no more than a term of art for
autonomy.

Seems true, until you've made so many promises that you are no longer
free. For example, I promise Joe (for some return benefit) that I will
not do X. I correspondingly promise Jan (for some return benefit) that I
will do Y. I then promise Jack (for another return benefit) that I will
not do Z but I will do Q.  

Et cetera.

Eventually, it seems clear that at some point I will have restricted my
actions to such an extent that everything not prohibited by contract is
compulsory by contract. How can I then say that I own myself? I've sold
my freedom to act for a certain consideration. My point, as you have
quoted above, is that with the very first promise I make, I no longer
own myself entirely. Again, ownership being a term-of-art for autonomy.

I'm familiar with the Friedman model (from DDF's website) and I agree
that his is a practical, and workable system. I've never disputed this.
But, I'm not sure how it supports the contention that a social contract
can result in anything but a form of government. First, are you familiar
with Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau? If so, maybe I should start by asking
how, in your estimation, a social contract may avoid the label
"government."

Yup, you're right. Was indeed the Convention, not the Congress that was

I'm not an astrophysicist either (but I do play one on the Net :-),
but here are some rough guesstimates:

Colonizing the galaxy can be done in less than 10 million years using
von Neumann probes (see Tipler & Barrow, the Anthropic Cosmological
Principle for a discussion of this). 

The solar system is around 5 billion years old. Life has existed for
(say) 4 billion years. Even if we assume our solar system is one of
the oldest generation I systems in existence, I still have the
feeling that the time from the first bacteria to the cambrian
explosion could have been shorter (the explosion was likely due to
one or more "tricks" like predation and multicellularity which were
slightly unlikely but could have happened much earlier). The same
goes for the emergence of intelligence among the vertebrates: the
oldest vertebrates are around 100 million years old, there is no
strong reason intelligence couldn't have developed much earlier. 

If we assume just a 10% variance, then it is quite possible that life
could have turned metazoan and intelligent several hundred million
years ago on some earth-aged planet. Since interstellar expansion is
so quick they should have arrived here a long time ago.

Max More, Peter McLuskey, Steve Petri, Leslie Aimone and I made up the
trekkers on Expedition 97.  As Mars Pathfinder and the Sojourner rover began
exploring the Martian landscape, we hiked and camped under the stars in the
Pecos Wilderness.  Good exercise, good conversation and a good time was had
by all.  Sometime in the next month or so, I'll update the EXpedition97 web
page with more details and pictures from the trip.

You're invited on the next EXpedition (98?).  Ideas for the next trip include
a rafting trip (perhaps in the Grand Canyon) or a SCUBA trip (perhaps to
Cozumel).  Ideas for EXpeditions a little further in the future that were
discussed on the Pecos trip included backpacking Valles Marineris on Mars and
SCUBA on Europa.  Your ideas are welcome: Send me an e-mail with the header

Actually, we have had several approving discussions of an alternative
to strict capitalism, the polycentric legal system, aka PPL, privately
produced law.  In this system people voluntarily choose what set of laws
they wish to live under, and the market determines the cost to the customer
of having various laws available to him.  Sometimes people assume that
PPL would be a mechanism to achieve a laissez-faire society, but this is
not necessarily the case in practice.

In such a system, certain libertarian or laissez-faire legal principles
may be prohibitively expensive, if they are despised by a large majority of
the population.  For example, a religious Muslim majority may be offended
by the sight of people walking around and not praying during the appointed
times.  These people may choose to live under a law which makes it a
crime for anyone not to pray, or at least to bow down as though they are
praying, at the call of the Muadh-dhin.  While it might be theoretically
possible for the non-religious to live under a legal system where that
is not a requirement, in practice it could be prohibitivelly expensive,
given strong enough feelings among the religious majority.

Other forms of victimless crimes could have similarly high barriers,
when the population as a whole believes that the acts are morally wrong
and should be prevented.

There is debate over the degree to which PPL would be libertarian, and it
may well be that it would tend to be more libertarian than a democratic
system, but the point is that it has been discussed favorably on the
extropian list despite its differences from a strict laissez-faire system.

(Privately produced law is a new idea for many people, and I am not trying
to explain it here.  The list archives may have some pointers to better
sources on the subject.)

E-Prime is English without the verb "to be" (is, are, was); more
specifically, without the "is of identity" ("John is a liar; Linda is a
lawyer; Edgar is stupid."). 

E-Prime emerges from the tradition of General Semantics. The reason for
E-Prime is that the "is of identity" connotes an eternal Platonic
essence possessed by the thing that is said to "be" something. The "is
of identity" tends to blind both the speaker and the audience to many
important characteristics about the relationship between the person
being described and the quality or category being assigned to them. "Joe
is a racist": "Racism" is not a measurable quantity of an object like
mass or momentum; there is no "racism meter" we can point to a person
that will detect whether Joe has the "essence" of a "racist" in him.
"Racist" is a _name_ we give to an object based on our observations of
emergent phenomena like behavior; but the assignment of the label is in
our heads, not in physical reality. E-Prime, by restricting the use of
the "is of identity," makes explicit the fact that these are statements
about the state of our nervous system, not about the outside world.
E-Prime confines itself to observations and operational statements like
"Joe frequently makes statements that sound racist to me" or even "I
heard Joe say Angelo is a dirty wop."

I see your point here. E-Prime does seem to flow out of a recognition
that human perceptions are limited and therefore we are correspondingly
unable to say something *is* anything with any any degree of accuracy.
However, what I think is more accurate is that E-Prime flows out of the
fuzzy logic camp moreso than any of classicist logicians. It recognizes
that there is no eternal Platonic essence

The point is that you've ascribed your own internalized feelings to both
systems for eternity. (Maybe a bad thing, maybe not.) But this
incorrectly assigns to each system an essence that seems intrinsic to
the reader but is in reality merely a statement about your state of
mind. Maybe this would be more clear, and less assailable: I like
capitalism over communism because communism morally sanctions the
initiation of force. This makes it clear that you are offering a
subjective opinion, no matter how true you think it is, and you've made
your point also with a reason for believing it. 

If I were to say, "Communism is a good philosophy and capitalism is a
bad philosophy." Your first reaction might be, "That's nice. Go on."
Expecting more from such a baldly opinionated statement such as that.
E-Prime seems to avoid these formulary distractions and thereby tends to
focus debate on substance.

Yeah, but that's just semantics.

Exactly.

This has definitely gotten to the level of being a dispute about
semantics (which is not necessarily a bad thing), but I personally
do not choose to use the word "promise" to designate something that
restricts self-ownership or autonomy. (Or perhaps I should say that
I choose not to use the words "self-ownership" and "autonomy" to
designate something that is restricted by promises.) A promise
restricts future action, it reduces degrees of freedom, but I do
not leap forward from that point to say that it reduces autonomy
or surrenders self-ownership. Promises and contracts can be broken,
after all, if one is willing to pay the cost to ones reputation.

In this technical sense of "social contract", the Friedman model
as I understand it has none. Only private contracts are called for.
A Friedmanesque system of private arbitration and security contracts
avoids the label "government" by failing to be a social contract
as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau used the phrase.  (Although I must
confess that I am actually more familiar with the Lockean theories
of Nozick and Gauthier than with the above three. But Gauthier is
a fan of Hobbes and Rousseau also)

I don't think social contracts are real. IMHO, the best explanation
of how the current political situation on this planet got to be
this way is provided by Hayek, and I don't think he ever uses the
phrase "social contract", except possibly to criticize it. As far
as I'm concerned, governments are not social contracts: rather,
they are legitimized (that is, popularly accepted by default, not
"legitimate", which to me would mean receiving the active consent
of the governed--a signed contract--and not just default birthright
"consent") protection rackets, the same sort of thing as the Mafia,
only more popular. (This is not a damnation of the government...
in my opinion most of the revenue-generating activities of the
Mafia ought to be legal, and I suspect it's only because of the
illegality of their core businesses that they must, er, "police"
themselves so heavily.)

I guess after blathering about this stuff so much, I should
point out that in matters of legal theory and legal philosophy I
am strictly an amateur. (As if you couldn't have guessed.  ;)

I think Ian's idea is not to associate with everyone 'as is', but everyone
after they've adopted his own warped world view (a pit full of Ian clones).
 I find his ideas very totalarian, rather than that of an anarchist.  I think
the link to a webpage for 'slackers' on his website says more about him than
any of his e-mails.  He favours a world where there is no rewards for hard
work, so that he can sit on his ass all day why we do the work for him.

Maybe I wasn't very specific about what I meant by logic - I'm using logic as
a term to describe cause and effect.  In it's simplest form it could be a
collision between two solid objects, sending each in different directions.
 Or a simple chemical reaction, at a more complex form it could be our brain,
a collection of these smaller parts.

Now imagine that every time there's a chemical reaction, or two objects
collide or anything happens where there is an outcome there's a spark of
consciousness.  Every time a reaction occurs it creates conscious thought.
 From this pool of conscii larger conscii start to form, in fact there could
be some sort of evolution taking place that decides what conscii survive and
which fade (a good consciousness being one that becomes aware, as non-aware
consciousness is pointless).

These smaller conscii could be so inferior that you probably wouldn't call
them conscious at all.  Think of them as sparks being created by gears
churning together, eventually enough of these sparks can create a full blown
consciousness like that of the human mind.  We could also be part of a larger
consciousness, but just as we are not aware of these smaller conscii, or even
each others conscious minds we would not be aware of a higher level
consciousness.

This is, of course, only an idea.  I can't prove it now just as much as you
cannot prove to me that you are conscious.  I suspect I only developed this
theory because I like the idea of discovering that something we once
treasured as setting us apart, turns out to be one of the most abundant
things in the universe!

I'd like to take this opportunity to coin the word 'conscii' - if you don't
mind.

My idea was consciousness being created by physical movement.  Whereas memes

I have thought about consciousness as a learned or evolved phenomenon.
 Prehaps what I am experiencing as consciousness is really just me *thinking*
i'm conscious, and it really never happened at all.

You could say that you are not conscious until you are told you are
conscious, after which you look back and say "Oh yeah!  I was conscious all a
long" and therefore can't remember a point where you weren't conscious.  This
could be easily past along.  We would not notice the difference between a
conscious being and a non-conscious being until we ask - of course, as soon
as we explain the question, they're infected and they also think they're
conscious!!

I prefer the idea that it's something physical and within our grasp.

Referents:

   Quantum theory....as I understand it when an electron changes
"shells"...i.e. either gains or looses energy and movoes from one energy
shell to another ....it does so without crossing the intervening
space....just disappears and then reappears.  In some quarters the "Many
Worlds" scenario is discussed with a straight face.

   Dark Matter....as i understand it there is about 10 times less observable
matter than would be expected from celestial mechanics calculation.

    The speed limit of light appears inviolate.

Super-String theory....as I understand it....presupposes more dimensions than
the garden variety 3 that we are used to...4 if you consider time a
dimension.


Outrageous Speculation:
    High energy particle physicist John Cramer wrote a book....TWISTOR....  in
 which he speculates that the matter is there...but in a different
(diminsion? don't like that term...but lack anything else) not interacting

This opens up a number of possibilities....which I can't go into right

So it's come to this, the once mighty Extropian list is reduced to debating 
the merits of Velikovsky, that's Velikovsky of the Jupiter spiting out a 
comet that causes miracles in the bible and then goes into a remarkably 
circular orbit and becomes the planet Venus fame. It's a sad day.

When Sagan said he predicted the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus in 1960 
he was being modest. 1960 was when his Ph.D thesis was published, he started 
writing it in 1957 and made no secret of his views on the subject before that.
Apparently Carl felt that it didn't count until he spelled out every detail
of his argument in great detail and made it available to anyone who wanted
to read it. Most in the Scientific community thought he was wrong until
Mariner 2 proved him correct in 1962. The idea that Carl Sagan could find 
anything of value in the ravings of a dim bulb like Velikovsky, let alone 
plagiarize it, is beyond idiotic.

I read the quotation of Robert Anton Wilson that Mark posted, and perhaps
I just have no sense of humor but I didn't think it was very funny. I didn't 
find an amusing satire, just a vicious attack by a man ignorant of Science. 
Personally I think Bozo The Clown is a better comedian, sometimes he's 
amusing when he's hit by a pie and at least his cruelty is not directed at a

Obviously part of the art of making a good model is picking the correct
parameters, and Sagan was one of the best in the world at it.

Nuclear absolute zero? How?

Very fortunately the definitive experiment has not been performed, yet. Do
you think that in a matter such as this it would be wise to error on the
side of caution?

That's true it didn't work for oil fires, the model failed because the smoke 
didn't go as high as most predicted, but that doesn't make Sagan evil or 
stupid, just wrong.

Sagan never said he had proven that Nuclear Winter would happen, only that
it was a disturbing possibility that needed further research. I challenge you

   I have some questions about Free-Market Economics that I hope someone 
can answer.

   I will start by saying that I agree completely that a true 
free-market economy would be ideal.  One that is competitive, open, and 
decentralized.  But is a market free, if a company becomes so powerful 
that it establishes a near-monopoly on a given market and in turn 
prevents competition and progress form occurring?  A good example now I 
believe is Microsoft.  If your answer is no, then what methods or laws 
would enable the market to remain free and competitive without large 
corporations controlling policy?  As an anarcho-libertarian I want to be 
free of any coercion, government or corporate.  How do we as extropians 
propose to enhance the potential of a true free-market taking hold?


Bobby Whalen


P.S. I hope you can forgive what may already be a basic question on this 
topic.

But when folks made up the Roswell story back in the forties no-one had
even thought of nanotech so they based it around 40s technology instead. 
I wouldn't be surprised if fifty years from now people think that UFOs
built with nanotech was a really funny idea.

P.S. There have been some very good Roswell debunkings posted to
alt.alien.visitors lately. There is basically no first-hand evidence of
any of the major claims, and certainly nothing which can't be explained by
the Mogul surveillance balloon theory.

Well, I did write a long reply at work, but gave up after it bounced eight
times. Can someone PLEASE fix the MX relay from pobox.com to extropy.org
because currently any time there's no direct link to extropy.org mail
bounces. Eliminating the pobox.com MX altogether would be an improvement.

Hmm, I don't remember saying anything about the main features of
Velikovsky's theory, other than that I don't believe it. But since you've
brought this up, here's what he I understand he said, from the little of
read and lots I've heard second-hand: 

	1. Jupiter threw out Venus

Possible? Well, there could be some kind of unknown phenomenon which makes
gas-giants occasionally do so; there's enough energy in the system.  So
it's unlikely, but possible. 

	2. Venus then passed Earth several times

Possible? I don't see why not if it could get into an appropriate orbit. 
So again, it's unlikely but possible. 

	3. Venus spewed out 'manna' which the Hebrews ate

Possible? Maybe... a body of that size could potentially drop a lot of
matter on Earth. 

	4. Venus caused other Biblical 'miracles'

Possible? Don't know; I don't know which miracles he's talking about. 
 
	5. Venus then settled into its current orbit.

Possible? I don't see how without an interaction with a third body which
was ejected from the system during that interaction. Again, possible but
very unlikely. 

So why the hostility? I see no reason to believe Velikovsky's theory, but
while it's highly improbable, it's certainly possible. Unlike, say, the
perpetual motion folks, Velikovsky has claimed nothing that breaks any
known law of science. So why is it that mention of him causes such a
knee-jerk reaction from so many people? 

> I read the quotation of Robert Anton Wilson that Mark posted, and perhaps
> I just have no sense of humor but I didn't think it was very funny.

True; in retrospect it's lowered my opinion of Wilson a fair amount. 

[nuclear winter]

As you say, there's nothing wrong with Sagan being wrong about nuclear
winter. Equally, there's nothing wrong with desiring a nuclear freeze, but
if someone wants one and produces and publicises a flawed study which
supports that position you have to wonder whether their political
ambitions have colored their models. See, for example, the Club of Rome. 

The problem is that he went out to the media and even published a book on
the subject before his work had been evaluated by his peers. As a
consequence even though he's wrong most people still believe what he said.
Now with many people I could give them the benefit of the doubt, but Sagan
was clearly smart enough and definitely media-savvy enough to understand
that no later retraction could come close to matching the original
sensational media coverage of his claims. Science is about truth, not
popularity of ideas, and at least in this case Sagan put his desire to
'spread the word' above truth. 

BTW, is the Paul Ehrlich who co-authored 'The cold and the dark' the same
one who was predicting mass starvation in the seventies? If so, Sagan
could clearly have picked better people to work with on his models.

Apparently so.  IBM in the 1960s and 1970s was in a market-dominant
position very similar to the position that Microsoft is in now.
Its repressive influence on progress in computer technology was
also about the same as that being exercised by Microsoft now.  But
Digital's VMS systems and the Unix system out of AT&T (popularized
on Digital's machines) did not go extinct, and eventually a smart
young feller named Bill Gates figured out how to steal IBM's fire
by stealing its new microcomputer platform out from underneath it.

Natural monopolies of this kind grow up from time to time.  They
last, usually, for a few years or decades because they are pioneering
a new market niche that people are unfamiliar with, and because
they provide service, products, and prices that are "good enough"
for the vast majority of new consumers entering this market.  Alcoa,
which dominated the aluminum industry in that industry's infancy
by keeping its prices very low, is another good example.

This sort of monopoly is not nearly as pernicious as monopolies
like the US Post Office, whose competition is prohibited by
legislative fiat, and the oppressive influence of which can last
for centuries and not mere decades.

Eventually, someone will trip up Microsoft the way Microsoft tripped
up IBM in the 1980s.  It's a fairly straightforward measure of the
ambition of any young business executive in the software industry
whether they dream of unseating billg@microsoft.com one day; I
suspect that most of them do, though few of them mouth off about
in public.  I doubt that any human being or corporation can withstand
being the focus of that kind of competitive pressure for many
decades.  Although I've badmouthed Microsoft on this list before,
really, I think the US federal government is a much greater threat.

You must be joking!  Isn't one of the great whinges of our time how
terribly difficult it is to cope with progress and competition in
computers?  Continuous upgrading seems to be the norm.

The only way corporations can possibly coerce is by means of government.
When people say 'corporate coercion' in the usual sense, it's just
another whine.

Because that's not true: Velikofsky's claims are quite impossible in
many ways: "Manna" as described in Exodus appeared on the ground in the
mornings as was nutricious: anything falling from the sky would be very
different.  The parting of the Red Sea (another Velikofsky claim) does
not follow any laws of gravity or fluid dynamics.  The timing of the
passes of Venus does not comport with any reasonable stretch of the law
of gravity.

But beyond all that, Velikofsky deserves ridicule not for merely being
wrong--as many good scientists, including Sagan, have been--but for
doing the exact opposite of science itself: by taking the conclusions
first, and stretching the facts to fit them, rather than starting with
observations, postulating ideas that fit the facts, then testing them
to reach conclusions.  Velikofsky is not merely a bad scientist, or
even a non-scientist; he's an anti-scientist, and an apologist for
theists.

I lost a lot of respect for Sagan when he sued Apple for making fun
of him, but despite that, he's always maintained at least a modicum
of epistemological integrity and scientific honesty--even his "nuclear
winter" work was an honest possibility arising from observed phenomena
and reasonable guesses about unknowns.  As it happened, his guesses
were wrong, but he never tried to hide them, and he always used the
known facts as they were.  Like Velikofsky, his guesses were perhaps
motivated by religious prejudice--in Sagan's case his environmental
beliefs, so Sagan loses another point on that, but he's still so far
above Velikofsky on the scale that it's hardly worth noting.

Yes, and he deserves to be put closer to the Velikofsky camp, as you say.

Maybe we should evaluate scientists on a scale of integrity and rigor:
We'll make Richard Feynmann a 10.0, L. Ron Hubbard a 0.0.  That puts
Velikofsky in the 0.5 range, Sagan probably around 7.0.

I think the progress on the hardware side has been great. However, if 
there wasn't continuous upgrading then Microsoft and Intel (Wintel) 
would go out of business.  Microsoft comes out with a new, more bloated 
version of their software, and Intel in turn has to come out with a new 
and faster chip for it to run on.  Have you ever noticed that it takes 
Windows 95 longer to load on a Pentium than Win 3.1 on a early version 
of the 486?  If you consider Windows 95 progress then you haven't really 
fathomed the potential software that could really be done on these 
supercomputer chips we now posses. Microsoft and Intel are in bed 
together to insure future business and market share. If you have not 
noticed this, then you must be kidding!

I definitly have to disagree here.  Lets me diverge for a moment.  I 
consider myself an anarchist.  A "true" anarchy is where individuals can 
do anything they want as long as it dosen't interfere with anothers 
freedom.  If an individual or group of individuals grabs a bunch of arms 
and starts terrorizing the rest of the people in this "anarchy" into 
submission, then we no longer have "anarchy" but a new form of 
authoritarianism..  Now back to corporations... 

It's corporations that are increasingly requiring piss tests to get a 
job.  Imagine if you had to take a random piss test from the government 
just to stay in "good citizen" status and not be thrown in jail!  Please 
don't misunderstand me, I'm not defending government in any way.  What I 
am saying however, is that a corpocracy is not a free-market.  A good 
example was in the early part of this century when Rockefeller would 
open up a new gas stations next to small independent operators.  When 
one of his stations first opened they would charge less then wholsale 
prices until the other guy COULD NO LONGER COMPETE and go out of 
business.  As soon as the small-time operator went out of business, 
Rockefeller would raise the price of gas higher than the small-time guy 
was originally operating at.  If you consider this practice fair-game in 
a Free-Market economy, then I will have to take serious odds with the 
whole concept of a "Free-Market" as you are presenting it.

Rather than looking at Microsoft's continuing status, try looking at
what they have really had to do to keep that status. The error of people
who point the finger at monopolies is that their excuse would only work
in a market with no technological progress, as all it would take to beat
out the monopoly is to build a better mousetrap. Microsoft succeeds
because its people are not satisfied to be number one for a day, they
want to stay nuber one, and, despite claims to the contrary by
reminiscers of that quaint old Apple, they must constantly improve their
products to compete with the other companies that build better products
than Microsoft's previous versions. Even in no-tech industries, like
farming, monopolies are hard to come by because of the commodity value
of the product.

Do you wonder why the anti-trust lawsuits against Microsoft have faded
away, its because the cheif whiner, the President of Novell, lost out,
and the number two whiner, Ellison of Oracle, has decided he could do
better by trying to do a technological end run around Microsoft with his
NC technology. Aldus got bought by Adobe, so they chilled out.

All that antitrust stuff in the news was just the competition trying to
put some brakes on Microsoft, who had taken advantage of some strategic
mistakes the others had made.

I think that the high level of Microsoft haters out there indicates that
Microsoft won't dominate the applications industry, and the evidence
from Corel so far indicates that this will remain this way as the
competition seems fully capable fo turning out quality, even superior
applications.

As for the OS market, so what? SOmebody has to set the standard. Ghu
knows that Apple abrogated that right when they continually charged a
stiff premium for an OS that did not get improved very often. The fact
that Microsoft was able to come along and kick their butts indicates
that the monopoly domination claim is bogus.

What was that? The reports of temporal dilation, unknown materials
technology, and no discernable power source are all evidently beyond
40's technology.

There have been accounts by scientists who claimed to have inspected
materials at Wright-Patt that the metals were nanoassembled, and that
the bodies DNA had less than 10% of the amount of genetic info that
humans have, indicating possible genetic engineering.

Uh, Col. Corso, who just came out with a book, was on the recovery crew,
supposedly, and was with the Joint Cheifs of Staff as well, so the claim
of no first hand accounts is bogus. Of course, once all the alleged
witnesses are dead, it will be easy to say, "well there are no first
hand accounts, so its a fake". Marcel, Brazel, and the local funeral
director (who delivered child sized coffins) have all made first hand
accounts.

Also, the Mogul balloon theory would fit thescattered materials found at
the Brazel ranch, if the materials technology problem was not there.
Additionally, vets who worked on that project said that balloon
materials were not classified, as they were pretty basic stuff, only the
purpose of the project was classfied. If this was so, why were the
materials shipped on a priority flight to Wright-Patt under guard? This
is a known fact that the GAO's report did disclose. THis incongruity in
security  statuses rings bells in this veterans mind.

Also, the Mogul theory does not fit the first hand reports of intact,
damaged wreckage being recovered at another site closer to Roswell, the
recovery of which by military personnell was witnessed by a number of
people on a geological or archaeological expedition, several of whom
have given first hand accounts.

Personally, I don't know. I do know of the things I saw when I was in
the Air Force that I still can't talk about. Given that all of the stars
in our region of the galaxy are relatively the same age, I would give it
a 50% chance that we've been visited in the past or will be visited
within the next 100 years. The fact that we put out as much radio energy
as a small star should ring some bells in some radio observatories on
other planets when the c sphere reaches them. I think that most of the
unexplained UFO sightings today are classified aircraft projects,
something which I am involved in tracking with a private group I work
with. I also think that most of the hysteria in the public these days is
purposely generated disinformation put out by governments seeking to
create a PR cover for their covert activites. This is something I was on
the other side of once, so I know that this is true.

I think that the surest sign that the occupants of UFOs are intelligent
is the fact that they pointedly refuse to be interviewed by our press...
;)

"There's this thing called being so open minded your brains fall out."  
                            Richard Dawkins

There are a large number of things that are highly improbable.  So
improbable in fact that they can be assumed not to have occurred, unless
there is extremely good evidence otherwise.  I would bet my life (and that
is not a statement I make lightly or often) that there is no good evidence
for Velikovsky's theory.  It would be about as probable for a fully formed
bacteria to suddenly appear on replicator-less Earth because free floating
lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars all just collected in the
right place at the right time by random chance.

You make a very good point.  However, those who have built a better 
mousetrap invariably get bought out by Microsoft.  So little of what 
they have actually created has been orginal or creative.  They have 
advanced only to the degree necessary to maintain their market dominance 
- which isn't much.

I heartedly agree that Apple has made some serious blunders.  The way I 
see it, is Apple's had superior technology with a rotten marketing 
strategy, and Microsoft has had the superior marketing staregy with a 
poor software package.  But that is another story.

It almost did on earth.  Just before the meteor hit that wiped out the
dinosaurs there was a bird-like creature with the intelligence of an
ostrich.  Granted, it wasn't much, but the extinction may have set back the
evolution of intelligence on earth, or it may have moved it forward. 
Depends whether primitive mammals or birds as smart as an ostrich could
evolve to intelligence faster.  Is there any data for the relative
intelligence of mammals over time?  How long did it take from cretaceous
mammals to ostrich level mammals?  Idle speculation of course, but
interesting none the less.

Of course.  I'm just using the rules of natural selection, and our current
understanding of physics, to describe what would happen if such entities
evolved.  I cannot completely explain the Fermi Paradox, obviously.  My
only guess is that there are more efficient ways to get energy and matter
to convert to mind than paving the universe.  I do not have suggestions as
to what those are.  It's just that after a billion years, it would seem
intelligence would discover some physics we do not have an inkling of now.

Irrelevant.  We have to take care of our young.  Human beings are a bad
model for the far future of intelligence.  The ecosystem is a better model.
 Memetic evolution is useful as well.  The effect of wealth on human minds
is likely to tell us nothing.  Postbiological minds could colonize the
universe with small seeds that started converting matter into mind as soon
as it got near a star.

	Virtual reality maybe fun but it does not get much accomplished.  You
cannot explore new physics without a connection to the outside world.  You
also cannot avoid dangers.  Those entities that concentrated their efforts
on avoiding real threats would be more successful than those that divided
their time between the real world and artificial worlds.  Survival (of
replicators) is the name of the game.  If it doesn't help survival, it's
useless (evolutionarily speaking).
	You might also want to chose a better metaphor.  I find "Expanding into
Cyberspace at many hundred multiples of lightspeed..." to be so vague
(using c to measure distance through ideaspace, where there is no light) as
to be meaningless.

As of this hour, I have a Ph.D. in Social Science from Caltech!

My thesis is available (minus some figures) at:

http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/dissertation.html

Paper copies are available to those who ask in the next week, and who
promise to look at it.  

The Acknowledgements conclude: 

"Finally, I thank these older but still strong influences on my
intellect, Eric Drexler, David Malament, Mark Miller, Riley Newmann,

So thank you all.

Here is a title and abstract:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Four Puzzles in Information and Politics: Product Bans, Informed
        Voters, Social Insurance, & Persistent Disagreement


In four puzzling areas of information in politics, simple intuition
and simple theory seem to conflict, muddling policy choices.  This
thesis elaborates theory to help resolve these conflicts.

The puzzle of product bans is why regulators don't instead offer the
equivalent information, for example through a ``would have banned''
label.  Regulators can want to lie with labels, however, either due to
regulatory capture or to correct for market imperfections.  Knowing
this, consumers discount regulator warnings, and so regulators can
prefer bans over the choices of skeptical consumers.  But all sides
can prefer regulators who are unable to ban products, since then
regulator warnings will be taken more seriously.

The puzzle of voter information is why voters are not even more poorly
informed; press coverage of politics seems out of proportion to its
entertainment value.  Voters can, however, want to commit to becoming
informed, either by learning about issues or by subscribing to
sources, to convince candidates to take favorable positions.  Voters
can also prefer to be in large groups, and to be ignorant in certain
ways.  This complicates the evaluation of institutions, like voting
pools, which reduce ignorance.

The puzzle of group insurance as a cure for adverse selection is why
this should be less a problem for groups than individuals.  The usual
argument about reduced variance of types for groups doesn't work in
separating equilibria; what matters is the range, not variance, of
types.  Democratic group choice can, however, narrow the group type
range by failing to represent part of the electorate.  Furthermore,
random juries can completely eliminate adverse selection losses.

The puzzle of persistent political disagreement is that for ideal
Bayesians with common priors, the mere fact of a factual disagreement
is enough of a clue to induce agreement.  But what about agents like
humans with severe computational limitations?  If such agents agree
that they are savvy in being aware of these limitations, then any
factual disagreement implies disagreement about their average
biases.  Yet average bias can in principle be computed without any
private information.  Thus disagreements seem to be fundamentally
about priors or computation, rather than information.

>Why do you shy away from ranking philosophies? 

Every human is in part a product of their culture and environment, 
and each human has developed a particular perspective based on that.  
We can learn to break out of that and learn to appreciate other 
perspectives, but ranking our modes of thought as better than other 
modes would necessarily create a barrier to broadening experience and 
learning. 

>Obviously some philosophies are better than others. 

This is not obvious to me, because you have not defined the ranking 
factors you have subsumed into the term 'better'.  I would critique a 
philosophy based on whether it takes an open-ended approach to 
important questions, whether it is internally consistent, etc.  These 
are the types of factors that mean 'useful' to me.

>You also state that "I prefer to think of it in terms:  'this set of

>(ranking)* a philosophy by how it makes you *feel* at any particular

I don't think that the usefulness of a philsophy depends on how it 
makes me 'feel.'  To the contrary, I find useful those philosophies 
that force me out of comfortable modes of thought.

Let's be very careful here--Richter said nothing about discarding 
philsophy in general and focused entirely on ideology.  Philosphy is a 
mental discipline that encourages questioning and rigorous 
examination;  ideology discourages critical thinking and relies on 
emotions such as fear and insecurity, and as such it is used as a 
tool by those who would control others.  Richter had first-hand 
experirence in his own life of how ideology is used to control and 
imprison other humans, and I greatly admire him for standing up 
against it.

If "Objective" means independent of any observer, then feelings can never be  
objective or even exist. If "objective" means the way things really are, 
then I can observe feelings objectively because MY feeling can never be 
anything but the way they seem to me. I would even say that if I can observe 
a  being's feelings objectively then I am that being, and if I can't then 
I'm not. That's not to say that my idea about why I have the emotion I do is  
objective, it's not, and is in fact very often wrong.

Some drugs have the embarrassing side affect of making us irritable. I take  
such a drug and am now filled with anger. My brain needs to find a reason,  
any reason, to explain this anger. Well... it must be because you're looking  
at me funny, yeah that's it! At the time It seems to make perfect sense, 
after all, I am angry and I think you did glance at me once. I think it was  
you.

In this example my theory on the fundamental cause of my anger was untrue and  
not objective in the slightest, but of one thing I was objective about,  
the fact that I was angry, no doubt about it.

Nobody has a gun to your head, if you don't like the new  "bloated" version 
then don't buy it and stick with the old one. If many really felt that way 
Microsoft would be out of business. They're not.

It's interesting that every one of the people who ran crying to the government 
and later testified that Standard Oil's predatory tactics made competition 
impossible, nevertheless somehow managed to amass huge fortunes competing 
with Standard Oil. Take David P Reighard for example, when Standard Oil 
threatened to lower the price so much that he would lose money on every 
gallon he sold, Reighard called their bluff, he knew Standard oil sold a lot 
more gallons of oil than he did, and so would lose a lot more money than he 
would if they tried to do that. Standard Oil realized that the only way to 
stop Reighard was to buy him out, which they did, at a huge profit to 
Reighard. What did he do with all that money? He built an even larger oil 
refinery of course. Standard felt they had to buy that one too, at an even
larger profit to Reighard. Are you starting to  see a pattern here? 
In all Reighard did this 3 times before Standard caught on  and gave up, 
making him one of the riches men in the country.

Being small is absolutely no excuse for not being competitive. I manufacture 
99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% .  I want to drive you out of business, 
so I figure I'll lower my price until you go broke and then I can jack them 
up to anything I want. So now you louse money on each widget you sell, 
the trouble is I do too. I have 99 times as much money as you do, but I'm 
lousing it 99 times faster. Even worse, because the price is very low the 
demand for widgets is huge, and if prices  are to remain low I must build 
more factories and increase production. I'm lousing money faster and faster, 
meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small factory and wait
for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.

GAUSSIAN HUMANS:
  Neutral Terminology for the 21st Century.
       )1997 by Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.

Fairly soon, our society is going to be faced with altered humans.  Some
naturally altered humans already exist.  Proposals for deliberately
altering humans exist.  Now would be a good time to start defusing the
panic that will result when the issue becomes popular.

This article deals with the subject of what to call unaltered humans. 
I feel strongly that the term chosen should be neutral and should remain
so, more for the altereds' sake than to spare the unaltereds'
feelings.  While there's no need to deliberately promote a sense of
class distinction that will retard research or spread fear, megalomania
has always been the great cliche danger of mind-tampering.

Bear in mind also, as you read this, that you are almost certainly an
unaltered human; as you review the appellations, reject any you feel
would be insulting if applied to you.  If you are, or plan to be, an
altered human, reject any terms which make you feel megalomaniacal when
used to refer to others.

----

Historically, terms used to denote unaltered humans include "normals",
"mundanes", "ordinary humans", "humans"/"mere humans", "mortals", and so
on.  I feel all of these are insulting.

"Normals", as used on Babylon 5 and many novels, seems slightly
derogatory; "mundane" is even worse.  In both cases the implication is
that the person is flat/dull/obsolete.  Few people become famous or
admired for being "normal" or "ordinary".  For that matter, how many
"normal" people are there on this list?  Your chances of being "normal"
aren't much better than your chance of being "modified".

Calling unaltered humans "humans" is worse still; the implication is
that the altered are a new species.  Taxonomically, and ethically, this
will not be the case.  Human/nonhuman distinctions should be reserved
for human-computer distinctions, or humans who have been neurally
reprogrammed to the point that they have entirely different cognitive
architectures and are essentially neurally based computers.

"Mortals" is worse still.  Mortal/nonmortal distinctions should be
reserved for {humans, AIs} vs. {Vingean Powers, Singularity Children}. 
Using the term to refer to others, if meant seriously, is a short step
from megalomania.  There may be some slight justification for medical
immortals using this term, but even these long-lived folk could fall
prey to a nova and are thus mortal.

----

I therefore propose the phrase "Gaussian", as in "Gaussian
distribution", also known as a bell curve.  A Gaussian can be anywhere
on the curve.  A Gaussian can be an idiot or a genius or an average
fellow.  No geis of normality or uninterestingness is implied.

The implication is that the person is a legitimate part of that curve,
which an altered human is not.  Let's say we implant 1,000 people with
neural interfaces to pocket calculators.  If we now look at the total
bell curve for all human calculating ability, we'll find an ordinary
looking curve with a huge spike way off on the right.  Moreover, the
curve and the spike will have been produced by entirely different
internal models, one natural, the other artificial.

Of course, that's a best-case scenario (for the altered humans).  Other
alterations (such as those I've proposed in "Algernon's Law") would
produce somewhat odder disturbances in the bell curve.  In addition to
spikes on the right, there'd be spikes on the left, flat areas in the
middle, broken correspondences, and all sorts of statistical havoc.  I
daresay that cognitive scientists of the future will have to exclude
altered humans from the sample of any study not specifically geared to
them.

Which is the general idea.  You have Gaussian humans, who tend to be
distributed smoothly and statistically, with most in the middle and a
few on the edges.  Then there are altered humans, whose curves come in
all sorts of odd shapes and sizes - not necessarily with any net trend
towards the right.  (In other words, the altered will be weird but not
necessarily superior.)

(Picky readers may note that many altereds' curves will be Gaussian in
their own right; however, the mean will probably be different, which
would distort the unaltereds' curve if factored in.  And since an
altered human is likely to be the product of a single disturbance
rather than a large set of environmental and genetic variations, the
curves *are* less likely to be Gaussian.)

Finally, the phrase "Gaussian" has never been used in any science
fiction novel (that I am aware of) to refer to a group of humans.  It
will therefore have only whatever connotations we choose to give it, and
will initially evoke no prejudices.

Do any of you deem this phrase insulting?
Would it make you feel megalomaniacal if you used it to refer to others?

Sincerely,
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.

Re the Subject line of this thread,

	The best definition of Remorse I have seen is in the I Ching, which
states that Remorse is the ability to observe when one has made an error
and
takes action to correct it, and to correct any future errors of the same
kind.

I have read a fair amount of R.A.W. and have also met him in a number of
contexts including some discussion groups. I enjoy his writings much
more than I enjoy his person. As a writer he is indeed a satirist who
especially likes to poke fun at pomposity of all kinds, particularly in
politics, the occult and in overblown establishment science. I would
select 'Prometheus Rising' as probably his most informative work in
terms of what interests me the most (typologies of consciousness). As
far as Extropian kinds of issues, I think R.A.W. is of very limited
interest. IMHO I think he is more intersted in pointing out absurdity
than in promulgating rational thought. But he is fun to read!

This passage presumes the subconscious is some kind of mongrel dumb

I didn't make an argument about whether we have, or will be, visited. I
simply tried to say that if anybody was able to visit us thru space, they
would probably be able to do so without us detecting them in any way.

Oh, please.  That's not being careful, that's redifining what the man
said into meanings less controversial--evading the issue, not dealing
with it.  Let's not pretend that the enemies of "ideology" don't mean
what they say; they do, and should be held accountable for their
beliefs.  Those who use the term "ideologue" as derogatory--and there
are many--do not oppose only those ideologies imposed by fear or used
to control others.  They hold equal disdain for reasoned ideologies
and ideologies opposed to control.  I have been called an ideologue
in the dergoatory sense more than once for being a free-speech
absolutist, for example.

And why do you *have* to run Microsoft software on an Intel processor? I
chose a computer with an Intel processor because it's cheap and runs my
favorite games, and I only have a DOS partition in order to run Duke Nukem
3D and Strike Commander (Doom and Quake are already ported to Linux). If
the new freeware DOS clones are compatible enough I'll soon be able to
eliminate all Microsoft software from my computer. 

>Have you ever noticed that it takes

Yes; so why use it? On a normal day my only contact with Microsoft
software is the NT machine on my desk, which I only have because the
company decided to standardise on some weird Windows email system for
internal mail and Word for documents (and because I can happily trade
resolution for colors and run it with a 16-bit display to check out my Web
pages). I do all my real work, internet email and Web page development on
Linux.

Microsoft is *not* a monopoly. Last I heard their turnover was less than
Apple and much less than IBM. NT was announced as the wonderful new
operating system which would take over the world, yet it flopped despite
Microsoft's marketing muscle; now every year they announce that NT will
soon replace Unix, and every year it fails to do so because it just can't
compete. Not even Microsoft marketing can beat reality. 

There are numerous operating systems you can run other than MS-Windows
(e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, NeXTStep, OS/2) and many alternatives to Microsoft
applications. Most of them are no only cheaper, but more powerful and more
reliable. No individual or company *has* to run Microsoft software but
many choose to do so, because Windows has real advantages; it has a large
software base and for novices it's easier to use than most alternatives.
If you don't like it, then don't use it. No coercion is involved. 

>If you consider Windows 95 progress then you haven't really

Windows 95 *is* progress compared to Windows 3.1, and Windows NT is
progress compared to Windows 95. As far as I'm concerned they're all dross
compared to real operating systems like Linux, but they're definitely
progress compared to the previous dross that Microsoft has sold.

>Microsoft and Intel are in bed

Of course they are. They make money, I get cheap computers; we all
benefit. What's the problem? 

>It's corporations that are increasingly requiring piss tests to get a

As far as I'm aware, most of those corporations are forced to do those
tests by the government in order to retain their government contracts and
wouldn't do so otherwise. The exceptions seem to be corporations hiring
unskilled workers, who can't trust them not to turn up wasted; companies
hiring skilled workers can't afford to upset them without a good reason. 

What stops you from working elsewhere, or as an independent contractor?
I'm damned if I'm going to work for any corporation that expects me to
piss in a bottle, regardless of their reasons, but I support their right
to voluntarily impose the tests. Until the government mandates tests for
all workers I can simply take my skills elsewhere.

>Imagine if you had to take a random piss test from the government
>just to stay in "good citizen" status and not be thrown in jail! 

Hey, don't joke... recently the British government have been musing about
random roadside piss-tests for drivers just in case they've been taking
anything. "But if it saves just one life..."

I'm sure you've had many answers already, but I'll take this
opportunity to plug what I think is the best of the hundreds of
places one can get the constitution online (the best free one
anyway; WestLaw's annotated is even better if you can afford it).

<http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/constitution/toc.html>
is the Government Printing Office's version with history and
analysis of decisions by the Senate, as authorized by 2 U.S.C. 168,
as well as plain text verbatim versions with all the original
spellings, etc.

For your convenience, I've placed the plaintext version from there
on my site at <ftp://ftp.piclab.com/pub/usconst.txt> and
<ftp://ftp.piclab.com/pub/amends.txt>.  (Your amendments may be
out of date if they are older than 1992, when the 27th passed).

Congratulations Robin! This may seem a major accomplishmenht to you (and it
is), but I have to tell you that ever since I've known you, you've *always*
felt like a Ph.D.! To put it another way, Robin Hanson has always been a
Ph.D. waiting to happen.

Best wishes for your new position. The folks in N. Cal will be delighted to
have you nearby.

Once again I find myself in the untrendy position of defending Microsoft! I
note that while most companies are slashing research budgets, Microsoft has
recently *tripled* their budget for basic research. They have hired a large
number of exceedingly smart people, especially in regard to advanced
graphics software.

Whatever truth there was a few years ago in the view that Microsoft was not
creative (a view that I've found exaggerated) has become ever less true
over the last few years. In the years to come, as results appear from their
labs, I think even the Microsoft haters will have to change their views.

It's Apple that rested on its laurels while Microsoft relentlessly caught
up then, in many areas, overtook. I don't believe it's realistic to blame
all of Apple's woes on marketing. I suspect their cultish approach allowed
them to get lazy. While Apple was busy enjoying being cool, Microsoft was
busy attracting intelligent people and putting them to work at maximum
efficiency.

Okay, go ahead, call me a corporate lackey.

Why would the next 100 years be any more special than the last million?  Or
the next million?  On someone elses timetable it should make no difference.

I agree.

I am sure the aliens are seriously upset with the disturbing and uncanny
ability of rednecks and trailer trash to spot their stealthy craft.

     Roswell and the UFO phenomenon may be the government taking advantage 
     of first cold war, now millenial hysteria and keeping a nice 
     entertaining dog and pony show going to keep the masses distracted.  
     There is a tinge of paranoia in that statement I suppose but I figure 
     when you have access to the mightiest military force on the planet and 
     gazillions of dollars, you might just get a little power hungry and 
     outta control.
     
     But I'm much more fascinated by the notion that spacecraft (flying 
     saucers,etc..) would be impractical for interstellar travel, given the 
     inviobility of FTL travel.  Not knowing enough to go on about the 
     physics involved, my question is more a request for illumination.  
     What about the notion of interdimensional travel where space is 
     "folded" as in Dune or notions (however unfounded) like the wormhold 
     in DS9?  Perhaps there are means of sustaining matter as one traverses 
     physical dimensions into ones where distance isn't an issue.
     
     Now, I don't really need to know whether or not there are creatures, 
     races from other planets.  Chances are pretty high since it's a pretty 
     big place that's been around several billions years.  But then again, 
     the world was a pretty big place to people who could only travel as 
     fast as a horse could gallop (if they had horses) or boats that were 
     essentially hollowed-out logs.  The first Spanish ships must've looked 
     like some alien mothership to the indigenous natives of the western 
     hemisphere.  Distance and vastness are relative to our ability to 
     traverse the space.  What took generations, months and thousands of 
     lives in the traversing of USAmerica now is done in a matter of hours 
     and then we get pissy if the flights are off schedule.  Just 150 years 
     or so ago, pissy had a different context.  And now, change is on an 
     exponential curve that makes 19th to 20th century innovation pale 
     comparison.  We're in for some interesting times.

Thanks for the good wishes everyone!

There are a lot of costs to going back to school when you're older,
rather than just keeping on when you're younger, but I think one of the
benefits is that it doesn't go to your head.

I know I haven't changed that much; just learned the standards and
literature of existing research in certain areas.  And I've had time
to contribute my own research.  I also know full well there are lots
of smart and interesting people without degrees.  And I know that if
you want to directly attack the most interesting questions, you'll
likely have to do that in your own spare time, whether you're an
academic or not.

There are lots of good reasons not to do what I've done, but "I
couldn't do it" isn't one of them.  I'm pretty sure most of you could
do this if you wanted, regardless of your age.

We have had some detailed discussions on wormholes on this list in the
past, and there is a good article in back issues of Extropy.  Without
wormholes, it would probably still be possible, but expensive.

Years ago, people proposed ramjets which could get up to near lightspeed
by fusing interstellar hydrogen.  Today we might envision using nanotech
to upload all the passengers into some kind of solid state form, perhaps
suspended, so that higher accelerations could be used.  In one design
I saw, the interstellar craft was basically a gun able to shoot its
payload at close to the speed of light.  The whole gun was launched at
near the speed of light from the home system (maybe with a light sail
or EM launcher so the g load is relatively moderate).  Then on arrival,
it would shoot out the tiny "bullet" backwards, opposite to the direction
it was travelling.  This would slow the payload down so it would enter
the target system at a moderate speed and crash into some body where it
could rebuild the passengers.  But the bullet would pull a lot of g's!

Once arrived, there would not be much point in travelling back and forth.
EM waves could be used to communicate any results as fast as travelling,
and perhaps even to send compressed brain descriptions so travellers could
"beam over" between star systems.

All this would suggest that UFO's, if they existed, would be
interplanetary rather than interstellar craft.  They might even be
strictly for use in the near earth region.  They would be built and
launched somewhere nearby, either on earth or perhaps the moon.

However this is really just entertaining speculation; actually the
ostensible characteristics of the craft (their ability to crash, for
example) don't seem consistent with the kind of technology we are talking
about here.

It is hard to understand why "violence" is the specific ill said to
follow from violating these principles.  I could see that some of them
might lead to unhappiness or disappointment, but a lot more would have
to go wrong before violence would result.

>From an individualist perspective, these are not "blunders of the world."
Some of them may be unwise practices for individuals.  Although they
are expressed in the language of conventional morality, there may be
something there that we can use.  Let me try to go beyond the conventional
interpretation of some of these items, and see what they could usefully
say to extropians:


>      * Wealth without work

If you have a lot of wealth, and just sit around and enjoy it all the
time, there is a good chance that ultimately your lifestyle is going
to seem boring and pointless.  For most people, having a challenge, a
goal, a chance for improvement, is an important part of a happy life.
(Note, there may be some people for whom this is not true, and who really
are satisfied just enjoying a pleasant lifestyle.)

>      * Pleasure without conscience

Conscience represents your suppressed knowledge of problems in your
current situation.  If your conscience is bothering you, it's because
at some level you believe you should be doing something different, but
you are trying to ignore it.  In this sense, the advice is valid: be
aware of the full ramifications of what you are doing.  Look at the
long term consequences of your actions.  Don't just ignore problems,
hoping they will go away; do something about them.

>      * Knowledge without character

I interpret this as distinguishing between "book" or theoretical knowledge,
and "character", which is learned through actual experience with the real
world.  It's a common mistake to think that the first can be a substitute
for the second.  (Another mistake is to think that the second can be a
substitute for the first, people who have practical experience but refuse
to believe that theoretical analysis has any value.)  This advises us
to test our theories against reality, to go out and interact with the
world.  This is an important source of information and learning which
some people ignore.

>      * Commerce without morality

Think of this as another recommendation to look at long term consequences
of actions.  It may seem attractive to cheat or shave some corners in a
commercial interaction, but in the long run this will hurt your reputation
and interfere with success.

>      * Science without humanity

This could be seen as advice to think through the full consequences of
implementing a new technology.  "Humanity" really refers to the world as
a whole as it is impacted by a scientific advance.  Don't burn down your
rain forest land so you can grow wheat without thinking about whether
it may hold valuable pharmaceuticals.

>      * Worship without sacrifice

This is really advice to avoid hypocrisy.  If you think of yourself as
a worshiper, you should make your actions suit your thoughts.  Actually
worshiping will require some sacrifice.

More generally, it is easy to fall into the trap of believing that
thoughts are as good as actions.  An example would be someone who
thinks of himself as taking steps to improve his life just by reading
mailing lists.   Unconsciously he identifies with the progress being
made by other people on the list, and he thinks he is improving himself
in that same way.  But actually he is not making the real effort and
real sacrifices which are necessary to move forward.

We see this a lot in the cryonics community.  There are people who think
cryonics is a good idea and can work, and even think of themselves as
being in a position to receive the benefits of the technology, except that
they haven't actually signed up to have the procedure done!  Taking that
extra step is the costly one in time and effort, and it's surprising
how many people don't do it.

>      * Politics without principle 

The idea here is consistency.  Politicians without principle change with
the latest opinion poll or lobbyist contribution.  They end up moving on
a random walk through position space, and don't accomplish much.

By adopting principles and following them, you coordinate the actions in
your life so you are moving generally in a consistent direction.  Align
your goals with your principles and they will be that much easier to
attain.


I won't try to go on and do the other ones.  The technique should be clear.
The real point is not to reject this kind of advice just because it is
cloaked in the language of conventional morality, or offered by someone
who is perhaps approaching issues from a very different direction than
your own.  Often if you look a little deeper you will find common ground.

Hal

P.S.  Curiously, reversing several of these points makes them equally valid
IMO, and often more extropian:

 * Work without wealth
	People should work with the goal of significant rewards.  Sacrifice,
	save, so that you are improving your financial picture.
 * Conscience without pleasure
	Don't be so focused on the big picture that you forget to enjoy
	the happy moments.
 * Character without knowledge
	Explained above - don't scorn the boys in the ivory tower.
 * Morality without commerce
	Ethical and honest behavior is good, but you can't ignore the reality
	that work is necessary to survive.  This also emphasizes the
	importance of the division of labor and cooperative commercial
	agreements in terms of benefiting everyone.
 * Humanity without science
	Without science and technology we are little better than animals.

They're not out of business because they ARE the business.  What people

With regards to Rockefellers tactics, your facts of history are wrong. 
Rockefeller did not have to lower his prices everywhere - <only in those 
places he was opening new gas stations>.  History shows this worked 
quite well to his advantage.

I have to make one very important point.  Since we don't actually live 
yet in a free-market economy, all we can do is speculate as to how it 
might work; thus my questions are theoretical.  My intention is to 
increase my overall comprehension of free-market economics.  By doing 
so, I am taking on the roll of 'devils advocate' to see how others on 
this list can respond to any holes I might see.

So far, people have made some pretty fair arguments regarding Microsoft 
- although I still think some of Microsoft's historical tactics of been 
anti-competitive.

Cheers!

Neanderthals lived from 300,000 to 30,000 years ago, fully modern humans came 
along about 120,00 years ago, so they coexisted for about 90 thousand years. 
Neanderthals had brains at least as large as modern humans and they made 
tools almost as sophisticated, the main difference in culture was that Humans
produced Art and Neanderthals did not. That's probably significant but I 
confess I don't quite know what to make of it.

One of the great mysteries was whether there was any interbreeding between 
these two groups, it looks like the question has been settled. In today's 
issue of Cell Dr. Svante Paabo of the University of Munich reports that he
has discovered mitochondrial DNA in a Neanderthal bone and found no evidence
of any interbreeding with modern humans, no Neanderthals genes in the Human 
gene pool.  He also found that the 2 groups were not as closely related as 
thought, the last common ancestor to Humans and Neanderthals lived between 
550 and 690 thousand years ago.

I have a hunch that this may have something to say about Robin Hanson's great 
filter, but again I'm not quite sure what. On the one hand a big brain was 
produced in 2 independent ways, on the other hand one of those ways did not 
work out in the long term.

Speaking of Robin Hanson, I want to congratulate him on his new Ph.D., not  
that I'm surprised, I already knew he was smart as hell.

But what holds one to one's promises?  It isn't some external force, but
one's own will, one's own decision - after all, I *could* break those
promises at any time, if I wanted to.  

So one is still autonomous: one still owns oneself, one still controls
oneself, by nature.

One only loses that power if some alien force intrudes on one's control:
and that's what libertarianism has noticed, and emphasises.  The *social

Aren't you contradicting yourself here?  In fact, advances in software
possibilities drive advances in hardware, and advances in hardware drive
advances in software.  Both ways, it's a good thing on the whole.

I''ve got no more than an ordinary end-users smattering of knowledge of
computers, but it seems to me that despite its faults, Win95 is a
definite advance on Win 3.1 in terms of ease of use, speed of running
programs, and multitasking capability.  I *have* spent the occasional
day or two tearing my hair out over some problem, but then I expected
that when I got a computer, because the need for backwards-compatibility
and the many different manufacturers of ever snazzier hardware and
software having slightly different standards means that there will *
always* be problems.  In fact come to think of it, most of the
complaints of the kind you make seem to forget that a lot of the reason
for Win95's 'bloatedness' is caused by these things, plus the requirement
that the PC ought to be operatable by even relatively stupid people. 
This last requirement is never quite fulfillable, of course, precisely
because it requires a bloated, complex program that is prone to the
occasional problem! :-)

>Microsoft and Intel are in bed

I'm sure they are.  And if they keep on making stuff people are prepared
to buy, they will ensure future business and market share.  So what? 
The fact also remains that if they don't they won't.

A piss test for taking a job is the employer's privilege.  That is
completely different from govt., because the govt. in no way *owns* the
country.

This is not an example of *coercion* as I think of it, except in a *very
* loose sense of the word.  It is a dirty practice, and it ought to
be*morally* condemned, but since it doesn't involve force or the threat
of force it does not require the use of force to correct.

Also, the bigger operator is still losing money if s/he undercuts; the
bigger s/he is the more money they lose, so in the *long run*, such
monopolies are unsustainable.  I'm sure Michael or Daniel or Eric would
be able to explain this better than I.

Sorry, nothing you have said persuades me that a free market would
prevent competition from occurring.

That's not the only difference.  Evidence examining the bones of
Neanderthal children and the children of modern humans of the same period
showed that Neanderthals kept their children on the move (the activity
shows in slight breaks and healing in the bone normal in any demanding
physical activity) thus exposing them to more dangers and stress.  This may
be the reason modern humans won out or it may not.  The important thing is
that it shows the major difference was probably cultural as opposed to
biological.

Just a quick comment on this Rockefeller business.  I've read that
Rockefeller used the tactics of trying to pressure his competitors
into selling out to him by undercutting them and then offering to
buy their businesses while they were in distress.  This set up an
arms race: several small-time oil operators caught on to what
Rockefeller was up to, and began to start up new oil businesses,
investing little or no capital in them, letting him lose money for
a while by undercutting them, and then selling them to Rockefeller
for far more than they were worth.  I don't have any cites to the
primary literature on this (and I only read about it in secondary
literature, so I don't know how reliable the story is).  And of
course, just as Rockerfeller's smalltime competition caught on to
what Rockerfeller was up to and took advantage of it, Rockefeller
probably only got burned a few times before he realized what was
going on.

My point is that markets are shapeshifting creatures, and however
awesome the power of a monopoly may be, the power of the government
is even more awesome.  I'd prefer to see people fight monopolies
with the same sorts of tactics that are used to build up monopolies,
the way those smalltime competitors of Rockefeller purportedly did.
IMHO, the monopolies instituted and protected by governments nearly
always do more damage than the spontaneously emerging natural
monopolies.  If you want to fight monopoly, it would be better to
try to get the government to stop prohibiting people from competing
in the delivery of first-class mail and other transportation,
communication, and power services (usually monopolized by government
fiat the world over) than to lobby for the government to intervene
in the business of a company that has never received any kind of
special treatment from the government.  Microsoft certainly have
*far* less on their consciences than the RBOCs, the power companies,
and the various PTT agencies on the planet do.

(Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the RBOCs to counter any natural
prejudice arising from the fact that I'm currently working as a
contract programmer for Pacific Bell.  ;)  I'm only in it for the
money, so maybe I'm far more guilty than Bill Gates of profiting
from monopolistic practices.)

I never said advances in hardware drive advances in software only the 
other way around. Each new version of a Microsoft package requires 
faster processors with more memory.  As to weather these newer versions 
are better than the old is very debatable.  More features is not 
necessarily better software design.

I've been using both Windows and Mac-Based platforms for years.  During 
a 2 month period my company kept track of productivity comparisions 
between the two platforms.  The results were devastating to the Wintel 
Platform - every time a Mac crashed, the Wintel equivalent crashed 6 
times!

I'm not sure I quite follow you here.  The government *owns* the country 
in all sorts of ways.

Please see my previos post in this regard.  Rockefeller only lowered 
prices on gas where he was opening new stations.  This hardly put a dent 
in his pocket.

something will give.)I've lost all mail that has come my way to date.

Because of the light speed balloon of radio signals we are constantly
pumping out. Sooner or later, someone is going to notice at the very
least a drastic change in the radio noise level from this quiet little
yellow dwarf we orbit around. SInce most of the stars in our neigborhood
are of similar age, its higly likely that we are temporally coexistent
with another intelligent race within 100 ly or so. Given that we will be
heading out within the next 100 years, its equally likeley we will
either find them, or we will find each other.

A civilization a mere 100 years ahead of us technologically should have
interstellar capability now and be heading this way. If they are more
advanced, then they could already be here.

Hey, Murphey doesn't give a damn about stealth. At least three of our
own stealth planes have crashed, for all their advancement. Stealth does
not mean that you're invisible to a drunk sitting on his porch or a
co-ed getting porked in the back seat, just that such a vehicle is
designed for "low observability", not "unobservability".

I may have misunderstood you.  I thought you were talking about the computer
industry as a whole, hardware+software.

'Better' is up to the buyers of the software to decide.  

But anyway, advances in hardware do drive advances in software,
particularly in games.  Obviously, the more the hardware can do, the more
software designers will exploit it (if they think they can make money
doing so).

Isn't that more to do with the hardware side?  In that Macs are designed
as a whole?  But perhaps we should stop this computer talk, as it's

Living in a country isn't like having a job.  The government may own
bits of land, but it isn't the owner of the right to live in that
country in the same way as the company is the owner of the right to say
who shall and shall not work for it.

See posts now coming from others on this, esp John Clark's re. the

But my point stands: that sort of thing may be morally wrong, nasty, etc.,
but it's not coercion, and it doesn't stop progress as a whole (not as
much as coercive government measures to stop it do - precisely because
they are coercive and unjust in the strict sense).

There are physical limits to stealth capability. Any "Stealth" vehicle
can still be seen by radar from a certain range of angles. A stealthed
vehicle is designed so that the large majority of angles at which radar
is likely to hit it at are such that they are reflected in a direction
different from that which it came from. This is passive stealth, which
if maximized, is usually hard to detect. Incidentally, the flying saucer
is the most stealthy shape useful in a flying vehicle.

Active stealth, which can more effectively hide a vehicle from detection
equipment designed for a specific range of emanations,  will require the
use of electrical, magnetic, or gravitational fields, all of which are
capable of being detected by additional specialized gear.

Remember, even in Star Trek, they were able to eventually develop a
countermeasure detection capability to the Klingon cloaking device.

The most effective possibility is materials which absorb as much
incoming radiation as possible. Some such materials are used today to a
limited extent for radar absorption, but are only effective in absorbing
diffused radar. The main beam reflection must still be redirected. It
cannot all be absorbed. Even if fully absorptive materials are
developed, it will then be possible to detect vehicles by the absence of
background radiation, that which is being absorbed by the vehicle.

The Roswell incident was supposedly due to some sort of on board
explosion, a malfunction. Given that machines always do break down no
matter who builds them, it is not unreasonable that a vehicle would
break down after an interstellar flight and entering our atmosphere. Man
made air vehicles have always had maintenance requirements of between
20-100 man hours per flight hour. THe more cutting edge ones always had
higher maintenance requirements, with the exception of some of our new
military planes like the F-22, but vehicles like the space shuttle and
the stealth bomber are still way up above the top of the range.

I once used this to debunk some abduction nuts. They were claiming that
1 out of every 40 people have had abduction experiences. Doing a
utilization analysis of this figure relative to the populations of the
US and the world, I was able to come up with  figures showing that we
should be experiencing between 1-12 UFO crashes per YEAR in order to
support the size fleet required to abduct one in 40 people. Given this,
we should statistically have seen at least several such crashes in
highly populated areas that would have been witnessed by thousands of
people.

As for your assertion of any visitors not being detected, this goes
against logic. Given that some group, corporation, or government on
another planet would have shelled out billions if not trillions of
EBE-bucks for such an expedition, the idea that they would not try to
wring out the maximum PR, scientific, or economic value from that
investment is ludicrous.

1) hardware advances are expanding faster than OS advances. Evidence:
Prices for then year standard configurations are lower, allowing one to
buy more than the minimum necessary for even the "bloated" new system.

2)Granted bloat is a problem, and the fact that so many businesses are
not upgrading their systems as fast as MS thought they would is causing
them to make some changes in their priorities for their newer versions
yet to come out. However, much of the bloat is unavoidable as new
systems need to be able to be compatible with all of the older versions,
etc., so as time goes on, there are more and more filters, links, calls,
etc. that an OS must handle.

3)the base PC systems offered by the big names that many people buy
because they are so affordable are absolute crap. They are extremely
detuned versions, like HP's initial pentium offering of a 75MHz system
with only 8 megs of ram, when responsible people were using a minimum of
100 MHz chips to run Win95.

It really shouldn't matter how long it takes Win95 to start up. For
starters, it still starts faster than a Mac, and secondly, if you had
sufficient RAM it actually starts faster than Win 3.1 (its 32 bits mean
that its processing twice as much information as well). THirdly and
finally, what IS important is how fast applications run on the OS, and I
can say that any application will run faster on 95 than on 3.1 (because
the same version of Word, for example is 16 bits, it will run
approximately twice as fast on a 32 bit OS as on a 16 bit OS.

Also, if you are running on an ISA bus, it is no wonder, as the ISA bus
was not built to handle 32 bit processing.

As I recall, the government can revoke your drivers license, pilots
license, as well as many other "licenses" to practice simple tasks if
you refuse to accede to their authroity to demand you take their piss,
blood or breath tests. THey can even judge you impaired if you "fail" a
simple physical dexterity test (a freind of mine who has an inner ear
impairment has lost her license on site over a dozen times in the last 6
years. If thats not harassment, I don't know what is). Corporations do
not have the same authority.

ALso, if you are an employee and are not an operating owner or partner
in the firm, you have no vested interest in the company, so if you don't
conform to their standards, they have every right to ask you to leave.
You are not owed a job.

As for the gas station monopolist, those are the breaks. If the gas
station owners did not utilize public opinion to force a curtailment or
accomodation, its their own damn fault. I have seen numerous communities
across the country successfully fight big corporations like Walmart and
Costco who wanted to come into their communities.

My own town here just lost such a battle due to sheer stupidity. They
had succeeded in keeping Costco out last year, but this year, Walmart
dug up an old plan permit without an expiration date in the city records
for the property they want to build on. They bought the permit from the
guy who received it, and are now going to build a store. The local
yokels were stupid in that they 1) didn't have expiration dates on
building permits, and 2) they didn't buy that permit from the owner
first, and 3) didn't pass an ordinance mandating a maximum square
footage any retail or wholesale space can operate on.

For those of you in foreign countries where Walmart and Costco have not
spread the gospel of "everything for less", they are a chain of stores
that typically cover at least several football fields in indoor area,
you need a map to get around in, and can find just about anything you
could possibly need at typcially less than half the price you will find
anywhere else. Also, unlike most other retail operations, employees have
an active program of freindliness and helpfulness (I think its something
they put in the water) that can be disconcerting to begin with, but once
you get used to it, you start to resent the rude way you are treated
anywhere else.

Note: This is probably why EuroDisney is so unpopular....its like an
alien planet to be treated like a human being rather than a number in a
socialist "paradise".

I'm not sure that your low end number is literally true. I'm going to 
visit my local F.O.B pretty soon, and I'll try to get their numbers 
for the low end. It may (in fact, I expect it will) depend on the 
timescale you measure.

Bzzzt! Have you further considered that that's because they're absurdly 
specified and designed, by political and pocket-lining 
creatures? You do know the story of the B-1 and of F-111s, right?
To take the latter example, suppose I insisted on fielding a full 
complement of F-111s (the B variant, I think) fully loaded with Phoenix 
on an aircraft carrier. You're going to have hella high maintenance
if you really want to keep everything flying; in fact the carrier may
never be the same, either:). Those tubs land *hard*.

MTBF very much depends on how rich you are, how carefree you are (i.e. 
"what's a failure?"), and how superior your tech is to the requirements. 
I suspect strongly that the maint-to-flight hours ratio (whatever that's 
called in aero, I forget) is, too. 

The long term data isn't in for things like composites and the Zoche 
turbo diesel, but I suspect they, or what comes after them, will 
start stretching those numbers out into the sub-1 range.

Ah, but why is this a given at all? And who says they'd derive any 
benefit from being seen? How can you (or Hara Ra) be sure you know 
what their payoff matrix is for be3ing seen? What if their motto 
really is "Primum non nocere (at least at first...)"?

And this is how Rockefeller made his money??? It sounds like a wonderful

them to where they're sky high.

The only crime Microsoft and Intel have committed is in being successful,
a peculiar sin for a Extropian. Imagine the screaming we would hear if Apple 
had won and had "unfairly" crushed Microsoft. Apple would not only be king of 
software but of hardware too. For some reason people love to pick on a leader, 
when Netscape clearly had the best software everybody dumped on the company,
now that Microsoft has started to catch they get the black hat. 
             
It's true that if you were starting from scratch lots of people could make a 
more consistent, more elegant, system than Wintel, but Microsoft and Intel 
didn't have that luxury. Everything they made had to be compatible with 
everything they made before, this imposes a severe burden, but a burden the 
most popular operating system in the world MUST bear. If the Many Worlds 
Interpretation is correct, I predict that on nearly all those worlds people 
are complaining that the most popular operating system is an ugly mess, 
a inelegant hodgepodge of kludges. Such is the fate of things that are not 
designed all at once but evolve and grow, things like English with it's weird 
spelling, or biological organisms for that matter.

It's in the nature of things that standards are resistant to change, but 
that's OK because that is exactly the way a standards should be. The lack 
of popularity of the Apple or Next or Bee or whatever operating system  is 
not an example of market failure  because in the context of the real world 
they are in fact inferior system.  If everything else was equal they  would
be better than Wintel  but everything else is not equal. These systems have 
some small technical advantages but that is countered by enormous practical 
disadvantages, they will not operate on the type  of computer most people 
have and it will not run billions of dollars worth of popular software that 
took thousands of man years to write.  It's perfectly valid to take such 
things into account when deciding what system is really superior.  When a 
standard is set it's just not worth going to a new one unless you get an 
astronomical improvement. The market has decided that the Apple or Next or 
Bee is not a huge advance of that type. Maybe the market is wrong but I know
it has a better understanding of such things than a bunch of hack politicians.

I'm not sure what you mean by 'the issue', and I hesitate to project 
too broadly what I think that Richter thinks based on such a short 
quote by him.  Much of his work was in the visual realm (painting), 
and I have not yet had the opportunity to read much of his writing.

Again, I'm not sure what you mean by 'what they say', and your use of 
the term 'enemy' seems to cast anyone who does not agree with you as 
someone who is somehow against you personally.  I think that this 
approach to dialogue or debate is one of the facets of ideology that 
drove me away from those particular systems of thought--I might relate 
to the actual system, but I don't find the conflict created by 
statements such as the above productive to the kinds of exploration I 
favor.

Quite.  If  Velikovsky had suggested that Venus is the biblical Hell, would
its observed high temperature provide `confirmation' for this great
scientific notion?  Would anyone sensible be righteously shocked if Dr
Sagan had refused to `give credit' to the Hell theory?

RAW is an amusing gadfly, but taking his `multi-disciplinary' gags
seriously (even when he does himself) is all too often a recipe for...
cross-sterilization.

The first personalization in this discussion was yours above, not mine.
I have said many times, loudly, that I don't and never will give a damn
about the personalities involved in a rational discussion, and my
record on that is very clear.  I am responding to the words printed,
and only those.  I merely suggest that when someone says he is opposed
to ideology, that we ought to believe that he is opposed to ideology,
not that we misunderstand him.  To me, that very statement itself is
evidence that I am attacking the words, not the man.

The word "enemy" is simply the word that fits the structure of the
sentence I chose, and it means precisely what the dictionary says it
means, not what you might psychologize about my motives.  Personally,
I value quite highly those who disagree with me--especially those
capable of doing so with rational argument.

I was going to say 'what if all people are enhanced?' but then I realised
that if we increase the intelligence of everyone by 10%, Gaussian
distribution still remains as the 'norm' (which we could then consider
'Gaussian human') and those who are peaking would either become Gaussian, or
enhance themselves further.

I think the term is fits, and it isn't easily used as an insult.

Microsoft is not evil nor is it a monopoly, here's why:

It's more extropian...

The purpose of the Network Computer (NC) movement is to recentralise
computing, to recentralise the power... the whole idea of centralised power
should send a shiver down any extropians back.

However, if you take a trip to Microsoft Research you'll find millions of
pounds being spent on research into distributed Operating Systems.
 Microsoft's distributed OS is called MS Millennium (this gives them a
thousand year period in which to release it).  The new OS offers complete
distribution of power.  As long as you are running the OS, you are a part of
a 'pool' of computing resources.  You may only have an average Pentium, but
if you want more power, take it from the resource pool.

Bill Gates has also very much set his aim on distributing power.  He believes
giving all people the ability to create and communicate.

Microsoft is not and never will be a monopoly...

Microsoft is not a monopoly.  They may dominate the current computer market,
but the current computer market is absolutely *nothing* compared to the
potential market waiting for anyone who wants it.  (That'll be me)...

Microsoft don't have original ideas, but who cares...

Microsoft may steal all it's ideas from the minds of young Computer
Scientists while they sleep.  But if it weren't for Microsoft who else would
actually use these ideas.  Look at Xerox, Xerox PARC invented the mouse, the
monitor, the GUI, the hard drive, the laser printer and they didn't do a
thing with them (please note that anything invented by Xerox PARC was also in
production at the MIT Media Labs at the exact same time).  Apple stole one
good idea, and them became so full of themselves the forgot what innovation
is!

If you want to see upcoming MS products take a trip to the MIT Media Labs
(http://www.media.mit.edu), where all Bills ideas come from.  If you want to
see products that could wipe Microsoft off the face of the earth but wont,
visit Xerox PARC (http://parc.xerox.com).

Microsoft will destroy itself...

If MS Windows becomes the only OS, it will come with the hardware, eventually
Microsoft will have no reason to sell it and will hand it over to become an
open standard (by which time it will just be a set of simple objects anyway).
 MS may well dominate the rest of the software market, but this will mean
nothing with the advent of speech recognition and AI.  There will be a point
when you don't buy software, you just tell your computer what to do.

Bill Gates knows this and is setting himself up to become a Content provider.
 However, as media creation tools become more abundant and Media independence
allows information to be stored in one medium and viewed in any, media
companies will fall and information will be collected by those who 'happen to
be there'.  Bill Gates will retire... and everyone will be happy.

And that's all folks...

Excellent post!  I would also add that when people whinge about
'marketing' they forget that included in the price they pay is how much
it cost the company to bring the product to their attention and make it
easy to buy. In fact, when you hear those stories about the poor widdle
company that had a great product but got beaten by the bastards that had
better marketing, what is being blanked out is that, since advertising is
part of the company's job and part of what you actually pay for, the
poor widdle company was just crap at doing its job.

i.e. the physical or conceptual item bought may have been ok, so the
poor widdle company did half their job well, but they didn't do the
other half very well: making it easy for you to buy it, so you knew it
was available and easy to buy when you needed it.

     A short time ago, I was wandering through the web, and happened to
come across a description of Extropianism. Reading though it, I became
aware that this was something that fit in nicely with my developing
belief structure. After a bit of looking around, I came across the
mailing list, and joined.
     Since that time, I have been sitting here enjoying the view,
listening to the conversations, and feeling the breeze. Now, I still
enjoy the view, and still listen to the conversations, but the wind up
here is getting a little much.
    It seems that I am faced with a choice. Either I can step up the
pace of my self-generation, or I can shave my head to reduce the drag.
The ideas on this list seem to be thrown out fast and furious, and for
someone with little over the 'traditional' high school education (aside
from some specialized industry courses), there is a lot passing by just
above my level.
    Basically, what I am wondering is what areas/books would some of you
consider mandatory reading to help one become a 'whole' person? What are
some of your favorite books? Are there any books you would consider
fundamental introductions to various topics, or laying essential
groundwork?
    I am aware that these are highly individual questions, but I am
trying to get a grasp on what pieces I am missing.

The whole debate of UFO's generally misses the important question, and The 
Question is not 'Have we been visited by an extraterrestrial civilization?' 
but 'Why have we been visited by extraterrestrial civilizations?'  I find 
debunkers amusing in the fact that they seem so dedicated to disproving 
something akin to spending your life trying to disprove the existence of 
'God'.  'We' send out probes to other planets...why wouldn't another 
planet's intelligent life?  Believe it or don't, but do not worry about it 
until the fanatic believers get enough political power to start passing and 
enforcing laws that affect your life (as religious fanatics do).

First, the Air Force's 'mogul' explanation's biggest problem for me is the 
amount of material found (supposedly scattered for over a quarter of a 
mile).  I've seen photo's of the 'mogul' balloons and 'there just ain't 
enough stuff there to be noticeable' for that area (especially after being 
blown around in a thunderstorm).  The largest component by far is the 
balloon itself.  Even the ranch hand would know balloon material was not 
some 'unknown' metallic structure.  The Air Force personnel certainly 
would.

Second, the Air Force has yet to explain the extreme security measures it 
took to recover and dispose of this 'balloon'.  Even if it was a top secret 
spy device a simple gathering of the wreckage of a 'weather balloon' and an 
embarrassing apology for releasing a false report ('We have recovered a 
flying saucer') would have sufficed.  Besides, if it WAS a top secret 
spying device why wasn't the Air Force actively searching for it?

Third,  if the 'cover up' was an attempt to scare the Soviet Union into 
believing we DID have a 'flying saucer' and could use the recovered 
technology to blow them off the face of the earth then THAT should be the 
explanation.  Reagan's SDI project has already been admitted as such for 
the most part.  But then, that explanation WOULD be an admittance of 'We 
planted the material there' and 'Yes Virginia, the Government DOES lie to 
you...'.

Fourth.  Now to 'Why?'.  I can currently think of 4 reasons.

a)  Pure curiosity.
b)  Economics.
c)  Security.
d)  Survival.

Both a and b pose no threat to us.  c has the consequences of either 'THEY 
would try and sabotage our technology so we could not threaten THEM' or 
'THEY want to help us advance and become allies against some third party 
civilization ('This Island Earth', written in the 1950's covered this.  The 
movie was a joke...read the book.  Jack McDevitt's 'The Engines of God' has 
another interesting concept.).  d is double edged too.  THEY could be 
looking for suitable new colony locations or just for a 'lifeboat' planet 
in an emergency.

The abduction claims are much harder for me to believe.  These 'aliens' 
want to go unnoticed so they take 'specimens' and 'torture' them and 
release them back into the pack.  Though an alien thought process may 
conceive of this as logical, I sure don't.

One last thing to ponder.  HOW?  I don't think we currently have the 
technology or knowledge to grasp this.  I am of the belief that travel 
between solar systems will require a mastery of the Unified Field. 
 Something along the line of being able to use AND control gravity to fold 
time and space.

Just scrambled thoughts while trying to wake up.

We saw "Contact" last night and I HIGHLY recommend it.  The film is actually
an improvement on the book and brings out even better than Sagan did in his
novel the central themes of science, faith and the primal drive for "contact"
with the universe.  I am very hopeful that this film will plant some good
popular memes about skepticism and the value of science.

Dear Admiral Gayler,                      22 April 1997                                 22 April 1995


    Thank you so much for speaking with me when I telephoned you from Bristol,
England at your home in Alexandria a few weeks or so back.  I really enjoyed
our conversation so much -- a dream come true; for me anyway!


    [I enclose some papers to give you some idea as to 'who I am and where I'm
at' right now; I'm happy to answer any enquiries you may have about me and my
activities.  I promise to try not to inveigle you into my problems over here.
<smile>]


    A word on methodology: my approach to problem-solving is basically that of
Karl Popper; and more particularly, Imre Lakatos' proposals in his "The
Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes" (Cambridge, [1978]).  These are
among the most powerful and effective instruments of intellectual weaponry I
know of.  I enclose Bryan Magee's wonderful little book "Popper" as a gift from
me to you; and to 'repay forward' the work you've done already for peace with
freedom.

    [ I have to admit to sometimes 'speaking through quotations': if others say
what I want said better than I can say it, 'let them fly'! ]


    I *don't* start from the problems of the _specific means of warfare_,
important though these are (especially nuclear weapons).  With Heisenberg, I
don't think these are the basic -- or even the worst -- problem:  My primary
concern is with 'The Causes of War' (see Geoffrey Blainey's classic academic
text of this name, publ. Sun Books, Melbourne). Blainey's view (following
analysis of several hundred wars from 1700 to 1971) amounts to the conclusion
that wars arise as a result of faulty intelligence evaluations of one's own or
the other side's interests, aims, strengths and will to fight; wars "usually
begin when two [or more] nations disagree on their relative strength, and wars
usually cease when the fighting nations agree on their relative strength."

    And I think the problems of disarmament can actually be more readily
resolved long-term by something like the twelve-track strategy I outline here,
with the tracks running separately yet simultaneously, more or less in parallel
(an Integrated Operational Plan for worldwide peace with freedom, if you
like!).  Such a plan incorporates specific advances to general nuclear
disarmament, while (hopefully) avoiding the dangers of open-ended non-nuclear
warfare.  Its central focus is upon what we're fighting for -- and against --
and the means by which we fight; and upon the human and material costs.

    Still, there are indeed 'no final moves'!

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

TITLE: "William Hood on war"

TEXT:  "Like war, spying is a dirty business.  Shed of its alleged glory, a
soldier's job is to kill.  Peel away the claptrap of espionage and the spy's
job is to betray trust.  The only justification a soldier or a spy can have is
the moral worth of the cause he represents."

    William Hood (James Jesus Angleton's deputy); 'Mole' p. 11;  publ.
Weidenfeld's [1982].

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------


[01] TITLE: 'Values as the expression of the central order'

TEXT:  'The problem of values is nothing but the problems of our acts, goals
and morals.  It concerns the compass by which we must steer our ship if we  
are to set a true course through life. The compass itself has been given  
different names by various religions and philosophies ... but I have a clear
impression that all such formulations try to express man's relatedness to a
central order.   In the final analysis the central order, or the 'One' as it
used to be called with which we commune in the language of religion, must win
out....

  If we ask Western man what is good, what is worth striving for and what has
to be rejected, we shall find time and again, that his answers reflect the
ethical norms of Christianity even when he has long since lost all touch with
christian images and parables. If the magnetic force which has guided this
particular compass - and what  else was its source but the central order? -
should ever become extinguished, terrible things may happen to mankind, far
more terrible even than  concentration camps and atom bombs.'

    Werner Heisenberg, [1971] 'Physics and beyond: encounters and
conversations', published by George Allen and Unwin, London.


    Thorpe is emphatic in asserting that we must never forget that such a
conclusion must on no account be attributed solely to the Western insights
stemming from the Christian revelation; he gives the following Admonitions as a
further example, drawn from the Amerindian tribe of the Shawnees (who were
dispossessed of their Oklahoma lands in 1839).


TITLE: The Shawnee Admonitions:

TEXT: (1)  "Do not kill or injure your neigbour, for it is not him you injure,
you injure yourself."

      (2)  "Do not wrong or hate your neighbour, for it is not him that you
wrong, you wrong yourself.  Moneto, the Supreme Being. loves him also as she
loves you."

  Quoted from W.H. Thorpe, 'Purpose in a World of Chance' Oxford [1978].


    This is clearly related via the central order to the (negative) Judaic
injunction not to do unto one's neighbour that which one would not wish to
befall one's self.  My own -- perhaps agnostic -- orientation is nearer Taoism;
but these ethical principles are capable of reformulation for most spiritual --
and even humanistic or atheistic -- contexts.

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------


[02] TITLE: "The Role of the Sciences"

TEXT:  I am constantly reminded of the role of the Newtonian foundations in
Kantian ethics.  I do think that the near-destruction of 'Classical Physics'
was a tragedy that broke the self-confident -- Kantian -- foundations of 19th
Century liberal optimism and rational expectations of a better future, and
further opened the door to the barbarism of Prussian militarism, aggressive
racial nationalism, Marxism and National Socialism in the 20th Century.

    I've spent much of the last 10 years working on a Scentific Research
Programme which is founded on an extended Classical Mechanics, which replaces
SR/GR and QM with an intelligible and accurate integrated Scientific Research
Programme -- Relational Mechanics -- which can be stated on a sheet of A4
paper.  Here's the 'Core Programme' of Relational Mechanics:  There's an
accompanying 120K file which closely argues for the programme on a positive
'balance-sheet' heuristic of clarity, simplicity and accuracy in description,
explanation and prediction.


TITLE: A Scientific Research Programme of Relational Mechanics

TEXT: The basis of Relational Mechanics is the single principle, that the laws
of physics have the same form in all frames of reference in uniform
translation, and are the same everywhere. It extends Classical Mechanics into
the realms presently occupied by Special and General Relativity and Quantum
Mechanics.

 Dimensional Analysis of Measure Ratios: Mass = M.  Length = L.  Time = T.

 [1] MATTER IN INFINITE SPACE: Material objects having extension exist in a
space which is without intrinsic properties, and which exists to infinity in
every direction.

 [2] UNIFORM TIME WITH UNIVERSAL SIMULTANEITY: The elapsing of time is uniform
and unidirectionally forward, with an instantaneous present time which occurs
at the same time - simultaneously - everywhere.  Signal intervals can be
calculated to achieve corrected accurate predictive and retrodictive data.

 [3] EQUIVALENT GALILEAN RELATIVITY: All forces, material coordinate positions
and velocities are relational; and all co-ordinate systems or frames of
reference in uniform motion relative to one another are Galileian systems.
There is no privileged or "absolute" reference frame.  There is full addition
of velocities across co-ordinate systems or reference frames.

 [4] GENERALIZATION OF THE LAWS OF MECHANICS: All the laws of mechanics have
the same form in every inertial frame of reference or coordinate system.

 [5] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: INERTIA: The stasis or movement of anything does not
change unless and until a force acts upon it.

 [6] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: ACTION: A change in movement of anything is
proportional to the force acting upon it, and is made in the direction of the
force which acts upon it.  (f = ma = ML/T^2; Force = mass times acceleration).

 [7] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: REACTION: For every action, there is an equal
reaction in the opposite direction.  (f1 = -f2).

 [8] RELATIONAL GRAVITATIONAL FORCE: The relational gravitational attraction
between massy objects is proportional to the sum of their masses, and is
proportional to the inverse square of the distance between their centres of
mass.  If gravitational force should prove to be propagated at a finite rate,
and objects be moving radially relative to each other, then the additional
velocity-dependent modification for propagated spherical forces, Woldemar
Voight's [1887] equations (later known as "Lorentz Transformations") would be
required, as a first approximation to non-linear equations for delayed
interaction over a distance.

 [9] RELATIONAL ELECTRIC FORCE: The relational electric attraction or repulsion
between charged objects is inverse-square proportional to the distance between
them.  If electric force proves to be propagated at a finite rate, and objects
be moving relative to each other, then the additional velocity-dependent
modification for propagated spherical forces, Woldemar Voight's [1887]
equations (later known as "Lorentz Transformations") is required, as a first
approximation to non-linear equations for delayed interaction over a distance.

    Coulomb's Law and Voight's equations yield Maxwell's equations without
further assumptions, as proved by Leigh Page, Yale Professor of Mathematical
Physics [1912] and [1913].

No. 11/12, pp. 553 to 560, November/December [1981].

 Leigh Page, Yale University, [1912] and [1913].

 [10] RELATIONAL MAGNETIC FORCE: The relational magnetic attraction or
repulsion between north and south magnets is inverse-square proportional to the
distance between them.  If magnetic force proves to be propagated at a finite
rate, and objects be moving radially relative to each other, then the
additional velocity-dependent modification for propagated spherical forces,
Woldemar Voight's [1887] equations (later known as "Lorentz Transformations")
would be required, as a first approximation to non-linear equations for delayed
interaction over a distance.

    The lines of magnetic force follow from the force interactions described by
Poisson's equations.

 R.A. Waldron, "Electric Forces", The Radio and Electronic Engineer, Vol.  51
No. 11/12, pp. 553 to 560, November/December [1981].

 [11] QUANTIZED MASS AND ENERGY VALUE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION:
Electromagnetic structures which are radiated and absorbed ('photons') have
intrinsic mass, and this mass occurs in in multiples of a minimum mass.  This
mass, when in linear translation and with up to three axes of classical
rotation, ('spins') as well as three degrees of vibration, gives rise to
quantum effects.  Such electromagnetic structures ('photons') are made from the
same material as other forms of matter - negatively charged microparticles
(which we can call electrinos); positively-charged microparticles, (which we
may call positrinos).  There are also neutral microparticles, (presently called
neutrinos).

 In free space the velocity of emittance of a radiated photon _relative to its
source_ is constant at L/T = 299,792.485 + or - .0012 km/second.

 E = hv, where E is the energy value of the photon; v is its frequency; and h
is Planck's constant, which has the measure-ratio of ML^2/T, and is presently
calculated as 6.6262 x 10^-34 Joules/second.  There is accordingly a lower as
well as an upper limit to photon size.  Relevant equations may be found in R.A.
Waldron, [1977] and [1982].

 These quantized electromagnetic structures, in conjunction with Beckmann's
[1987] theory of electron orbits, provide the basis for developing the
quantized dynamics of particle systems, including atoms and molecules.

 [12] CONSERVATION LAWS: There is full conservation of mass; full conservation
of energy over time; and full conservation of momentum.  Mass is invariant with
respect to relative velocities, as are length and time.

       It may assist understanding to think about RM like this:

[A] Take Classical Mechanics: (Start with T.W.B. Kibble's fine text):
[B] Add relational electric and magnetic and gravitational forces:
[C] Add a velocity of force propagation ('c'), which delays far-action:
[D] Add a full ballistic ('particle' or 'photon') theory of EM radiation.

[03] TITLE: "The Role of Philosopy in the Furtherance of Open Societies"

    Popper's "The Open Society and Its Enemies" is a basic text, as is his
[1994] "The Myth Of the Framework."  Tarski's Correspondence theory of truth is
central; and Lakatos and Musgrave [1976] is also 'essential reading', as is
John Hospers' fine book 'An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis.  And even
David Carradine's fine book 'The Spirit of Shaolin' <smiles>.

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

[04] TITLE: "The Role of the Arts"

TEXT: "They were wrong, and they will always be wrong, those prophets who say
Art will degenerate, will exhaust all conceivable forms, will die.  It is we
who will die; Art will remain.  And shall we -- before we perish -- manage to
understand all its facets and all its purposes?

    Not everything has a name.  Some things lead us into a realm beyond words. 
Art thaws even the frozen, darkened soul, opening it to lofty spiritual
experience.  Through Art we are sometimes sent -- indistinctly, briefly --
revelations not to be achieved by rational thought.

    It is like that small mirror in the fairy-tales -- you glance in it, and
what you see is not yourself: for an instant, you glimpse the Inaccessible,
where no horse or magic carpet can take you.  And the soul cries out for it..."

    From 'One Word of Truth...' -- The Nobel Speech on Literature; by Alexander
Solzhenitsyn:  BBC External Services Translation, Publ. The Bodley Head [1972]

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

[05] TITLE: "Realizing Human Potential"

TEXT:  I'm working intermittently on a -- shareware -- personal computer
programme which offers some of the benefits of the Human Potential methods,
inexpensively, on a more widespread basis.  There is quite a lot of interest in
such technologies nowadays.  The work of LTC Jim Channon's 'First Earth
Battalion Foundation' is also well worth a look; as is the generality of work
done on the realization of Human Potential described in Pearson & Shaw's book
"Life Extension -- A Practical Scientific Approach"; and "MegaBrain" by Michael
Hutchison.  [Also Jose Silva's 'Silva Mind Control Method.']

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

[06] TITLE: "The Open Society and its Enemies"

TEXT: Popper's work, again; I've developed a simple programme -- Democratic
Agorism -- which aims to provide both assessment benchmarks and practical
measures to achieve more fully free and open societies worldwide.  And Open
Societies don't war with each other...


                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

[07] TITLE: "Wars of Ideas; Wars on Ideas"

TEXT:  As Popper says (The Myth Of The Framework), civilization really started
with the invention of swords.  Civilized and intelligent men then saw that
fighting with words makes better sense, with bad ideas dying instead of people.

    So I support wars of ideas waged on behalf of the ideas of the Open
Society, backed with:

    Triple-track diplomacy (positive, negative and covert-action);

    Psychological warfare (viz. Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger's classic text of
that name: did you ever meet him?);

    Special Forces (viz. "Swords of Lightning" by Terry White; publ. Brassey's,
[1992];

    Reactive 'Antiweaponry' Defences (PGMs, conventional antiballistic missile
systems -- viz. the _original_ "High Frontier" ideas in Dan Graham's Heritage
Foundation Project Book of that name [1982], not the hyped-up SDI stuff that
dissipated the money and the political support which could have built High
Frontier's Layered Defense proposals.  

    I would ask you to please consider the "High Frontier" proposals
independently of your experience of Dan Graham:  I was impressed by the way he
welcomed a visiting Soviet journalist to a High Frontier presentation in
London, and emphasised how the US and the USSR could work together to block
nuclear attack.  You and he do _seem_ to share many ideals, while differing
profoundly over means.  And you're both feisty and combative people!

    (Some of our MoD and conservative people were averse to Strategic Defense
ideas because they feared the nullification of Britain's 'independent
deterrent':  yet our Trident systems rely on American know-how for accuracy;
and I'll not soon forget my Royal Navy friend Peter McManus -- later a 'Top
Gun' trainer 'on loan' to RAF Valley in the late Sixties -- telling me of the
terse reply they were given at their fighter-bomber mission briefing, when
someone asked how they were supposed to get 'back home' again, when the nuclear
targets were at the Scimitar's limits of range: "What do you think there will
be to come home to"?).


    The aim of this sort of twelve-part Integrated Operational Plan should be
to fight and win the war of ideas *peacefully* for the Open Societies,
transforming enemies into friends wherever this may be possible.

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

[08] TITLE: "Horizontal Spontanous Social Orders"

TEXT:  My preference is for the sorts of damage-resistant, adaptive and
resilient 'horizontal' free and equalitarian social orders envisioned by (most
of) the Lockean founders of the American Republic. (If a quiet patriotism is
the love of the _idea_ of a country, I'm certainly a North American!  I'm
applying for political refugee status in Canada right now -- see attached
document).


[09] TITLE: "Globalized Free Communications Networks"

    Lots of Internets, with lots of alternative telecomms providers! 
Spontaneous orders then form from the free chices made by the individual
telecommunicators.  David Andrews' book "The IRG Solution: Hierarchical
Incompetence and How To Overcome It" (Souvenir Press, [1984]) gives good
insights into these social processes.


                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

[10] TITLE: "The Role Of History"

TEXT: In 1944, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation ran this magazine
advertisement,showing a grim pilot, about to take on Zeros at twelve o'clock,
imagining this staccato message to his wife:-

    "I want to tell you what I'm fighting for.. it's you and our little house
and the job I had before... and the chance I had, the fighting chance, to go
ahead on my own.  That's what all of us want out here... to win this war... to
get home... To go back to living our lives in a land -- and a world -- where
*every* man is free to grow as great as he's a mind to be... where every man
has an *unlimited* opportunity to be useful to himself and his fellow men...
Tell 'em we'll be back... nothing can stop us... And tell 'em no matter what
they say, no matter what they do... to stay *free*.. to keep America a land of
*individual freedom*! That's what we're fighting for... That's what we're
willing to die for... That's the America we want when we come home."

    ...............


    "We had better figure out what happened if we expect any army,  conscript
or volunteer,  to remember what it's fighting for." - Michael Levin

 (Policy Review: Publ. The Heritage Foundation; Fall, 1983).


                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

[11] TITLE: "WildFire Systems"

TEXT: By "WildFire Systems" I mean easily-propagated, decentralized,
'synergistic' and practical instantiations of free social innovations, which
replace existing faulty social practices with better, more mutually
advantageous relationships; e.g.

    [a] Offices of Open Network (like Leif Smith's in Colorado - I have a copy
of their interesting 60pp Operating Manual available).

    [b] Information Exchanges (like CIX here in England - runs under COSY)


    [c] Credit Unions (like Grameen Bank and North American CUs)


    [d] Local Exchange Trading Systems (to 'kickstart' economic activity where
people have little or no money).  Start-up books are available.


    [e] WishCraft Centres:  Non-injurious 'wishes' are described on record
cards or computer record entries in this simple format:

    TITLE: <five or six words>;
    TEXT: 50 to 100 word description;
    CONTACT: preferred contact mode or address

    Participants then work to realize the wishes for each other.

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

[12] TITLE: "The Role Of Mythologies"

    Science fiction has been aptly described as 'The Mythology of the 20th (and
21st) Century.  Foremost among my favourites are Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'
(in which coercion is the main evil, and individual free will is the foundation
of the principal virtues).  And Cordwainer Smith's incomparable stories (Dr.
Paul Linebarger's nom de plume)

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------


    I hope you find these ideas worthy of your consideration and further
discussion;  I'm really looking forward to hearing from you!  I'm entirely
happy for you to discuss all this with others if you think it's worthwhile.  I
have no secrets from the Puzzle Palace!! <smile>



    All Best Wishes,

I use the term "ideologue" as derogatory because it connotes for me
people who are far more sure of their beliefs than a rational person
should be.  I also agree with Kathyrn that thinking in terms of
"enemy" is correlated with ideologues, not to their credit.

There is interesting data on brain size that seems to show its

A true anarcho-libertarian society wouldn't have corporations, since
they are products of the state, chartered and protected by them. True
capitalism is one without corporations. Abolish the laws that establish
corporations and even though you may still get big powerful companies,
its owners would be directly responsible for their actions.

I meant to add the following to my e-mail, but I forgot:

I have a problem with the very idea that *we* are labelling *them*.  If
history serves us well, they will find any label we put upon them as an
insult and will finally choose a suitable name for themselves, or _more
likely_ for us.

As an individualist, i refuse to label myself...

I only pick on 'successful' companies if they have gained their success 
in unscrupulous and anti-competitive ways, as Microsoft has.
For sure Apple has made a bunch of crummie business mistakes.  Not least 
of which was refusing to allow clones to enter the market until 
recently.  Apple has been quite anti-competitive in its treatment of the 
clone vendors.  Thus Power Computing will start building Wintel 
machines. This in turn has caused Apple's stock to plummet.  Despite the 
fact that the Mac platform is great, Apple is getting exactly what they 
deserve.

You make a very good point.  And if I were to buy a new computer today 
it would be Wintel for the exact reasons you specify.  My only 
contention, is they have become the de-facto standard by stifling 
progress on many other fronts.  So the way I see it, Free-Market 
Economics is not necessarily best for technological progress - at least 
in the short-term.

Your observations are interesting and accurate.  The way John Clarke and 
yourself have presented it, Free-Market Economics seems to favor 
Marketing excellence over Technological superiority.

As an Extropian, this is disconcerting to say the least!

This is definity a great film!  I saw it last night, and haven't been 
able to stop feeling its effects on me.  This movie has intelligence and 
heart.  I kept thinking of the paper on Traversible Wormholes in issue 
#11 of Extropy.  

I will not suprised if this film wins the Oscar for Best Picture.

Very true. As I've said many times, Free-Market Economics is only second best, 
the best possible system would be to be lead by a king who never made mistakes 
and had all the values I do, in other words, make me king. To me this is 
blindly obvious but for some strange reason I've had considerable difficulty 
in convincing anybody else in the sublime beauty of this approach, so I must  
settle for The Market.

Thank you.  Even though your post (and perhaps my response) may trigger a 
holy war, an excellent common sense explanation of why anti-Microsoft 
bigots seem to not understand.

To expound:

Larry Ellison and Marc Andreeson are not the savior's of the 'computing for 
the little folk' as some fanatics would preach.  Ellison wants to control 
by forcing you to use what HE decides you can use.  If all the software is 
located on a central server then you only have available what the 
administrators want you to use.  Andreeson is just a kid (much akin to 
Gates) who saw an opportunity to take advantage of a new technology.  I'm 
sure most of you already know, but neither Andreeson nor any of his staff 
'invented' the 'browser' nor had anything to do with the development of the 
hypertext transport protocol.  Remember also that the hypertext markup 
language is just a subset of the much older Standard Generalized Markup 
Language.  Netscape is just another Microsoft wannabe.

Remember also that Apple stole the idea for the 'Mac' from Xerox (just as 
MS did) and that Microsoft was one of the first software companies to write 
for the Apple OS.  Oh yes, for those who may have forgotten....Apple DID 
steal it's BASIC from Microsoft, and originally ran the character based 
AppleDOS.

Ellison runs Oracle.  Oracle's biggest clients are mainframe and huge 
mini-computer shops.  Of course he would want you to give up independence 
to go back to centralized computer.  That's where he makes his living.

I remember when Win95 *FINALLY* came out (I beta tested it and remember 
calling it WinEVER...never mind the fact that some of the great 'new' 
things to *MAYBE* be in MemphisOS WERE in the original Win95 but were 
pulled (hard to believe the TCP/IP stack for Windows for Workgroups can do 
things Win95 still dreams of...or NT has been doing for years)). 
 Anyway....during this time the MacFanatics were proudly posting flyers 
that said 'Windows95.....Mac84'.  They thought this was a great slam. 
 Though that is essentially true the sad fact is that Mac97 is STILL Mac84. 
 Cooperative multitasking, lame AppleTalk, etc, etc.  At least MS saw the 
need for a REAL OS and developed NT, and moved into other areas as well.

Apple's problems stem from the fact that the founders saw the Apple as 
'everyman's computer'.  Then they followed the Dilbert Principle and 
promoted and hired the least competent to mangers with the most power, 
priced their 'everyman computer' into a range only the elite could afford 
and smugly sat back sure that Joe Blow would hock his first born to own one 
of their Big Brother killers.  They were so unsure of their ability they 
refused to even license a third party from making a clone (claims for 
quality control don't wash here as a simple clause about having Apple 
Certification and Apple not financially responsible for un-certified 
machines would suffice).

Sun Microsystems is Microsoft's current competition.  They have some great 
ideas, fantastic products, and more lethal lawyers than OJ.  (Yes, Sun DID 
sue a mom and pop shop to have them remove 'Java' from their logo...even 
though the logo had been there years before 'Java' was a glint in it's 
developer's eyes.  Yes, Sun won the case).  Unfortunately I see signs of 
'Dilbert' at Sun.

Microsoft indeed does NOT always develop the latest greatest advances, but 
they sure have supplied those with ability and confidence to do so.  Little 
Boy Blue comes along and develops something that is usable (operative word 
here...not necessarily bleeding edge orgasmic but USABLE) and MS sees a 
profit, they indeed try to buy it.  LBB has the financial backing to say no 
then he can do so and may end up making a good profit.  Of course, this 
leads MS to say 'OK, but we have programmers and billions in resources...' 
so MS just may put LBB out of business.

Microsoft then is an extropic borganism.  The main thing is to survive. 
 The most good for the most people.  Let the small civilizations to the 
research, if it's usable absorb and refine it.  Let them survive so you can 
profit from the distribution.  Competition is what keeps MS in the 
dominating position.

I do disagree with your Microsoft will destroy itself.  MS will dominate 
until Gates dies (I don't think he will retire).  The result will be as the 
Empire of Alexander the Great.

Now we're talking!  I couldn't agree more.  As an extropian, I'm for 
individual liberty/responsibility over corporate 'entity' 
liberty/protection.  If a large group of individuals want to form a huge 
company and amass huge fortunes in the process that's great and I'm all 
for that.  To give all of them protection under the Law, without they as 
individuals being accountable - is bullshit!

	It has been a long while since I have read, from start to finish,
"Infinity and the Mind" by Rudy Rucker.  I was, however, skimming through
it the other day, and I noticed what I think is a contradiction.  It is
located in my paperback version on p. 86, last paragraph.  That would be
chapter two, section 3, Infinitesimals and Surreal Numbers.

	"I would respond that omega is a _given_, an object of our
immediate pre-rational experience.  And to use the tools of symbolic logic
to investigate an _empirically_ existing phenomenon..."

It seems to me that he is at first asserting that the concept of omega
exists a priori.  He then goes on to speak of it further as an empirical
phenomenon, certainly in clear contradiction of the first statement.  Any
thoughts on this?  Could I be correct, or am I missing something in the
text?

Ha.ha..Your argument here makes me giggle.. In that case, you shouldn't 
mind the system <we're currently living in>!  Our current system of 
nations, armys, laws, bureaucrats and dictatorships have all evolved to 
their current state in a situation you have just advocated!

Curious.  Tell me how a small-time operator in 1919, when there was 
little or no access to telephones, radio, TV or big-town newspapers, 
would find the time take on the herculean task of mounting a public 
opinion campaign against Rockefeller?  He would surely go out of 
business in the process.

That is a very good question. 

I think the best way to be able to keep up with the tempo on this
list (and in the world in general) is to read widely (esp. in the
sciences) and try to see the big picture. 

More specifically, here are some books I conseder worth reading as a
start:

Kevin Kelly, Out of Control: the New Biology of Machines
(http://www.absolutvodka.com/5-0.html). About biology, artificial
life and how technology is becoming life-like. Quite broad, gives a
nice overview of many areas. 

K. Eric Drexler, Engines of Creation, Anchor Books, 1987, ISBN: 0385199732
(http://www.asiapac.com/EnginesOfCreation/) The classic popular book
about nanotechnology.

Marshall T. Savage, The Millennial Project : Colonizing the Galaxy in
Eight Easy Steps, Little Brown & Co, 1994, ISBN: 0316771635. Space
colonisation; I haven't read it yet but my friends recommend it and
the plan is interesting. 

Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene. Classic sociobiology and
evolutionary theory. 

Richard Feynman, The Feynman Lectures in Physics, Addison-Wesley
Probably the best introduction to physics ever written. Starts from
the basics and moves (in three volumes) to quantum physics. Very
clear, but may require acquiring some math on the way (I have a very
good book for that, Hgre Matematik fr Poeter by Tnis Tnisson, but
it is in Swedish).

Mind Children by Hans Moravec; the dramatic aspects of robotics, AI,
uploading and other information-mind tricks. May be superceded by his
new book. 

Infinite in All Directions by Freeman Dyson. A good explanation what
the humanism part of transhumanism stands for.

Of course.  But we're talking mythology here.  Bulb-headed aliens in

Hmm... limited-liability issues to one side (I don't know about you,
but it's easy for me to imagine corporations being replaced by unlimited
liability general partnerships like Lloyd's), where do you draw the
line between sewing circles and go clubs, on the one hand, and
corporations on the other?

It seems to me that a corporation is just a contractual agreement by
which a group of shareholders can own property jointly and make joint
contracts with other people. Is it joint ownership of property or
joint contracting that you disapprove of? If not that, then what?

Love to help out if I can...but all i can do Is give you my own opinion.

My education is perhaps similar to yours...(I've got an BS,and an MS but they
were in business...and I feel effectively useless)..and I work for a living
as a Truck Driver.  (owner operator).

However I since childhood I have been reading Science Fiction....and when I
was experienced enough to understand the difference I concentrated on the
"Hard" variety...

Check out any books you can find by,..... (remember...this is from memory
only...so some errors are probable)......

Vernor Vinge, Neal Stephenson, W.T. Quick, James Hogan,John Cramer,Larry
Niven, and several more  but can't remember their names

Read:
"Engines of Creation" and "Unbounding the Future" by Erick Drexler
"The Lucifer Principle" Howard Bloom



Use the net...go to websites of the Transhuman Alliance, the millenium
foundation, 
Home page of James Hogan, John Cramer, Linda Nagata, 

key words nanotechnology, Augmented Reality, Extropian, ....

This is but a bare smidgin...hope it helps a little.

Naww... we don't GOTTA do anything....there is a very large sector of our
population which is "Self Raised" so to speak....I seem to remember hearing
that white female illigitamate births is at 16% and rising...while that of
blacks is at 70% and holding stable...and all the dads are just wandering

But that wasn't my point...I'm a parent...hell I'm a grandparent...and over

be less of a reason for expansion.

And why are "Human beings a bad model"...I think we're doing pretty damn

au contrair.

There are several versions of "virtual reality" of which I am aware...one
"Augmented Reality" coupled with "Telepresence" would (and is..I'm sure) very
useful in the exploration of new physics..biology..astrophysics...etc.

And as far as threats and dangers?
    "As I walk thru the valley of the shadow of death...I shall fear no
evil..
           Because I'm the meanest SOB in the valley"

I'm sorry...It appears that you are fixated on classical pre-sentient,
pre-technological evolution...perhaps not such a good model
anymore....humanity is less and less subject to evolution...in fact the time
will come..may already have come when we can direct our own
development...(hmmmm ....isn't there a group somewhere on the net that talks
about that a lot...?...things like Boundless Expansion..?)

Lets see if I can hit this at a different angle..

Remember Maslow?  He of the hierachy of needs? (warmth,
food,..etc..etc...self actulazation)...we're talking about self actualization
here...if all my fundamental needs are seen too I can explore new
worlds...(for real or in cyberspace)...If a majority of a population feels
that way...the population will not increase so rapidly...may even stabilize
or decrease...

>You might also want to chose a better metaphor.  I find "Expanding into

picky...picky...picky...but ok...I grant you that.

What I was trying to so ineloquently illustrate is the notion that with
really advanced telepresence into cyberspace a civilization might be more
inwardly focused...if all their material needs are taken care of by
technology...if they no longer even have any material needs to speak of
(uploaded )...then cyberspace would definitely be the thing. And is there a
limit as to how far cyberspace can expand?  I can spend hours and hours just
surfing the net...and the net is still young..

Oh, criminy, I can't believe I'm dipping my foot into this. But as
long as all the spew from the commercial computing rags is going
to be washing up on the shores of the extropians list, I know from
experience that free-software folks tend to be far too polite to
get involved in such religious warfare, and this task falls to rude
people like me.

There are powerful, efficient, heavily tested, secure software
systems that run on standard Wintel hardware and support probably
the most advanced and powerful set of programming tools developed
so far. There are several different versions, and the people who
develop them not only want you to have them for free, they want
you to share this software and your knowledge of it with your
friends. (The people who develop this software generally make their
livings supporting, customizing, and documenting the software, so
you might have to buy a few books.) These systems rarely get
mentioned in the commercial computer rags, because there is no
incentive for the developers of these systems to buy advertising.
Fortunately, almost everyone on this list should have access to
the web by now, so without further ado:

	http://www.gnu.org/
	http://www.debian.org/
	http://www.linux.org/
	http://www.caldera.com/
	http://www.freebsd.org/
	http://www.netbsd.org/
	http://www.openbsd.org/
	http://www.linuxmall.com/
	http://www.redhat.com/
	http://www.cygnus.com/
	http://www.ora.com/
	http://ariel.cobite.com/abf/abf/linuxad.html
	http://www.fokus.gmd.de/linux/
	
Notice that many of the above are commercial businesses that
sell support contracts, documentation, proprietary applications
that run on non-proprietary operating systems, etc. Free
software is a profitable business!

In the hopes that I have left this discussion as something
slightly more than the ten-millionth Mac vs. PC war on the
net... (Which reminds me: you can run Linux on Macs too.)

For a good *long* list of books that extropians seems to agree upon (for
the most part) go to
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Philosophy/princip.html and scroll to
the bottom under Readings.


Personally, I like best: 

Julian Simon's *The Ultimate Resource* at
http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Colleges/BMGT/.Faculty/JSimon/Ultimate_Resource/

Robert Anton Wilson's *Right Where You Are Sitting Now*

Drexler's *Engines of Creation* at
http://www.asiapac.com/EnginesOfCreation/ 

Dawkins' *The Selfish Gene*

And for those who hate government, there's no better way to fight it
than to know it inside and out. Which is why I think every educated
American should at least peruse the political philosophy of modernity

Machiavelli: *The Prince* at
http://daemon.ilt.columbia.edu/academic/digitexts/machiavelli/the_prince/title.html
and *The Discourses on Livy*

Hobbes: *Leviathan* (at very least Part 1: Of Man and Part 2: Of
Commonwealth) at gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/98/1

Francis Bacon: *The New Atlantis* (civil religion based upon science --
a vision of the New World?) at
http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgibin/browse-mixed?id=BacAtla&tag=public&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/eng-parsed

John Locke: *Second Treatise on Government* at
ftp://wiretap.area.com/Library/Classic/locke2nd.txt

Rousseau: *On the Social Contract*

Then hit Friedman's *Machinery of Freedom* and some of his other
articles which are darn good (Such as *Law as a Private Good* at
http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Academic/Law_as_a_private_good/Law_as_a_private_good.html
)

Finally, I think everyone should read the Illuminatus! trilogy by Robert
Anton Wilson just for kicks.

This is the kind of thing that Kant invented the phrase
"synthetic a priori" to cover. It looks like Rucker is asserting
that omega belongs to the synthetic a priori, although he may
not *intend* to have done so...

I find Paul Churchland's discussion of these Kantian categories
(presented along with his theory of semantics in his monograph
SCIENTIFIC REALISM AND THE PLASTICITY OF MIND) most
illuminating, if anyone cares. The theory of semantics proposed
in that monograph is significantly fleshed out in Churchland's
later more neurocomputationally-focused books.

Rucker's metaphysical poetry you quote here reminds me of Pirsig's
"Quality". The closer philosophers try to get to what they think
really matters, the more abstract and colorless their vocabulary
gets. This has always disturbed me, and probably accounts for my
pluralistic hunches that the Good is not something capable of
detailed unitary representation within an ape brain. In Minskyan
terms, I see the Good as an accumulation. (ref. Society of
Mind.)

I don't know whether subscribing to Kantian metaphysics is
necessarily self-contradictory, although many people seem to
think so. Kant's popularity waxes and wanes, but most people of
libertarian political bent find it difficult to disagree with
Kant's moral maxim that a person is an end in emself.

(New problem: what is a person? The old definition--a person is a
mature, sane ape of species Homo sapiens--was already rife with
problematics probed by Foucault and Szasz and others, and now may,
for the first time in millenia, be threatened by obsolescence.
The best replacement we have available, it seems, is the Turing
test, which is neither more nor less than a straightforward
bootstrapping from the old definition. The Turing test says: if
a new system can fool one of the systems that we would have
called a "person" under the old definition into believing that
the new system is a person, then the new system is a person
under the new, Turing-test definition. Of course, the details
are much messier than that, but even simplified that much it
looks pretty kludgy.)

Oops. I started out addressing a technical point and wandered
off into a heavy philosophical problem on a digression. I do
that sometimes. Sorry.

Why? In general the more advanced our commercial vehicles get the more
reliable they are, if properly maintained. Modern cars are far more
reliable than they were twenty years ago, and a 747 is far more reliable
than a Dragon Rapide... Modern commercial aircraft almost never crash if
they're maintained correctly. Why should alien spacecraft be any different
(I'll give you the possibility that they *are* military, early models or 
government vehicles like the shuttle)?

Interestingly, Lockheed were able to provide better SR-71 maintenance (and
the SR-71 was far ahead of its time, let alone cutting edge) for the CIA
with a very small group of Lockheed technicians than the USAF could manage
with far more people (I think the figures were something like five
Lockheeders vs fifty USAF), so military experience may not tell us much.
And shuttle maintenance is notoriously bloated...

But even if that's true, the last comparitive reliability figures I saw
showed that it typically crashes three times as often so you notice it
more. In comparison I don't really care how long Linux takes to start up 
(though it feels faster than Win95 and *is* faster than NT) because I can 
happily go for coffee on the few occasions when it's neccesary; my workstation 
had been up for nearly three months as a development machine and web-server 
before someone accidentally unplugged the power lead last week. Goes to show 
that there's nothing inherently unreliable about PC hardware.

Actually from what I've heard the workers at EuroDisney have a typically
obnoxious French attitude, which is why most British folks still prefer to
go to Florida instead. Anyway, until recently going to Disney World was
cheaper.

P.S. I'm typing this on an "absolute crap" 486/66 with 8 MB of RAM,
which makes a fine Linux Web development platform if I'm not connected 
to the Net by modem and don't use SSL (both of which are inherently
too CPU-intensive to run at the same time as Netscape and the rest of
the web server).

You are presuming that alien "stealth" capabilities are similar to our own.
 The well-known stealth capabilities of the US military is first or second
generation and relatively passive.  The current experimental (mostly
classified) generation is starting to utilize active stealth techniques
which have vastly enhanced capabilities.  Primarily utilizing advanced
"active" materials and smart composites, I have seen some *very impressive*
new stealth capabilities.  I was on the engineering and science side of it,
but the US military was fairly drooling over the results.

Some of the newer active materials can not only protect against several
forms of direct radiation without redirection, but they can generate a tiny
amount of return noise as well.  The residual noise (a result of
imperfections in the materials) produces a much cleaner return spectrum
without the "hole" normally associated with some passive forms of stealth.
I know people have been working on computer controlled versions of these
materials that let you modify the return characteristics in realtime.  I
understand that the computer controlled versions can not only give you the
full amplitude spectrum (from no return at all to a full strength return),
but can also modify some characteristics of the return signal.  A very cool
technology with a ton of possible real world uses.

Possibly, but will our very weak (relatively) radio source be detectable
among the myriads of strong radio sources?  Will they even be looking?
Will they care?  They may not even exist on a planet that has an atmosphere
that is particularly transparent to radio waves.  We are making large
assumptions regarding the motives, interest, and capabilities of a
hypothetical advanced race.  Even a distance of 50 ly is prohibitively
large based on our current understanding of physics.  They might not even
be interested in making any type of contact with us, to the point where
they go out of their way to avoid us even assuming they have developed
strong interstellar capability.  A race that was simply looking for
resources in other systems might prefer to avoid us to prevent possible
contention.  Consider all the unoccupied yet equally accessible star
systems available.

Then again, the situation could be that we are the most technologically
advanced society in our neck of the woods.  Within a 100 ly sphere, this is
a very plausible possibility.  IMO, our best odds of finding ET
civilizations is to go out and look ourselves.

I was presuming that the stealthy craft were of super-advanced alien
origin.  Of course our stealth aircraft have much more limited capability.
"Stealth" as currently applied means hard to detect via electronic means.
As for crashing, "stealth" aircraft have very ordinary airframes and are
subject to the same laws of physics as any other aircraft.

Another part of the bloating and stability problem is most of the major OS
vendors try to make their product a "do-everything" OS.  I think the
biggest failure on the part of the OS vendors is to try and make their OS
like everyone else's.  What they should be doing is differentiating
themselves by focusing more on their core competencies.

Mac-based platforms are unsophisticated simple-to-use, single user systems
that excel at realtime things like digital audio and video processing.
This is their core technology and they do it well.  Yet they have been
spending lots of money trying to market the concept that the MacOS is a
great network machine and makes a great server, both of which are blatantly
untrue.  The simplicity that is normally associated with the MacOS is due
in part because many of the components that would make it a truly powerful
OS never existed.  I suspect that re-designing the MacOS to include NT and
UNIX-like technologies will do little to actually improve the market for
MacOS, seeing as how that market is already filled.

Windows NT is Microsoft's wannabe UNIX, but has neither the power nor
flexibility of UNIX.  However, it is a great desktop OS and works great for
peer-to-peer and workgroup networking.  What Microsoft *should've* done is
lighten up NT by removing all the wannabe enterprise, Unix, and other
generally useless components, and sold it as the ultimate business OS and
forgotten about Windows 95.  NT is more stable than MacOS, fairly easy to
use, far more powerful than MacOS in the networking department, but it is
no substitute for the MacOS's core competencies.  NT is more stable than
Win95 because it is a "from the ground up" OS and prefers stability to
backward compatibility.

Unix is irreplaceable as a server and network OS, and makes a pretty good
research and development environment, but I seriously doubt its place as a
user OS for numerous reasons (sorry Linux people!).  The learning curve is
far too steep, and the interface is unintuitive and complex.  This is its
power, but it is not for the masses.  With the exception of the Free Unix
crowd, I don't think too many people had any illusions about this though.
Can't beat the rock solid stability and (in most but not all cases) speed,
though.

I have a MacOS, NT, and Unix box at home and I use all 3 regularly.  Unix
is by far the most stable.  I run Unix under heavy loads for months on end
and it never crashes or even hiccups.  NT is definitely less stable than
Unix, but crashes less often than the MacOS and is way faster than the
MacOS system even though NT is running on significantly slower hardware.
Windows 95 is simply too dirty an OS to be particularly stable.  I never
use it on my own machines.  However, it is more stable than the old Win 3.1
environment that I use to use in days of yore.

"Productivity" is a slippery definition.  A software developer would find
Unix, NT, and too a lesser extent Windows 95 to be more "productive" than
MacOS.  The marketing department may beg to differ.  For many applications
a command line interface is faster than a GUI, but may or may not be more
productive depending on who you ask.  I have MacOS, NT, and Unix systems
because I recognize the fact that some OSs are significantly more
productive and efficient for certain tasks than others.  Instead of trying
to fight the weakness of one system, I utilize the strengths of all of them.

What would really be cool is an OS that could radically reconfigure and
optimize itself on the fly to support multiple models...

I'm convinced they could, even in the very unlikely event that it's impossible 
to achieve speeds higher than what we can right now, with Von Neumann Machines 
they could send several probes to every planet orbiting every star in the 
Galaxy in less that 50 million years. Just the blink of an eye. 

I'm convinced they would, I don't see how a life form could be intelligent  
and technological if it didn't have curiosity. So where are they?  
That's the Fermi Paradox.

I'm also convinced that an intelligent society that had been around for any  
length of time would start to engineer the Universe and be conspicuous even  
at cosmological distances. There is no sign of it. 

It's mind blowing to think that there is other life in the universe, 
it's  even more mind blowing to think that there is not and we're alone.

As for government cover-up, if those jackasses couldn't keep the Watergate

I disagree strongly with this line of thought for a number of reasons.

First, it is simply not true.  High-level officers *can* be held
accountable for the actions of the corporation.  

I find the "accountability" argument against the existence of corporations
to be poor.  If a large aerospace company (say 100,000 employees) builds
and sells a plane that by some definite fault of their own crashes and
kills 250 people, who is liable?  In an organization that large, with
thousands of people directly or indirectly responsible for the design and
safety of the aircraft, how do you determine the liability of each
individual?  Are mere employees directly liable for a fault of the company,
or do you have to be a owner/stockholder (who usually are NOT employees) to
be "directly liable"?  In either case, it is very easy to argue that
*neither* the employees nor the owners/stockholders should be directly
liable.    

In civil cases, it makes no legal or logical sense to sue the employees of
a company whose individual responsibilities are not justification for a
civil suite.  Many corporate civil suites are generated by situations that
are an accumulation of actions and decisions by hundreds of people that
were correct in their local context but not correct in the organizational
context.

Corporations are not inherently evil or even bad.  They are an
organizational form that has serious practical advantages for large
companies.  Corporations encourage investment in business.  A corporate
structure allows you to share the profits of a corporation without being
responsible for the activities of individuals you cannot control (*NOTE: by
legal definition of a corporate stockholder you are NOT ALLOWED to have
direct control unless you are also an employee*).  The corporate liability
exists so that an entity can be held responsible when no individual clearly
is.  


You seem to be operating under the assumption that 1) Most employees of
corporations are also owners, 2) most owners are also employees, and 3)
owners of corporations are in direct control of the employees.
These conditions are rarely true for large companies.  And in cases where
the owners are also employees with significant control, they owners *are*
liable. 

This corporate accountability thing sounds like a version of the ever
popular "Corporate Conspiracy Theory" to me.

Dear fellow Extropians,
The alternative to corporate structures as a form of organization is
possibly a cooperative, integrated and interactive worker owned
environment, At issue would be the surrounding political environment. 
It seems that among the many questions that would have to be asked is
whether in a highly competetive world economy large numbers of such
organizations can compete effectively when all the variables and
constraints in a multicultural world are taken into account. 
I have my own theories, but I'd like to know what the rest of you think.
It would be nice to have a few realistic and implimentable proposals as
responses.
Enjoy,
AMG

The low end number applies to several WW I & II military craft that were

battle damage.

By what basis do you make this assertion? There is no politics in
engineering. The more complex a device, and the more severe its
operating environment, the greater its maintenance requirements.

F-111s have been flown on carriers, and were originally supposed to be a
multiservice platform. The naval version was going to have several more
struts in the fuselage, a sturdier wing, and heftier landing gear.

No matter how steep a difference between tech level and operating
regieme, higher tech always has higher maint time. There is a difference
between tech level and the quality of construction. A crappy Edsel of a
flying saucer will still be more likely to crash than a hot air balloon.

The trouble with failures in composites is that there is not usually a
soft failure. You can't detect cracks until it gives way under strain,
and when it does, it shatters. This is why new composite wings are
stress tested on the ground far in excess of their operating margins.
This does not mean that they will not fail over time.

You think that there will be less than 1 maint hour per flight hour? It
hasn't happened yet, and the curve averages upward over time, so I doubt
that it will happen for anything but the most low stress flight regeimes
for quite a while.

So your beleive in alien abductions?

Because Occams razor tells me if screwed up creatures like us with our
screwed up ways of doing things can make it, then any visitors are just
as likely to come from screwed up planets as well, and just as likely to
have short sighted, self centered, idiotic politicians and bureaucrats
in charge of things on their home planet. The ideas that people get from
Star Trek  are much more unlikely than things continuing much as they
are now.

Read Scott Adams new book, Dilbert Futures, in which he states "The
future will NOT be like Star Trek." because people will still be as
screwed up as they are now, they'll just have cooler high tech toys to
be screwed up with.

Well, the first thing that sticks in my mind is our radiowave
emanations. That radio had been in wide use for over 20 years prior to
Roswell, and even TV broadcasts occured 11 years prior, not to mention
the large electrical discharges  in recognisable patterns that people
like Nicola Tesla had been using since before WWI gives one enough of a
change in the radio output of our solar system to be noticable.
Considering that our sun is such a mellow, stable yellow dwarf, such a
rapid change in radio output is obviously a sign of technological
intelligence developing, that should to any scientist, be a chance to
study a whole new society.

Sure its obvious that any other intelligent society would send out
probes. That isn't a question thats worth debating. Whether we are the
first in our star cluster is the real question. What is the
density/spread of intelligent life in our galaxy? Even the pessimistic
Sagan said that there are between 1 and a dozen such civilizations in
existence at any one time (based on a formula that someone came up
with), and this was when he was expecting our own species to be snuffed
out before the millenium by nuclear holocaust. Given that that
particular threat seems to be over, then the likelihood of even more
such civilizations being in existence rises by a huge magnitude.

THis is in my mind the biggest hole in their claims. Since the people
who operated the Mogul balloons have said that they never cared about
recovering the balloons since nothing on them was classified, only their
purpose was, then the security measures and priority guarded flight of
the materials to Wright Patterson AFB are completely incongruous. ALso,
the report disclosed that all of the paperwork related to the crash
recovery was destroyed without authorization, and without record of the
date or place where they were destroyed. THis in my mind is a smoking
gun that should justify even deeper poking.

Actually, I beg to differ about your conclusion with respect to b.
Economic reasons are the greatest threat because it would be very easy
to completely destabilize our economy by suddenly releasing information
to, say, build your own basement fusion or zero point field power
generator. Many people would say to this, "no it just means we are free
of those theiving power company bastards, etc".....but it just shows how
little people understand about economics. Say these aliens released over
the airwaves plans for an easy way for an average joe to build a weapon
of mass destruction. What would happen? Instant bedlam. Nuclear weapons
level terrorism would be the norm for every community. Imagine kids
phoning in a bomb threat to get out of school then....

Using the Conquistador Syndrome as an example, economics is a good
reason to expose ones existence.

Maybe its been a while since I posted this, but anyone who understands
relativity knows that a spaceship accelerating at a mere 1 G for one
year reaches 90% of light speed, where time dilation effects start to
happen. Essentially, with a constant thrust vehicle that can accelerate
at 1 G, just about anywhere in the galaxy is reachable in under a
decades flight time, anywhere in our star cluster is reachable in less
than 6 years, and anywhere within 20 light years is reachable in less
than 4 years ship time. So if you have a decent supply of reading
material, a decent hybernation couch, and a good hydroponic system, a
person can go anywhere at sublight speeds. Of course, don't count on
anyone but your grandkids  being alive when you get back from a 20 LY
cruise, unless people start living a lot longer.

I think it's great and I know for a fact they are magic words, they can  
instantly get you out of involuntary servitude. I was called for jury slavery 
recently, I did not want to be there and the pay stank. When questioned by 
the judge in open court the first thing I said was "I believe in jury  
nullification because..." and the judge interrupted and said "Thank you  
Mr. Clark you are dismissed". The poor man looked like somebody said "Fuck" 
at a Sunday school picnic, I don't think he wanted the other jury slaves to 
be contaminated with my evil ideas so I got to go home. I was delighted, but 
I felt a little sorry for the other captives.

Its probably the only form of hyperdemocracy in existence, where one
person or small group of persons can declare a law unjust. This is why
most judges will declare a mistrial if a lawyer mentions the mere
existence of the jury nullification law to jurors. They typically charge
the lawyer who mentions it with contempt.

I'm somewhat disheartened to report that the universe seems to be open.
The Big Crunch and its Omega deity are therefore off the agenda, unless we
and our AI pals get in there and really push (well, pull), tweaking the
parameters.

Dr Brian Schmidt, a research fellow at Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring
observatories in Australia, writes in the Weekend Australian newspaper for
Saturday 12 July (p 24) that this week he presented to a Sydney conference
of the Astronomical Society of Australia the first results of a study of
supernovae at very great distances.  This used new technologies available
via the Keck and Hubble telescopes, permitting measures of the expansion
rate 8 billion years ago.  
`Comparison to the current rate of expansion indicates that the universe
has slowed down very little over this time, and therefore will continue to
expand forever.'

This data is very recent - the latest observations were made less than 10
days ago.  A second very similar study is currently under way in
California.  Schmidt expects to learn if the results converge `in the next
few years'.

(BTW, Robin, good news about the PhD!  This cosmological news means you'll
now have a very long time to enjoy it, although things will be getting
rather cold after a while.)

Speaking of mythology.... ;)

This sounds good, but you are forgetting a few key problems with that
scenario:

1) what's its power source? I suppose it could have a catalytic cold
fusion crystal in it that ran on atmospheric moisture, but we are
talking still about one major problem that even that kind of power
source would not be able to solve:

COMMUNICATION

You are expecting a probe the size of a grain of sand to be stealthed,
yet pump out enough power to run a communications device that can
communicate at interstellar distances? Oh PLEASE. The sort of power
density that would demand is huge, millions of years beyond  our
greatest hopes. At that level, such a grain of sand would stick out on a
beach like a spotlight, would probably melt its surrounding material to
glass, and start a fire... hardly a stealthy behavior.

Here's a fantastic scenario to go with that:

The grains of sand come down in bunches over an area of a few miles
wide. They survey, store up information, and wait for a storm system to
swing overhead. They use the storm's electrical potential to trigger
lightning strikes that they use to send a tightbeam burst message using
the earths atmosphere as a highpower radio transmitter. The power demand
to accomplish this naturally causes a forest fire that destroys the
probe,and the fire is blamed on lightning.

WHile this sounds like a fanciful SF story, I think your guys are
thinking too far ahead. Any civilizations first interstellar missions
will not be that much different from our existing space program, i.e.
hiding is not a priority. you think that any aliens must be some
superbeings because in your heart you think that humanity is too stupid
to ever reach other star systems, so if they can get here, they must be
so much better than we are. BS. They will put their pants on pretty much
the same way as we do, and will be just as messed up as individuals as
we are.

What was a Dragon Rapide? True commercial aircraft are extremely
reliable, but they hardly operate in a harsh flight regieme, and they
are highly overbuilt for the job. Still, a plane with 20,000 flight
hours at an average of 450 mph is still brand new compared to an
interstellar flight of 20 light years at .98 C with no maintenance
stops. Its a whole different universe of operation.

Well, one could say that the skunk works guys were the ones who built
it, so that may be an advantage over using high school graduates or
dropouts who were drafted. Plus Kelly Johnson never liked having people
who just did heavy looking on, like so much military work is.

Additionally, the CIA got a new plane, while the USAF got a well used
plane. Maintenance time goes up with airframe age.

How long an OS takes to boot within a 20 sec to 1 minute range, at this
point in time, is irrelevant from a cost effectiveness point of view.
Having a larger OS that can do more stuff makes up for a few extra
seconds of boot time, and having a bigger OS that can run the
applications you actually use faster than the previous version is what
is real progress.

Hardly. We have never had the chance to live in an anarchy, just varying
levels of authoritarianism, monarchy, and mass tyranny. That the
majority seem to prefer to live as cattle is disturbing.

You don't seem to know much about the period. Phones were widespread
(and there was even competition in that market!) and every town had a
newspaper that was the primary source of information, not nationwide
talkshows or corporate faux journalism like most people waste their time
on today. Additionally, literacy was higher then than it is now...
People took the time to be involved in what was going on in their
communities, almost always voted in every election, and attended town
meetings. There was national news on newsreels that preceded movies at
the local theater. Mounting a local effort to keep outsiders out was not
that hard. During the 30's during the depression, when large banks would
come in and buy out problematic mortgages on farms, the banks would
seize the farms and auction it and all equipment off, but the locals
would come in, underbid everything, at just a few dollars or less a
peice, and give the equipment and land back to the farmer. The local
Granges were sort of a union hall to coordinate these activities, as
everyone would eventually help everyone else out. 

This is much the same situation small towns face today with companies
like Walmart and Costco trying to move in. Some towns are successful in
fighting because they think things through, prepare, and do good PR work
to get the whole community behind the effort. Others who don't fight it,
but only complain and sit on their butts get what they deserve.

Accountable, yes. Liable, probably not. 

Let's say that an airline company experienced a string of crashes.
Later, it comes to light that the CEO had ordered a cutback of
maintenance personnel. The lawsuits pour in.

The basic standard is that the director or officer must behave as a
reasonably prudent person would behave in similar circumstances. There
is no such thing as an "accommodation" or "dummy" director. If a person
sits on a board, he automatically (and non-waivably) bears the burden of
acting with due care. 

However, liability for breach of the duty of due care is generally
imposed only when the director or officer behaves "recklessly" or with
"gross negligence." (Example: D, a director, fails to attend board
meetings, fails to read financial reports, fails to obtain the advice of
a lawyer or accountant even though he is on notice that the corporation
is being mismanaged  taken together, these acts amount to recklessness,
and thus justify holding D liable for losses suffered by the corporation
that could have been prevented by a director who exercised reasonable
care. [Francis v. United Jersey Bank].)

This means that as a director, with a decent lawyer, you're pretty much
safe from liability in all but the most extreme cases. So with our
airline CEO, he'll probably look bad, but that's about it. That's not to
say that the airline itself can't be held liable (a whole 'nother
story).

There's also this cute little "business judgment rule" which saves many
actions from being held to be violations of the duty of due care. The
business judgment rule basically provides that a substantively-unwise
decision by a director or officer will not by itself constitute a lack
of due care. If the director or officer has no "interest" in the
transaction, has made an "informed" decision, and "rationally believed"
this decision was in the corporation's best interest, he will be
protected by the business judgement rule. So the decision does not have
to be substantively "reasonable," but it must be at least "rational"
(i.e., not totally crazy).

As a practical matter, people choose to bother with the time and expense
of chartering a full-blown corporate entity where (1) the owners want to
limit their liability; (2) where free transferability of interests is
important; (3) where centralized management is important (e.g., a large
number of owners); and (4) where continuity of existence in the face of
withdrawal or death of an owner is important. If these do not apply, by
all means go with a partnership when (1) simplicity and inexpensiveness
of creating and operating the enterprise are important; or (2) the tax
advantages are significant, such as avoiding double taxation and/or
sheltering other income.

My conclusory point on this is that without settled law, corporations
cannot exist.

Exactly. This is why corporations are given a legal "identity" with
rights and responsibilities under law. The sum total of the collective
activity is embodied in this legal fiction to make it safer for
businesspeople to transact, and easier for tortfeasors to collect. I
don't see much of a problem with the philosophy behind it.

Right. Your powers as a shareholder are limited to electing and removing
directors, amending the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, and
voting rights on fundamental changes not in the ordinary course of
business (e.g., mergers, sales of substantially all of the company's
assets, or dissolution).

I suspect a significant part of the increase in maintenance time is the
result of regulations forcing the services and maintenance to take place
more frequently.  That has certainly been the case for civilian aircraft.

I have to confess that I have never heard of jury nullification, but it has
my curiousity.

Could someone explain (in a paragraph or so) what jury nullification is
exactly, and what is the
basis for its existence?  Or at least point me to a source for more info.

I learn something new every day...

Direct testimony to Congress, for starters.
But there is politics in aerospace development and procurement.
I'll address the "no politics" claim again a little further on.

This is tautologous: the harder things are, the harder things are. 
But the better technology and wealth get, the more overdesigned 
for the environment a piece of gear can be. You don't seem to address this.

Evidently you _don't_ know the story.

I'm keeping myself from laughing my guts out here. Talk to one of the 
F-111B crew chiefs, as I have. They _could not_ get that puppy to hunt; 
I'm familiar with the B variant mods, the plane was still too heavy 
to land on an aircraft carrier unless you burned off all the fuel and 
launched missiles (expensive missiles) before landing. Not very cost 
effective. Oh, you could underload the planes, but then they had a 
real hard time performing their mission--long loiter fleet stand-off 
defense--you need the fuel _and_ the missiles.

As I said, the decks didn't like it much either. Oh, you could beef 
up the carrier deck--but that would take the carrier out of service 
for *quite* a spell while there's a war on, and the gross tonnage 
gets screwed up, so you can't carry as much ship's stores, so now 
the _carrier_ has trouble performing _its_ mission... and around 
and around.

F-111s were developed _by order_ of Macnamara, who *knew* that the 
life cycle costs of a "joint" vehicle *had* to be less. Others 
*knew* what the mission-role requirements had to be for the Air 
Force and Navy. Even Silly Putty can only stretch so far.
And everybody was making money even if the thing didn't work, 
so what the hell?

Check how many were actually deployed for carrier use. I believe 
the total number was *6*, but it might have been slightly different.
If you don't want to check, I'll see what I can dig up.

The phrase I used was "absurdly specified and designed".
I see little evidence in your post to change my opinion.

>There is no politics in engineering. 

OK; then the Shuttle and modern aerospace contract developments 
like the F-111, Shuttle and America's Vanishing Space Station 
are not engineering. We agree. :)

The biographers of Max Faget will, I hope, address the Shuttle
and its co-option into its current bad design. If we have to, 
I'll go into it. However, just talking about Shuttle ops, 
permit me to commend to your eyes 

_The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, 
and Deviance at NASA_ by Diane Vaughn, University of Chicago Press, 1996, 
ISBN 0-226-85176-1.

Onward.

The service ceiling of a standard B-1 is less than 30,000 
feet. Why? This is *not* the original spec; it was supposed 
to outfly the B-52 in all particulars, all conditions.

So--why? Because late-breaking "requirements" caused 
new electronic gear to be placed the only place it would 
fit; this led to the center of gravity being shifted such 
that the plane can't assume a proper angle of attack at 
altitudes much over 28,000 feet.

I can't prove that the requirements were political, but I 
smell a big fat aerospace rat.

>for quite a while.

I suspect the curve averages upward because of FAA restrictions, 
human laziness and the litigious environment. Two of these 
are correctable. :) I assume you know why Burt Rutan got 
out of the kitplane business? Because some _yahoo_ who 
put five layers of epoxy over one layer of glass hurt 
himself when he tried to take off and the wings folded--
and won in court. Idiocy got rewarded. And general aviation
air design lost a pioneer for good.

I did not exclude *any* flight regime, and neither did you 
at first--why do you now feel you have to? 

Wanna bet?

My bet proposal: I pick "General Aviation, Ultralights 
(an artificial distinction created by the FAA) and Subsonic
RPVs" as the flight regime, and I restrict 
the pertinent maintenance time spent to that spent on 
airframe, powerplant and VFR instruments (i.e., the 
equipment needed for safe VFR operation in 1950), 
over the useful life of the airframe or powerplant, 
whichever fails first.

What do you like for the stakes?
Just for the record, 150 hp Zoche turbo diesel engines will 
probably run $20k. :)

I find myself unable to follow your reasoning. I find your confidence 
in your ability to predict other lifeforms' reasoning charming, but 
arbitrary. I couldn't have even predicted how relatively _un_ fucked up
_I_ am now if I'd tried to, say, six years ago.

I do find value in Adams' generalization that "everybody is an idiot 
[sometimes]". Including me, and you, and William of Ockham, who, 
by the way, was a _theologian_. 

Occam's Razor kept "real" geologists from looking at continental 
drift for a long time. All hail Occam's razor, it never fails 
to make life simpler. :) 

When the only tool you have is Occam's Razor, you think you need 
to shave all the time.

No, I don't "believe in alien abductions". You seem to "believe" that

I'm in favor of simplifying the whole jury/"justice" deal,
and I see nothing wrong with the FIJA principles as part of that.

Now ask me what I think of the number of victimless felonies. :)

Or of the fact that the common law definition of "fraud" fits on 
a 3x5 card and can be explained to a competent jury in five minutes,
while the SEC fraud regs are a nine foot shelf of books that 
grows every year... :\ :)

I am all for it.  I recommend Lysander Spooner's book on the subject. 
He asserts (and I agree) that unless the jury has full access to all
information, and full freedom to find guilty or acquit for any reason,
and judges not only the facts of the case, but the law and actions of
the government, then it is not trial by one's peers, but trial by the
state, and as such, bad.

I actually think independent contractors are the business model of the
future.  In Silicon Valley, contractors are increasingly becoming the norm.
 A lot of companies employee a significant part of their staff as
contractors.  The benefits are numerous.  For the company, it is usually
cheaper to hire technical contractors only for as long as needed than to
hire them as a full-time employee.  Additionally, it allows the company to
adapt its staff more quickly to the changing business environment without
the hassle of hiring and firing.  For the contractor, there is usually
significantly more money, more freedom, some lifestyle benefits, and the
satisfaction of working for yourself.

A business form that has started to appear occasionally is groups of
loosely associated independent contractors forming somewhat transient
virtual companies, only staying together for as long as necessary and then
going their own ways.

I strongly approve of this form of economics because it promotes individual
freedom, reduces corporate bureaucracy, and it more closely ties an
individual's income with his abilities, usefulness, and performance.  The
only downside is that the government makes it more difficult and expensive
to operate this way.  The government prefers that everyone be a faceless
corporate cubicle clone.

The idea is that this spec includes an "egg yolk" power source enough
to get it started building.  Then it relies on environmental sources,
essentially solar energy, as it spreads out.  First it's a grain of sand,
then a small blotch on the soil, than a larger, dark green spot, extending
roots below to find the elements needed.  A few cubic inches of super-
computer, built below the soil, are enough to boot up the millions of
alien minds which arrived in the seed.  These researchers guide the
remainder of the expansion, careful study, building equipment and
supplies, a whole interstellar expedition.  When the time is right,
communications equipment is built in space or on the ground.  All the
plans, blueprints, and stored minds arrived in the seed.  That's what
you can do with nanotech.

I completely disagree.  Statistically, the chances that the aliens just
happen to be within 100 years of our own technological development is so
low as to be absurd.  100 years is less than one ten thousandth of one
percent of the age of the Earth.  Imagine two planets which happened
to create intelligent life which flowered at exactly the same time,
to this level of precision.  Impossible!

You don't seem to appreciate the power which we're going to be able
to wield in 100 years.  Ever hear of the "singularity"?  Ever hear of
"nanotech"?  Ever hear of AIs billions of times more intelligent than
the smartest humans today?  In 100 years *we* (meaning our cultural
descendants) should be able to launch the interstellar expedition
described above.

This is the biggest problem I have with UFO stories.  The aliens are
laughable caricatures, Buck Rogers in a flying saucer.  They're just
like we would have been back in the 1940's if we had that era's idea
of future technology.

The stories which really make me laugh are the biological ones.  Did you
know the aliens need to swoop down at night and steal the sex organs 
from *cows*?  I won't even get into the abduction tails of forced sex and
hybrid human/aliens.  This is ludicrous.  If the aliens want biological
samples, they can use nanotech probes and get them invisibly!  And once
they have a few they certainly don't need to keep coming back for more,
they can make as many as they want, ringing their own changes on the DNA.

The limited abilities of the aliens are due to the limited imaginations
of the people reporting them, nothing more.  It's just as dated as Star
Trek.

We've got a lot of new people on the list, and they don't seem to have
fully internalized the new way of thinking about the future.  Read some
of Moravec's stuff.  His new book has excerpts on the web at
<URL: http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book97/book97.index.html >.  Read
the other references which have been discussed here recently.  It is
gradually becoming clear that the future is not going to be what we thought
back in the 1960's.  It's going to be awesome, strange and terrible (in
the older sense of the word).  It's going to be great and godlike.  Any
superlative you like can apply.

This list can be a good place to start thinking about it, but we need to
have less nonsense and more familiarity with what will be possible.

Both sides here are assuming facts not in evidence. Both *could* be right.
*I* know I have no way of telling besides living through whatever I live 
through. I think there's a good chance we may auger in on what I
sometimes call "the nano-Beirut scenario".

Someone else mentioned the destabilizing effects of, e.g., handing over
backyard atom tech to "anyone"--me, I have a little more faith in people
than to believe they'd nuke school rather than just cut classes...

But there is little question in my mind that unless things collapse, 
individuals will have control of the equivalent energy stored in 
weapons of mass destruction--this is an easy prediction because 
individuals have already had such control; I mean "more individuals".

My ongoing question is how to make a world like that stay one I 
wouldn't mind coming back to.

A great danger is that this, or greater (say, strong nt), power will
continue to concentrate in the hands of the few.

This seems to imply that humans have to grow up or grow out or both.
I don't see clearly how things will go, but I'm pretty sure pluralism
won't be a bed of roses.

That's why I like the Vallee scenario(s) from _Messengers of Deception_.
It's amusing to contemplate a natural, Earthly phenomenon that hits
people in such a way that they later explain the occurrence in a semi-
archetypical fashion: angels long ago, strange airship operators in the 
last century, BEMs now; all speaking and acting cryptically and "cosmically".

It's going to be extremely rough sledding, at least for a while.
It _may_ get better after that. Then again, maybe not. How's that
for a specific prediction? :)

I happened to be in a room the other day in which a Television was turned
on...I think it was tuned to the discovery channel...(perhaps the history
channel)...and the topic was ......wwII mogul ballons...

According to this source:

  The Japanese had a site on one of their Islands, near a beach...in which
they made and launched about 3000 "continental attack ballons" (my
term)...They were made of....RICE PAPER...filled with hydrogen...had
detatchable ballast packs filled with sand (beach was convient for
that...which was how the launch site was located..(sand was
identified...localized)...and bombed into oblivion by DoLittle). and had one
bomb each...  They were launched into the Jet Stream...drifited across in a
day or so...periodically dropping ballast or venting hydrogen to maintain
altitude under the varying conditions of sunlite and darkness...(used an
ingenious clockwork mechanism for this)...when the last ballast was
dropped....the bomb was dropped next....terror weapon...ment to divert scarce
resources from the war effort.(set forests afire,...randomly destroy whatever
was underneath...kill people)

But  RICE PAPER...not very metallic...and the ballons ...individually...were
rather small...didn't appear that one would cover much area at all....when
ripped to shreds...and this all occured further north ...I think.

Subject: CFP: Learning in Autonomous Robots

Dear Colleague,

Maja Mataric and I are guest editing a special issue of Prof. George
Bekey's Autonomous Robots Journal. Please review our CFP which is salo
available online.

http://www.cs.buffalo.edu/~hexmoor/autonomous-robots.html

                           Call for papers
                        Autonomous Robots Journal
             Special Issue on Learning in Autonomous Robots

             Guest editors:  Henry Hexmoor and  Maja Mataric

                 Submission Deadline: August 15, 1997 

Autonomous Robots is an international journal published by Kluwer
Academic Publishers, Editor-in-Chief: George Bekey


Current applications of machine learning in robotics explore learning
behaviors such as obstacle avoidance, navigation, gaze control, pick
and place operations, manipulating everyday objects, walking,
foraging, herding, and delivering objects. It is hoped that these are
first steps toward robots that will learn to perform complex
operations ranging from folding clothes, cleaning up toxic waste and
oil spills, picking up after the children, de-mining, look after a summer
house, imitating a human teacher, or overseeing a factory or a space
mission.

As builders of autonomous embedded agents, researchers in robot
learning deal with learning schemes in the context of physical
embodiment. Strides are being made to design programs that change
their initial encoding of know-how to include new concepts as well as
improvements in the associations of sensing to acting. Driven by
concerns about the quality and quantity of training data and real-time
issues such as sparse and low-quality feedback from the environment,
robot learning is undergoing a search for quantification and
evaluation mechanisms, as well as for methods for scaling up the
complexity of learning tasks.

This special issue of Autonomous Robots will focus on novel robot
learning applications and quantification of learning in autonomous
robots. We are soliciting papers describing finished work preferably
involving real manipulator or mobile robots. We invite submissions
from all areas in AI and Machine Learning, Mobile Robotics, Machine
Vision, Dexterous Manipulation, and Artificial Life that address robot
learning.

Submitted papers should be delivered by August 15, 1997. For a small
extension or problems with submission please contact contact Henry
Hexmoor as soon as possible.

Manuscripts should be typed or laser-printed in English (with American
spelling preferred) and double-spaced. Both paper and electronic
submission are possible, as described below.

There is a complexy threshold for man-made systems, which makes them
progressively expensive to operate. There also seems a pretty sharp
boundary where the system is suddenly _unable_ to operate at all. Many
aerospace designs and large software projects hover at that threshold. 

This needs not to be so, however. Naturally evolved systems do not show such 
marked brittleness, and their occasional failures can be attributed to 
random mutation noise crucial for the darwinian optimization process to 
function.

Systems which can tolerate defects are comparatively easy to do. As 
next generations hardware is likely to feature many 10^9 active elements, 
their production error and failure error rate must be counteracted by 
redundancy to make them both affordable and operable. WSI FPGA and CAM 
EHWs are obviously a step into the right direction. Langmuir-Blodgett 
should give us 2 1/2 d-systems, whereas true 3d integration is only 
achievable with crystal growth autoassembly.

Self-healing systems at microscopic module scale are only achievable by 
means of molecular manufacturing, whether machine or solvate phase. Don't 
expect them too soon.

    I too would like to know what point the Washington Post was making.
I have always thought the biggest danger from cannabis is smoking it!
Can't be good for the lungs to take-in smoke of any sort.

And who, exactly, claimed it was scattered over quarter of a mile? I don't
have access to original documents, but I do have a cite for the
_Alberquerque Journal_, July 9 1947 claiming that the recovered object was
about three feet across... Hmm, odd, that's around about the size of the
Mogul balloon's payload, isn't it? Bet it's just one of them coincidences.

It's a black program, or the 40s equivalent; indeed, as far as I'm aware
it was part of the nuclear development programs (checking for radioactive
fallout from Russian bombs), and hence security would have been incredibly
tight. What do you expect them to do? 

BTW, you do realise that New Mexico was in the middle of a spate of
'flying disc' reports, don't you? Someone's collected together nine
newspaper reports of 'flying discs' from July 1st to July 11th, several of
which were either parts of weather balloons or hoaxes. Don't you think
that in the circumstances it's not entirely surprising that that's how it
was first reported? I mean, after all, that's pretty much what the
balloon's payload looked like. 

Finally, how come no reference to aliens at Roswell was ever made
publically until more than thirty years later?

EvMick,

Reading your 'how I got here' post reminded me how old I am!  The books
you use as reference points for example are quite modern, and didn't
exist at all when I was going through the same kind of process.

I've been persuaded by reading Roger Scruton, the conservative
semi-libertarian (or at least very anti-socialist) UK philosopher, that
allowing legal incorporation, allowing a true collective to be holdable
legally accountable, is one of the pillars of civil society.  Now I
don't know the ins and outs of law as it stands, but if companies are
somehow getting away with things because of corporate law as it stands,
that is wrong, because the function of corporate law ought to be to hold
corporations accountable for their actions as a (presumably univocal in
the relevant respects) collective.  It is particularly important that if
we are to have government, at the very least that government must be
subject to the same kind of accountability (of course not through
corporate law but through constitutional law).  That's what was missing
in Soviet Russia for example: the Party was unaccountable in this sort
of way.

epic-length post on the "In Search Of" mailing list.

[....]

What is so unique about Cydonia? Geologically it is a mixture of fractured,
desert plains containing numerous mesas (flat-topped eroded prominences)
with varied craters typical of natural landforms throughout the solar
system. But at latitude 41 degrees North, longitude 9 West lie a collection
of features which some observers believe are anything but natural. Research
conducted by a small group of scientists in America since 1979 has
suggested a most exciting possibility - the remains of artificially
designed structures.

Mankind's last wholly successful voyage to Mars was NASA's robotic Viking
mission in 1976. Twin orbiters and landers investigated the geology,
chemistry, meteorology and possible biology of the Red planet. Whilst soil
chemistry tests were ambiguous, more than 50,000 digital images of Martian
geomorphology were returned from orbit. Most of the planet has now been
mapped to a resolution of 100m, and, in some places, 10m. Scientists
continue to analyse these pictures, inferring details of geological,
climatological and - most controversially - biological evolution from them.

There is ample evidence that the Martian climate was in the past more
benign than today. Eroded river channels, evidence of glaciation and
perhaps even ancient lake and sea beds have all been seen in Viking images.
An ocean may have occupied most of the northern hemisphere. There has been
speculation that the features at Cydonia lie on the edge of this ancient
northern sea. Certainly if the Cydonia remains are artificial, proximity to
water would be expected. Water and oxygen may have existed in the area
abundantly over one billion years ago.

Photographic interpretation plays a key role in generating hypotheses
concerning Mars's past evolutionary history. Ejecta blankets, comprised of
material thrown out by meteorite impacts - and with icy flows surrounding
their craters - hint at locations with ice or permafrost beneath. The width
of ancient valleys can be gauged from 3- dimensional maps (generated from
originally 2-D images) and the volume of floodwaters which once occupied
them estimated. The heights of volcanoes and depths of canyons can also be
shown in startling detail in computer flyby simulations. This kind of
research is the province of planetary geologists and geomorphologists.

Similar techniques - shape-from-shading (computerised 3-D image generation
from shadow depth) and stereoscopic imaging (generated by overlaying two
images of the same area taken from slightly different perspectives) - have
also been applied to Cydonia. New interpretative tools like fractal
analysis, used to determine the probabilities of non-natural features
occurring in a landscape, have also been brought to bear. Fractal analysis
highlights any possibly artificial objects due to their non-fractal nature
(i.e. they stand out by having a different mathematical signature from the
background terrain). When the technique was tested on Viking imagery, the
results suggested certain features were strongly non-fractal, and thus by
implication, non-natural.

Those studying the Cydonia region have identified a number of objects which
appear to share certain architectural, artistic and archaeological
characteristics not intrinsic to geomorphological formations. The most
obvious formation was termed the Face because of its similarity to one. The
DiPietro and Molenaar (D&M) pyramid and City are also terms frequently used
when nearby landforms are described. These names are used solely for
research purposes and do not ascribe any function to the objects under
investigation.

Discovered by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
personnel in July 1976, the Face was originally dismissed as a "trick of
light and shadow" when shown to journalists at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. Project scientists claimed that
later images of Cydonia revealed nothing.

The Face was rediscovered in 1979 by Vincent DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar,
computer engineers under contract at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,
Maryland. DiPietro had become intrigued with Viking frame 35A72 labelled
"Head" filed in the archive. Looking for further information on the
geological explanation and analysis of the feature, he found nothing.
Initially DiPietro and his partner Molenaar called for further
investigation of the 2.5km wide Face and the apparently vast pyramid-like
structure - approximately 500m high and nearly 3km long - on frame 70A13
nearby, later termed the D&M pyramid after its discoverers.

They first developed a computer processing method called SPIT (Starburst
Pixel Interleave Technique) to enhance the images, then tested the
integrity of the method on Landsat photographs of the Earth. Although they
presented their findings in a technically responsible and scientific
manner, calling for verification of their results, they were generally
ignored by the very scientists who should have been most interested.

Despite having been shunned by the mainstream planetary establishment,
undaunted, they set up their own research organisation Mars Research, with
physicist Dr John Brandenburg.

DiPietro and Molenaar's findings were further developed by the pioneering
work of former NASA consultant Richard Hoagland in the early 1980s.
Hoagland was one of the men behind the interstellar plaques - designed to
be understood by any alien life-forms who might discover them - aboard the
Pioneer 10 and 11 probes to Jupiter, Saturn and beyond. An extremely
controversial figure in the US space community, he promotes radical new
ideas many find difficult to accept. With a background in subject areas
like archaeoastronomy, Hoagland was also something of an outsider to the
planetary establishment. He had originally accepted NASA's explanation of
the Face without question.

Hoagland discovered a collection of pyramidal mounds to the southwest of
the Face (termed the City) and containing the Fort, an unusual object
apparently with straight walls and an open central area. He also calculated
that Martian solstice alignments at Cydonia would be fulfilled every
500,000 years or so, later revising this to 330,000 years. Departing from
the usual planetary landform analysis techniques, he examined the features'
possible spatial orientations to one another. He also commissioned sculptor
Kynthia Lynne to create an analogue clay model of the Face and surrounding
terrain. When compared with the independent computer studies conducted
there was strong correlation. Part of Kynthia's model can be seen on the
cover of Hoagland's book "The Monuments of Mars".

Results of the early work on Cydonia are found in anthropologist Randolfo
Pozos's book "The Face on Mars: Evidence for a Lost Civilization?", an
account of the computerised conference that took place in late 1983 and
early 1984 between Hoagland, DiPietro, Molenaar, Brandenburg and others. As
well as exploring the technical research conducted on Viking image mosaics,
Pozos approached the highly speculative subject of extraterrestrial life
from religious and philosophical perspectives, examining the profound
implications should Mars indeed have once held advanced life.

The next researcher to address Cydonia was Dr Mark Carlotto, former
employee of a Boston company occasionally involved in US government-related
work. Dr Carlotto examined Viking imagery in 1986/7 using
shape-from-shading, disproving the "trick of light and shadow" theory. He
noted the possibility that teeth were present in the mouth of the Face, and
that these were not artifacts of imaging, appearing in pictures taken at
two different sun angles. Estimating the Face at around 2.5km long, 2km
wide and 400m in height, Carlotto further noted crossed symmetrical lines
on the forehead. He also applied the fractal analysis technique two years
later. In 1991 Carlotto published a book about his work "The Martian
Enigmas", where he called for Mars Observer, NASA's most recent Mars probe,
to re-image Cydonia.

In 1988 Erol Torun, a geomorphologist and cartographer with the US Defence
Mapping Agency in Washington DC, published a cartographic and geometrical
analysis of the D&M pyramid. He concluded that the internal angles and
symmetry were unlikely to occur in a natural mountain, and that no known
erosional process could produce such a regular formation. Torun has also
worked with Hoagland developing his theories. Finally former planetologist
and NASA astronaut corps member Brian O'Leary (at one time on the selection
list for a manned mission to Mars) also published work on Cydonia in 1990,
independently reviewing Carlotto's work in the Journal of the British
Interplanetary Society.

The history of the Cydonia research - and NASA's attitude towards it, up to
and including the loss of the Mars Observer spacecraft in August 1993 - are
well documented in the 200 page McDaniel Report. Author Stanley McDaniel,
Philosophy Professor Emeritus at Sonoma State University, California,
details how NASA failed to seriously consider the research and potential
importance of the issues raised.

McDaniel argues that the space agency ignored or avoided the research,
failing to justify its criticisms. The narrow SETI (Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence) methodology assumed and adopted by NASA was
the radio-search model - i.e. evidence of extraterrestrial life could only
occur via Earth-based radiotelescopes. Yet surely it is incontestable that
potential artifacts on nearby planets need a clearer photographic
examination? In view of this point, it seems strange NASA is unwilling to
consider it, though there have been recent signs that this attitude may be
changing.

The most recent work on Cydonia was completed in 1995 by Professor McDaniel
and Dr Horace Crater, of the University of Tennessee Space Institute. They
published a mathematical analysis of the small mounds in the vicinity of
the Face and City, their method being to discount the random placing of
these mounds.

If the objects in Cydonia are artificial how could we learn more about
them, beyond obviously re-imaging the area with optical sensor systems? One
approach might be to use a technique known as radar remote sensing. This
was used with great success on NASA's Magellan mission, which recently
mapped Venus using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Radar remote sensing has
a number of advantages over conventional optical systems. Firstly, the
illumination of a scene is generated by the satellite itself, in the form
of microwaves. These have several unique properties: they can pass through
clouds and weather systems unaffected; they can be used regardless of day
or night (and hence are of great interest to the military) and can, to some
extent, help to show what surface textures and materials are composed of.
On Earth for example, power lines and railways show up clearly on radar
imagery, being linear metal features they are strong signal reflectors.

A radar system deployed to study Cydonia might be used not only to map the
topography, but also provide spectacular 3-D views similar to those of
Venus generated from Magellan data. It would also be able to peer beneath
the Martian desert revealing the geological substructure as well as any
possible ruins.

The European Space Agency has examined instrumentation - including several
radar systems - for possible Mars missions in a 1989 study document. Radar
applications on Earth have made some surprising findings. The space shuttle
radar revealed ancient Mayan canals when the shuttle flew over Central
America in 1981. Completely covered in jungle they were invisible from the
ground. Archaeologists subsequently visited the site and verified the
shuttle's discoveries. The discovery of the ancient city of Ubar, in the
Middle East, was also assisted by space shuttle radar imagery. At the time
of writing, Dr Michael Malin, President of Malin Space Sciences - the
company building the camera for Mars Observer's replacement - has said he
will re- image Cydonia. This marks a subtle change from an individual who
has sole control of what objects the camera photographs, and originally
showed no special interest in the Cydonia region. The Mars Global Surveyor
is due to commence mapping Mars in early 1998.

What could be the solution to the mystery of Cydonia? Conventional
explanations for the Face involve natural forces blindly sculpting the mesa
into its near-symmetrical form. The pyramids have been compared with
driekanters or ventifacts - rocks and stones polished and faceted by
windblown sand. Yet if the landforms are natural it obviously asks a great
deal of nature. How could the same winds produce such differing forms so
close by, and what about the precise mathematical angles claimed in the D&M
pyramid?

We can but speculate on the implications should the features turn out to be
artificial, but theories put forward amongst those advocating an artificial
origin suggest that Cydonia might provide evidence for it; for example:

1.An ancient indigenous civilization which arose on Mars billions of years
ago, when the planet was more Earth-like; perishing, for reasons not yet
fully understood, when the climate changed.

2.Visitors from beyond the solar system who colonized Mars when it was more
habitable, either dying out, migrating to Earth or returning home when the
climate changed.

Or do the Martian artifacts really seem so unfamiliar?

Why assume they are really so ancient?

Could the real answer to the mystery of Cydonia have something to do with
us?..

....and, with this I believe we can now discuss this region without the
burden of psuedo-scientists attempting to wish a history and background
that may, or may not exist.

Cydonia is not going away! It has been around for a long, long time and
there is no reason to believe it is going to disappear in the next week,
month or year. I am simply not certain at this time, that anything other
than natural formations of land structures through natural erosion took
place.

Imaging will occur over this region once the Mars Surveyor arrives. It may
take some time; the first images may not be from the high-res imager, but;
if there are real scientifically 'provable' artificial structures as
proposed by those mentioned above, you can well bet that NASA/JPL WILL
obtain the best images possible. And, if there was any real scientific
proof of unnatural 'artificial' structures in the Cydonia region today you
can well bet NASA/JPL would place it on its highest priority. There is
simply no proof. Scientists can not avoid a true mystery, they can avoid
one that is obviously false.

Perhaps NASA/JPL are doing what scientists should do and that is to better
understand how Mars came to be what it is today. With a clearer
understanding of Mars and its geological history then perhaps we will be
better suited to explore the anomalies associated with the Cydonia region.

Lilly also didn't like this entity and thought its aims were inhuman.
Note that The Scientist also mentions some of Lilly's childhood, which
was, to say the least, dismal. There's a well known psychological
mechanism known as projection in which despised parts of one's own
experience are seen as external agencies. LSD and other psychedelics
(including Ketamine) amplify inner experience, and this includes
projections.

Of course the Extropian and Transhuman view is to embrace this
developing entity, either as a symbiosis or extension of the future
self, a POV which I find preferable....

Which is about 2^16, which implies since the search time is about
2^keylength, that most of these estimates are based on brute force
searches for keys instead of any genuine analysis. Bigger, Faster, Just
as Dumb as Always.

If we work backwards, the keylength which will resist ALL brute force
searches is computable. We have 10^80 particles in the Universe, 10^18
seconds age of the Universe, assume a clock rate of 10^12 ops/second,
giving 10^110 ops, which is about 2^390, so a 390 bit key will suffice.
Note that this presumes a computer with a processor for every atom in
the universe, running at a teraflop speed, for the age of the universe.

So a 512 bit key should do quite nicely. (and is a power ot 2)

I've always had mixed feelings about jury nullification.  Jefferson was
surely right that jury nullification is one final bulwark against tyranny,
but on the other hand, few things can compare to the injustice that can be
doled out by a jury gone wrong in contradiction to the law and the facts.
 I'm especially guarded about the system we have in which 12 "average" people
are asked to consider highly technical matters in complex commercial cases or
cases in which scientific evidence plays a key role.  

The jury system developed in an environment in which there really weren't any
truly complex cases:Twelve average folks can surely determine as well as any
judge whether John skewered Robert with his broadsword or whether Henry
defrauded Jane out of her herd of sheep.  But when asked to consider whether
security interests were perfected in thousands of lending transactions
involving as many documents, or whether the DNA evidence raises a high enough
statistical probability of guilt to support a murder conviction (hmmmm) . . .
we sometimes see some pretty unjust results from juries of "laymen".
 Consider that the crucial evidence in a modern case may involve technical
issues about which experts who have invested years of their lives studying
may disagree, and that a jury is asked to make a decision based on at most a
few weeks of testimony.  Then consider that our jury selection rules will
often result in the empaneling of the LEAST qualified set of people that can
be selected . . .

THE DECLARATION OF INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with others, and to
assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which
they may choose to aspire, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the
separation. We hold that no truths are self-evident, but must have their
usefulness demonstrated. That all people are created with equal freedom from
tyranny, but frequently accept domination or obedience to a legal code, to a
greater or lesser degree from person to person. That people are endowed with
only what rights they have chosen to be endowed with, through wisdom or
common folly, for wealth or ilth. That people can secure for themselves, with
understanding of their own unique situations, those rights which best allow
them to live in fruitful harmony with other people. That whenever any person,
Government, or other entity, not fully recognizing the unique situation of
each individual, becomes in any way oppressive or destructive, people may
choose to ignore, alter or abolish such an institution, and to live in
whatever manner they decide, with understanding of the situation, will allow
them whatever conflict or harmony they so require for their happiness and
survival. That man can choose to resolve any conflict through intelligence,
with, adequate communication and a full understanding of each and every point
of view involved, by each and every person involved. Prudence, indeed, will
dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and
transient causes, but only after calm consideration of the True Will and
mutual goals of all those individuals involved. All experience has shown that
people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right
themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a
long train of abuses and usurpations evinces a design to reduce them under
absolute Despotism or Dogma not chosen by the individual concerned, it is
their right, it can be their choice, to throw off such a Governmentand to
accept responsibility, each for their own future security.

The most apparent difficulty herein lies in the general inability of people
to understand the specific direction of their unique organism, or,
understanding it, to make the firm resolve necessary to shake free the
shackles of cultural conditioning and Dogma accepted through poorly
considered indoctrination. Therefore, those of us who now declare their
individual autonomy (and this document speaks only for those who freely
choose to do so) are faced with a potentially arduous task of
self-examination, compounded by the resistance encountered from those who do
not comprehend the changes engendered by this individual declaration. But the
rewards of this liberation are enormous, being the very fulfillment of each
individual's own nature, and therefore the nature of the human race as a
whole. Those of us who choose to accept this self-responsibility do so, we
believe, for the advantage of all.

The crimes against individuals by those who blindly group together under the
flags of Governments, religions, and other institutions are too numerous to
fully discuss, but can be categorized in the following way: Actual
legislation which limits the freedom of individuals in speech, worship,
thought, and any actions which do not, themselves, infringe upon the freedoms
of others; Cultural norms, taboos, peer pressures, moral codes and any other
influences which likewise limit the freedoms of individuals.

It should be strongly emphasized that we recognize that various dogmas,
models and systems are necessary for the harmonious growth of humanity, but,
in all things, these can be the choice of the individual. If one person and
another believe that it is their will to band together for a specific
purpose, under delineated restrictions, then they are free to do so, given
that their purpose still respects and allows the differing beliefs and
actions of those who stay apart from their group. If one person believes that
it is his will to stand apart from all others, then he is free to do so,
given that he does not interfere with the free behavior of any other. In the
same manner, the dogma or meta-dogma of this Declaration is intended to apply
only to those who freely choose to accept it as being beneficial or useful in
the attainment of their own True Will.

We, therefore, the people of the planet Earth who choose to accept
responsibility for our own lives, do publish and declare that we can be FREE
AND INDEPENDENT PEOPLE, that we are absolved from all allegiance to any
dogma, system or code that we have not chosen for ourselves, that we as
individuals have full power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,
establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which individual
People may of right do.

For list members unfamiliar with jury nullification, here's a bit of
background.

In the very first jury trial before the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief
Justice John Jay instructed the jury in this way: "It is presumed, that
juries are the best judges of facts; it is on the other hand, presumed
that courts are the best judges of law. But still both objects are
within your power of decision... you have a right to take it upon
yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as the
fact in controversy". State of Georgia vs. Brailsford (3 Dall 1)

Jurors not only have the duty to decide guilt or innocence, but also the
"equity", or "inequity", of the law for which the defendant is accused.
This means that juries have the ability to acquit a defendant based upon
their own ideas of right and wrong, fairness, and their own conscience.
If they feel that the laws against marijuana possession are unjust and
unfair, then jury nullification suggests that they vote for acquittal,
regardless of the judge's instructions. 

Because a jury's guilty verdict must be unanimous, it takes only one
vote to effectively NULLIFY an unjust law. Regardless of legislative
intent, or a judge's instructions to the jury, the jury, not the court,
will make the decision to acquit. Though this may only cause a "hung"
jury, and it won't be a true acquittal, at least the defendant will not
be convicted of violating an unjust or unconstitutional law. Very often,
defendants are not retried by the government, due to the high cost
involved, and in this way juries send a very clear and powerful message.

Why does the ability to talk have anything to do with consciousness? A
computer can talk, but someone with cerebral palsy might not be so able.
Hobbes (?) would agree that the use of language is what separates man
from animal. I don't think he went so far as to say it is what makes us
conscious. 

As far as the second criteria, I agree that self-awareness is necessary
to consciousness, indeed I think it is the definition of consciousness. 

In order to be self-aware, a system must have two things 1) will and 2)
power.

Will is the ability to self-direct (L. volo) according to one's own
self-interest.

Power is the abilitiy to warp (L. inflecto) the normal course of events.
If something exists it by definition must have a certain measure of
power.

So a system is self-aware if it can discuss its experiences? I think the
more distilled version of this is if a system can understand and use the

Either we have to learn to deal with it (opting for the Dyson
scenario), or we have to change it. Baby universes are neat, but has
anybody looked at the possibility of "closing off" a part of the
universe by moving mass around?

We'll see. So far it sounds like it has not been reviewed; the
question is far from settled.

Drexler's vision of nanotech involves self-replication in a big way.  Howeve
Neil Stephenson (i think) in his book "Diamond Age" speaks of "Sources" and
"Matter Compilers"

A source is a place where air and water is sucked in and disassemble into
their component atoms...said atoms being either stored or reassembled into
convient building blocks.

A Matter compiler is a device which takes a program...then uses the stored
atoms to build whatever the program specifies.

It would seem to me that this would sidestep the "Grey Goo" scenario. (Whew!)

To me...this seems more easily obtained...since self-replication appears
HARD...whereas we already have the Matter Compiler Technology....only on a
Macro scale...(assembly lines...etc)  so all we gotta do is shrink
it.....severely.

No.  A conscious machine does not need to communicate in such a way, would
you say that someone who cannot speak and hear is not conscious?  Surely
seeing and feeling are enough to know you exist.  Even if I never tell anyone

The last thing the world need is more 'Turing style' tests.  Do you really
think the Turing test is a good way to detect machine intelligence?  Any
discussions we have with something so different what not be anything like
talking to a human.  In the same way, many different forms of consciousness
exist and they are all so different that such a test would not prove
consciousness, it would only prove similar lines of thought sorrounding
consciousness.

I agree that we need a definition of consciousness, but this is far from it.

I think there are two things we are talking about in these posts.

*Being aware - the very idea that I am conscious and I am looking out at the
universe.

*How I relate the physical to the abstract (that which exists in my mind) -
How I see blue.. how you see blue, and how we relate seeing that colour to
emotion.

Yes, I think this is the right interpretation.  I don't think the nanotech
in the book is capable of self-replication.  The reasons are not very
clear, but perhaps it is in part due to some technical difficulty (hard
to understand what, though), and in part it is pretty clear for political
reasons.  The range of designs which can be built from the Feed is limited,
and this gives the suppliers of the Feed political influence and control.
So they have little incentive to try to develop self-replication.

Instead, an underground research project is implemented, using some kind
of bizarre mix of nanotech and biology, sex as computation.  This is an
effort to generate the Seed, an alternative which will free the world
from dependence on the Feed.  The Seed is self-replicating, able to grow
using available environmental resources.

What happens before the engineers put something on paper and prototyped
is not part of the engineering process, it is market research. That the
market can't pull its head out of its proverbial ass is in no way the
fault of the engineers.

I don't address it because in the context of our dicussion, my assertion
is that our most likely alien visitors will not be that much farther up
the technological scale than we are, contrary to most people's
fetishistic fantasies of technological paradise in alien civilization.
Given this, they will have not had enough experience in interstellar
length missions to be able to overengineer their vehicles for the
operating regeime.

I worked on those particular hogs, sir. I do know what pigs they are
considered now compared to other newer planes. When they were new, they
were the hottest shit in the skies. I was a phase dock inspection cheif
for the electro-environmental systems at Cannon AFB, working on the D
model. I also did work on the flight line. WHile they are bigger than
the F-14, they are not bigger than the Crusader nor the E-2. With its
swing wings, it actually can come in at a rather low speed. Like I said,
in order to make that plane useful to a carrier crew in the 60's all it
would have needed were a couple of body struts and heavier duty landing
gear.

SOrry, the Ardvaark is not any heavier than other planes which land
regularly on aircraft carriers, and would not have posed any additional
wear on the decks.

In the end, granted, the F-111 is an example of the worst top level
compromise of specs, but that has absolutely nothing to do with the
engineering. If an engineer is told to build such and so a plane for a
given budget, he or she goes and designes the best damn plane they can
for those requirements.

Why do you take the worst examples alone? How about the best examples,
like the 747-400, the F-15, etc.

The shuttle was an obvious abortion produced by a specs committee that
couldn't agree on what it wanted. Typical 70's politics. THis does not
mean that the shuttle does that compromise mission to the best of its
abilities.

The Space station isn't even a product of engineering yet, so you can't
even include it in this argument. The station has been used to spread as
much pork around as possible, with no plan to actually build something.
Every new administration and congress feels that it has to redesign it
in order to get their own names on the project. You seem to be confusing
the inability fo the customer to decide what it wants and whether it
wants to pay for it with the engineers ability to deliver what the
customer says it wants.

The B-1A was designed for high altitude supersonic penetration, low
altitude attack. When word came through intelligence channels that newer
russian radars were specifically designed to pick up returns from
supersonic shock waves, that nixed the whole supersonic idea. Then
Carter nixed the B-1A.

On came Reagan with the revamped B-1. By this time, the AF had
formulated that a low altitude (nape fo the earth) subsonic flight
regieme was the best way to penetrate Soviet defenses, so the specs for
the new B-1B were changed from that of the B-1A, which is why it has a
different model type specification.

In its particular flight regeime, it can outfly the B-52 by a huge
margin, and is much more stealthy.

Because I acknowledge that with simple planes flying in low subsonic
ranges with no aerobatic use, they can be easily overengineered due to
the length of time we have been flying in that regieme. Materials
technology can just barely handle the upper limits of our present top
flight regeimes.

Sorry, I see the ace in your sleeve. An RPV is a remotely piloted
vehicle, hardly a category  which has had millions of hours of
engineering and flight time yet. Now standard man rated ultralights are
an area I'd bet on. I'd even bet on a particular plane: the Paraplane.

Its rather simple. If we can make it as screwed up as we are, then the
law of regression to the norm says that the most likely aliens we will
meet will be just as screwed up as we are, not some fantastic
technological and socioloigically perfect gods.

No, I beleive that engineers usually don't screw up big engineering. I
personally view engineers on one side and politicians and bureaucrats on
the other in a planet wide battle of building and destroying. That we
succeed in spite of politicians and bureaucrats says volumes about
engineers.

So you've gone a million miles at or around 55 mph. Ever broken a
fanbelt? A radiator hose? a valve or valve lifter? I know the U-joints
on the drive shafts of those babies tend to go...

Ever get stuck in the middle of nowhere with a breakdown?

Now, you were operating in a flight regieme of constant surface contact
in a range of 0-75 mph on well paved roadways, that has billions of
manhours of research and engineering behind it, as well as 100 years of
operation of over a billion vehicles under similar conditions. That is
probably the largest engineering base to support the level of technology
in all of our civilization, and they still can't make a starter solenoid
that lasts the life of the vehicle or a cooling system that can run
through the desert without specialized mods.

Commerical airliners, similarly, have a huge database of flight time,
test, and basic research behind them, so much so that they are the
safest form of transportation around. Yet they still crash, don't they?
Most recently, we have one that blew up over Long Island for no reason
that anyone can agree on, one that lawn darted into the Everglades
because oxygen containers were loaded in the cargo hold, several more
whose wings shattered in  blizzards over the midwest, and numerous
others whose radar and navigation systems weren't good enough to see
mountains in front of them. Locally here in NH, nobody has yet found
that Learjet that dissapeared Christmas Eve after aborting a landing at
our fog draped airport.

When I made my original post, regarding how the claims of abduction of 1
in 40 persons do not jive with my analysis that shows that given that
abduction rate, we should be seeing a crash rate between 1-12 UFOs per
year. In this instance, I was using commercial airline figures for crash
rates, which are the best around, because I was envisioning these
supposed aliens as operating their abduction operation like an airline.
One fact I left out of my post is that this analysis projected an alien
population on earth of between 40,000 - 100,000 beings needed to provide
support, logisitics, and crewing for this fleet that should range
somewhere between 1000-5000 vehicles. That none of these illegal aliens
have been discovered by our press, or by mom and pop with their shotguns
is indicative of the ludicrousness of the whole abduction thing.

BINGO! And why is that, pray tell? Because jury selection isn't really about
selecting peers of the defendant, it's about sandbagging. This may be
business as usual, but is it *right*?

The scientific books already mentioned are indeed favorite readings. To
broaden horizons and introduce other important  modes of thinking, you might
consider reading the following to fully exploit your brain power!

_Creativity_, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
_Toward A Psychology Of Being_, Abraham H. Maslow
_The Farther Reaches of Human Nature_, Abraham Maslow
Anything by De Bono

These books explore developed intelligence and well-being by engineering the

Kauffman nets (randomly wired graphs) show a very interesting
property: if the ratio of edges/nodes goes over the threshold
of 0.5, most nodes crystallize into one giant, interconnected
domain. A classical phase transition, obviously: gradual
change, before, gradual change, after; a very rapid change,
interim.

This has some impacts onto the grassroot nets I've been
proposing for years (seasoned denizens will probably remember.
Several people came up with related schemes, it is probably a
FAQ item somewhere). But let's describe the status quo first, to
learn what exactly what, if anything, is amiss with the way we
are accustomed to do things just now.

Currently, there is a sharp boundary between the consumer and
the provider. Single users have to pay the telcos for use of
their comm lines, the providers for bandwidth and computational
resource. In some, less advanced regions of the world, a telco
monopoly still prevails. Behind it, hides the ISP semimonopoly,
attempting to maximize profits by keeping newcomers out. It
won't hold for long for sure, but damage's done, already.

On the other side of the spectrum, bottom-up networking has
begun. We have the CAN bus on the side of the microcomputer
embeddeds, IBM's PAN via the "handshake" protocol, ethernet
networking in the flat; between home PCs, IrDA (now extended to
4 MBit/s) to talk to the portable, wireless modems, and the
like. With the recent advent of cheap multiport cards, 10/100
switches, GBit ethernet, and plastic fiber optics relatively
impressive hardware will become available to the home user.

In a very real sense, random interlinking has already begun. It
is possibly only a question of time, before adjacent domains
crosslink and coalesce, resulting in a larger nucleus. Its
participants profit mutually, as a linkup has emergent
properties (distributed storage, resource sharing, etc.) If we
extrapolate this way into the future, we'll get a global
grassroot net.

A quick sketch, how this can be possibly accomplished.

Birds of a feather flock together. This also applies to likewise
minded individuals. In some regions the critical potential user
density is already reached. A (possibly boosted) IrDA module, a
pair of magnifying bathroom mirrors (to collimate the 30 deg
beam), and a PPP infrared link across the street is in place.
Links along the street may form a pretty good backbone, ranging
for many 100 m even with primitive optics. There are few
problems assotiated with a twisted pair network in the house
(current loops), put galvanic potential-separating cheap optical
fiber is around the corner. Using laser diodes and directed
microwave links will be the next step.

Many users object to let their machines run 24 h/day, also most
OSses show too limited performance and availability (two
free Unix users won't probably find any of this very demanding).
A hardware solution is in order, which may well be based on a
dedicated embedded solution, or on embedded PCs running Linux,
or, possibly, (embedded) Java in the near future. A low-cost
solution would use (optocoupled, or optical (IrDA)) RS232, a
more expensive one, ethernet. The system must be performant
enough to be able to handle several channels simultaneously (in
some cases a simple crossbar may already suffice, in some
interim storage and packet checking might be mandatory). The
system must come in a rugged, atmosphere-proof case, large
enough to contain a buffering battery (in case the system is
powered by a solar cell, crucial for a standalone relais).
The basic idea here is that users own the hardware, and do some
very limited maintance.

There are several things to tackle: nanocash packet accounting
(to prevent network abuse), firewalling (agents should be able
to live in the boxes, but not to enter your home machine & to
do some havoc there), and a geodetic routing design.

The latter point is tough. Ubiquitous networking will need a
very different routing scheme than current TCP/IP. Constraints
like visibility demand such a scheme (tesselating space in
addressable voxels, which can be occupied by a hardware box).
The latter demands a huge address space. If you can imagine a
mm^3 voxel sphere ranging to beyond GEO, you might notice that
IPng has got a problem (the raw address space would suffice).
In the routing scheme there should be no difference between
routing and switching. Boxes, knowing their spatial address
(from GPS, and/ultrasonic, or vis LPS), can select the nearest
one. The benefits are twofold: you can't fake your address,
since your neighbouring boxes would notice the tampering, and
won't route your packet. Additionally, this gives a great means
for automated traffic routing, whether for humans, or agents.
(Remember a recent aerobot thread).

This could go on for hours, I obviously have to truncate. Such a
routing scheme appears devisable, using orthogonized hypercubes:
hypergrids, or, lattices. Their capability to handle wraparound
at address space boundaries fits nicely with curved spheres,
both of surface, and orbital configurations. With some effort, a
fuzzy routing scheme probably could be devised, which derives
fuzzy addresses from wiring constraints.

Comments?

ciao,
'gene

P.S. I've got a related problem: I'd like to wire up with
friends of mine living in the vicinity to share an ISP backlink
to be able to use cable modems, which are unidirectional (all
thanks to my favourite monopoly (Telekomiker)).

P.P.S Just hooked up a tiny PC keyboard to my Newt130. The Newt
(especially the Newt2000) is imo a pretty interesting minimal
wearable platform, since both offering computational oomph (the
NTK, a sofware developer set is available for free for download,
and comes bundled with many Newton developer books, it allows
the use of NewtonScript, reminiscent of Java, and native code
as well), and is not too demanding in terms of power burned).
Of course the peculiar demands of a wearable (which are weird,
and many) demand a hackbox.

Michael:

OK, now I understand where things stand.

It's always a pleasure to meet another "experienced gambler"
--unless you both happen to be sitting at the same table. :)

Maybe my crew chief was embellishing, maybe not--but he was there,
and the fact that, e.g., supply planes or P3s come in that heavy 
is not at all the same thing as operating squadrons of jets that
have similar loads. But OK, you may be right--gee, after all 
that development, why wasn't the B variant fielded? 
Because it turned out to be a bad idea. There is no intrinsic
shame in that, but there was pork in the process that led
to a "large turning radius". That was my intended point.

I know there are aerospace success stories, and I know how 
they sometimes get scotched, too--see the rise and fall of 
the DC-X, and NASA's lame "oh, gee, don't know where we 
can scrape up money" story. There are none so blind...

By the way, the real aces up my sleeve were aircraft 
such as Paraplanes *and* the fact that I said 
"'til failure" of either the airframe or the powerplant.
Run an RPV into the ground and your maintenance hours 
could be _zero_. :) 

Darn, there goes my free Zoche. :)

Anyway: it's down to your believing that we're such a hot 
radio item that our first visitors will (/have) come in the first
thing they can bolt together that will make the trip. Correct?

Plus you believe that operating hours for space vehicles 
_must_ be roughly equivalent (re: wear) to our experience 
with aircraft operating near our turbulent, corrosive little 
rockball under the political pressures we both acknowledge 
exist here in the good ol' US of A.

Can't prove you're wrong, old son; but you gussy it up like it
was more than a guess. :)

Have to strongly disagree with you.  What is best is what the majority wants,
as you are not the majority you can only ever be second best.  (Actually
third, 'cause i'm second).

The difference is - now we have the technology to keep the indivual informed
and to stop the rise of government.  In the anarchy which gave birth to
government we did not have the information or the economy to support
ourselves so we were easy targets for criminal protection rackets (or
governments as they call themselves).

My understanding of anarchy is no government. To have a corporation in
the sense I'm using, you have to have government. No government, no
corporations.

Yep, crazy idea... There was a discussion of these balloons on the
cypherpunks list a few months ago and apparently they mostly landed on the
West Coast; the only known casualties were a couple of people in Oregon. 

BTW, these aren't the Mogul project balloons; those were supposed to
float over Russia looking for evidence of nuclear explosions.

I don't mind joint ownership or joint contracting, as long as the state
doesn't absolve the individual owners of responsibility and/or treat
"them" as and abstract "person." I'm not a expert on corporate law, but
I do know that a bunch of guys can get a charter from a state, slap INC.

the same group who decided not to incorporate would.

It's a short but difficult book and sometimes downright weird, but

an anarcho-capitalist society in Machinery of Freedom (I can't remember,

And it wasn't suited for the bomber role either; the idea being that it
would survive by using terrain-following radar to fly in under the air
defence radar. Lockheed were pushing for fighter and bomber derivatives of
the SR-71 -- flying at 70,000+ feet and Mach 3+ to simply outrun any
defences -- and conducted tests to prove that the YF-12 (the fighter
derivative prototype) could happily cruise along up there blowing F111s
out of the sky as they crawled along at ninety feet. Not to mention that
something like 50% of the F111 bombers stationed in Britain flew
themselves into the ground in training. 

Lousy aircraft, like most political designs. Particularly lousy terrain
following radar.

As one of the most vociferous Linux people around here I'd agree with
pretty much everything you said; at this point in time I'd certainly tell
new computer buyers to go for Windows rather than Linux, but my main
concerns are with configuration and compatibility. Software similar to the
Control Panel on MacOS and Windows would solve most of the configuration
issues and Wine is starting to get somewhere on the compatibility front.

P.S. Microsoft's new distributed operating system that someone mentioned
sounds remarkably like 'Plan 9'... and I think Helios was doing something 
similar on transputers a decade ago.

Why does it need to communicate at interstellar distances? Surely it can
just send a low-power directional signal to a relay in orbit which does
the hard work?

However, their first interstellar missions will be unmanned and if they
find life on other planets they're unlikely to be in any hurry to contact
them. You're also assuming that this *is* their first interstellar
mission, when seems unlikely. That would require that they are within a
century or two of our level of development after ten billion years.

This I kind of agree with; it's something I've been musing about lately.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

We discussed the Doomsday argument briefly on this list about
half a year ago, but didn't reach a definite conclusion. Considering
that it is a potential refutation of the core of the transhumanist
world-view, I think it is pertinent to bring it up again. --Here
is a quick recapitulation:

The Doomsday argument was conceived by the astrophysicist
Brandon Carter some fifteen years ago, and it has since been
developed in a Nature article by Richard Gott [1993], and in
several papers by philosopher John Leslie and especially in his
recent monograph The End of The World (Leslie [1996]). The core 
idea is this. Imagine that two big urns are put in front
of you, and you know that one of them contains ten balls and
the other a million, but you are ignorant as to which is which.
You know the balls in each urn are numbered 1, 2, 3, . N. Now you
take a ball at random from the left urn, and it is number 7.
Clearly, this is a strong indication that that urn contains only
ten balls. If originally the odds were fifty-fifty, a swift
application of Bayes' theorem gives you the posterior probability
that the left urn is the one with only ten balls.
(Pposterior (L=10) = 0.999990). But now consider the case where
instead of the urns you have two possible human races, and
instead of balls you have individuals, ranked according to birth
order. As a matter of fact, you happen to find that your rank
is about sixty billion. Now, says Carter and Leslie, we should
reason in the same way as we did with the urns. That you should
have a rank of sixty billion or so is much more likely is
only 100 billion persons will ever have lived than if there will be
many trillion persons. Therefore, by Bayes' theorem, you should
update your beliefs about mankind's prospects and realise that
an impending doomsday is much more probable than you have
hitherto thought.

I have recently written a paper on the DA which is
available at

http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/140797/doomsday.htm

For people who think they have an easy refutation, it might be worth
to take a look at Leslie's book, where many standard objections
are successfully countered.

And which (AFAIK) was never mentioned until the 1980 book (Berlitz?),
*thirty-three years* after the supposed crash, and even then there were
no first-hand accounts. Yet from the number of supposed 'witnesses' crawling 
out of the woodwork most of the population of New Mexico seems to have seen 
the crash site, shaken hands with the aliens, bought the T-shirt and taken 
souvenirs which miraculously disappeared later on. How come not one of these 
people spoke about it to a UFO investigator for over thirty-three years? 

And if it really happened and the USAF managed to cover it up for
thirty-three years, how come they came up with such a supposedly lame
cover story? Why would a super-powerful Air Force which could keep an
alien saucer crash secret for a third of a century suddenly turn around
and say that their communication records were destroyed, rather than
creating a bulletproof cover story from scratch? Would that have convinced
any of the saucer-freaks anyway? (note that it's not just the "Roswell
incident" records which are missing, it's most of the records from March
1945 to December 1949 and this was apparently common practice at the time; 
how long do you expect the Air Force to keep records about crashed 
balloons?). 

Note also that Marcel, one of the primary 'witnesses for the prosecution'
was reported in the 1980 book as stating that the photographs showing him
with the debris did in fact show the materials he found at the ranch;
debris which appears to be a 1940s-era radar reflector as used on the
Mogul balloons. So it would seem that either he found a radar reflector or
his testimony is suspect; either way the Roswell myth starts to fall apart
merely on that count. 

The evidence from the time supports the balloon theory. Everything else is
merely hearsay more than a third of a century after the fact. There is
*not one piece* of physical evidence for the crash theory, otherwise the
vast majority of us would be convinced. 

	Mark

P.S. Odd, isn't it, that there are so many Roswell believers on a list 
which rails against Velikovsky for lack of evidence?

And the 'saucers' reported by Roswell 'witnesses' aren't? (But odd that
this material which is supposedly so indestructable could be torn into
little pieces in a crash).

Yes, it is. Cruising at 0.98c is hardly a harsh flight regime if you have
a shield ahead to catch debris impacts. After your engines shut down
you're simply cruising for years until you reach your destination. Landing
and take-off are also the most extreme parts of an airliner's flight
regime, but they still have to keep their engines running for the whole
trip. And, of course, the crew can't maintain the plane as it's flying,
which alien astronauts could. 

Let's compare this to shuttle maintenance, qualitatively the closest
current approximation: the effort required to overhaul a shuttle is almost
fixed regardless of whether it's in space for two days or two weeks. The
vast majority of maintenance is related to launch and landing, which both
happen precisely once per flight. Longer flights merely require more minor
maintenance like removing more garbage, adding more fuel for the fuel
cells, greater chance of having to replace a window damaged by debris etc.
The second the shuttle engines ignite you're up for thousands of man-hours
of work, even if it doesn't launch. 

Finally, I find it highly unlikely that aliens as technologically backward
as the Roswell reports imply could travel interstellar distances in their
little saucers. Far more likely they'd be simple planetary transports
which would have been in storage until they reached Earth, then serviced
thoroughly before flight.

Precisely; and how much of the increase in maintenance on modern military
aircraft is simply an increase in the amount of 'heavy looking on', or
badly-designed maintenance programs? 

Ben Rich mentioned that the massive Air Force oversight to ensure that 
they didn't charge for any $600 hammers greatly increased the cost of the 
Stealth (not-)Fighter, probably by far more than corruption in the company 
could have done. NASA have on occasion found tools inside a shuttle after it 
returned and discovered that three inspectors all signed off the forms to 
say that those tools were removed. This is why I was concentrating on 
commercial aviation, where there's a great incentive to minimize the 
required maintenance and oversight.

AFAIK the CIA started out with the original single-seat A-12, but the USAF
bought two-seat SR-71s from Lockheed instead; I don't think that any
aircraft were transferred over, but I don't have my books handy to check.
Also, AFAIK NASA were maintaining their SR-71s with a CIA-sized crew, and
those aircraft were around twenty-five years old (although I don't think
they flew as often).

But pretty widespread in 40s SF. In any case, most of those claims weren't
made until the early eighties, by which time they'd moved on to 80s
technology and SF. Hal's already elaborated on this anyway.

Ah, they've moved on to 90s SF. How do they know they were 'nanoassembled'? 
Do they have any evidence whatsoever that they were scientists working 
there, that these materials exist and that they saw them? 

Or is this just more hearsay?

Note, supposedly. AFAIK there's no evidence to back any of this up. More
to the point Corso apparently spent twenty years in military intelligence
and has a long-standing grudge against the CIA. He's hardly someone I'd
trust as a source.

By firsthand accounts I was referring to those who could actually prove
they were there; for example the folks who worked on the Air Force base. 
Preferably people writing their own books or articles, rather than
reported interviews, and ideally those who said something less than fifty
years after the supposed incident occured.

I'd have to check up more on that. I've already commented on Marcel in
another message (his testimony seems to support the balloon theory),
according to contemporary news reports Brazel said that the 'flying disc'
was about four feet by six inches (three feet in another report) and 
appeared to be made of tinfoil, consistent with the balloon theory. I can't 
comment on the funeral director, other than to point out that an Air Force 
capable of keeping such a story secret for a third of a century would have 
been smart enough to build their own coffins. Amazing how they can be so 
smart one moment and so stupid the next, is it not?

Which materials technology problem? The first-hand accounts don't seem to
show any problem, and the material in the photographs, which Marcel said
*was the material he found at the ranch*, appears to be the material used
to make Mogul radar reflectors. It was also, AFAIR, quite creased and
wrinkled, contradicting the supposed 'indestructible' accounts. 

And again, why did supposedly 'indestructible' material break up into
little pieces when the 'disc' crashed? We have a major contradiction here.

Because, as far as I can see from the report, they didn't know it was a
Mogul balloon until it was examined at Wright-Patterson, and even if they
did they wouldn't want to leave it lying around for reporters to examine
because they wanted to keep the program secret. Why pass classified
information on to the folks at Roswell rather than ship the balloon out
for examination as quickly as possible. 

(And what does he mean by 'balloon materials'? The payload was the 
important evidence, not the balloon itself, which AFAIK was just a 
standard weather balloon).

But not until more than a third of a century later, *after* the Roswell
Industry got into full swing and they could make a buck out of it. Odd
that. There are no contemporary reports of wreckage or alien bodies. Not
one. AFAIR there aren't even any first-hand accounts in the 1980 book.

I have to ask why?

Is your argument that a corporation necessarily requires a settled law
of business organizations? If so, then its certainly possible under
Friedman's model (i.e., privately-produced corporate law).

If not, then are you arguing that without *governmental recognition* of
the corporate entity a corporation cannot exist? If so, as I've argued
before, this is merely a legal fiction and has no real-world
significance other than tax-filing benefits -- a moot point in anarchy.

At this point yes, though recent RedHat, Debian, and whatnots are
purported to be suprisingly painless to install. Even the process of
recompiling the kernel could be hidden from the user (but it is backwards,
there must be a better way to load modules at runtime). 

The point is where Linux is heading towards, or, rather, where Microsoft
is _not_ heading towards. The dynamics is very exciting. It can be
extrapolated that a few years from now both the installation, the kernel,
the interoperability, and the supplied software base will make Wintel look
very paltry in comparison (unless they improve mightily, which they so 
far have failed to provide). Intel chipsets can't cache more then 64 
MBytes, haha. Pentium II can't cache more than 512 MBytes, hihi. 
Braindead hardware, fit to run zombie OSses and bureau apps. There are 
even users (zombies?) who like it.

Microsoft never produces anything new, it's axiomatic. It's products

their marketing is a desaster.

Okay, I'm beginning to understand where you're coming from here.

First, we must distinguish between ownership and directorship. The
owners of a corporation are you and me, the stockholders. Typically, in
all but the most extreme of circumstances, stockholders are not liable
for corporate stupidity. There's a mess of criteria involved in
"piercing the corporate veil" in this way, but they're not really
relevant here. Suffice it to say that people incorporate in order to own
a portion of the company, hire someone to run it, and then forget about
it and collect the dividends.

A directorship is entirely different. If the director is not an owner,
then see my earlier post about when he or she can be nailed for stupid
decisions. If the director is an owner (i.e., shareholder) the
directorship rules hold as far that person's liability. That is, a
director can't defend himself against a lawsuit by saying, "Hey! I'm a
shareholder! You can't get me!" That's a no-go.

If every shareholder were liable for corporate foul-ups, this, IMHO,
would be absolutely unjust. Indeed, for every director to be immediately
liable for corporate foul-ups would also be unjust (but less so). I see
no problem with the current system of collecting the sum of the group's
business activities together under the entity XYZ, Inc. and then nailing
the entire complex for the foul-up.

Why are you assuming at the outset a 50/50 chance of doomsday?

You are saying that there are two human races, one where doomsday
occurs, and one where it does not. Then you go on to predict how many
people will exist in the one where it does not. Actually there are an
infinite number of human races where doomsday does not occur, each with
a different number of people -- an infinite number of urns with
differing numbers of balls. 

Give me a billion urns (too little to begin with) each with a different
number of balls, and then tell me which urn has ten balls in it.

I might've missed your argument against this one in your paper.

        Or, to go even further out on a transhuman\automorphic limb, the
book _Art Objects_ by Jeanette Winterson is a tremendously good collection
of essays dealing with the immortal necessity of creativity in the present
and the future.  Also, check out _Brave New World Revisited_ by Aldous
Huxley.  Although it is an older book (1957), it contains many plausible
extropic solutions to overpopulation and other such social maladies.

It doesn't matter if the first is true.  There would have to be a reason

I personally don't believe the skies are full of aliens.  I do believe 
aliens have visited.  May have been a million years ago or 100000 or 50 or 
just last week.  I'm not a 'beam me up I love aliens' fanatic.  I do know 
the government can lie.  That's what pisses me off.

I remember reading a book back in the 60's about Roswell that talked of 
captured aliens.  Dunno how many others before then.  I'm not a devotee of 
UFO's.

I think I missed the original post on this one, but I am fascinated 
by the underlying assumption that one can develop into a 'whole', 
fully developed human by reading books!  I think that books can play 
an important role in learning, but there is no substitute for getting 
out there and living, taking risks, pushing yourself beyond your 
limits, making mistakes, enduring the hurt and the raptures.  Life 
events can be designed to provide experiential learning or boundary 
breaking (edge gaming), and one could look at life as one long 
experiment.

Well I've just tossed heads ten times in a row. Do you want to give me
better than fifty-fifty odds on heads coming up next? If we were able to
randomly select a new life out of all the possible lives that ever lived
and will live and found ourselves in the 20th C then I grant your argument
has some weight. But someone has to come first. I suppose you were standing
next to Neil Armstrong as he stepped up to the launch pad saying "If the
moon is reachable by people then its likely that lots of people will reach
it in the future. The chances that you would be the first are vanishingly
small. Many people have died in the past. Therefore its much more likely
that you will die rather than be the first person to reach the moon".

This has a very biblical ring to it "the first shall be last". Personally I
prefer a more Extropian version "the first shall be first..."

>> The whole debate of UFO's generally misses the important question, and The

>> but 'Why have we been visited by extraterrestrial civilizations?' 

Leaving aside the relativistic starship model, which hardly fits the
alleged ensemble of strange phenomena, I've never understood why the
default provenance of UFOs-as-artifacts  is thought to be an alien ET
civilisation using some faster than light drive or wormhole.  Since any
superluminal transport also requires time travel in some frames, it's more
parsimonious to posit that these alleged craft are from a future Earth.  

That's *why* the drivers look sort of Homo sap - they're our evolved and/or
posthumanly morphed offspring.  And that's why you can't nab the buggers -
any encounter sufficiently egregious to cause a lethal time loop (landing
on the White House lawns to say hi and pass over the zero point energy
equations) will either pinch out or be aborted by the meta-Time Patrol.
Sightings by `trailer trash' and timid astronomers, or even anally-obsessed
abductions, presumably have no long-term impact on the future history in
question, and can clear themselves up by attenuation.  

On the other hand, maybe they're visitors from adjacent Many Worlds
cultures.  Since there are an infnite number of these (by hypothesis),
there's plenty of sources and machine models.  If such craft break down, it
might be harder to retrieve them to the home plenum.  But then you'd expect
to see a far greater proportion of intelligent dinosaurs, etc.

As for Roswell, and to be serious for a moment - my problem with the Mogul
explanation is that nobody in the US defense establishment expected Soviet
nuclear weappns success until the mid-fifties (or so I'm told by my brother
Mick, the nuclear-movie specialist), so I can't see why they'd be running
weapons detection apparatus in 1947.  Sure, there's always trial
lead-time... but it sounds implausible to me.

Anarchy or agoriarchy can have corporations.  Any business partnership
that informs all of its customers--say, by having "Inc." in the name
as required by our system--is then making a contract offer to a fully
informed adult that says "by doing business with this company, you are
freely agreeing to limit any potential liability this company might bear
to the assests of the company, not to the total assests of all of its
owners."   If the customer doesn't like that, he can buy from Fred's
Widgets instead of WidgetCo, Inc.  No coercion, no government, but still
a limited liability corporation in a free market.

Subject: Are Beliefs Like Clothes?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Clothes are both "functional" and social.  Clothes are functional in that
they keep us warm and cool, protect us from injury, maintain privacy, help
us carry things, and enhance our figures.  But since they are usually
visible to others, clothes also allow us to identify with various groups,
to demonstrate our independence and creativity, and to signal our wealth,
profession, and social status.  The milder the environment, the more we
expect the social role of clothes to dominate the functional role.

Beliefs are also both functional and social.  Functionally, beliefs help
us choose our actions, given our preferences.  But many of our beliefs are
also social, in that others see and react to our beliefs.  So beliefs can
also allow us to indentify with groups, to demonstrate our independence
and creativity, and to signal our wealth, profession, and social status.

For example, a belief that the local sports team will do well can help me
associate with my locality.  A belief that my future looks bright can help
me attract a mate.  A belief that UFOs are aliens could help me signal
that I'm an independent thinker, while a belief that UFOs are bunk could
help me signal my scientific education.  A belief that a Democrat would
make a better president could help me signal my caring and concern about
others.

For subjects with little social monitoring and strong personal penalties
for incorrect beliefs, we expect the functional role of beliefs to
dominate.  Beliefs about small military missions or small engineering
projects come to mind.  But for subjects with high social interest and
little personal penalty for mistakes, we expect the social role of beliefs
to dominate.  Consider beliefs about large elections or beliefs addressing
abstract philosophical, religious, or scientifc questions.

If people could wear a parka undetected underneath a bikini, bikinis might
be in fashion in the Arctic, and Arctic folks wouldn't need to trade
off the functional and social roles of clothes.  Similarly, if people
could choose their external behavior independently of their internal
beliefs, then internal beliefs would never need to be anything but our
best computationally-feasible estimate of the way things really are.  But
since it is typically hard to say one think and believe another, the
functional and social roles of beliefs do conflict.

O.K.  Now that we realize this, what do we do?  I think it is a mistake to
assume that the solution is to educate people about how to better
construct more functional beliefs.  It is not obvious that, given typical
preferences over functional vs. social outcomes, people are biased toward
the social role of beliefs.  Of course more education on either role can
help people get better results without hurting the other role.  But more
education costs more, and it is not obvious that people are biased against
such educational spending.

The conflict between the functional and social roles of clothes has become
less of a concern with the invention of new materials and designs, and as
we have become rich enough to move to milder climates.  Similarly, I think
a key to reducing the conflict between the functional and social roles of
beliefs is to better understand both roles, espcially the
academically-neglected social role of beliefs.

Just as it seems that teenage smoking can't be reduced much without giving
teenagers good substitute ways to show their independence and coolness,
the social costs of mistaken beliefs about politics and UFOs probably
can't be reduced much without giving people good substitue ways to show
their concern and independence. But it is hard to create substitutes for
things until you understand in some detail the functions they now perform.

Also, the conflict between the functional and social role of beliefs can
be muted by the invention of better social institutions, such as
political parties or academic journals, to which people might delegate
their actions.  Within such institutions, social relations may be
structured so that social pressures are better aligned with functional
pressures on beliefs.  But, again, it is hard to design better
institutions with only the fuzziest understanding of these pressures.

Fortunately, innovation in clothes proceeded even without a deep
understanding of either fabrics or the social and functional roles of
clothes.  Similarly, belief complexes and social institutions have evolved
even without a deep understanding of the nature of computation and of the
social and functional roles of beliefs.  But there is reason to hope that,
as with clothes, such evolution may proceed faster with a deeper
understanding of these issues.

The issue is how Richter, in the original quotation, defines it, and
how most people who say things like that define it.  You, Robin, are
capable of reasoned argument, and I have no doubt that you have solid
reasons to disdain those you call "ideologues"--although you should
call them something that agrees better with a common dictionary.  The
word for what you describe is "fanatic"--"ideologue" does not have the
meaning you assign to it /except/ among those like Richter, and the
fact that it has evolved that connotation is precisely because of what
I claim; that those people really do have no respect for ideology, in
its normal denotative dictionary meaning.  They should not be charitably
interpreted as opposing only fanaticism, because their opposition to
ideology is dangerous and should be exposed and countered.

> Beliefs are also both functional and social...

Good essay.  I have often thought that the very institutions of belief
I despise in most contexts may serve important social goals that it
would be dangerous not to replace; thus I have suggested creating new
mythologies, holidays, gathering functions, etc.  Perhaps even the
irrational beliefs themselves serve some of those functions.  I would
not hesitate to create church-like or state-like social systems by
voluntary association to fill some of those roles.

Although I think you ignore what to me seems like an equally likely--
and more cynical--posibility: that people associtate with belief-
based social groups specifically to /hide/ their true beliefs.  That
people may be active Democrats, for example, to make people think they
care about the less fortunate without having to actually do any of the
hard work of genuinely caring.

Many, if not most people wear the clothes they wear because they feel
that they look good in them. Why would I put on an article of clothing
that I thought detracted from my appearance? In much the same way, to be
"clothed" in a belief system connotes a type of external showmanship
that may indeed be a way to cozy up to a certain group of people, or
even win a vote or two. 

Furthermore, beliefs cycle their way in and out of style much like the
latest fashions. Mainline Marxism has in many ways become out-of-style,
and instead, supplanted with the new, more flexible "Marx-based"
frameworks. The intelligentsia turn their noses up at "last season's
holdovers." Of course, to be cutting-edge you have to clothe yourself in
the lastest ideological style.

Good post, RH.

This seems like a good thread in which to say that the Transhuman/Extropian
book list is alive and well and living on my transhuman pages, on my
personal web site.

The URL is http://www.seraph.org/Trans/SKMbooks.html

The pages contain entries for work by over fifty authors, but I'd really
welcome any further reviews: the book list faq on the site explains the
format.

If there's enough interest in the list then I'll move it to the 'crf' pages
and reformat it appropriately.

Robin, I can't help think your analysis is wrong to omit some analysis of
communication and interaction in its discussion of belief (and, indeed, of
clothes.) Without the communication of your belief to another through some
form of interaction, vocal or otherwise, it does not serve a social
purpose. Moreover, since this interaction is a choice, it is a
manifestation of the functionality of the belief system, within your model.
The dichotomy between functional and social roles of belief is therefore
blurred: one function of belief is social differentiation.

Both these are good examples of my point, the second particularly: the
belief could help you _signal_ that you're an independent thinker. But it
is the signal which acts to fulfil a social role, and that signal is part
of the function of the belief.

Your definition of 'function' seems reflexive: a function is something
which acts on the 'wearer' of clothes or belief, whereas a social role is
something which involves the 'wearer' and at least one other. But I think
that the interaction of 'wearer' and other, necessary for a social role, is
as much a function as is the more reflexive warmth of the clothing, or
'inner contentment' of belief.

That assumes that the social role is less important than the functional
role merely because of the size of the 'society' involved. Why should that
be the case? Consider the mass suicides of cult members. These are small
societies, yet it is the social role, I would submit, which causes the
society following its leader and destroying itself. Perhaps the key here is
your phrase 'with little social monitoring': social is a relativistic term;
societies are myriad, inter-linked, sub-classed and interactive. An
argument based around the societal function of belief cannot presume a
single society against which to measure things such as monitoring.

One could argue that there is no trade-off at the moment. Warm clothes
function to keep the wearer alive, but also allow the wearer to move in an
outside environment and hence socially interact with others. (And I would
argue that this is a function of the clothes.) If your implication is that
the wearing of bikinis would allow the people of the Artic to fulfil a
further social role, then I think it is based on very Claifornia-centric
cultural beliefs: attraction is a very culturally-relative thing, and I'm
sure the people of the Artic have there own 'bikini-substitute'.

Consciously it is very easy to say one thing and believe another; in ones
everyday actions and interactions it may be more difficult. But does that
mean that the functional and social roles of beliefs conflict? I don't see
why that should follow. As I argue above, the social role of belief is one
of its non-reflexive functions. Furthermore, whilst belief may drive social
interaction, so may social interaction drive belief; Saul becomes Paul on
the road to Damascus. If one has a belief and acts upon it, where is the
conflict? If one wishes to act in a certain way but is prevented from doing
so by ones own belief system then one has a choice to make between amending
ones belief system or not acting in that way. But that is a choice to be
made, and, more likely than not, is one which will be made within the
context of the pre-existing belief system: belief system therefore informs
social action, and vice-versa. There is a dialogue between the two, not a
conflict.

<snip>

>espcially the academically-neglected social role of beliefs.

This is an area in which that are huge amounts of anthropological
literature available. Indeed, given the nature of ethnographic study, one
is almost forced to construct any paper on the basis of social role.

Which society? Mistaken in whose opinion? (Perhaps we should find

The problem is that to build a matter compiler you will likely need
self replication. I'm not 100% sure it is mentioned in Stephenson's
book (likely at the scene where Hackworth makes the Primer), but to
build a macro-object you need a large field of nanoassemblers (which
likely put it together using recursive assembly). How do you build
such a field? The most likely explanation is that it is built by
nanodevices; by assumption the assemblers are able to build most
molecular structures, nanodevices included, and would hence be a
cost-effective method of making assembler-fields; making each
assembler-field using bulk technology would make MCs prohibitively
expensive.

So, we have self-replicating nanodevices (assembler-fields) anyway.
In the book is it very likely that the designs for them are not in
the public domain and only used by the manufacturers of MCs, but it
is not a perfect protection against runaway replicators. Stephenson
simply ignores this problem, but it is clear that in order to get a
widely usable, cheap nanotechnology you need replicating assemblers
if only in the factory.

Not much; a closed universe rules out the steady state but an open
doesn't give any more information abouth whether the steady state
holds or not. Personally I doubt steady state theories since they
make the Fermi paradox much worse.

A very good point. I don't think anybody has assumed that one can
become human by reading books in this thread, it is mainly about what
books should be considered "required reading" or at least good
introductory reading to keep up with this list. 

It would be interesting to see if the process of becoming oneself
could be aided by artificial means; so far it has been largely a
random accumulation of experience and a gradual abstraction from
them. Schooling is one method intended to make this process a bit
more efficient, maybe some initiation rites could be considered
growth tools too. Are there others reliable methods?

Ok, here's Brazel's original testimony (for those who've avoided the issue
so far, Brazel is the rancher who found the 'alien debris') from the
Roswell Daily Record archive at:

	http://www.sierra-vista.com/roswell/rancher.html

Now remember, this is testimony direct from another of the Roswell
Industry's main witnesses... without Brazel and Marcel (the Air Force
officer who later collected the 'alien debris') there would be no story. 

>>> STARTS HERE

                         Harassed Rancher Who Located 'Saucer' Sorry He Told
                                  About It

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

W. W. Brazel, 48, Lincoln county rancher living 30 miles south of Corona,
today told his story of finding what the army at first described as a flying
disk, but the publicity which attended his find caused him to add that if he
ever found anything else short of a bomb, he sure wasn't going to say
anything about it.

Brazel was brought here late yesterday by W. E. Whitmore, of radio station
KGFL, had his picture taken and gave an interview to the Record and Jason
Kellahin, sent here from the Albuquerque bureau of the Associated Press to
cover the story. The picture he posed for was sent out over AP telephoto
wire sending machine specially set up in the Record office by R. D. Adair,
AP wire chief sent here from Albuquerque for the sole purpose of getting out
his picture and that of sheriff George Wilcox, to whom Brazel originally
gave the information of his find.

Brazel related that on June 14 he and an 8-year old son, Vernon, were about
7 or 8 miles from the ranch house of the J. B. Foster ranch, which he
operates, when they came upon a large area of bright wreckage made up on
rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks.

At the time Brazel was in a hurry to get his round made and he did not pay
much attention to it. But he did remark about what he had seen and on July 4
he, his wife, Vernon and a daughter, Betty, age 14, went back to the spot
and gathered up quite a bit of the debris.

The next day he first heard about the flying disks, and he wondered if what
he had found might be the remnants of one of these.

Monday he came to town to sell some wool and while here he went to see
sheriff George Wilcox and "whispered kinda confidential like" that he might
have found a flying disk.

Wilcox got in touch with the Roswell Army Air Field and Maj. Jesse A. Marcel
and a man in plain clothes accompanied him home, where they picked up the
rest of the pieces of the "disk" and went to his home to try to reconstruct
it.

According to Brazel they simply could not reconstruct it at all. They tried
to make a kite out of it, but could not do that and could not find any way
to put it back together so that it could fit.

Then Major Marcel brought it to Roswell and that was the last he heard of it
until the story broke that he had found a flying disk.

Brazel said that he did not see it fall from the sky and did not see it
before it was torn up, so he did not know the size or shape it might have
been, but he thought it might have been about as large as a table top. The
balloon which held it up, if that was how it worked, must have been about 12
feet long, he felt, measuring the distance by the size of the room in which
he sat. The rubber was smoky gray in color and scattered over an area about
200 yards in diameter.

When the debris was gathered up the tinfoil, paper, tape, and sticks made a
bundle about three feet long and 7 or 8 inches thick, while the rubber made
a bundle about 18 or 20 inches long and about 8 inches thick. In all, he
estimated, the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds.

There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been used for an
engine and no sign of any propellers of any kind, although at least one
paper fin had been glued onto some of the tinfoil.

There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument, although there
were letters on some of the parts. Considerable scotch tape and some tape
with flowers printed upon it had been used in the construction.
 
No strings or wire were to be found but there were some eyelets in the paper
to indicate that some sort of attachment may have been used.

Brazel said that he had previously found two weather observation balloons on
the ranch, but that what he found this time did not in any way resemble
either of these.

"I am sure that what I found was not any weather observation balloon," he
said. "But if I find anything else besides a bomb they are going to have a
hard time getting me to say anything about it."

>>> ENDS HERE

So, in other words, the famous 'flying disk' was made from "rubber strips,
tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks", held together by "considerable
scotch tape and some tape with flowers printed upon it" (the latter oddly
reminiscent of the flowery tape which was used on the Mogul balloons) and
"there were letters on some of the parts". The only debatable section is
at the very end; I'm not sure how similar the Mogul balloons were to a
standard weather balloon. 

Now, tell me how many self-respecting aliens are going to fly across the
galaxy in a 'flying disk' held together by *scotch tape*? And when did 
they build a scotch tape factory on Zeta Reticuli?

Note that most of the Roswell Industry's later reports claim the 'alien
wreckage' crashed between July 2nd and July 4th. Brazel's find occured on
*June 14th* ... and was so unremarkable that they didn't bother going back
to look at it for *three weeks*!!!!! Clearly Brazel's find, *the only
documented find at Roswell* could not be related to those reported crashes
unless the saucer hovered around for three weeks before finally crashing. 

BTW, the infamous picture of Marcel with the debris he recovered from 
the ranch is available at:

	http://129.107.37.101:80/DLL~ISC308?ScanString=roswell

Unfortunately the link for the full-size image doesn't work; I've mailed 
them about it so hopefully they'll fix it soon.

Of course nanotechnology assemblers may require factory conditions.  A
replicator that can't work in the presence of oxygen or cosmic rays isn't
going to gray goo this planet, but could be very handy in the appropriate
factory.

First let me say that the list Anders sent out is an excellent one.  I would
add to it one thing: a book on economics.  I reccomend "Hidden Order: The
Economics of Everyday Life" by David Friedman.  It's a popular book,
available in bookstores now.

Most private arbitration agreements do not choose to use juries.  For
a few exceptions, see the p. B1 article in the Mon, 7 Jul 1997 Wall
Street Journal (7/7/97), "Private Jury Trials: Cheap, Quick,
Controversial."

Juries seem to be one of those extra expenses and inefficiencies one
may attribute to state, vs. private, law.  We don't trust state law
enough not to use juries, but customers do seem to trust their private
laws enough to only use them rarely.

Btw, I was on jury duty a few weeks ago and the judge explicitly
mentioned nullification, explained its meaning, and then asked if
anyone had problems with ignoring that idea.  None did.  Either most
people lie about this, or there really isn't much public support for
the idea.

The U.S. Governments official line on roswell is:

They were testing to see what would happen if parachutes do not open, the
bodies found were actually dummies and the material found around the crash
site was from the parachutes.

This was only changed from the balloon story recently (this year I think).

100,000 years ago the same experiment was tried, number 100 was picked.
 There's more likely to be 1,000 people than there is 60 Billion!

The urns had a choice of two different amounts, we have a choice of infinite
amounts, what are the chances of a number between 0 and infinity being as
small as 60 billion? or 100 trillion?

Sure.  In any signaling process, a variety of types of people are
pooled together with each possible signal.  The signal reciever can at
best only respond to a signaler based on some average type of senders
of such signals.  So the type of an individual who differs from that
average is not fully revealed.  See standard signaling game lit.

Responding to a post like yours with a quick comment like this can
also be a way to cozy up to the poster.  Of course it helps to say
something like "Oh yes I agree", even if you wouldn't otherwise want
to believe something that strong. :-)

I agree that the social role of beliefs is also in a sense
"functional", which is why I put this word in quotes in my first
usage.  Perhaps it would have been better to say "social" vs. "non-social"?

I guess I meant "small" not just in terms of total number of people
involved, but also in terms of its relative importance in your social
life.  But I hadn't thought it through very well, I agree.

I must be showing my Califonia bias, but I can't help but believe that

I'm afraid you've completely lost me here.  I was making an analogy to
clothes, where one might have to trade off functionality, such as
tennis shoes might provide, with social roles such as fashion, such as
high heels might provide.  There can be similar tradeoffs in choosing beliefs.

I was referring primarily to the academic disciplines I am most
familiar with: philosophy, economics, and political science.  I am
aware of some anthro/ethno stuff, and want to read more.  But what
I've seen of that literature seems to suffer rather weak and poorly
considered analysis of the nature of beliefs.  The usual story really:
theorists neglect data and empiricists neglect theory.

Aha! Found another copy. If you want to see what the remains of an alien 
spacecraft look like, check out:

	http://www.express-news.net/roswell/roshistart/marcel.jpg

This is the photo which, according to Marcel's reported claims in "The
Roswell Incident" book, shows some of the debris he found on the ranch
(it's reproduced in that book). Looks a lot like a few bits of torn and
crumpled tin-foil to me.

This contradicts what I think I know about virii.  My understanding was that
e-mail cannot transmit computer viruses...only memetic ones.  That for a
virus to be forwared it was necessary for executable code to be
transfered..which email is not.

Would someone please explain this to me?

I will freely admit that my understanding of corporate law is limited.  
My basic contention is that a group of individuals (the owners and 
operators) under the umbrella of "INC." should not have any more rights, 
privileges or protections than any other group of free-associating 
individuals.  The way I understand things now, this is not the case.  Is 
this correct?

Several things come to mind:

In "Queen Of Angels" nanotechnology was NOT cheap.

By self-replicating the "flavor" of the term was (to me) in the biological
sense. Like bacteria eating all the food available.  Not in the industrial
sense like the automovile industry (for example) replicating factories first
in order to "birth" automobiles.

could not atoms be positioned appropriately via laser beams?...Wouldn't this
be much easier to build than the other varients?

They might NOT be.  I refer to "wolf-children" who could not be taught to

Is it possible that the human persona program must be "Booted" up in a
certain sequence relative to the biological changes of physical growth or not
boot up at all?

I've heard that children can learn multiple languages easily...whereas
adults...I for one...have a difficult time learning another language...I've
heard that if a child is not taught to read prior to a certain age then
subsequently it will become much more difficult...

A person who cannot see nor hear (nor speak)is probably conscious (Helen
Keller. I beleive was a blind deaf mute)..but she was in constant
communication...she had a dedicated nurse who went to great effort. .. (I'm
rather vauge on the details I'm afraid)...to teach her to communicate.  Is it
possible that the act of learning to communicate...the inherent ability TOO
communicate is somehow prerequisit to self Awareness (what we're calling
consciousness)

Hard questions...tough subject...VERY interesting.

I read lots of SF...in one of the last books that I've been able to acquire
"The Reality Dysfunction"...this point is mentioned.  Also David Weber speaks
to the matter in his series dealing with the Genocidal Alein Horde  (can't

a lot i seem to recall.

Also in "Vacumn Flowers" (forget the author)..there is the concept of an

available in stores...today you can be Barbie,...tomorrow Madonna....(or
whatever)

I mention the above...science fiction ...to illustrate that the idea has been

So let me hypothesize:

    The "Mind" is a multitude of "programs" running (simultaneously and
sequentially) upon a (currently) biological (protein colloid) "computer".
 These programs, in aggregate, constitute a person's personality, memory,
knowledge and skills (i.e. the programming needed to move the muscles)..and
more.

I beleive it is conceded that "uploading" is foreseeable.  If in the process
of uploading the original is not destroyed then might partial uploads be
possible?  Might not future products....ready for upload at need....be
languages...organizational skills...mathematics....etc...

Well said. In a sense, what I was saying is that we are living in 
anarchy right now. It's just that 
'those-group-of-people-who-armed-themselves' have taken over everything 
in the intervening 6-10,000 yrs.  But as YakWax pointed out in a recent 
post, if we can achieve true anarchy today, we are better equipped to 
sustain it than previous generations.

I'll just say here, that although phones were available they were not 
widespread.  It wasn't until after WWII that phones saturated the middle 
and lower income households.  Yes, they didn't have mainstream media (a 
blessing in many ways), but a necessary evil I think, in order to reach 
a wide-enough audience sufficient to take on Rockefeller...

I have learned a lot on this thread from yourself and others.  Your 
arguments have been appreciated!  Thanks.

But in the case of clothes one could argue that what was occurring was a
trade-off of functionality: the functions of grip, support, etc. against
the functions of leg-enhancement, attractiveness, etc. Or one could argue
that what was occurring was a trade-off social roles: tennis shoes which
allow one to be a part of tennis-playing society, against high-heels which
allow one to be part of fashion-conscious society. Therefore, there is not
necessarily a tradeoff between functionality and social role. If my
original argument was unclear I think it was most likely because I don't
view the distinction between functionality and sociality in the same way as
you do: belief functions in the context and creation of society; society
functions in the context and creation of belief(s).

The message you received *is* a memetic virus. It caused you to

Fascinating.  Did you know what the case was about at the time of the
question?  (I probably wouldn't consider attempting nullification for
a violent crime, and I wouldn't admit my willingness to the judge
pre-trial for a drug "crime".)

The last time I was in a jury pool, we already knew that it was a
violent rape case before I was dismissed (at the first opportunity
after I answered questions individually).  The judge was taking great
pains to make sure that the jurors would be able to look a bloody
pictures without losing it.

I've apparently established a reputation for being an expert on jury
nullification, since my friends often come to me for advice when
they've been called for Jury Duty.  About half of them ask me for help
with the intent of finding out how to get out of Jury duty.  

I, on the other hand, think of Jury duty not as something the state
wants to coerce me into doing (though it clearly does.)  Rather than a
responsibilty, I consider it to be a right.  It's one of the few
opportunities a citizen in this country has to directly overrule the
government.  It's also the only thing I can do to help ensure that
there are some reasonable people in the jury pool.  If all
libertarians, and all educated folk do their best to get out of jury
duty, there'll be no one to listen critically to the prosecutor's
testimony when I am falsely accused, or when I'm truly accused of some
illegal behavior that shouldn't be a crime.

It is a hoax--a variation on the old "Good Times" theme (see
<http://www.urbanlegends.com/>), but the concern is not completely
unjustified.  It /is/ possible to transmit viruses by email through
some programs--in particular Windows-based programs.  Messages that
contain MS-Word attachments, for example, can contain Word Macro
viruses, and embedded OLE objects cause the activation of locally-
resident code that may have security holes.  These "features" can
usually be turned off, or else one can use a safe email program that
knows better than to allow active content.

And while we're at it, can we please stop spreading the "virii"
memetic virus?  It's not even a correct pun: that would be the Latin
plural of the word "virius", if there were one.

>Does anyone have the date for the first sex/gender change or male or female?  

This may be a tricky question, as you don't have to have surgery to 
render a sex change.  Use of hormones will also drastically alter 
biological sex organs, and often surgery is not needed.  In some 
cases, surgery makes the change more permanent.  

In modern times, several disorders related to gender have been 
identified, each having a course of treatment that would fall under 
the category of a sex change:  Klinefelter's syndrom (extra X 
chromosome), Turner's syndrome (missing X chromosome), Speck syndrome 
(extra Y chromosome), hermaphrodotism (dual sex organs), and gender 
dysphoria (feeling of being in the wrong body).  All are treated with 
hormones, and in the case of the latter two, surgery.  

Babies that are born with sexually indeterminate organs are often 
subjected to surgery at birth to render them as one or the other sex. 
It is estimated that about 12,000 operations of this type take place 
per year, and Congress recently had hearings in which persons who had 
been subjected to this type of surgery voiced their opinion that the 
doctors should have been required to wait until the age of consent to 
conduct this surgery.  Evidently this type of surgery has been 
conducted for years prior to the adult voluntary sex change surgery, 
but I don't know the year that began.

Sin,

Actually, no! This is a subtle point which people tend to miss. If
there existed one very breif and one very long-lasting race, then
the Doomsday argument *wouldn't* work! This is because in that
case there would be a greater prior probability that I would be in the
long-lasting race (after all, the overwhelming majority would be in
that race). It is easy to verify that this change in the priors exactly
counterbalances the probability shift that we are to make upon
discovering that we exist in the initial segment of a race. (See my
paper for the calculation.)

We have no reason to believe that there are an infinite number of
human races. There are, however, an infinite number of *possible*
human races. Pardon me if this sound like philosophical hair-cutting,
but for the DA it makes an absolutely  crusial difference.

No problem. You have to specify the prior probability distribution
over the probability space, though. This means you have to tell me
how many urns there are containing n balls, for each n. Then it is
just standard Bayesian statistics.

This is an interesting example. As far as I can see it doesn't 
involve the Doomsday argument, though. It is just standard induction:
if more people have died than reached the moon, then, ceteris
paribus, Neil shouldn't believe he will reach the moon. Of course,
the cetera weren't paria in this case: he knew that he entered
a space vehicle. This fact outweighs the priors created by induction.
But in the same way, the DA can also be overridden if we have
strong independent reason to believe that mankind will continue
to exist a long time (which we havn't, of course).

I don't really know enough about the whole Mars face thing to comment on
Anton's questions (other than that it looks a lot like Elvis). But I
would like to ask whether list members think it merits closer
inspection, and if not, why?

The Men in Black have been at your house, ripping out the other picture.
The two `classic' frames are Viking 35A72 and 70A13.  

According to a dismally stupid book called THE FACE ON MARS: THE EVIDENCE
OF A LOST MARTIAN CIVILIZATION (Brian Crowley and James J Hurtak, 1986):
`Then there are four additional very high altitude shots which, if blown up
to their limits, produce a resolution of the face about the size of a small
pea.  The lighting from all four, however, is from the east and, through
enhancement techniques, it can be confirmed that a basic overall symmetry
is preserved [...]'  No frame numbers are given in the text.  They're bound
to be on the net somewhere.

The best explanation for this phenomenon is provided in my young adults' sf
novel THE SEA'S FURTHEST END (Adelaide, Australia: Aphelion, 1993), but
it's not available in the US or UK.  Bad luck.  :)

Yes. But I have to ask, why would you rather sue an employee of a

I suspect he's saying that we can directly perceive omega,
as directly as we can perceive sounds or colors - although
not through any of the five senses, but through some other
faculty of mind (e.g. "intellect" or "intuition"); and that
he will count as empirical evidence, not only sense-data,
but also "intuition-data", derived from that extra faculty.

I'm not sure about this. A priori knowledge is supposed to
be had without appeal to perception. Rucker might agree that
the existence of omega is not an analytic truth, but he
might say that we only know about omega because we "perceive"
it (again, where "perceive" would have to include the alleged
faculty by which one is directly aware of mathematical
entities).

As far as I'm concerned, a priori knowledge is stuff hardcoded into
our brains by the genes, and it originates in the gene-pool's
"perception" of the environment over millions of years. The perception
of the environment by a species gene-pool is a very slow, long-term,
and wasteful thing, proceeding on purely Darwinian means. But I
prefer not to believe in knowledge that has no causal origin, and
that's the only causal origin I can appeal to to account for what
philosophers have traditionally referred to as "a priori" knowledge.
Trying to make sense of Kant's abstractions in terms of evolutionary
epistemology is a bit of a struggle, since there's a whole bunch
of jargon from genetic algorithms that describes this stuff
beautifully and doesn't map well to Kant at all. (And furthermore,
my grasp of Kant is dim at best and mostly secondhand.)

Regarding the direct intuitive perception of truth, as with the
perception of the truth of a mathematical theorem after spending
many hours playing with the axioms and lemmas that underlie its
proof, this is still rather mysterious stuff in neuroscientific
terms. Most fruitful work in neuroscience-oriented epistemology
focuses on the origin of empirical knowledge, just as much of Popper
and Lakatos and Bartley's work in critical epistemology focuses on
the origin of mathematical and theoretical knowledge... knowledge
that has "logical structure" that we don't always find in empirical
knowledge. Trying to come up with a model of PCR that works in an
entirely neuroscientific paradigm is a toughie. And I can't quite
get away from the fact that phrases used by the mathematicians to
describe the certainty of mathematical knowledge seems to map nicely
to the vocabulary used by Buddhists and other mystics to describe
the certainties arising in their holistic religious experiences.
Whatever is going on here is going on in some synesthetic area of
the brain that welds together information coming from a variety of
different sensory inputs and postprocessing areas: the mysterious
and ever fruitful "intuition".

Anyway, if you buy into the evolutionary-epistemology metaphor
about a gene-pool being able to "perceive" its environment at a
completely different timescale from that in which we say that an
animal organism can perceive its environment, then I wouldn't
hesitate to identify that "Darwinian perception" as the origin of
the so-called "a priori" knowledge... but the perception of the
gene-pool is not the perception of an individual organism, who is
born with the potential for the development and unfolding of this
"a priori" knowledge but to the pure empiricist is still tabula
rasa as far as a posteriori knowledge is concerned. And clearly
the two interact:  a priori "knowledge" serves as a structure within
which a posteriori knowledge can be constructed, but might be a
mere scaffolding that is not much use without being empirically
informed, and actively developed by that other mysterious process
we call "thinking things through".

No, it merits no study at all.  On the Feynman-Hubbard scale I showed
earlier, Hoagland rates about a 0.3, even below Velikofsky.  He doesn't
even pretend to have any scientific objectivity or make any attempt
at worthwhile scholarship.  I'm almost embarrassed by the amount I
have read about him after convincing myself that he was a crackpot--I
should not have wasted any more brain cells on him at that point, but
there is something oddly fascinating about watching a fine bullshit
artist at work, and he does turn a nice phrase.

Now that I think about it, the scale would make an interesting essay.
I can imagine some standards for some points of the scale, but I'd
like to hear nominations for some others:

  10.0 Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr: The standards.
   9.0 Albert Einstein, Steven Hawking: No experiments, no 10.
   8.0 ?
   7.0 Carl Sagan: Some political influences, but does his homework
       and maintains his integrity.
   6.0 ?
   5.0 Andrew Weil: One can be /too/ open-minded.  A bit too
       theatrical and rhetorical, too.
   4.0 Hal Puthoff, Fleischman & Pons: Might be on to something,
       but tend to announce results before verifying them.
   3.0 ?
   2.0 John Gray (Mars/Venus): Interesting ideas, thin on facts.
   1.0 ?
   0.0 L. Ron Hubbard, Creationists, Astrologers.

In an otherwise reasonable and rational post, I was jarred by this

If you are a Platonist, all mathematical constructs actually exist in
their entirety. Penrose discusses the Mandelbrot Fractal in this
context, as an example of something which cannot even approximately be
rendered within a finite context, such as computer generated imagery.

I am on the other side of the fence. Omega is the name of a mathematical
object, and we can generate a finite number of finite statements about
the properties of Omega. Obviously, enumerating Omega is not physically
possible, and I don't believe in the existence of some mystical space
where one can enumerate Omega. Similarly, with the Mandeobrot Fractal,
we may explore admittedly inexact representations to the degree that our
computational resources allow. However, this does not say the Mandelbrot
Set exists as a complete object somewhere, only that we can explore some
aspects of it in a finite manner.

Mathematical theorems and conjectures are statements of how to generate
and investigate strings finite in length, grammar and syntax which
describe the mathematical objects and operations in relation to same
(the strings representing the objects only!)

Shades of Wittgenstein (I hope I spelled it right).
Such is MHO...

What I meant, and this may not have been entirely clear, was whether
list members thought another fly-by of the Mars-face area was a good
idea; and this barring any of the preconceived, Hoagland-based
pseudo-science that might be floating around. I tend to think that
another fly-by would either prove them right or shut them up. If right,
well, a long shot; but if wrong, shut them up and at least preserve some
bandwith. This topic is a Metacrawler goldmine.

So John Gray is better than Hoagland? At least Hoagland gave us links to
his ideas. Well, I guess when we get to the bottom of the scale the
differences are negligible, but I must say, if I have to buy it, it
better be more than "thin on facts." Any gender stereotype is worthless
in my book, and stereotyping without facts is more than worthless, it's
the memetic equivalent of entropy. And some guy is making beaucoup
d'argent off of it?

John Gray is definitely worse than an astrologer. He's predicting the
future of your relationship based upon not the heavens, but some
primordial fact sheet that only he has a copy of. No man is alike, no
woman is alike. And I leave it at that.

I wrote off-line to Natasha to say that the first two vaginoplasties were
conducted in 1931 (although attempts to create a vagina on an essentially
female-phenotype person were made in 1761, ouch!). The first phalloplasty
was carried out between 1945 and 1948. 

Who said social anthropology wasn't interesting and informative?

Not really.  The protection afforded by a corporation is that individuals
generally can't be held responsible for the misdeeds of the entire
organization.  Individuals *can* be held personally liable for their
individual actions, within the employment regulations regarding such things
(which are generally applicable to all businesses).

If you, as a businessman, own an unincorporated company and the yokels in
engineering unleash a fatal flaw, you are *personally* liable for their
screwup as sole proprietor of the company.  If you were incorporated and
the same thing happened, the most you could lose is your company.  The
corporate structure is practically necessary for large businesses.  The
necessity of incorporation for small businesses is considerably more
debatable.

Didn't Stephenson assume the assemblers only worked in a vacuum? It
is very probable that the first assemblers will need very special
environments to work well, and not unreasonable to think that the
cost of designing robust assemblers is higher than providing them
with their special environments (and as you point out, it provides a
safety measure and gives the manufacturers more control). 

However, assemblers that can spread in the biosphere are possible
(existence proof: bacteria), the question is only how high the design
threshold is to make them. My guess is that there will be few
incentives at first, but plenty of research on robust nanodevices
(for e.g. medical use), and at some point it becomes possible to
combine the technologies into robust assemblers theoretically able to
spread in a goo fashion. The grey goo disaster is still unlikely (I
worry more for the golden goo and red goo problem), but it is
possible in principle.

Yes, but I doubt it would be in real life (after the initial stage of
being tended by people in white coats). See Drexler's EoC.

[Aside: Greg Bear likely made it expensive to tone it down in his
story (which wasn't about nanotech) - cheap, ubiquitious nanotech
changes things too much, and most authors realize they cannot handle
all the implications. Linda Nagata and Neal Stephenson are so far the
only authors I have read who have tried to explore the possibilities.
I have myself limited nanotech in a science fiction game I'm working
on just to keep the setting somewhat familiar. ]

Yes, but is there a difference between an insect making new insects
and a factory complex building more factory complexes (remember the
NASA plans for replicating moon factories). 

To get nanotech of the ground you need to be able to build
nanodevices cheaply - if every assembler has to be built "by hand" by
a STM they will be astronomically expensive and inconvenient. But if
you have *one* assembler, you could use it to build another
assembler. Now you have two... soon you can have as many assemblers
as you want, and nanotech production becomes reasonable.

I wouldn't fear the Goo That Ate The Earth, it is somewhat unlikely
(it needs energy to convert stuff into itself, limiting its speed a
lot; I'm not sure biomass or diamondoid is the most energetic, but we
only have around 1 kW/m^2 of sunlight). What is more dangerous is The
Little Nanite Who Could - imagine an escaped medical nanite killing
certain kinds of bacteria rather efficiently, spreading out of
control. It might destroy our ecosystem without us noticing until it
was too late.

The Matter Compiler will not prevent the creation of goo or dangerous
nano, but it will provide a good consumer interface for the products
of nanotechnology. After all, most computer users never write
programs, they just download them from the net or buy them in a
store. The real danger comes from the programmers, who might write
viruses or make mistakes that crash your hard drive or ecosystem.

No, since you need to keep both the building blocks and the object
under construction floating together. So when you try to push an atom
in place, the laser will also push at the object; it *might* be
possible to solve the control problem, but I doubt it. This method
doesn't seem to work well for massive structures, only individual
atoms, molecules or optical crystals.

Were the subjects adults or babies?  Was the surgery voluntary?

	The following is from a private message that I sent to Eric Watt
Forste yesterday.  It is applicable here, for it gives yet another
interpretation of Rucker's intended message.  Upon rereading, I don't
believe that he intended anything nearly as interesting as we have been
considering.  I believe that he is simply stating that the concept of
Omega is given a priori, then further understood, along with lower
infinities, empirically.  I also give a brief refutation of the Kantian
view of this, in the following text:

	I did...return to the text to ponder the surrounding paragraphs
and I have come up with this:   In the sentence immediately following the
paragraph that I extracted the original object of debate from, Rucker says
this, "We have a primitive concept of infinity".  He then goes on to
mention how it is inspired, not giving a solid reason, but rather
referring to the "same deep substrate of mind that conditions religious
thought", this can be pre or post rational, but it really doesn't matter
in this case, because he goes on to further clarify our conception of
infinities.  "By means of set-theoretic analysis of Absolute Infinity [our
omega], we attain knowledge of many lower infinities-the transfinite
ordinals and cardinals".  
	My revised view of his text tells me that the initial concept of
infinity, as Absolute Infinity, is given a priori, whereas we arrive at
further understanding empirically.  This isn't the Kantian synthetic a
priori, for in this case it is given first, then further understood.  In
the case of a synthetic a priori, I believe that one arrives at or 
discovers an innate concept empirically, only then recognizing it as an a
priori and eternal truth.  Hence, we are given new knowledge (synthetic)
from an eternal truth.  This of course could just be my own twist on Kant.
A fun subject nonetheless, and great fuel for hours of intensely enjoyable 
debate.

	Much agreed!  One must note, however, that your definition of
"perceive" is essential to this statement.

	I'm not certain that "hardcoded into our brains by the genes" is
quite correct.  Certainly there are some types of knowledge that can be
had only by the intention of evolution (I use that loosely, I'm not
promoting a deterministic view), such as walking.  We have the knowledge,
we could say, a priori, and just have to learn to utilize it.  There are
some bodies of knowledge, however, that arise in us naturally and not
through sense data simply by the "structure" of the brain.  Now given, the
brain is determined by biology, but the information that it percieves can
in some instances arise by the _very nature_ and structure of the brain,
not by the genetic information composing it.  Mathematics is one of these
bodies of knowledge, I don't believe that it was written in our genes to
discover mathematics, but rather it arose naturally as a benefit of the
way in which our minds percieve.  Seeing in three dimensions is another
example, if somewhat more "physical".  It isn't "hardcoded", but rather is
by the very structure of our eyes and brain to percieve this way (imagine 
percieving naturally in other dimensions...).

	This is a very materialistic view, or perhaps I should say
biologically dependent view.  A good deal of knowledge is not dependent
upon the biological entity percieving it.  What Locke would call Secondary
Qualities, or Descartes Confused or Materially False ideas ARE dependent
upon the observer, this is sense data.  But biological entities can have a
priori knowledge of eternal truths, eternal throughout our universe, not
by genetic intent (again, I'm not implying a telos) but by the very
structure of their percieving.  In other words, we can have knowledge of
eternal truths by virtue of having the structure that we have, the genes
evolutionary purpose isn't necessarily to enable an understanding of these
truths.

	Douglas Hofstadter in "Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies"
promotes a view of innate pattern recognition.  He does however discuss
actually developing these abilities as well.

	This relationship is of course the cure to Locke's claim that the
mind is tabula rasa.  Indeed, there _must_ be some innate or a priori
knowledge, to enable initial perception.

The problem is that laser beams can only maneuver non-super-cold atoms with
a precision on the order of a wavelength of light, which is 2000 times
larger than an interatomic spacing.  The hold provided by the laser beam is
very 'soft'; it doesn't constrain the position of the atom sharply enough to
permit precise assembly in the presence of thermal noise at any temperature
above a millionth of a Kelvin.  And below a millionth of a Kelvin, every
atomic bond you form will release enough energy to overheat a billion atoms.
You'll have to wait for them to stop jiggling before you make another bond.
I don't think it would be very efficient.  But somebody should try it.  It
won't provide a cheap mass-production method, but it might suffice to make
the first assembler.

On these scales gravity is negligible; we won't need zero-g.

Actually, the closer an object is in size to a wavelength of light, the
easier it is to push around.  For bacteria that are close to one wavelength
across, you can yank them around, hold them in place, etc, with a cheap
desktop laser apparatus.  I don't think holding the work-in-progress will be
hard, at least compared to holding the atoms you're adding to it.

Once one reaches a certain level of maturity and education, that 
person would not necessarily have to rely on predesigned learning 
processes.  One can design one's own life experiences in order to 
create environments and events that will stimulate growth and break 
through personal barriers--sometimes with the guidance of another 
person or organization, sometimes entirely alone.  

Many universities are now taking this approach, teaching the basic skills 
of learning design and self-evalutation in order to promote lifelong 
education that continues beyond the acquisition of a degree.  I think 
that someday we won't even need universities anymore, as learning 
itself becomes more closely integrated into daily life.

Sin,

Yes.  However, I'm most interested in the first sex changes for
documentation.  Sarah offered a date of 1931.  I will need to learn if these
early sex changes allowed for the organs to be functional for performing sex.

An excellent book is _The Sexual Brain_ which covers the biological basis

Could be the early date stated above.

Great points.  In the book I had read, _The Sexual Brain_, the author Simon
LeVay brings up a case history of a child that was born as a male, but when
he was circumcised, had some problems (I won't go into detail in deference
to all).  Because of the mistake by the surgeon, they decided the best thing
to do would be to make him a her.  The file was closed at the child's
teenage years stating that all went well, a fisty child, but generally
adapted to the change.

Interestingly enough, a few weeks, I was watching television about sex
changes and this same case was brought up.  It was reopened and disclosed
the fact that the child did not in fact adapt well.  She never fit her role
as a woman.  She didn't have sex, couldn't enjoy it, didn't menstruate, etc.
She researched her own history and discovered the sex change as a child.
She later had her sex changed back to a man and got married, and adopted a
child.

I think it the date for the first sex change is still a primary date because
it references a lot of changes both within the medical community and
society's first adaptations to  gender changes.  I think a second date would
someone's voluntarily desire for a sex change and has it is performed, and
that person is able to fully enjoy his or her new sex -- performing sex and
having orgasms

Interview of Forrest Bishop by Bill Spence
December 10, 1996
The "Optical Assembler," fka the "Food Replicator"


[[Note: This is a partial description of an idea I originally had several years ago. 
It has not
proceeded past the conceptual stage, and is offered only for your entertainment.
Forrest Bishop ]]


Bill (B):	Forrest Bishop on a different kind of replicator, one that does not 
involve robot arms.  

Forrest (F):	Right.

B:	What does it use to manipulate?

F:	This is very similar to what was on the original Star Trek episodes.  They 
called it the "Food 
Replicator".  It was depicted as a box in which things would simply appear when you 
wanted them, and so I 
use that name because it has some of the same properties.

B:	Is the food replicator...Earl Grey tea or ...general country doctor?

F:	Yes, this is very speculative technology; it's not a for-sure thing; it's more 
out on the fringe.  The 
central idea is ...

B:	Well, first, let me ask you, what is a replicator?  It manipulates atoms in 
foods and puts them in 
specific places where you want them to be? 

F:	Yes, to build an object, you want to create an object that's atomically 
precise.  So, some kind of 
device to do this.

B:	And one kind of system is basically robot arms that physically 
move things.

F:	Yes, that's the most popular version.

B:	And this is completely different?

F:	Yes, it uses electromagnetic energy in a structured 
electromagnetic field to do the same thing.

B:	To move individual atom, more than one atom:?

F:	Individual atoms, molecules, small structures.

B:	Small structures?

F:	Yes, possibly.

B:	What does this device look like?  How does it function?  How does 
it work?

F:	The central idea is to create a structured electromagnetic field 
that is variable in real time.  The 
atoms are moved around by the electromagnetic field.

B:	Atoms can be moved around by electromagnetic field?

F:	Yes.

B:	What frequency are we talking about?

F:	Roughly, light, visible spectrum, about [600 nanometers] 
depending on the particular atom, 
depending on whether you're trying to ionize it or not.

B:	So you're pushing atoms with light?

F:	Yes.  This is already being done now.  It's partially based on 
..

B:	Trapping an atom with lasers, right?

F:	Yes.  This has already been accomplished.  In this environment, 
imagine a flat plate of emitters 
that are--each emitter is addressable; each emitter is very tiny.  By 
changing the timing--you have a row of 
them--by changing the timing on them, you can create a wave front 
that's steerable, just as in a phased array 
radar.

B:	OK.  Light frequency.

F:	Yes.  So, a planar array of these --

B:	A whole plane.

F:	A whole plane consisting of a grid of emitters can construct a 
beam of the frequency of your 
choice.  The frequency can be varied over [time, space, and phase] 
also, and that way, you're creating a 
beam that is coherent or different frequencies in different parts of 
it, that's steerable over the half-sphere.  
Ideally, you want to use emitters as small as possible--quantum well 
lasers are one possibility.

B:	Are they attainable?

F:	They are.

B:	In frequency?

F:	There's already existing devices that are wholly suitable.  These 
are also called artificial atoms for 
the reason that you have -- in them, you have an electron that is 
trapped in some kind of a potential well, 
which then [radiates] as the voltage varies the size of that potential 
well.  

B:	Oh, it's [an] orbiting electron.  Instant frequency of what it's 
going to throw off in radiation?

F:	That's right.

B:	Pretty clever.

F:	Yes.  These are existing devices.  Currently, researchers are 
trying to make arrays of these which is 
going to be difficult, from the one emitter ________one its neighbor.

B:	Why?

F:	Because these are tiny [quantum] mechanical properties that 
you're playing with.

B:	So the radiation field of one would affect the other?

F:	Yes, you could put it that way.  The electric field of the 
voltage that's being used to adjust the 
potential well in one is affecting its neighbor as well.

B:	How would you overcome that?

F:	In this idea, the way to overcome it, if you will, is simply 
through computation  [of] the wave 
function [of the entire planar array].

B:	Would it take  into consideration how one field affects the 
other?  And changing whatever 
parameters necessary?

F:	That's right.  It would take a massive amount of computer power.

B:	OK, so you have a plate.

F:	Yes, behind this plate, you have -- the equivalent of millions of 
supercomputers are needed to run 
this.

B:	Oh, that much power?

F:	That's right.  You're running in real time, and in this case, 
real time means you're obtaining a type 
of _________ range, so it's a huge computational problem that require 
nanocomputers in order to realize it.

B:	I see.  So you've got one plate with a hemisphere that's 
completely controllable where the wave is, 
and even what frequency it is.  Then what?

F:	Then what?  Now, imagine two of these plates facing each other.  
A quantum well emitter is also a 
receiver.  A wave that comes in will cause a electron or  quantum well 
emitter to transition to a level, if it is  
the correct frequency, which it will be, because it is part of the same 
system to design that in.  Therefore, 
you can create a standing between two plates.  You can steer that wave; 
you can, by phase shifting between 
the two plates, you can cause the nodes, the standing of the nodes...

B:	Where there's energy and where there's no energy.

F:	Yes, it vibrates something down, kind of like a violin string, 
and there are certain points on it that 
where the field strengths don't change, called the nodes, and at those 
points is where you place an atom and 
have it stay.  It's kind of similar to, if you take a board and want to 
saw on it, sawdust will bounce up and 
down on the boards and collect in the nodes, which is the places on 
that board that aren't moving up and 
down.  Some parts of the board move and some stand still, and that's 
where the sawdust collects.  It's a 
little bit like that.

B:	So you could have atoms that would stay in the low-energy spots.  


F:	Yes, which is the nodes.

B:	But you could move those nodes, is that correct?

F:	Right, by phase shifting between the two plates, you could move 
the nodes back and forth, and the 
atoms, theoretically, will move with the nodes.

B:	Aha!  So, you can move atoms in one axis.

F:	Yes, one axis.

B:	So far.

F:	So far.  Now, make it six plates.  Now you can construct a 
three-dimensional, fully specified, 
electromagnetic standing-wave field.  You can move it, and the atoms 
that are in it can be moved, shifted, 
in space.

B:	Relative to each other?

F:	Relative to each other, and relative to the box.

B:	A lot closer together, if need be, or want?

F:	You'd want it to be.  

B:	Yes, I guess you would want it to be.

F:	Yes, the idea is to inject an atom and have a wave front set up 
at that point that catches that atom, 
or small molecule, or what have you, perhaps you want to hit it with 
high energy to ionize it, to create a 
radical group, and then you use the standing waves to move it, in three 
dimensions, over to where you want 
it, and theoretically, cause a reaction.

B:	Oh, in other words, bring it closer to another atom or molecule 
and cause a reaction.

F:	Yes, [close to the structure] you're building.  Cause a reaction.

B:	And because you have so much resolution, you could inject lots of 
atoms at one time in lots of 
places.

F:	Because you have lots of computational power, you should be able 
to do that.  Every time you 
place an atom in this electromagnetic field, its field interacts with 
that field and, in principle, you can 
deduce the location of that atom by...

B:	By its shadow?

F:	By its effect on the overall field.

B:	OK, so you constantly know where the position of all the atoms are, in real 
time?

F:	Yes, like I say, this is getting kind of far out there.  Another problem is 
the wavelength is, say, 500 
nanometers, which is much greater than the positional accuracy required for 
reactions.  However, by time-
averaging the position of that atom, you should be able to deduce its position to a 
small fraction of a 
wavelength, in other words, to the resolution required for positional chemistry.

B:	All right.  So, what we've got here is a box that you can inject atoms into 
and grab them with 
standing, very complex lightwaves, and literally move them around independently and 
get them into 
position to go into place.  As opposed to robot arms, you're using lightwaves, 
energy.  It sounds very 
exciting.

F:	And the higher frequency lightwave can be used [to knock] an electron off an 
atom to create a 
radical group, and at the desired time.

B:	Oh, so, it's more reactive; can jump into...

F:	Remember, I was saying the plane consists of tuneable quantum well lasers that 
have a spatial 
frequency distribution so that you can address that atom with the UV ray you want.

B:	Sounds pretty utilitarian to me.  It's very useful.

F:	Yes, it's a lot of speculation.  It may or may not happen.  There's some 
research and ideas that are 
similar to this already being done, so...

B:	Briefly, what is that research?

F:	Well, I just learned of a fellow--I think he's simply conceived it--with what 
he calls an "optical 
crystal"--I think that's what he calls it--and it is kind of the same idea, of 
having a three-dimensional 
standing wave and placing atoms in the nodes, but not shifting it, but placing atoms 
in the nodes such that 
they form a lattice structure that's like a crystal, except the atoms are actually 
separated quite a distance, at 
least one wavelength of light apart, but they're in a lattice.  Now, as I've said 
before, the presence of those 
atoms alters the field, alters the electromagnetic field in spots, and therefore, 
gives it a new optical property 
that it didn't have before those atoms were there.

B:	And it's detectable.

F:	Yes.  For instance, the index of refraction would be different than if it was 
a box of [just] 
electromagnetic [energy].  And so by, for instance, changing the frequency, you're 
changing the lattice 
spacing, you're altering .. the [optical] properties of this volume ....

B:	With this Optical Assembler...

F:	That's a good name for it.

B:	What do you feel like you could build?  Anything?  A cup of Earl Grey?

F:	No, it's so speculative that I'm already out on a limb, and I don't know how 
much further I want to 
go.  Conceivably, anything; practically, there's a lot of unanswered questions.  
Somewhere between there.

Mr. Bostrom--

I just read your paper on the Doomsday Argument (not as closely as I should
have).  I am intrigued by the reference class "people who know their
approximate place in human history".  There was nobody in this reference
class before the last century.  Perhaps this implies that with 90%
probability, everyone will forget their history sometime between 2010 and
3000 AD.  Could some combination of a Singularity and interstellar migration
render the past infomationally inaccessible, and convince most people that
the human race endures from everlasting to everlasting?

Adults and voluntary, to the best of my knowledge: the term 'transvestite'
was applied to the 1931 case, implying there was no intersex or other
geno-/phenotypical sexual characteristic abnormality. The full details are
in Pauly, I.B. (1965) 'Male psychosexual inversion: transsexualism' in
'Archives of General Psychiatry 13: 172-81'. (Unfortunately I don't have
that original text or I'd give more details.)

The 1945-48 (operations took place over several years) case also appears to
have been voluntary, and was conducted on someone who had no intersex, etc.
condition.

I agree that with a liberal definition of "functional", social roles
are also functional, and that with a liberal definition of "social"
all functions serve some social goal at some level.  But while I may
not have chosen ideal terms to denote it, isn't there a distinction
here worth making?  If you grant this, please suggest better terms, or
grant me the license to use my not-perfect terms.

Second that.  He's an odd one, and no mistake, but I don't think the
economical-with-their-attention would regret having read him.  90% of
what he suggests is probably wrong, but the 10% that's right, if right, is,
I reckon, some really weird shit that's right!  I particularly think his
theory about the evolution of human intelligence (actually, I would
rather say human culture - psychedelics are a great way of shaking up the
old memes) being linked to the use of psychedelic drugs has the ring of
truth (see 'Food of the Gods').

Pardon my casual descriptions, but I'm not a physicist.  

It's probably more accurate to say that FTL travel is meaningless, rather
than just impossible.  As you go faster, the universe gets smaller.  To a
photon, the entire universe is just one point.  Go faster, and the universe
is imaginary.  You have nowhere to come from and nowhere to go.

If, hypothetically, it were possible to get from one point without travelling
(the wormhole concept), it would be trivial to set up grotesque paradoxes.
 For example, you "pop" from A to B, where a big bomb is about to go off. You
can set up an observer C who will see you get the before the bomb and get
blown to bits, while D sees you get there after and search the wreckage.
 This kind of thing was the basis of a whole bevy of clock paradoxes which
were thought to "disprove" relativity.  The way relativity works, however,
everybody always agrees on the sequence of events at a given point.  But this
requires that the only way to get from one place to another is by mundane
travel.

I do think there is a distinction worth making (which is what made your
original post so interesting and thought-provoking). It seems to me that
you're talking about the interplay between two _functions_ of belief (and
clothes). I'd term one the reflexive function ('How does this belief affect
me alone, in isolation?') and the social function ('How does this belief
affect my interactions with, and opinions of others, and their interactions
with, and opinions of me?'). In fact, the social function also covers a
second question, which betrays this function's dialogic nature: 'How do my
interactions with others, and their opinions of me, affect my belief?'.

Defining both the reflexive and the social as functions serves to stress
the strong influence which the one has on the other; that is: one may say
that a reflexive function of a belief is inner contentment, but that
particular reflexive function may find part of its source in the social
function of acceptance amongst a peer group.

That formation is on the list of interesting things for the Mars Orbiter
Camera to image during the Mars Global Surveyor mission later this year.
There are some technical issues about targeting something that small with
the high-resolution camera, though, so it might not make the cut.  There's
some information about this on a web site that Mike Malin (MOC principle

Most people on this list agree that anarchy has numerous advantages over
hierarchy, but how far can this go?

Can we have a spontaneous order in business?  Could we destroy the hierarchic
structure that plagues current business practise and have a looser, more
anarchic spontaneous order?

I see this as a possibility, companies could be considered a group of equally
ranked individuals all serving the same goal.  This would be easily
implemented within creative environments, which will probably dominate in the
near future due to automation.

[Xerox PARC is working on computer systems that will allow companies to be
more spontaneous, ubiquitous computing devices keep track of movement of
people and information and record it.  If many people are in the same room,
the computer classes this as a meeting, the subject of which corresponds to
information displayed on computers at the time of the meeting.  Technology
like this will allow for less paper work and more creativity and innovation
(which can't be a bad thing)]

To take this a step further: Could these ideas also be applied to education,
an anarchic schooling system?

I believe this is also possible.  Given that pupils have sufficient
motivation to work, generally they are more likely to work in a looser
system.  Freedom to work at your own pace and to form orders and groups
spontaneously in order to complete set goals could improve education
immensely.

There has been a long running project in England, which puts children with
behavioural difficulties in a 'school with no rules' (teachers are there for
when children want to learn, but they are not forced to attend classes).
 Generally even children who display the worst behavioural problems start to
work (breaking the rules gets boring if there aren't any rules).

If pupils are put in to such a anarchic system when they are young (changing
over halfway through a pupils school life could prove disastrous) the want to
work for personal reasons (as opposed to being forced to) should develop at
an early age.  After which point pupils can be given infinite opportunity to
broaden their knowledge and develop creative skills.

It seems to me that the entire idea of being forced to learn is the cause of
the many closed minds we see today.  Allowing people to develop their own
reasons to better themselves could dramatically change our society for the
better.

I've heard of a company in Australia making solar-powered Internet routers
with 400kbps spread-spectrum radio links; at one stage there was a plan to
use them to provide Net access in Bosnia, and they were talking about 
upgrades to T1 and above. I don't know what happened to them, but a Web

I don't see the advantage of this; why should the boxes know my spatial
location rather than where I'm connected to? Otherwise when I move I'll
have to update my address all the time. It would presumably work OK for
fixed sites, but be really bad for mobile users.

Not if the particular racist, misogynist, or relationship expert has
some respect for science.  Many call Teller a racist; he's still in
the 8.0 - 10.0 range.  Einstein was a misogynist.  Political ideas
and science are disjoint sets, and I for one refuse to allow my mind
to be clouded by them.  This scale is about scientific integrity and
only that, not about popularity.

I gave Mr. Gray a 2.0, and astrologers a 0.0, because astrologers
don't make any attempt whatsoever to test their ideas; many people
have tested them, and they fail every time.  Mr. Gray may not have
much of a scientific method, but he is /honest to his own observations/,
and makes no apologies for them.  The fact that they are politically
unpopular observations raises his score rather than lowering it,
because he is showing that he doesn't give a damn what the popular
egalitarian dogma of the country is.  What he sees is what he sees,
and he refuses to change his observations from his own interpretation.

The truth always matters, even if it's not pretty.  Those who hold
on to the pretty-sounding bullshit of gender equality are willfully
denying the plain evidence of their senses, and deserve scientific
ridicule, even if they do happen to be nice guys.  Of course we want
to grant equal rights under law, but that's a matter of law, not a
matter of science.  There certainly are "stereotypes" based on
ignorance and fear, and we should work to remove them.  But other
generalizations based on the realities of human nature are valuable.
Men and women have distinct natures, and studying those natures is
good science; dismissing them all as "stereotypes" is dogmatic nonsense.

I don't know. If it turns out that the DA holds water then the question about
the reference class becomes very pressing. You are right that there might
be an interpretation other than doom soom. This is a problem I would
like to think think about if nobody sinks the DA.

Mr. Bostrom--

I just read your paper on the Doomsday Argument (not as closely as I should
have).  I am intrigued by the reference class "people who know their
approximate place in human history".  There was nobody in this reference
class before the last century.  Perhaps this implies that with 90%
probability, everyone will forget their history sometime between 2010 and
3000 AD.  Could some combination of a Singularity and interstellar migration
render the past infomationally inaccessible, and convince most people that
the human race endures from everlasting to everlasting?

"Hardcoded into our brains by the genes" was, perhaps, an overstatement.
I certainly did *not* mean to imply that I think that the Human
Genome Project is going to stumble across the genes for "structural
perception of space". That's just barely possible, only because it
seems we still know so little about human ontogenesis, but seems
unlikely to me.

But our brains do have a physical structure that allows for the
development of a neurocomputational machine with properties similar
to, but much more sophisticated (and kludge-ridden) than the
artificial neural networks people have been playing with since the
perceptrons, and much more since the late 1980s.  And I suspect
that many of the "a priori" information structures are going to
turn out to be implicit in that style of computation. What our
genes code for is the production of tissue that can carry out that
kind of signal analysis, computation, and output motor-vector
generation. It codes for the neural architecture, indirectly, via
the proteins and the control genes that determine the sequence in
which proteins are constructed and the stimuli which will produce
the construction of other proteins. And the neural architecture
has certain "best ways" of dealing with the surrounding environment,
many of which were probably "discovered" and propagated culturally,
possibly even before the rise of language. Sorting out the genetic
from the cultural takes us right into the messiest possible issues
in animal ethology.
 
It's all a jolly mess, and I bet we're going to have a lot of
fun sorting it all out.

 > This is a very materialistic view, or perhaps I should say 
 > biologically dependent view.  

I guess I'm a methodological materialist. If something is to be
explained by an information structure, I still want to have some
clue about which atoms encode that information structure. In
most philosophical questions, the atoms that encode the
interesting information structure are in the human nervous system.

 > A good deal of knowledge is not dependent upon the biological 
 > entity percieving it.

Well, remember what I was saying about how a posteriori
knowledge can be seen as the fruit of perception by the
organism, and a priori knowledge can be seen as the fruit of
"perception" by the species gene-pool. It's a very odd way to
use the word perception, certainly, and if I restricted myself
only to standard usage, I'd have to agree with you. But given
this genetic-algorithmish semantic extension of the word
"perception" (which is due to evolutionary epistemologists such
as Donald Campbell), I'd want to claim that all knowledge
(actual physically encoded information structures in people's
nervous systems that we use as knowledge) has its causal origins
in "perception" either in the conventional "small" sense or in
the new, unconventional "large" sense.

I tend to be of the opinion that no knowledge existed at the
time the first replicator spontaneously formed. Knowledge is
what is left over after gross falsehood gets stomped by the
environment. Or at least, that's a hypothesis I entertain from
time to time.  ;)  Here I'm using a rather strict, small,
physicalistic sense of "knowledge" as something that is encoded
within or can be communicated into (as in, reading a book or
something) a physical organism. I know it's odd for me to use
such a restricted sense of the word knowledge when I've just
gone and tried to drastically expand the sense of the word
perception. But if epistemology were a done deal, it wouldn't be
so interesting.

I don't know what the phrase "evolutionary purpose" means. I'm not
saying no such thing exists, I'm just saying I'm unfamiliar with
it. The very structure of our perceiving is a causal consequence
of our ontogenesis. Perhaps I'm being a "causality dogmatist"
here... But purposes, it seems to me, are properties belonging to
the individual organisms that arise within the Big Genetic Algorithm
Soup, not properties of the Soup itself. I really am groping in
the dark here and merely spouting the opinions that get past my
filters, so don't make too much of this.

 > Indeed, there _must_ be some innate or a priori knowledge, 
 > to enable initial perception.

If you're talking about a human individual's perception, yes.  But
if you're talking about the first physical event of perception in
the cosmos, this doesn't square with our knowledge of biological
evolution. At some point, the first animal perceived something.
The "a priori" knowledge that it had at that time, which enable
its individual perception, lay in the structure of its nervous
system and its sense organs, which grew by an incredibly kludgy
and delightful process from its genes and its encounters with its
environment during its growth. Its genes evolved by a process of
random mutation, accurate replication, and selective elimination,
from those of the first (presumably "nonperceiving" in the narrow
sense) replicators.  Again, the whole argument hinges on Campbell
and Waechterhaueser's extension of the word "perception" to mean
something that gene-pools can do to their environment over long
periods of time too, and *not* *only* something that animals can do
to their environment over short timespans.

To take it further and make the metaphor more concrete, I'd have
to have a lot more programming experience with genetic algorithms.
But to someone trying to make a GA robot that can navigate an
environment using a GA perceptual algorithm (I'm not sure whether
anything like this has been attempted by anyone yet), I suspect
that these ideas would seem quite concrete indeed.

I know "reflexive" is a popular term in certain academic circles, but
its connotation is pretty vague for most people.  How about "personal"
vs.  "social" roles of clothes and belief?  Or "individual" vs.
"social" roles?

I would make a further note on this (forgot about LeVay's book, he's 
an interesting guy) regarding medical advancement in sex change 
operations.  The primary date of the first sex change may not 
accurately reflect the actual advancement of the medical technology, 
because these operations are denied to persons who have not obtained 
a psychological/medical diagnosis of gender mismatch.  In other 
words, an individual must be labeled as 'sick' in order to obtain the 
operations to change biological sex.  (Therefore your assumption that 
the babies were first operated upon makes sense)  I did put in a few 
emails to individuals who would know of any change on the horizon, but 
it is presently a bone of contention among those, including myself, who 
would like to make temporary or permanent body modifications that would 
reflect our evolving identities and lifestyles.

Subject: Anarchy and spontaneous order in business and education
Date: Tuesday, July 15, 1997 4:45 PM

Most people on this list agree that anarchy has numerous advantages over
hierarchy, but how far can this go?

Can we have a spontaneous order in business?  Could we destroy the
hierarchic
structure that plagues current business practise and have a looser, more
anarchic spontaneous order?

I see this as a possibility, companies could be considered a group of
equally
ranked individuals all serving the same goal.  This would be easily
implemented within creative environments, which will probably dominate in
the
near future due to automation.

[Xerox PARC is working on computer systems that will allow companies to be
more spontaneous, ubiquitous computing devices keep track of movement of
people and information and record it.  If many people are in the same
room,
the computer classes this as a meeting, the subject of which corresponds
to
information displayed on computers at the time of the meeting.  Technology
like this will allow for less paper work and more creativity and
innovation
(which can't be a bad thing)]

To take this a step further: Could these ideas also be applied to
education,
an anarchic schooling system?

I believe this is also possible.  Given that pupils have sufficient
motivation to work, generally they are more likely to work in a looser
system.  Freedom to work at your own pace and to form orders and groups
spontaneously in order to complete set goals could improve education
immensely.

There has been a long running project in England, which puts children with
behavioural difficulties in a 'school with no rules' (teachers are there
for
when children want to learn, but they are not forced to attend classes).
 Generally even children who display the worst behavioural problems start
to
work (breaking the rules gets boring if there aren't any rules).

If pupils are put in to such a anarchic system when they are young
(changing
over halfway through a pupils school life could prove disastrous) the want
to
work for personal reasons (as opposed to being forced to) should develop
at
an early age.  After which point pupils can be given infinite opportunity
to
broaden their knowledge and develop creative skills.

It seems to me that the entire idea of being forced to learn is the cause
of
the many closed minds we see today.  Allowing people to develop their own
reasons to better themselves could dramatically change our society for the
better.

Dear fellow Extrpians,
Possibly creative colaboration and cooperation within a real or virtual
organization owned and operated by its employees might be a more pracical
and effective paln than anarchy?
Please consider this as a meaningful alternative.
Enjoy the dialogue,

This is way off topic, but it's a meme-jungle out there.  An ep of the
Chris Carter series `Millennium' was shown here in Oz the other night, in
which the Grand Key to It All (maybe) is revealed as an impending planetary
line-up of seven planets, all neatly on the same side of the sun as the
earth, in May 2000.  Not having a digital orrey to hand, I wonder if anyone
who does have access to such a program could confirm or deny this detail?
I find it hard to believe, and assume the scriptwriters just kinda...
rearranged the solar system, to make the story work.

I'm very familiar with that photo. It was taken at the news conference
where the coverup story of the balloon was released. It would have been
a small errand to  get the base weather department to send over a
balloon and a radar reflector to use as props. The story additionally
conflicts with the fact that Marcel's assistant was a well trained
weatherman, who would have recognised the weather balloon used by the
Mogul device at first glance, in which case, the original story would
have never gone out.

I only included it because of the Trekkie-like awe some people here have
of their idealized alien visitor's typical technology level.

I have experience in ECM from my USAF experience, and I happened to have
built a police radar superjammer device which used a focussed emp to fry
police radar, which also tended to fry the engine electronics....

I did that on my free time while in the USAF, and wound up having to
give it up to the military....or face charges for frying a base cops
car. I'm sure they've built some cool new battlefield gizmos with my
help...

I've read articles on this for several years. Apparently most of the
largest planets will be within like 20-30 degrees of each other, which
isn't a really great conjunction, and there will be a couple of similar
ones in the decades following, leading to competing doomsday astrology
theories...which can be rather entertaining to someone who knows better.
The tidal influence of such a conjunction will be something like
1/1000th off norm, or some such, so its there, but hardly likely to tear
the world apart, or even make it grunt.

I really liked what Wax had to say. In an anarchy, all possibilities are
allowed. I don't know why you are fixated on the idea that companies
must all be owned by all of their employees. If they go into the job
investing existing assets, then great, but the idea of giving one
ownership for free when they start a job is dumb, not to mention
economical unfeasible (people seem to wonder why the privatization of
many companies in Russia has failed so badly).

Employees should also have the right, as many currently do in this
country, to invest whatever level they wish in the company, even $0. If
they can make a better profit investing elsewhere, its their money. I'm
really tired of people who think that people need to be protected from
themselves. Stupidity is the last Darwinian influence on our society,
lets not give that up, lest we begin to deevolve....

Such a two class system would describe pre-technological culture just
fine. When writing, permanent structures, and specialization began to
occur, the maker category became necessary to symbolize those who built
newness and were not tied to the wheel of life. THis is why the gods
were so pissed at Prometheus and stuck him on that rock. ;)

Thanks, this completely illustrated the point I've been trying to make.
Everyone here has these heavily dogmatically weighted blinders on about
star faring aliens. They think that because they may be eons ahead of us
that their technology will never break down, that by their point in
development, an interstellar trip would be as easy and common an
operating regeime as highway or airline travel is for us, that the idea
that their ships would break is ludicrous. We've been building highway
capable cars for 100 years with trillions of miles, and billions of
production units to show for it, and still its extremely rare to have a
car that doesn't break something unexpectedly even at least once in the
first 50,000 miles. Even though a properly maintained car may last
200,000 miles, or even a million in EvMick's case, it is still gonna
break, and Murphy knows that its gonna break when you least expect or

Was an excellent tactic to penetrate hilly central and eastern europe to
attack Soviet columns that would be expected in a blitzkreig attack
outnumbering NATO by 20 to 1. The laser bombs  carried by the FB were
developed to take out our own bridges, which were precisely surveyed, to
slow and impede a Soviet advance.

As I recall, lookdown shootdown radar was not developed till the 80's,
and the computing power to clean out the gound noise to spot a guy at 90
feet was decades away. The soviets did not have this capability till the
late 80's with their Mig-31.

Also, outside of losses in Vietnam, F-111's lost less than 10% attrition
over 20 years. WHile I was stationed in NM, we lost one plane (out of
over 60), and that was a hydraulic failure, not a TFR failure. The TFR
has a failsafe where it puts the plane into a steep climb out if it
malfunctions.

That happens to consistently win awards at Red Flag bombing exercises.

The only real things that sucked about it from an air combat point of
view was it size and its damn swing wings. With so little wing area,
proportionately, that there is a high wing loading, and the swing wings,
that are automatically positioned based on the planes kinetic energy
level, its adversary can automatically see which planes are in weak
positions at which points in a dogfight by the position of the
swingwing. This is why when I was working on F-15 Eagles outside of
Tacoma, we consistently beat the hell out of the Navy Top Guns (flying
F-14s) at Miramar in our annual cross service dogfight grudge match.

The japanese project is what probably gave us the idea for the Mogul
project. The mag also claims that the Germans had captured a saucer
during the war, and that we got it when we cleaned house over there.

I've read the report on Roswell and it was well done, in what it
covered, with the exception that in the extensive coverage they give of
Col. Corso, they consistently misidentify him as a gentleman named
Kauffmann.

They also have recently done a story on the "new" Area 51. They claim
that Groom Lake has been locked up and deactivated for the last 1 1/2 to
two years, and then go on this really well done investigative work to
find its "new" location. They conclude that since Michael Air Field will
be the landing area of the new X-33 space plane prototype, which is
being built by the Skunk Works, and that the engineers at Lockheed have
designed a small payload bay to fit between the fuel tanks that was not
in the original specifications, and that the Phillips Lab at White Sands
is building various cockpit and payload configurations for this plane,
that they have decided that the Utah Launch Facility that White Sands
owns and is renovating will be the classfied launch site for classified
missions with this platform.

Thus they have designated this new site as the "new" Area 51, and are
doing a big webwide PR campaign with their site and magazine and TV show
to convince everyone of this "truth".

Unfortunately, this ignores a couple things, namely that the big land
grab that the Air Force went through two years ago to more effectively
close off Groom Lake to prying eyes took effect just about the time that
PM claims Groom Lake went inactive. 

Why would they waste all of that time, energy, money, and real estate
when they aren't going to take advantage of it?

One thing PM did let slip out was that they tried to buy commercial
spysat pics from the Russian Spysat agency (which sells them to anyone)
of the "new" site, but were denied the higher resolution pics "for
security reasons". Whose security? THis seems funny that the Russians
can take pictures anytime they want of American facilities but US
citizens can't see them under threat of deadly force. 

I then myself called the US office of the Russian spysat agency seeking
pictures of Groom Lake, figuring that if its inactive then it must now
be an ok site to get pictures of, right? No go. The Russians still won't
let pictures out of Groom Lake. 

THis leads me to conclude that PM is an active propaganda/disinformation
arm of the Black agencies of our government, seeking to distract people
from Area 51, and by association, anything else they say about related
subjects is suspected propaganda.

Variants of the F-111 ranged upward to the F variants. The B was the
FB-111B, i.e. the "bomber" version that was typically based exlusively
at Lakenheath over in England, and was used against those baddies, the
Libyans by good old Ron. The C variant was an export version bought by
Australia, the D version I worked on, which had more powerful engines
and shorter wings, and the E and F variants that were used in electronic
warfare missions, and still are today.

I can attest to the ruggedness of the D version. I personally was on the
ramp when one came in with the following story:

They were at around 5,000 feet and flew through a thermal that had a
bunch of eagles in it. They took one down on engine, which promptly
killed that engine, and sent pureed eagle through the compressor outlet
to the environmental system such that it began snowing frozen eagle
blood in the cockpit. Another hit the nose cone head on and shattered
the composite structure, so that it (the nose cone) then hung down
vertically like a flaccid John Holmes as a loose basket of fibers. A
second eagle then hit the nose, which penetrated the avionics bays,
happened to hit the pressure valve for the cockpit capsule dead on and
broke into the cockpit, dying its last gasps on the WSO's (pronounced
wizzo) lap, who was a butter bar leutenant on one of his first flights
in that machine. 

WIth all the drag of the limp nose cone, and only one engine running,
the pilot, a Col. vietnam vet, put that last engine of full afterburner
to maintain speed above stall, and limped home over 400 miles.

I was rather impressed to watch the thing land, with its nose dragging
on the airstrip.

Or even if they've been up there a while. Look at how we still haven't
gotten back to the moon, when "logic" says that we should be colonizing
Mars now with more than dead bacteria on our robots. Other civilizations
, odds are, would have just as much chance of backsliding, budget
pinching as we have shown. We've been focusing our energies on
consolidating power on this planet first. The initial moon trip was a
political ploy as a gambit in that contest.

Imagine the on that other planet the length of the lull after the first
interstellar voyage that only finds dead rock in the next solar system
over, and leaves a planetary economy in ruins. How many decades or
centuries do you think it will be before some engineers can con somebody
into paying for another mission to a different star. All of their
"conventional wisdom" will tell them that our radio signals are a
natural phenomenon that they don't understand yet, yak, yak, wha, wha.
"Why should we go to other stars when we can barely support the asteroid
habitats whe have now?" "We need to concentrate on problems with space
travel in our own system." The amount of time it will take to
consolidate power in a space the size of a solar system is a bit of a
chore. In this respect, I would guess that any advanced travelers would
be descended from free enterprisers that wouldn't let a star systems
bureaucracy slow them down.

High fractional C velocities in our interstellar spaces is turning out
to be a pretty corrosive environment, according to data from Hubble. The
concentration of hydrogen is higher, as is the dust and ice
concentrations, not to mention the effect the  radiation levels of such
speeds will have on materials structural abilities.

Given this, the risk of vehicle failure at the far end of the rope is at
its Murphy maximum.

Sorry, the hard radiation of impacts and dopplershift would embrittle

How do you stop? SOrry, you've got to turn that mutha around and brake
for as long as you've been accelerating. That puts your ass end open to
reentry through an alien solar systems Oort cloud.

For starters, the shuttle orbits at a mere 17,000 mph, and it still
breaks down half the time, causing the mission to be cut in half. You
can't do that on an interstellar mission. "Oops, Snorf, we busted the
toilet, we've gotta turn around...."

Sure, so to "ensure" that they would not be worn out, an alien
bureaucrat supposes, they'd be brand new. And sitting in a hanger at a
standstill for several years enduring hard radiation wouldn't harm it a
bit. Buddy, you are talking to someone who has worked on the best we've
got, and they still wear out, and still crash. Expecting your godlike
aliens to be any different is pure delusion.

There is nothing badly designed about them. They are doing their best
with what they can get. Lockheeds skunk works had a few dozen geniuses
who made things work right the first time. That kind of skill is a wee
precious commodity that regualr service cannot afford in any but
extremely special circumstances.

My first squadron, the 318th FIS in Tacoma, had 350 people covering all
jobs related to running a fleet of 24 F-15A and B, except for base
logistics. Of those, 30 were pilot officers, and 6 others were admin
officers. The remainder were all enlisted personnel, half of which had
not graduated high school before basic training (the older guys). We had
the highest utilization rate in the USAF TAC the first year I was there,
and had not lost a plane in over ten years (we had lost an F-106 a few
months before they were retired in 1979). Our unit was deactivated in
January of 1990.

Neither did the CIA operate the A-12 at the level the USAF did the
SR-71, and half of the SRs WERE operated by the CIA prior to USAF
takeover. If you'll recall, the reason they were turned over was because
LBJ had announced the plane's existence (and incidentally screwing up
the plane's designation), and it wouldn't look good having the CIA with
its own publicly known air force.

The CIA also did not have the operating environment militarily that the
USAF did. By the time the USAF took over, the Soviets had developed
missiles capable of catching the plane, which required the development
of EW units for the plane.

Nope, it was a report by a soldier who claimed to be at the crash site
of the full vehicle, not the Brazel ranch.

If its all cultural related to current scifi literature projections of
technology, where are the cyber abductions? Where are the "I was

The reports I've seen said that the materials, when looked at under a
microscope, looked like they were made up of bazillions of microscopic
welds.

This would necessitate a welding machine the size of bacteria, eh?

Corso was at the base at the time. This is known.

You forget the bureaucratic machine. Don't have something on base?
where's the right contractor? From what I've seen of Area 51, its all
contractor run. From my own experience on many bases, most of the
logisitics stuff is handled by civilians and contractors.

The photos released were several days later, after Gen Ramey had put the
cover story in place. Considering that weather balloons were heavily
used by the weather people on base, gussying up something in a day or so
would be rather easy.

According to Brazel, the eve before he initially found the scattered
peices (June 15th), he and his family experienced a huge explosive
sound, louder in his opinion than the lightning that was common on
summer evenings in that area.

The idea is that some explosion occured on the craft, spewing stuff over
Brazel's field, but the craft still had altitude and crashed a number of
miles away, which is where the main vehicle and bodies were found.

But the mogul project was BASED at Roswell. If anyone knew what a Mogul
balloon was, it would have been the people at Roswell field.

Anyways, outside of the radio reciever, the mogul balloon was exactly
like a normal weather balloon. The radar reflectors were for radar
tracking of the balloon.

The payload was a string of radar reflectors and a radio receiver with a
tape device. Not hush hush.

According to the story, the larger wreckage was found several days or
weeks later, once the story was clamped on.

Hoping to draw to a close this particular tangent, 
FWIW, both the Wright Patt and the Eglin museum Web 
pages contain essentially the same text:

>
Originally known as the TFX (Tactical Fighter "X"), 
the F-111 was conceived to meet a USAF requirement 
for a new tactical fighter-bomber. In 1960, the 
Department of Defense combined the USAF's requirement 
with a Navy need for a new air superiority fighter, 
then launched a competition among aircraft 
manufacturers for the final design. In 1962, 
General Dynamics and Boeing were selected as 
finalists with the General Dynamics TFX design 
eventually winning out.
The Navy version was known as the F-111B and the 
USAF version the F-111A. The first flight of 
the F-111A took place in December 1964, and 
the first production models were delivered to 
the USAF in 1967. Meanwhile, the Navy's F-111B 
program was canceled. In all, 566 F-111s of all 
series were built; 159 of them were preproduction 
and production F-111As. 
<

All other references I can find, both print and Web, 
refer to the actually-fielded AF bomber variant as FB-111A.
The airframe was stretched, it has more tankage,
and of course it has AF-style midair refueling,
rather than the Navy's probe-and-drogue.

It seems clear to me that Grumman "recycled" the suffix 
when the time came to propose an enhanced FB-111A, 
and that the F-111B was a substantially different 
critter than the FB-111 with any trailing letter. 
Find me an FB-111 with a tail hook and 
fold-up wings, and I'll reconsider. :)

The source I find most instructive is

http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pettypi/elevon/baugher_us/f111.html#RTFToC11

where FB-111B and FB-111H are mentioned as 
_proposed_ variants of the FB-111A.

I haven't found any Navy sources on the Web yet.

Hoping we can now draw the curtains, I remain

Yr ob't Corresp.

Well, I cranked up my copy of the freeware Home Planet program
(written by the estimable John Walker) and set the Wayback machine
for 2000 - May 01, then let it walk forward.

It looks like all the planets do wind up on the same side of the
Sun, *not counting the Earth*--but from an astrological perspective 
I guess the Earth isn't a planet... Or that all the planets except Mars, 
but _counting_ the Earth, wind up on the same side, depending on exactly
what day in May you look at.

Hardly a line-up. At least by my orrery, all you get is a scatter of planets 
that all fall on one side of an imaginary line bisecting the Solar System.

Well, *AS SEEN FROM EARTH* they would make a line; but this is
just because they're pretty much more or less on the plane of the Ecliptic
(I'm not sure what's up with Pluto, and I'm not fascinated enough
to go fire up Home Planet again and go see about it). Not counting Pluto, 
that would be seven planets in a line, visible at night, all right. 
A pretty long line, though.

Methinks they "sweetened this up" for an impressive _2001_-style lineup
visual. Did they?

See above. I welcome anyone else to confirm. It may very well be rare.

This is one step above the physical transport layer. Upon it, you can 
mount a DNS-like abstraction.  However, I simply don't like global 
distributed databases. Machines don't need syntactic sugar, anyway.

A solution: you leave a message stream reflector in your home (sweet 
home) node, you leave a trail of forwarding agents as you travel. When 
two agents discover they communicate via a relais, they snap the pointer, 
and start communicating directly. When you move, you report your new cell 
address to the last agent. _Very_ limited flooding (just few bits of the 
binary ID) should catch you even at Mach 5.

If you move permanently, you give notification to all relevant parties, 
so that the bulk gets redirected to your new location. A bounce agent 
left in place will forward you the rest, while also notifying the senders 
about your address change.

There's a million of ways to make this practicable. The chiefest reason 
is that you don't need routing anymore, switches (which are vastly simpler 
and dumber) are sufficient. So let's chuck out TCP/IP.

Hi, yes it will happen, but I heard that all the rest of the planets were
gonna be on the other side of the sun than us.  Either way there will be an
allignment.  Also, many people, including scientists and researchers, believe
that there will be a pole shift on that day, in which the pole will shift on
its axis with antarctica going to the equator.  There's lots of stuff to back
up this theory, such as there being trees on antarctica and the ancient
egyptians saying that the sun used to rise in the west.  There's lots of
books on the subject.  Oh ya, the big thing, all the cataclysms that are
suppose to occur on that day, earthquakes, 500 mile an hour winds(although i
think that all the winds will turn into lots of hurricanes, dropping the
windspeed to 200+), 300 ft tidal waves, widespread freezes, and sea levels
rising (from Antarctica going to the sea, either by sliding off, due to the
momentum and because it is slippery where the ice meets land because ice
turns to sludge with a lot of pressure, causing tidal waves for slipping in,
or it will eventually melt).  But the main thing is the shift in
consciousness it will bring.

Do a search on "pole shift", but here are some addresses:

Wow! I spent an hour reading through those sites Danny listed. All I

        I'm having a little bit of a problem trying to understand how the
allignment of seven planets and an alleged pole shift can cause a
"doomsday" of sorts...but I'm no scientist.  Could someone please explain
it in a few words?  Thanks.

Just a curious observation: what is it about the nature of human minds
that makes them constantly get my name wrong (even Max called me

that it bothers me at all; you can call me Fred for all I care, but it

No, this was shown in the `Millennium' episode *literally* with a
lead-balls-on-wire orrery, O-------, then `confirmed' by good ole Frank
firing up the net and getting the planets strung out on the screen, away
from the sun, making a straight line pointing at... the mote in God's eye,
maybe.  Common sense told me that if anything *this* wonderful-looking was
on the cards, every astronomer in town would be crowing about the
2001-style spectacle, and every fruitcake would be howling abt the
apocalypse and the world flipping over.  Then danny's post arrived in the
nick of time to show that I was right about that, at any rate, even when
all the silly little bits of dirt and gas are up to is roughly tumbling
along in the south-east half of the field.  Aw shit, people.  (Or am I
missing the smiley here somewhere?)

No, because (so the argument runs) we now comprise about a tenth of all
humans who've lived until now.  It's a very plausible time to be alive.

Incidentally, John Leslie makes it clear that the extinction argument only
goes through if there are objective reasons to expect doomsday - such as
nuclear war threats, environmental hazards, black hole engulfment,
metastable vacuum collapse on a cosmic scale, etc.  It's a subtle point -
in fact, it escapes me at the moment, but then I haven't had my dinner yet
- and lets him out of the implicit charge of quietism or defeatism.  We can
*change the odds* in our favour (or against them, as we're tending to do
this century, alas).

I think I'd go with 'individual'; 'personal' doesn't convey quite the same
degree of separation from the social and, dare I say it, the right degree
of reflexivity.

Sigh. So much for critical thinking. 1 point to the millennial meme,
0 to basic physics. 

Why would the alignment of planet induce the *huge* torques needed to
shift the axis of rotation? The Earth has a total rotational energy
of around 2.57e29 J; shifting the angular momentum vector would
require energies on this order. The Earth is nearly spherical, so
where would these torques be applied? Tidal forces won't do, since
they would simply rip apart the planet (and most other planets). Why
haven't we noticed *a lot* of evidence for immense changes in the
rotation axes and orbits of most planets (if the earth is affected,
what about the asteroids, mars and all the moons)? Why don't we
notice similar effects among the moons of Jupiter, which are more
massive compared to their central mass and have faster periods, and
hence would align quite often? Why haven't we noticed periodic mass
extinctions every few thousand years instead of tens of million years
apart (a pole shift would certainly cause such an extinction)?

A nice example of belief bias. There are other, more likely
explanations in accord with known physics, such as fossils/stranded
logs from elsewhere in the case of antarctic trees (it was quite
balmy before the current ice age, I think) or mistranslations in the
case of the egyptians (wouldn't the chinese have noticed it too?). 

That there are people who believe in pole shifts doesn't make it
likely. They hypothesis contradicts a lot of known physical laws
(elementary mechanics), predicts some things which are not observed
(like very noticeable geological upheavals in historical times),
explains away the lack of evidence in an ad hoc manner (Velikovsky
was a master of this; he claimed many disasters were forgotten due to
global amnesia!) and its proponents rely heavily on predictions by
astrologers and seers rather than observations. 

It is very likely the millennium will pass with just the usual amount
of disasters, plus the results of a surge of more or less unlikely
doomsday predictions. I don't think this list is the right place to
debate this kind of rubbish.

Does McKenna actually have some evidence for this, or is he also
basing his claim on that it "feels right"? It goes against most
paleontology and what I understand of evolutionary theory. 

Besides, isn't savannahs (or coastal areas if you believe in the
aquatic ape theory) very poor in natural psychedelics? How would
McKenna explain that?

I know this is total nonsense, and probably you do too.  Is there anyone on
this list who thinks this might be true, and wants me to talk them out of
it?  Other than Danny himself, of course, who will apparently believe
anything spectacular regardless of how poor the evidence.

The gist of the arument is that the gravitational forces on the Earth
produced by the planetary alignment are infinitesimal compared to the forces
produced by the moon and sun.  If anyone cares, I can compute the actual
forces involved.

First Velikousky then Roswell and now this. People, this is the Extropian 
list, a small island free of junk science, if I wanted this level of analysis 
I'd pick up a tabloid at my local supermarket. The only thing that should be 
offlimits on this list is terminal stupidity. This topic should be off limits.

No need to tell me I'm being rude, I already know that, but if you can't 
flame somebody over something like this, what can you flame them over?

     Rick Knight further elaborates:
     
     Daniel Quinn has three books by my counting, the first "Providence" is 
     an autobiographical tale of how the author attempted to become a 
     Trappist monk.  
     
     The second, and most popular, is "Ishmael" about a telepathic, 
     super-intelligent gorilla who is the mentor for a disillusioned man in 
     his mid-life crisis.  The characters and plot are a springboard for 
     Quinn's beliefs on human history which I don't mean to trivialize at 
     all.  They are fascinating and worthy of consideration.
     
     The latest, "The Story of B" is about a young American Catholic priest 
     who is sent on a mission to investigate a man called "B" who, by his 
     speaking, is stirring up a lot of controversy and gathering a hefty 
     following around Europe.  Again, the same notions of the author are 
     conveyed using a narrative plot convention.
     
     Quinn has a web page (www.bnetwork.com) I think.  He seems to be 
     pretty well read on history and anthropology.  He has divided the 
     people of the world into leavers (environmentally passive) and takers 
     (environmentally exploitive).  He's an advocate of balance for the 
     sake of long term human sustainability.
     
     I would regard a third world shepherd as a leaver, a western world 
     rancher as a taker.  The distinction being on their overall impact on 
     the world at large.  The shepherd's flock might eat up the grass in a 
     meadow which locally may locally impact the population but a modern 
     cattle facility can spoil groundwater and produce over abundant 
     amounts of methane, not to mention how much grain it takes to feed the 
     cattle that one doesn't get back nutritionally or substantively in the 
     resultant meat or dairy consumption for which the cattle are raised.

There are many people who argue that this is already happening.  Tom
Malone, and his MIT Center for Coordination Science (http://ccs.mit.edu/),
think that networked information technology (what we're all usin' here) is
enabling more market-like business structures to replace hierarchical ones.
 It's most obvious manifestation is more outsourcing and the rise in
individual consulting, which is what I do.  You also see more large
businesses breaking into independant profit&loss units.

Mind you, it might be my management hat talking, but I don't think it will
move in the direction you describe.  There may not be bosses and workers,
but there will still be customers and vendors.  Think of the independant
consultant model again.  When I consult for Company B, the designer or
producer isn't my boss, but they decide what they want me to produce for
them (though likely with advice from me), and if I agree then I am
contractually obligated to produce that.  And I want to, because it will
lead to repeat business and a good reputation.  On the other hand, if I
have lots of clients and I am not happy with how Comany B worked, then I
can turn them down the next time they have a project.

The idea isn't to eliminate forces and incentives.  Right now we have
hierarchical structures that opperate within a market environment.  They
say:  "we pay you a yearly salary, so you have to do whatever I say or quit
and find another job".  (Mind you, here in Silicon Valley, competition for
software professionals is so fierce that the answer to this is often "OK, I
quit".)  You could replace the hierarchical structure with a market
structure, where they say "I'll pay you $X for x work, $Y if you do y, and
nothing if you do z, and you get a cut of the profits from A if we finish
it".  What you need are systems that allow us to define x, y, and z clearly
enough that disputes can be resolved.

(You also need systems that allow the customer to coordinate the schedules
and products of many different vendors, and to choose between cost and
quality of various potential vendors.  That's what Tom talks about.)

>To take this a step further: Could these ideas also be applied to education,
>an anarchic schooling system?

David Friedman has an essay in Machinery of Freedom on a anarcho-capitalist
education system.  You should check that out, though it's mostly applied to
college.  Personally, I would love to see a world where 18 year olds could
get reasonable jobs without going to annother four years of school.

>immensely.

You have a bit more faith in this approach than I do.  Evaluations of
"Schools without Walls" here in the US have been mixed at best, and hard to
separate from the effect of having higher-quality teachers at the
experimental schools.  There are many students who need a fair amount of
structure to acheive, myself included.  What I'd rather see is a variety of
types of learning environments, so parents and students could choose the
approach that worked best for them.

What's the hardest problem I see?  It's the same one as in the
market-structured company: how do you define the output?  Imagine briefly
that schools don't exist to warehouse teenagers and keep them off the
streets in their most violent age period.  Instead that diploma is a
certificate that promises that the student has completed the program at a
school with a given reputation, and the transcript describes roughly how
well the student did.  This is then used by the student when talking to
potential employers as evidence of their aptitude and knowledge in certain
areas.

So, in an anarchic (or market-like) school, what do you have to show the
employers?  You need something more consise that the entire portfolio of
work, and you'd like something that helps them rank you in relation to
other applicants.  The option our federal government like is to create one
Great Standard Tesk of All Knowledge, but that's likely to dictate how
children are made to learn and doesn't help in specialized fields.  I'd
rather start thinking from the employer's perspective, of what they need to
know.  Any ideas?

There will, I believe, come a point in my life when I choose to raise a
child with a (female) partner of my choice; and it is highly likely that
she will bear the child. This being the case, and my being
spermatozoically-challenged (the current PC phrase, I suspect), does anyone
have any hard facts about the possibility of my genes being used to replace
those in the sperm of an anonymous donor, resulting in a child of which I
am a true parent?

Any help greatly appreciated.

The most interesting thing he references in the book (which I don't have
any more) is an experiment (don't ask me the details, I can't remember)
which showed that certain small amounts of psylocibin increase perceptual
abilities, and slightly larger amounts than that increase libido.  (I
haven't checked his references.)  I would be quite happy to admit it's
all nonsense if it is, but if it isn't it's really quite exciting and
thought provoking.

He goes into this question in the book.  Again, I can't
remember the details, I'm sorry - it's a while since I read the book.

Check it out.  He's a good writer, and he is coherent - he doesn't
babble, and he really makes an effort to be clear and precise. If he's
mad he's mad in a really interesting way, not a boring way like the
usual flake.

I think its cause Daniel is a longer word than Lee, so people kinda
subconciously associate the short word with an initial or middle name.

ELiezer Yudkowski's proposed Institutes of Verification, where one goes
to test for copmetency in ones field independent of the school or
college one attends, therefore, there is no pressure for grade
inflation, etc. is one solution. A big standard test would be useful if
one could take it several times through high school to get an idea of
where the individual may need to focus more attention.

credible job of combineing many emergent technologies .  I read it the first

it...I guess some of the ideas had to ferment for a while.

And it IS hard...it's easy to be glib and talk about "Singularities" and
"Technological Revolutions" and "The Third Wave"...but i think...(as has been

that means..

Hell...most people don't even have a clear idea of what MONEY is...now try to
imagine a culture that has no need for it?  (James Hogan wrote a novella that
addressed that subject...don't recall the title...had to do with interstellar
colinization..via vat grown embryos under computer control).

The transition period is what's intriguing...anything beyond a few years gets
TOO fantastic..  but how will nanotech...cold

implemented...in the next few years?  SOON

I...personally...think it will destroy governments as a concept...and a

I wasn't aware that the F-111 needed to fold up its swept wings
vertically, nor is anyone I recall ever talking to, including my father
who was a subcontractor. As for a tail hook, with the exception of
deltawinged century series jets and some models of F-4, just about every
AF fighter plane since 1960 has had tail hooks. They are very useful for
making assisted landings when the brakes fail, usually due to hydraulic
failure. I certainly recall the FB-111s that were transferred to Cannon
AFB from Pease as having tailhooks, though I could be wrong, or it could
have been a modification.

Plan for what?  By anarchy, we are talking about spontaneous organization
rather than forced organizations, not the absence of organization.  I will
say that "creative collaboration" and decision by consensus is *not* the
way to run an fast, flexible, and efficient business.  It may be more
democratic, promote better communication, and possibly even be more
intelligent, but it does not make good business sense in the majority of
situations.  When was the last time you saw a committee do anything useful
in a timely fashion?  Now would you really want to run an entire company
that way?  I certainly wouldn't.  Strict heirarchies have their place.

That said, though, I would like to say that I am generally very supportive
of individual sovereignty in the work place.  Everyone has it, but most
people don't realize it.  Most people seem to carry the perception that the
heirarchy imposed in the workplace somehow carries over into the rest of
their lives.  Subservience isn't necessary but sure is popular.  The
receptionist is equal in all ways to the CEO, but with a different skill set.

   I have read this book and it is quite a scholarly piece, with 
extensive references and experimentation.  His basic premise is that of 
neurological darwinism.  Those primitive tribes who imbibed psilocybin 
from time to time, were more likely to experience novel perceptions of 
themselves and their environment.  As to weather any one of these new 
perceptions provided evolutionary advantage is irrelevant in the face of 
brute-force statistical iteration.  In time, those tribes who were 
increasing the number of ways of perceiving their environment, were more 
likely to stumble (even blindly) onto an evolutionary advantageous 
pathway.

   These pathways could have have been as simple as new made-up sounds 
and contextual body movements.  This would have the side effect of 
widening their range of linguistic potentialities and in turn practical 
language applications.  With increase communication within their tribe, 
this would bring about more coherent patterns in their search for food 
and shelter; thereby increasing there chances for survival.

   That psilocybin produces brain-change is undeniable.  That it 
necessarily increases ones brain capacity is arguable.  But through 
shear random brain change, some of those changes will be evolutionary 
advantageous and some of them may not.

I would have to disagree.  Decision by consensus makes poor business sense
and becomes increasingly unusable as the number of individuals increases.
Although it produces arguably more intelligent results, the process is
simply too slow and tedious to be responsive to the market.  A team of
people does not have the focus and direction that a single over-riding
individual (manager) can give, and cannot make decisions as quickly.

A model that works better is a consensual heirarchy i.e. a group of
otherwise equally ranked individuals imposes a heirarchy upon themselves by
selecting managers and agreeing to abide by the decisions of the selected
managers.  I've seen this work well for transient virtual teams of
independant contractors.

This model assumes that everyone operates as an independent contractor.  My
favorite aspects of this model is that it would make the work environment
very market driven.  It would allow rapid and accurate adjustments in wages
as the market changed and as job requirements changed.  However, the
current structure of business is too rigid to adapt to such a fluid and
equilibrium sensitive job model.  I do know of (and have worked for) a
couple small companies that actually operate this way.  You don't have to
do anything you don't want to (no work, no pay of course), and the pay for
work is adjusted according to type and market values.  In my experience
this actually seems to produce a more efficient work environment, with few
administrative hassles and a lot more satisfied employees.  It is a lot
more relaxing when you are not "required" to do anything.

There is a problem with the terminology social/individual. For example,
a hermit could chose to have over-optimistic beliefs to cher himself up.
This would be an "individual" role, but in the distinction we want to capture
it comes on the other side. Is epistemic/nonepistemic role too technical?

(I miss Red Kryptonite.  It was fun.)

Is the goo color chart in a FAQL somewhere?

Isn't it already happening?  Better information flow is reducing the number of 
levels in a hierarchy, or so the pundits say.  Vertical integration is becoming 
less common, as companies find it's better to have multiple sources than a 
single source, even oneself.

I once planned to make a sensitive Polish movie trilogy called *Three

Yes, there are several articles by Carter and by Leslie, and there is one
paper in Nature by Gott (vo.368, 1994, p.108). The best sorce is Leslie's
The End of the World (1996). For other references see my paper.

The resultant probabilities depend both on the priors and on the strength
of the probability shift we make because of the DA. The priors are 
determined by such things as how likely a nuclear war seems etc. If the
prior probability of doom is extremely small then even a rather large
shift won't make doom probable. By taking action to reduce the likelihood
of an all-out nuclear war, or the grey goo scenario, we change the odds of
doom. But it is not clear that even very good priors would suffice to make
doom not almost certain.

To interject a notion....is it possible that our esteemed collegue is
thinking of a shift in the magnetic pole?  I seem to recall that magnetic
pole shift occurs rather regularly....in fact...isn't that a method used to
measure continental drift?  That is ...observe the magnetic alignment of the

Very Cool!  What companies were they?  I worked with someone who was
suggesting that our company pick up a similar model, but we didn't in the
end.  I suspect one of the biggest problems is trying to interface such a
system with a traditional hierarchy.  I kinda wish we had tried it out; it
sure couldn't have made anything worse!

And how was the type of work and market value determined?

Which may be all very well for certain people, and for temporary
modifications, but given the severity and irreversibility of the operation
we are discussing, and the fact that many people asking for it have other
psychological problems, it doesn't seem inappropriate for the medical
profession to act as 'gatekeepers'. Perhaps this a moral issue which will
have to be faced in an individual basis for each possible modification as
the technology we so-often discuss becomes available; but right now I think
it important that somebody take responsibility for making sure that this
particular, major, and undeniably medical, decision is not taken
mistakenly: and who better than the medical profession to do that? The
answer may come back, 'The individual concerned', but many such people are
not be in a suitable mental state to take such a decision: why should the
medical profession throw out its duty of patient care in these cases?

Yes, I have seen this too (including on some astrophysics website). I
think it is true, since the "random"  forces from the other planets
ought to induce (very slow) precession and change in the rotation
axis, while having a large moon would create a system where angular
momentum changes could be shared between the planet, moon and the
entire system (and since the system has a very large angular momentum
compared to the planet, the changes would be much smaller). Is this a
reasonable explanation, or just a sign of "what the thinker thinks,
the prover proves"?

How many more times to I have to say this: *MARCEL HIMSELF STATED THAT
THIS PARTICULAR PHOTO SHOWS THE DEBRIS HE PICKED UP AT THE RANCH*. Go read
"The Roswell Incident" by Berlitz and Moore, the book which started this
whole Industry. If Marcel is telling the truth then that is a photo of the
real debris. If he's not, then his entire testimony is suspect and the 
story falls apart anyway.

You can claim that Marcel is a liar, you can claim that Berlitz and Moore
are liars, but if you believe the Roswell Industry then that photo is
*real*.

Their concern wasn't with the balloon, it was with the 'flying disc' which
was attached to the balloon. Which wasn't standard issue on weather
balloons of the period.

If you have no ova, then the likelihood of you and a female partner
parenting a child is not likely in the near future.  Cloning you
entirely is probably within reach, next will come the ability for
two ova to fertilize each other (say your partner and your mother
or sister).  But something on your side has to undergo meiosis, and
that currently only happens in ova, so the prospect for that is
further off (but surprizes do happen).

Of course, you can easily--even legally--today, have a child with 50%
of your partner's genes, 25% of yours, and 25% of your ancestors' by
having your partner inseminated by your brother or father.

And as for that "true parent" quote, I tend to reject the idea that
DNA has anything at all to do with parenting.

If a person is mentally competent to engage in ordinary contracts, can
hold a job, make decisions such concerning sexual relations, other
medical procedures, and other important aspects of life, then any law
or professional "standard" that interferes with that individual's
decision is repugnant to individual sovereignty.

Any doctor who dared to presume such a "responsibility" on my behalf
I would fire on the spot.  I hire doctors for education and experience,
so that they can advise me of all the options and risks; ALL decisions
are mine, and mine alone, without exception.  Medicine is just a product
like any other, and the doctor provides that product at my request and
for my payment.  Any other "duty" he feels is only in his mind, and
perhaps the legislature's.

It is truly disheartening how many people mystify fields like
medicine and law, treating their practitioners as something other
than laborers no different from carpenters and plumbers, and somehow
implying that they should be treated differently.  Well if I want
green tile in my kitchen, I'm not going to listen to some builder
telling me I'm not capable of that decision.  Why should I tolerate
the same arrogance from a doctor or lawyer?

A good idea. The following is from my terminology pages:

BLUE GOO: Nanomachines used as protection against grey goo and other
destructive nanomachines, possibly even used for law-enforcement
(nanarchy). According to the entry in the Jargon File, it is
sometimes used to denote any form of benign nanotechnology in the
environment. 

GREEN GOO: Nanomachines or bio-engineered organisms used for
population control of humans, either by governments or eco-terrorist
groups. Would most probably work by sterilizing people through
otherwise harmless infections. See Nick Szabo's essay Green Goo --
Life in the Era of Humane Genocide.

GOLDEN GOO: Another member of the grey goo family of nanotechnology
disaster scenarios.  The idea is to use nanomachines to filter gold
from seawater. If this process got out of control we would get piles
of golden goo (the "Wizard's Apprentice Problem"). This scenario
demonstrates the need of keeping populations of self-replicating
machines under control; it is much more likely than grey goo, but
also more manageable. [Originated on sci.nanotech 1996]

GREY GOO: Self-replicating (von Neumann) nanomachines spreading
uncontrolably, building copies of themselves using all available
material. This is a commonly mentioned nanotechnology disaster
scenario, although it is rather unlikely due to energy constraints
and elemental abundances. More probable disaster scenarios are the
green goo, golden goo and red goo, khaki goo scenarios. As a
protection blue goo has been proposed.

KHAKI GOO: Military nanotechnology; see grey goo. 

RED GOO: Deliberately designed and released destructive
nanotechnology, as opposed to accidentally created grey goo.

BERGOO: A related term to grey goo, used (jokingly) to refer to the
mistaken idea that during the singularity powerful technologies would
decimate non-transhumanists, and that some transhumanists would see
this as desirable (which is clearly against the Transhuman
Principles).  [Dale Carrico 1996]

Hmm, an interesting idea. I think it would be possible to replace the
genetic material in the nucleus of a spermatozoa with your genetic
material (taken from an oocyte), but it would be very tricky. It
might also be possible to inject your genetic material in her oocyte
and then let a donated sperm cell without genetic material merge with
it to start the division sequence (I'm not 100% sure the sperm cell
is needed; is there a doctor in the house?). 

Of course, I think memes are more important than genes, so is it
really important to have your genes in the child? It would save a lot
of trouble and some risks.

Yes, but at the same time it is extremely hard to write well about a
society where almost everything is different from the present - the
economics, daily life, ideology, technology and sociology. So it is
understandable that many authors try to avoid it.

Yes, it is a quite nice book. Phil Goetz called it "New York
Transhumanism" and I think it fits; it is a static but very nice
(mostly) society, but honestly I don't think it is very stable (the
basic assumption was the utter incorruptibility of the aristoi, which
doesn't seem very likely even given this technological level and
sophistication). It demonstrates several technologies I think we
should try to develop, but maybe not a society we should strive for.

What we seek is not the overthrow of the government but a situation
in which it gets lost in the shuffle.
-- Duncan Frissell <frissell@panix.com>, CP 29-Aug-96 

Personally I think we will be surprised. The new society that I'm
sure will emerge will likely be something utterly different from what
we expect and hope for.

OK, that explanation actually makes some sense. I must admit I
thought he subscribed to deterministic psychedelic evolution a la
Leary (and he seems to do that in his later works, like timewave zero
and his monologue on the Shamen album). 

The basic idea seems to be that psychotropic substances led to faster
memetic evolution, which in turn led to exploration of different ways
of interacting and seeing the world. His problem is to show
that this actually took place.

It is interesting to note that in societies where psychotropic
substances are used for "mind expansion" (as opposed to
entertainment, rest or social facilitation) they are seldom used by
everybody, traditionally it has been the shamans or medicine men who
used them (in fact, the slightly outsider medicine man seems to be an
almost archetypal social figure, just as the alpha male-leader; 
today he exists in the form of the scientist-nerd and other forms) 
and then explained the visions to the tribe. This could act as a
defense against dangerous exploration, it is better to loose one
shaman than the whole tribe.

I'm not sure I buy McKenna's theory, but it is interesting to look at
memetic mutation rates across history and see how they have changed. 
If his theory is right then we should see the fastest memetic
evolution in societies where psychotropic substances were in use and
less in societies where they weren't. Is there any evidence for this?

Have you read the latest reports on the success rate of laser-guided bombs

Maybe the soviets didn't, but Lockheed demonstrated it with the YF12 in
the sixties. They could cruise along at Mach 3 at 70,000 feet and kill
target drones flying at ninety feet. That the Air Force chose not to
continue developing the technology probably has more to do with politics
than engineering (i.e. they're not going to develop technology which
makes the F111 obsolete).

Didn't work very well in England. Presumably it wasn't well tested for
European terrain (from what I remember of my one brief visit New Mexico

Interesting, I hadn't thought of that. I wonder if it works in Strike

Is there no-one investigating the possibility of inducing meiosis in other

A bad choice of words on my part. I suppose there's a circular argument
that says a parent is defined in terms of a genetic relation to offspring,
therefore DNA has a lot to do with parenting. However, as someone
considering the adoption/donor option, I understand exactly what you mean.

Much of which (according to articles I've read by pilots) is imposed by
the government and not really neccesary for safe operation. Even then,
from reading some of Richard Bach's books, the amount of maintenance
required to keep his biplane operational was far higher than that required
for his jets, *and* it crashed more often.

Isn't that what you have a shield there for? I mean, do you really believe

Uh, yes. Just like reentry with the shuttle, only worse. This is why I 
think your figure of 0.98c is much higher than they're really use (and 
way off the scale for the kind of early mission they talked about).

Firstly, note I said 'qualitatively', not 'quantitatively'. We all know
that the shuttle is a massive boondoggle full of cut-price engineering and
frankly I'm surprised it works at all. Even then it's only been called
back early two or three times (not the 50% you mentioned) and the first
time was an early test flight when things were expected to go wrong.

When have NASA ever brought the shuttle back because of a broken toilet? 
AFAIR all those aborts were due to broken fuel cells, and the mission
could have happily continued without them were it not for NASA's paranoia.

But you're still talking about military aircraft, not commercial (and I'd
agree that if this were the first flight that might be a valid comparison,
I just don't think that it would be). And you're talking to someone who
worked as a military avionics designer, so I know more than a little about
the badly designed military maintenance programs that I talked about. I'll
just get into trouble if I *do* talk about them.

Precisely; and they could get a lot better for the same price, if they 
speced it right in the first place.

However, the people who were looking after the Blackbirds weren't those
geniuses, they were just normal Lockheed technicians. The main differences
(from what I've been told) were in training, motivation and longevity; 
the Lockheed crew were there *because* they wanted to work on those planes
and stayed with them for years whereas the Air Force crew were just posted
there and moved on a couple of years later.

Hmm, the CIA were using EW units on their U2s, so I don't see why they'd
have any great problems using them on the Blackbirds. I don't know whether
they were using them prior to the handover and can't check at the moment.

Personally I don't like the way that believers ignore the very plain fact
that all contemporary accounts match that of a Mogul balloon and these
accounts weren't challenged until a third of a century later. Or do you
really believe that alien spacecraft are held together with scotch tape?

Again, if the saucer didn't exist then such reports don't matter. I mean, 
I could claim to have been at the crash site and been temporally 
distorted to the 1990s, but it wouldn't make it true.

How often do you see those on Star Trek? They haven't yet filtered down 
into popular culture.

Possibly, but why should anyone believe the reports? And why would anyone 
with the ability to build such a machine bother with 'welding'? Why not 
just stick it together atom by atom to produce a perfect surface?

And you think that such an organisation could keep this 'crashed alien
spacecraft' a secret for thirty-three years? Why is ignoring these
inconsistencies bad for 'debunkers', but fine for believers? 

Anyway, if this mortician is the same one mentioned at www.roswell.org
then his testimony is extremely suspect. That guy supposedly stated that
he visited the base with a nurse, and gave her name. That nurse isn't
mentioned in any contemporary records. When told this, our first-hand
witness admitted that yes, actually that wasn't her real name, and he
wouldn't give that out. Yeah, right. See the kind of people believers rely
on for their stories?

So. You have evidence that anything was substituted? *Marcel says that the

Alamogordo. Sorry.

Well, according to the Sceptical Enquirer:

"While many UFO proponents claim the wreckage shown in General Ramey's
office was just a weather balloon switched for the "real debris," Moore
pointed out that the radar targets used by NYU were unlike anything flown
in New Mexico before and that "they were not available in Fort Worth to be
substituted for the debris in General Ramey's office." Warrant Officer
Newton was able to recognize the debris in General Ramey's office because
he happened to have used an early version of the same targets while
serving as a weatherman in Okinawa. The earlier-model targets Newton used
did not have the reinforcing tape with the pinkish-purple flower designs." 

But I guess Moore (one of the Project Mogul scientists) is just part of the 
government coverup, right?

Again, a story which didn't appear until over a third of a century later. 
No-one has so far managed to produce any published account of a crashed
alien spacecraft at Roswell prior to "The Roswell Incident", which itself
only included second-hand accounts.

I spent some time on his mailing list last year; he seems like a loon to

few people who openly questioned the theories on the list soon gave up and

He is very involved in the Los Angeles spirituality community.  I'm not
saying this is good or bad.  It is merely a fact.  Much of what he says I
respect, he is fluid and writes in a comely manner.  Although he is listed
as an associated on the masthead of spiritual organizations, I have yet to
hear of him in more pragmatic future-oriented organizations.  If I am
incorrect, enlighten me.

He said it better than I couldl...I was thinking that it was odd for such an
opinion to emanate from a Libertarian group such as the Extropian Mailing
List.  I can imagine what the Anarchists among us must be thinking.

I figure we can't have it both ways...either a socialist "Father knows best"
or ......."Because  I'm the Mommy!!!" type of society....which will
eventually collapse upon itself absent war (in which case it will most likely
be conqured since decesion making is so difficult)....or an uneasy collection
of individuals who profit when they guess right....and suffer when they guess
wrong.

So my feelings are that if someone wants to do something horrible to
himself....such as smoke...eat saturated fats....listen to country
music....watch tv...or engage in some novel surgical procedure...then who is
to tell him no?  Of course if he doesn't like the results  brought about by
 such actions....oh well....

He can serve as an example to others as to why such a course of action should
not be taken.

Because of current available information, programs and news (such as the one
I mentioned) which focus on sex change and the deep psychological problems
of the individuals who underwent it only to find out later in life, I think
that more attention will be paid to who makes the choice.  Unfortunately our
parents are making that choice in our early lives (they sign the papers) in
tandy with the medical profession. Parents who are not well informed will be
looking towards doctors for advice.

The  medical profession in a broad sense.  It must include psychologists,
especially those well educated in gender changes and social issues.

According to the doctrine of the medical profession they should not.

I wonder if a child's sex might be left alone until he/she decides which way
to go, or both ways, or no way.  We will see a mosaic of sex-types in the
coming years.  This will only become a bigger issue.

You shouldn't!  I certainly don't. Yet, it takes time to learn about a
medical problem I have, to research it and get multiple opinions.  Same with
law.  In order to understand the jargon, I need to study law to a degree in
order to understand the negotiations of the contracts.  I did study law to
at least get some kind of certification. Otherwise, I would be at a loss.
Although I might be willing to take the extra time and effort to do this,
not everyone is.  And, even with this, my experience is limited and I would
appear weak in light of a serious negotiation.

I would rather spend the time to find a smart carpenter who will make the
structure I want, rather than do it myself because I don't want to -;)

As for being a *thinking* person and making decisions, no one can or should
make them for me but me.  I'm not sure of the protocol, but I think that in
order to have a sex change operation, one needs to have psychological
evaluations. I have never done this, obviously, so I don't know what it is
about.  It does concern me because I don't know how libertarian the tests
are. I would venture to say that it would be advantageous to know because
the tests probably determine if a person can have the sex change to change
genders.

Hi.  I'd like to briefly ask you to check out a new online magazine that
looks at politics and culture from a twentysomething perspective.  It's
located at http://www.journalx.com

And if you know of any bright twentysomethings, let me know because
we're looking for more authors for our politics section.

Thanks,
Kevin Bertram

Making materials by welding together bazillions of microscopic pieces is
called 'sintering' and has been done for at least 200 years.  You can sinter
metals or ceramics.  Needless to say, it is not done by bacteria with
oxyacetylene torches.  You take a powder, you put it in a mold, heat it,
compress it, all the grains weld together, cool down, knock it out of the
mold, and you're done.  Keeping the powder from melting entirely is the
tricky part; you need good control of temperature and composition.

The only difference between a dead species and the most advanced species to
exist on earth is the ability to create art!  This is very significant!  Take
a look around you for a minute, look at all this technology we have, do we
need it? No, we could have made our lives much simpler by staying in the

and interest us - we are artists.

There's a Neal Stephenson's short story, "Jipi and the Paranoid Chip"
in the 970707 Forbes magazine: 

Jipi goes to work for Mindshare Management as an online Guest Comfort
Facilitator at the Manila Hotel. Her boss Mr.Cardoza tells her, "It's
a vast field of opportunity ... A young woman with a nice personality
need never be out of work."

So, Jipi gets promoted to working with renegade paranoid schizophrenic
car-alarm systems that have been evolved by Lamarck Logic, carrying on
a fascinating dialog with one such device, trying to convince it that
she's neither a spoofer or lurker and that its goal in 'life' is to
learn to 'do the right thing' on its own.

Stephenson masterfully turns this into a sort-of reverse Turing test
as Jipi tries to convince the machine that "the conditions under which
your ancestors were punished and rewarded no longer exist." The
machine ponders: "Then it would follow that for me to exceed the
performance of my ancestors I would have to cease participation in the
reward/punishment structure."  Bzzt - wrong answer!

Forgive me for being controversial, but:

Johnny, a stereotypical seven-year-old American boy, is talking to his mother
in the kitchen, while she bakes an apple pie.

"Mommy, what was the cold war?" Asks Johnny.
"A war against Russia" His mother replies.
"Why do we hate Russians?" 
"Well they're our friends now, but they were our enemies"
"So it's alright to kill your enemies, but wrong to kill your friends?"
"Don't be silly Johnny, It's wrong to kill anyone"
"But don't we kill people in wars?"
"Yes, but that happens in other countries"
"So it's alright to kill people in other countries if they do bad things?"
"That's right dear, now why don't you go and finish building your model of
Hiroshima"

So Johnny returns to melting action figures in his sandpit.

Johnny has learnt some valuable lessons that will stay with him for the rest
of his life - territorialism, xenophobia and the need for excessive force.
 These lessons came in especially handy when Johnny joined a local white
supremacy group at the age of nineteen.

--Contradiction & Censorship

It's these kinds of contradictions, inconsistencies in people's beliefs that
lead to the bad memes responsible for a declining society.  Whereas some
people blame the lack of censorship for the rise in behaviour deemed
anti-social, I believe (probably along with many list members) that it is
censorship that is the very cause of many of the problems in society.
 Censorship causes contradictions in beliefs, these contradictions weaken the
mental immune system and live it wide open to bad, sometimes disastrous,
ideas.

The three main victims of censorship in popular media are violence, sex, and
swearing.  There are many other forms of censorship, but these three are the
cause of much controversy.

Sex & Nudity - Censored because seeing to much sex and nudity will apparently
turn our children into sex crazed maniacs.  The censors have lots of evidence
of the effects of sex and nudity on Children, sex crimes are increasing
yearly and so is the amount of sex on television.  No, actually that's wrong,
sex crimes increase as censorship increases.  It doesn't take much to
understand this, just some simple psychology:

Sex is dirty, disgusting and sinful, so we're lead to believe.  Then, of
course, we find it to be pleasurable (to put it mildly).  It doesn't take a
wild stretch of the imagination to think.  "If sex is dirty, disgusting and
sinful, but gives me pleasure, maybe other dirty, disgusting, sinful things
we give me pleasure too" and just like that a serial killer is born (or a
rapist, or fetishist, etc).

Nudity, of course, is also disgusting and so you should cover up.  While
you're at it, why not become so embarrassed by your own body that you're
afraid to go to the doctors to get much needed treatment.  I don't think I
even need to touch on the psychology of being embarrassed by your body (or
for that matter bodily functions - ever wondered why we have the most
primitive ass-wiping system possible, research into toilets just isn't the
done thing).

Swearing - Fuck, now I'm not quite sure why swearing is censored.  If anyone
knows why we see fit to 'protect' children from words, I'd appreciate it if
they would enlighten me.  I'm not sure of the psychological effects of
certain words being deemed 'dirty', but I do know that some people on the
internet get off on swearing at each other, so the damage is there.

Violence - If you watch too much violence, you'll turn into a violent person.
 I have to admit that after watching the latest Steven Segal action movie I
get the urge to run him over with my car, but I don't think it's for the
right reasons.  This, of course, is also wrong.  We are all already violent
and denial isn't going to change that, it's built into our genes, if it
wasn't we would have died off long ago.  It's important to learn when
violence is necessary and when it is not.  It's also important to take a
stance on violence, don't make contradictions like those of little Johnny's
mother (and the moral of this story is)

The source of most censorship is probably related to the Christian religion,
but I haven't got room to talk about the problems caused by the Christian
meme, so I'll save it for another post.

I'd like to hear people's ideas on how we can solve the problems of
censorship and any other bad memes we should be fighting against.

I agree, when I talk of anarchy in any situation I do not mean some wild
revolution to destroy hierarchy and free individuals.  I'm talking of a
gradual evolution.  We may not have to anything to get to an anarchic system,
the evolution has begun and it doesn't look like it's going to stop...

Now imagine everyone was an individual manufacturer (of a product or
service).  You choose what to make or do, when someone else wants a service
or product they come to you.  You choose the price and product, then you put
it on the market.  If your product doesn't sell you're going to change it,
you're going to lower the price or manufacture something completely
different.  The whole system works as it does now, except we have done away
with the hierarchical structure of business.

Let's say you choose to design and build aircraft.  Obviously you alone
cannot do all the work, so you decide to find like-minded individuals.  What
forms is not a company (as we know it), but a group of individuals working
towards goal.  The agreements between each member of the group can be
different.  You can work for money (a value you set), you can work in
exchange for other goods, you can work out of the kindness of your heart or
you can work because I have a gun pointed at your head (community service).

The market of the future will be very different.  As the market would be
constantly changing we would require computer agents to shop around for us;
it's likely that brand names and marketing will not have the importance they
have today.

How about a world were school is a place you go to voluntarily?  With the
marking scheme I've outlined below education could be done at home (or
anywhere else).  Schools would become a place where you go to socialize and
use special equipment (the school and library systems could merge into a
community education center).  You can leave at anytime, you can gain
qualifications at anytime and you can return for further education at
anytime.

Or have you learnt the need for structure?

The entire purpose of anarchy is to allow you to take your own approach to
what ever it is you want to do.

When a student decides to study, it would usually be done through an
interactive program running on a computer.  Because the program isn't
passive, it can ask questions and test the student.  Just by simply
interacting with the computer, the student is awarded certificates; the
students need never know they are being tested.  This would also mean that
students can work at their own pace, a smart student could be a doctor by the
end of the day just by reading up on medicine and interacting with some
medical simulations.  These certificate systems need not just be installed in
schools, imagine if all the information you read in books could go towards a
qualification, as you read!

I plan to send a more detailed post about how this will all work in the
future.

No, the official line is still the balloon. They only mentioned the
dummies when the saucer freaks said 'Nah, nah, what about the bodies
then?'. Of course it was hugely counter-productive because the dummies
weren't dropped until the fifties; the Air Force folks were taking the
perfectly sensible step of thinking that perhaps people had seen the
dummies in the fifties but were confused about the date, given that, after
all, these tales are nearly fifty years old. They clearly don't understand
the believers' mindset... 

Which also goes to support my point about the Air Force being far too
inept to cover up aliens for fifty years. An Air Force which could do that
would at least lie and claim that it dropped the dummies in the forties,
or just make up another explanation and fake documentation for it.

     Guru George responded:
     
     He goes into this question in the book.  Again, I can't
     remember the details, I'm sorry - it's a while since I read the book.
     
     Rick elaborates:
     
     McKenna is out there but after reading him, hearing him and observing 
     him, he's definitely onto something.  That being that our pre-human 
     ancestors came down from the trees, likely for environmental reasons, 
     into the savannahs where the plains roaming herd were depositing their 
     faces all over the place.  The tropical variety of psychedlelic 
     mushroom is very brightly colored (red cap with white spots---Alice 
     was quite taken with them).
     
     In low consumption, senses are heightened, visual accuity increases 
     and you can hear and taste everything much more profoundly (personal 
     experience attests to this).  These doses would've increased the early 
     hominid's hunting success since even night vision is increased.  A 
     little higher dose and your libido is ready to rock and roll, 
     increasing the possibility for conception for the otherwise 
     survival-centric apes.  The wacky-tabacky dose (5 grams I understand) 
     puts you into shamanic realms where you have the opportunity to 
     connect with the other (the overtly pragmatic reader requiring 
     empirical evidence may substitute "other" for unique 
     chemically-induced hallucination).
     
     McKenna makes a few quite notable suggestions:  that psylocibin was an 
     evolutionary agent in hominid advancement.  He also promotes a 
     measurable wave in novelty occurring for our species that is fast 
     approaching it's apex.  He is like a cross between Leary and Huxley, 
     very glib, very well read, very eccentric and hangin' very chummy with 
     some of the big boys like Rupert Sheldrake (whose theories on 
     morphogenic fields are quite intriguing as well).  I dropped 
     Sheldrake's name just in case a few of you were going into

I concur fully with John K Clark. I _do_ consider filtering rude, but 
obviously it is a necessary evil. This just as a constructive feedback.

Actually, the meteor theory has been getting a lot more attention
lately. Thousands of meteors enter Earth's atmosphere every day,
and there are thousands of commercial flights every day. An intersection
was bound to happen sooner or later.

(Note: don't fret about the dangers to commercial flight from meteors.
Just tote up all the commercial flights that ever flew, before TWA 800,
and none of which (apparently) were ever struck by meteors. Now take
the reciprocal of that number. That's your approximate chance of being
hit by a meteor on your next commercial flight... so relax.)

Just an alternative possibility that has yet to be ruled out.

Yep, the Word viruses are endemic in some of our foreign offices; seems
like every Word file they send has at least one of them. I also read
recently (comp.risks, perhaps?) about a Javascript virus or trojan which
someone had been mailing out. Of course the latter doesn't affect me,
since I know the difference between a Web browser and an email program. 

Then there was the MS-specific virus a few months ago which, when
activated, would mail a copy of itself to every person in your email
addressbook. I think that was another Word macro. 

So email used to be safe when it was straight ASCII, but recent attempts
to 'jazz it up' have greatly increased your chances of getting a virus by
email. I'm sticking to Pine and Privtool.

Possibly 'company' was a bad word for use in what I am trying to describe.
 The anarchic system would mean all people are individuals, they do not work
for a company or government.  Each individual offers goods and services on
the market; whether these individuals form into groups or operate under a
company name is irrelevant.  Companies can be described as a group of
individuals each working towards the same goal, they don't have to know each
other, they don't even have to have contracts between them.  They can even be
in competition, but still working towards progress in the same area.
 Management decision is limited, because the market decides who does what.
 For instance, if I produce X amount of a product, but cannot seal that
amount I will reduce X and put my resources into other area's.  There is no
consensus between groups of individuals as they work alone (unless they
decide on consensus).  Therefore each person only manages him or herself,
surely this is faster than hierarchical management?

Obviously taking figures out of chaos is hard, but I would think production
and company management would improve dramatically - If we have the
communications infrastructure to handle such a system.

I don't see this as the most democratic system, or the fairest system.  I see
this as the system that will build a competitive and productive environment
that will increase progress.

     Recently there have been some subjects that have popped up of 
     questionable, genuine scientific value (Roswell, pole shifting, and 
     maybe psychedelic-driven evolution).  It's intriguing to see the 
     rather intense reactions from the more academic members who wish not 
     to have the sanctity of their digest polluted with unproven or highly 
     improbable subjects.
     
     What's fascinating is the *effect* these discussions have.  One 
     reader, upon visiting the pole shift web sites declared "Aw shit!" (as 
     if he was already committed to his cryonics agreement but fat lot of 
     good it was gonna do him now because a world calamity is due by 
     century's end),  While the mental tug of war about the physics versus 
     the circumstancial evidence plays out, some go into flame mode at 
     having to be subjected to drivel, others wax mildly concerned about 
     the possibility of such a thing occurring.
     
     There is pre-millenial fever brewing in us all but isn't the current 
     time frame our own invention?  2000 means something because somewhere 
     way back when, we decided it did.  Does 2000 mean anything to the 
     Orthodox Jew or the Chinese?  Or maybe it's because 2000 is the mark 
     of a dominant world culture that makes it more special.
     
     Sure, it'd be nice for something a little novel to occur.  I was in 
     tears watching Contact just because it connected with the childhood 
     pain I felt of not belonging on this pretty fucked-up planet, 
     beautiful and pristine as it can be at times.
     
     Hypothetically, if the evidence started pouring in, the pole shift is 
     a definite, I wonder what actions the devoted Extropian might pursue 
     in increasing the assurance that s/he won't be crushed, drowned, 
     incinerated etc.. Entertain this notion if you will, suppose you have 
     a little less than 3 years before it's "the end of the world as we 
     know it".  What's your plan of action?
     
     Hypothetically, all the scientific lack of substantiation aside, what 
     if aliens crashed in New Mexico 50 years ago and the government knows 
     about it.  How does that alter your perception?
     
     If psychedelics open up a conduit in your chemical makeup to receive 
     information from another dimension (yes, I'm introducing this concept 
     that has heretofore not been mentioned), what of that?  
     
     So much thrashing about on the details, the facts, the proof or lack 
     thereof.  You may ask, do I *believe* in Roswell?  When I was younger 
     I liked the idea.  The details are so pureed though, who could tell 
     and who has TIME to dig that deep when ultimately you have to make a 
     decision on faith (or as one reader said about pole shifting "belief 
     bias").
     
     It's a security-based phenomenon to focus one's attention on empirical 
     proof so one doesn't have to deal with the emotions of what to make of 
     the unknowns.  You can keep it all left-brained and quite tidy.  If 
     that doesn't work, you can make some intelligible static as you look 
     down your nose at the quaint naive ones who have dashed the other way 
     like Chicken Little running around in hysteria that the sky is going 
     to fall (or the pole is going to shift <G>).  
     
     These tabloid-worthy stories are myths but I don't regard them as such 
     to dismiss them.  Myths are valuable.  Their archetypal impact brings 
     out a wide range of emotion and it's quite interesting to observe that 
     in others and in ourselves.  
     
     I'm certainly not advocating that the scientifically-minded spend 
     overt amounts of time mollycoddling the more impulsive members of this 
     digest.  I am suggesting that when someone brings up something that 
     occurs for you like a matador's cape to a bull, you might want to 
     drill down into what's triggering the response of judging, controlling 
     and flaming.  
     
     Personally, I like the fact that this digest covers the map from the 
     viability of food replicators to ancient evidence of Atlantis BEING 
     Antarctica (that's where that thread could possibly go..).  It's 
     entertainment and as memes go, it's a nice distraction, sometimes a 
     thought-provoking one.  And of course, it doesn't take much reading 
     between the lines to see that my red flag is control-meisters who want 
     to get the Animaniacs out of the studio lot (sorry, I have to plug 
     those guys at least once).

Subject: HUMOR:  Judith the (frozen) COBAL programmer.
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Judith, the COBOL Programer:   
   
Judith was a COBOL programmer in the late 1990s.  After years of deplorable
treatment as a technological dinosaur by UNIX programmers, Judith was finally
getting some respect.  She became a consultant specializing in year 2000
date-compliant conversions.  She worked short-term assignments for
prestigious companies and traveled all over the world.  While she had to work
70, 80 and even 90 hours a week, it was worth it because she made a lot of
money.   
   
Nevertheless, several years of this relentless, mind-numbing work took its
toll on Judith.  She couldn't sleep and began having nightmares about the
year 2000.  It reached a point where she became violently ill at the mere
thought of the year 2000.  She had to do something or suffer a nervous
breakdown.  All she could think about was avoiding the year 2000 and the
turmoil coming with it.    
   
So, Judith contacted a company specializing in cryonics.  She made a deal to
have herself frozen until March 15, 2000.  By that time all the year 2000 New
Years Eve parties and computer debacles would be over.  Cryonics seemed like
the only solution.  Judith was thrilled.  There would be no year 2000 to
worry about and then she could get on with her life.   
   
She was put into a cryonics receptacle.  The technicians set the automatic
re-animation date.  Injections of drugs slowed her heartbeat, she was frozen
and that was that.   Time passed.  
   
Judith opened her eyes and was blinded by the bright white light.  She was in
the middle of an enormous outdoors auditorium.  Excited people filled the
bleachers surrounding her. They were all chanting "She's alive!  She's
alive!"      
   
There were cameras unlike she'd ever seen before and equipment looking like
it came out of a science fiction movie.  Judith couldn't contain her
enthusiasm, "Is it over?  Has the year 2000 come?  Are the millennia parties
and crisis over and done with?"    
   
A man who looked like the senior scientist stepped forward.  "I'm so sorry,"
he said.  "There was a problem with your cryonics re-animation timer.  It's
wasn't year-2000 compliant.  You've been in suspension for almost 8000
years."     
   
"Oh no!  This is not the year 2000?!" she shouted.   
   
"Please, calm down.  There is someone here who wants to talk with you."   
  
Suddenly a wall-sized projection screen displayed the image of a man looking
very much like Bill Gates.  "I'm Bill, the Chief Executive Officer of Earth.
 There's no need to be upset.  This is a wonderful time to be alive.  There
is world peace, everyone is rich and there is no need for governments or
taxes.  The space program is self-funding from asteroid farming and there are
colonies orbiting the Moon, Mars and in several nearby star systems.
Technology has advanced to such a degree that everyone can travel by virtual
reality and can contact anyone on or off the planet.  We participate in any
entertainment whenever we want."   
   
Calming down Judith said, "That sounds terrific."  She was relieved and
excited to restart her new life.   Still, being revived in an auditorium
setting seemed wrong to her.  "Bill . . . I'm curious, why are all these
people so interested in me?"   
   
"Well," he said, ". . . the year 10,000 is just around the corner and it says
in your file you know COBOL."

 Hi,

That is pole shift!  Except the continent moved in a day.  Actually the trees
from  antarctica are recent(i cant remember when exactly). They are recent
enough that they can still be burnt, caught on fire.  Also, pole shift theory
states that all the plates slide over the magma at once, so it doesnt have
anything to do with continental drift.

Well said!  After all, are not extropians supposed to be rational.  
Saying something is pseudoscience, drivel or trash without rational 
inquiry is simply not rational.  For those on the list whose belief 
systems forbid inquiry outside of fundamentalist materialism should 
either not respond to such posts, or start using their e-mail filtering 
programs.  No ones asking you to participate in such discussion.  I am 
sure to those of you I'm referring to know who you are.

I like the diversity of topics on this list as well.  But what I like 
most, is that most people who participate on this list are of high 
intelligence and good sport when it comes to debate.  We may be inching 
are way to post-humanism, but sometimes our emotions can still get the 
best of us.

SCENARIO: With increasing automation and corporate downsizing, good 
paying jobs will become less and less available.  Jobs will either be 
those of highly skilled/creative varieties or very low-skill.  Now I 
would assume most people on this list are either already very 
skilled/creative or our doing everything they can to get there.  
Unfortunately the nanotechnological revolution has not occurred yet, so 
unless you have a job, your basic necessities of shelter & food will be 
hard to come by.  The clever among us, will figure out how to survive 
off the land or gain access to using high-intensity hydroponic equipment 
before they are downsized out of a job...

Do you feel this is a likely scenario? If so, I would like to hear how 
you would deal with this situation.   How would you survive?  And if 
your humanitarian enough, what would you propose to ensure the survival 
of the rest of humanity in the face of it?

Cheers,

Bobby Whalen  

P.S. Now personally, I look forward to the day when all menial 
uncreative work is automated <as long as I'm benefiting> from this 
high-efficiency society.  It would be even better if everyone benefited.  
Me, I would rather be scuba diving in the bahamas than working the grind 
every day!

Well, what about our culture since the Sixties, for a (not very
rigorous!) kick off?  For example, I remember reading somewhere that the
guy who thought up the idea of shareware (or was the first to put the
idea into action?) got the idea while tripping!  Most computer nerds are
at least stoners, are they not?  I bet you Gates and Jobs had a spliff
or two in their day.

Come to think of it, culture since the Sixties has been a veritable hot
house of memes!  Another possible (and quite amusing) example: hands up
any libertarians here who read Rand while stoned or tripping during the
Sixties and really 'got it' (I mean really got what she had to offer
that was good, without being sucked into her, as a recent ng correspondent
of mine called it, 'glassy-eyed idealism')? There must have been a lot of
those!

That's a shame.  Still, I think his ideas will probably have a life of
their own, and lead on to other, better ones.  Another point I forgot to
mention, which was the main reason I read Food of the Gods at the time,
was how his theory ties in so neatly with Riane Eisler's (Chalice and
the Blade), about how early human civilisations (round about early
Jericho, Mohenjo Daro, etc.) were kind of 'nice', with equality between
the sexes and stuff, but unfortunately got invaded by several successive
waves of hard bastards from tougher climes, who introduced all the
unfortunate trappings of what she calls 'dominator' culture - IOW
'patriarchy', heirarchy, etc.

That's another theory which, in its raw state is probably too neat to be
true (I've read some interesting criticisms of Eisler/Gimbutas by
Marxist feminist critics), but has a certain degree of plausibility.

Corporate downsizing is not much of a data point, because it tends
to be balanced by growth in smaller businesses, though this is much
less remarked upon in the media simply because the growth in smaller
businesses is less obviously visible. But downsizing is usually
coupled with outsourcing (more business for the smaller
businesses) and hiring of contractors (more business for people
like me).

What most of the high-paying jobs have in common is that the worker
is producing valuable information: a film, a legal brief, a song,
a computer program, an accounting analysis, experimental results,
a summary of research in some field, etc. There are an awful lot
of growth niches here that are not going to be automated any time
soon, and I think that perhaps our biggest problem is educational
systems that assume that most people are not fit for such jobs. I
suspect that the educational institutions in most countries of the
world need to be shaken up rather severely... I'd like to see a
lot more experimentation and a lot less regimentation going on in
the education industry than currently seems to be the case.

Not really true.  Bones of Neanderthal children show sign of heavy use (as
compared to Cro-Magnon), as I understand, so at least children were treated
differently.  There were certainly physiological differences (shoulder
strength, larynx shape).  There *could* have been significant psychological
or cultural differences as well.  We wouldn't know; those things don't
fossilize well.

Neanderthals might not have made art by inclination, or they might have
lacked the free time and security to do art.  Alternatively, perhaps art only
develops in fairly large societies (humans go to great length to communicate,
even over great distance) and Neanderthals didn't do that.  It's even
possible that Neanderthals did art and we just haven't found any yet.  

It's very fortunate that we have been able to deduce the genetic connection
between Neanderthals and ourselves but a real pity that there aren't any
left.  It would be very useful to observe them or even talk to them.

Incidentally, I consider the original discovery that started this thread to
be an incredible achievement.  From a few bones, tens of thousand of years
old, we are able to deduce behavior in populations nearly a million years
ago.  Wow.  Who needs magic?

I agree absolutely, and I think a major problem is that we teach people
what to think rather than how to think.

I thought I'd post this question for those even more scientifically
abled than I to explain:

How can a little kid (or an adult for that matter) sit on a perfectly
still playground swing, begin rocking back and forth, and within a
minute be wizzing back and forth to a pretty good height, without ever
touching the ground or other still grounded object?

Anyone who can supply their own answers, with equations if possible, is
welcome to reply...

Well, if they can't seem to keep their environmental systems operating
for more than a few weeks at a time, they must be socialist. If their
automated systems are too stupid to be able to dock without rupturing a
space station, they must be socialist (this past months Mir saga is not
the first. When we did the Apollo/Soyuz mission in the 70's, the US
carried up the docking ring and did all of the docking maneuvering, even
though we were more heavily loaded.)

I really liked what Wax had to say. In an anarchy, all possibilities are
allowed. I don't know why you are fixated on the idea that companies
must all be owned by all of their employees. If they go into the job
investing existing assets, then great, but the idea of giving one
ownership for free when they start a job is dumb, not to mention
economical unfeasible (people seem to wonder why the privatization of
many companies in Russia has failed so badly).

Employees should also have the right, as many currently do in this
country, to invest whatever level they wish in the company, even $0. If
they can make a better profit investing elsewhere, its their money. I'm
really tired of people who think that people need to be protected from
themselves. Stupidity is the last Darwinian influence on our society,
lets not give that up, lest we begin to deevolve....

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians:

It would appear that not everyone is familar with Employees Stock
Ownership Plans (ESOPS) or methods that have recently been developed of
creating an environment that encourages cross cultural integration and
cooperation. 

Hierarchys in many organizations are being flattened and are rapidly
becoming obsolescent. This is primarily due to the changes in the economic
environment and the need to compete more effectively. 

Middle managers in many organizations are being re-educated and are being
converted into team leaders. Ultimately, such teams become virtual teams
as knowledge, skills and abilities are interchanged and consoladated.
Leadership at that point ceases to be an issue. 

Obviously, there are more than a few egocentric dinosaurs that are being
phased out in this evolving environment. Far greater emphasis is placed on
self-reliance and self-actualization is encouraged as a productivity
enhancing asset. 
  
Since it is a change of order and a shift in and sharing of power I don't
think anyone who has studied management has considered the concept of
Anarchy as a philosophical basis for change. It might seem a bit to
abstract, unrealistic and ideologically fixated to provide much practical
value for the majority of post-industrial leaders.

I suspect that there are those who wish to express alternative proposals
and opinions. The question will remain, however, as to the ease of
implimentation.

Enjoy!!!

Antarctica reached the poles at least several tens of millions of years
ago. Its rather dumb to assert that the presence of fossils proves that
animals once lived at the poles, as they are most likely older than when
the continent drifted that far south. THis is just like the dumb
assertion of creationists who claim that the fact that there are
shellfish fossils on Mount Ararat, this proves that the legend of Noah's
Ark is true, as this shows that Mount Ararat was once under water.

THis is always a great way to point out the contradictions in their
idiotic theories. If they use this fossil evidence as fact, then the
earth could not have been built in 4004 BC like they claim. They claim
that older fossil evidence was created by God as a test of faith.... If
so, then since the Ararat fossils are dated older than 4004 BC, then
Ararat was never under water....

The Poles were pretty much ice free somewhere around 6000 BC according
to treee ring data. There were Alligators and hippos in the Thames at
that time.

Has anyone studied what the earth/moon system will do when disturbed by,
say, a large meteor strike. Our own magnetic field and poles are
generated by the rotational differential between the mantle and the
core, caused by the tidal drag produced by the moon on the outer layers
being greater than that at the core. If the moon is highly perturbed by
another body, or disturbed by an impact, its whole orbital plane will
change, which would then change the tidal drag vector it imposes on
earth. If the earth is hit a glancing blow, it should be enough to put
an even greater wobble in its attitude than that at present, or negate
some of the present amount. These phenomenon might possibly be
sufficient to cause the gyroscopic movement of our planetary dynamo to
"tumble" as it were. Even then, it still wouldn't happen overnight.

When these nuts talk about pole shift, it is the magnetic poles, not the
rotational exis that they speak of. We know from astronomical evidence,
and our own planet, that these two types of poles are not one and the
same. As you can see by the scenarios above, it may take a much smaller
astronomical event to cause a pole shift, if it occurs in just the right
way.

People say that 25% accuracy is a crappy result. BS. Considering that
infantry shoots an average of 9000 rounds to kill one enemy soldier,
artillery tosses an average of 50 rounds to nail one tank, etc....a
25-50% success rate is highly surgical by military standards.

I'd like to find out more on this radar. This is the first I've heard of
it. I'd also like to see the cost projections. There is more to combat
than whose got a better plane, but whose got a better, cheaper plane. A
study was done by Northrup showing that 2.5 F-5s could outfly an F-15,
and since 2.5 F-5's were somehting like 60% of the cost of an F-15, they
reasoned that the F-5 was a better buy. THis is why so many developing
nations bought F-5s in the 70s and 80s.

Eastern NM was quite flat, but central and northern NM is quite hilly
and mountainous, far in excess of Britain or Germany. Additionally, the
high quantities of private guns was another concern. Many farmers hate
the Ardvaaark because it scares the shit out of their cows and dumps
fuel on their pastures, which poisons the cows, so they tend to shoot at
the F-111 rather frequently. Repairing bullet holes in the belly of the
F-111 was one of the more frequent jobs that the sheetmetal boys had at
Cannon.

What seems like easy rolling hills at higways speeds is really rough
terrain at 450 knots. Also, don't forget that NM terrain is on an
entirely different scale than England. That hill you think is a quarter
mile aways is actually a mountain a couple miles away.

True, thats why the EF-111 was developed. Its great as a mission escort.

I haven't played that game, so I'm not sure if its sophisticated enough

I've never worked on a biplane, but I do know that business jets take a
good multiple of the maintenance time of small props planes. Rebuilding
a turbine engine is a lot tougher than a piston engine.

You can sheild a large part of it, but you are going to preserve the
areas of greatest sheilding for your crew, and with a mid course
turnaround, you've gotta have two sheilds, unless you can unhitch from
it and turn around and rehitch to the sheild at midcourse.

You've also got to deal with the fact that your landing vehicles will be
stored out of their operating environment for several years. Unless you
set up a phased inspection dock in orbit to rebuild the lander before
entering atmosphere, you could have serous problems. For starters, all
gaskets, seals, tires and lamps will probably need replacement. All
systems will need full checkout, inspection, as well as xray inspection
for structural integrity. THis sounds difficult, but its not really,
with the one exception that you get no test flights....

I wouldn't go on a manned mission if it didn't utilize a goodly amount
of relativistic time dilation to shorten trip time for the crew.
Logistics are always the biggest ticket item on such a project, and the
longer your stretch it out the more you spend in magnitudes.

Well, it has some failure on it almost every mission. If the missions
weren't so short to begin with, such failures would be a serious
problem, witness the Mir.

Once they brought it back due to a broken toilet. ANother time, they
overlooked the question  of how the monkeys they had brought up were
going to defacate cleanly. They wound up with monkey shit all over the
shuttle decks.

The point is that things break more often than not with the shuttle,
even though it was custom built and is basically rebuilt after every
mission, and it only flies one week missions.

Specs are usually right on the money when they are developed, based on
the latest military theory (which may or may not be true, i.e. AA
missiles making cannon and dogfights obsolete). What happens is threats
change, so specs become obsolete.

A "normal" Lockheed technician is still much more highly trained than
the average service joe, and you are right, morale and motivation have a
lot to do with it, which brings up another possible cause of mission
failure on an interstellar flight: depression. From space station
experience we know that astronauts are at high risk for depression, and
those are mere 50-180 day missions. Imagine being cooped up in a can
with a couple other people for 5-10 years. What sort of slump in
maintenance do you think will occur?

The end of flight orbital insertion will then require a full phased
inspection and rebuild for the lander. THis is the point where slipups
are going to occur.

Even though they finally dug up a minor classified program that they
were able to use to fit the facts that they previously admitted to, the
facts that they have also admitted to destroying all of the paperwork to
do with the incident, and that they don't know who destroyed it, even
though regs for recording of such records destruction were in place at
the time, and the fact that they had to come up with TWO stories to fit
ALL of the public claims about the story merely raise a flag with me. As
I said prevously, I still think that Roswell is in all likelyhood what
it is and is being used by gov't disinformation agencies to develop
misdirection toward their true classified programs. I am not a UFO nut.
I am into researching black programs and bringing them to light, as I
feel that an open society like ours should not have any programs that
the citizenry does not know about. ROswell has come into my radar scope
merely because of all of the interesting inconsistencies that would
raise flags in the mind of an investigator that had not already
prejudicially come to a conclusion about the case.

This would be the easiest thing to prove. If you had been temporally
displaced a number of years, and your dissapearance had been documented,
then you would be living proof that such an event occured.

however, the soldier was not displaced for years, just that he claimed
that what felt like a few minutes inside was actually several hours

Lets see, Kess had the mind of an alien warlord uploaded to her mind,
then you have the Borg, and there was an episode from the original show
that used a similar device...

Then you have movies like Johnny Mnemonic and Lawnmower Man and TV shows
like Tek War and VR5, etc..

Ever hear that a proper weld is stronger than the material being welded?
imagine the whole sheet being nothing but microscopic welds. Perhaps
such a culture has not been able to develop nanotech to the atomic level
that some people here dream about. Maybe they had but it is not
economical and this technique is a good cost effective compromise.

Gee, only DOD records, White House pictures, Pentagon phone books, the

SOmething as mundane as the SR-71 was kept secret for ten years, as was
the F-117. Lets imagine that our government concluded from the wreckage
that the alleged aliens were from a socialist planet. What do you think
they would have done? THis was the McCarthy era, mind you. Mere actors
were being blacklisted for life just because they refused to lie about
their freinds to congress. The last thing they needed during the entire
cold war, and even today, is for the population at large to know that
there is a superior culture on another planet that they think is
socialist.

I see nothing inconsistent about it. As a matter of fact, the new
government story proves that they CAN keep a secret for 50 years. They
did not declassify the Mogul project until recently, did they not? and
that, in respect to the greatest event in human history, is a mere
unmentionable footnote. So they can keep a secret for 50 years....

Marcel said at the followup press conference where the "evidence" was
presented that this was the "true" wreckage. He later recanted this
according to what I've read.

The testimony of Brazel and his family. The earlier testimony you posted
was from an interview he gave to the local paper after he had been
detained for two days by the feds. He has said that they worked him over
mentally pretty badly, making all sorts of threats if he opened his
mouth at the time...

The purple flower tape was not shown in the photo, nor has it been

The official cut off date for guaranteed low ($89) room rates for the
conference hotel has passed. However, I've managed to get the deadline
extended. The hotel had also rented out all the rooms in our reserved
block. I was able today to get ten rooms per night added to our block.
These should be available in their system from tomorrow morning.

If you haven't booked a room yet, I'd recommend doing so in the next couple
of days.

Several people are looking to share rooms. If you want to share, you can
post a message here, or phone me and I'll connect people.

This may be stretching it, but I saw a show on the Discovery channel of
all places where they had an english anthropologist who thinks that
there are still neanderthals living in distant parts of Mongolia. Anyone
ever hear if she failed to find anything or even went there? I imagine
that the story that came out of Mongolia was like the primitives in the
Phillipines that Marcos fabricated.

I would really like to see the recovery of a Neanderthal out of a bog.
Havng a nice pickled specimin would do wonders.

That was me, and I sure as shit didn't mean `aw shit, there goes my

Ahem.  

No, really, there's a difference between stupid pseudo-ideas and daring
imaginative brain-storming.  Which is why the core postings on this list
are fascinating and fun instead of infuriating and time-wasting.

I'm reeling from the stunned realization that I have read a post 
written by Lee and find nothing in it to disagree with!  (I checked, 
but gravity still applies to domestic swine and members of the bovine 
family.

My one small addition is that the temporary or permanent nature of a 
biological change should not be read as an indication of the seriousness 
of that decision for the person involved.  The very notion of choice, 
of making an active decision about one's own biology or sex role, 
challenges the base power structures of human society.  Taking on those 
encoded norms by refusing to stay in one gender, however it is done--
through semipermanent hormones, permanent surgery, or temporary 
cosmetic alteration--carries the same societal consequences for the 
individual.  The medical profession carries a vested interest in 
preserving the binary sex system and, therefore, in its role as 
gatekeeper will try to weed out those who would practice some 
flexibility.

Check out www.nepenthes.com/Misc/nerdvalley.html this is an article from
July '91 from GQ of all places which basically states that without
psychedlics the computer industry would be no where near what it is today...
it mentions Jobs, as well as the founder of Lotus and the developer of the
good ol' altair (also founder of PC Magazine according to the article) I
myself am going camping this weekend and plan on enjoying some fine San
Pedro tea... but I'm nobody so that doesn't really back up the argument...
so when we've reached our post human state I suppose us psychedlic users
will have an acid program... kind of like an internal screen saver... hmm

The tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy - is not so dangerous to the
public welfare - as the apathy of a citizen in a democracy!

The success of a nation should be measured not by the number of its
millionaires, but by the absence of poverty!

The lunatics of today usually become the visionaries of tomorrow!

Body movements can alter one's center of gravity significantly.  Just
as a high jumper can clear a bar without ever having his center of
gravity above it, the child on the swing can move his legs in or out,
and bend at the waist, to move his center of gravity just a touch
higher on each swing than the height attributable to the energy of
the previous reciprocal swing.  On the downstroke, he repositions his
body again to prepare for the maneuver on the other side, which uses
the energy of his muscles without depleting any of the gravitational
potential energy he has gained.  The amount of extra energy put into
the system from his own muscles is enough to escalate each swing.

By "random" you seem to mean "diverse," sort of.  Surely the ideas
and experiences we are exposed to are more systematic than pure noise.

Anyway, I'm not sure any systematic approaches are more reliable than,
"Expose kids to a choice of lots of random experiences."  I'm not sure
the Prussian-developed schools we have, or initiation rites either,
are improvements over randomness.

Compare:
"Free enterprise is random, let's have socialism."
"Evolution is too random-seeming, let's believe in God."
"Gas molecules are random--I'm afraid I'll run out of air!"
"God doesn't play dice, physics must be deterministic."
"Self-directed education is too random, let's guide people."
"Building things by moving masses of molecules is too random,
let's have nanotech."

I think I agree with somewhere between 1.0 and 2.0 of the above!
And I'm not sure I see the pattern.

Then there are hash codes and Ethernet delay algorithms...

"Large" or highly public topics like news, sports and politics have the
feature that lots of people (and therefore, probably people you might want
to talk to) have knowledge and opinions about them.  So that makes these
topics Schelling points for conversation topics.  Common ground, but of a
funny sort: you want to agree on the topic but disagree on the opinions
about it, to have a good argument.  And a good argument reinforces your
sense of the importance of the topic, too.

But the social vs. practical impact is a much clearer explanation of the
same thing.  Of course a high-social, low-practical topic will tend to
become popular, and popularity alone gives a topic social importance.
(And maybe the more cooks, the more spoiled the broth, so popular issues
are less likely to have practical decisions made on them?  Bonus!)

The social vs. practical comparison answers a question about politics:
Why so much hoopla about such a pointless process?  Because the pointlessness
makes it safe.  In fact it's in the interest of both voters and
representitives to make government good at producing annoyance (stuff
to get angry and argue about) and bad at changing things (practical).

Here's an example that this is happening:
An X-Files T-shirt, with the slogan, "I Want To Believe," is:
  o  an indicator that I'm an independent thinker interested in wacky
     ideas, and
  o  an indicator that I'm a skeptic with some scientific training, and
  o  an ironic meta-comment (maybe showing that people in general are
     becoming more aware) about the social function of belief, and
  o  a damn fine practical piece of clothing.

In short, a desert topping *and* a floor wax.  I rest my case.

(Later:)

The thing I noticed was that you put "maintain privacy"

Anyway, thanks for a fresh idea!

I thought I'd wait a little while until the expected replies to my post had 
drop on to the list before replying to them all at once.

Daniel Lee Crocker:

Your conditional clause mimics closely two caveats of my own, in my post:
"given ...the fact that many people asking for it [surgery] have other
psychological problems" and "many such people are not in a suitable mental
state to take such a decision". The medical role here is not to decide
whether or not an individual can take the decision to have surgery, but to
decide whether or not that individual is competent to take such a decision
in an informed, rational and considered way. So your argument in the above
paragraph does not differ from mine, except in one respect. Whilst you
simply introduce an introductory condition clause relating to the abilities
of the individual, I introduce the members of the medical profession as the
people best equipped to decide the applicability of that clause to an
individual. Would you allow the individual to decide mental competency? In
which case (a) you'd probably not get very many people deciding they were
not competent and (b) would you expect any doctor/surgeon simply to ask the
question, "Are you mentally OK?" and believe any answer they received
irrespective of any contraindications?

>Medicine is just a product
>like any other, and the doctor provides that product at my request and
>for my payment.

Except of course when your are in ER, comatose and bleeding to death, when
the product (service) is not at your explicit request. Or in a system such
as the UK has (although one could argue the same to a degree with an
insurance scheme) where it isn't your payment. That is, "Medicine is a
product like any other, except that I might not say I want it and other
people might pay for it."

>Well if I want
>green tile in my kitchen, I'm not going to listen to some builder
>telling me I'm not capable of that decision.  Why should I tolerate
>the same arrogance from a doctor or lawyer?

That argument ad absurdum is not a very apposite analogy. Suppose you
wanted to knock a door through a wall. You talk to a builder, who knows
about such things in far more depth than do you, and she tells you that it
would be wise to take the time to do a full survey of the house to find out
if the door would cause it to collapse or not; she herself, being able to
analyse the survey in ways you cannot, would interpret the results of the
survey to let you know the answer. But no! you can take this decision
yourself; you don't need her to take it for you; so you tell her to get on
with it, and your house falls down.

Besides, even mine is not a good analogy. Because in the subject about
which we are talking you are in effect asking people to assess their own
mental state. Is that viable? Or would you argue that, viable or not,
people should be allowed to take their own decisions; an argument which
effectively removes the conditional clause from your first paragraph.

Another thing worth noting is part of my orginal posting which you elided:
"Perhaps this [the role of the medical profession] [is] a moral issue which
will have to be faced in an individual basis for each possible modification
as the technology we so-often discuss becomes available..."

Nanotech would probably make all of this reversible, and one would then be
in a position where an individual could try out the physical change and
then reverse it if depression, suicidal-tendencies, psychosis, or whatever
started to make themselves apparent. (Still, one could ask, could the
individual spot those things in himself, or would he require monitoring
over a 'test' period?)


Kathryn Aegis:

>My one small addition is that the temporary or permanent nature of a 
>biological change should not be read as an indication of the seriousness 
>of that decision for the person involved.

My orginal post, of course, used the phrase "severity and irreversibility"
in recognition of this.

Although, the temporary or permanent nature of the change is a factor in
the seriousness of the decision. An obvious example is the difference
between, "Want to know what it is like to be dead?", and "Want to know what
it is like to be dead for a minute and then revived using this new, tried
and tested technology?" I can imagine the answers being different for some
people. There must be many more, everyday examples of the irreversability
of a decision changing its seriousness. One that springs to mind is, "I'm
don't think I'm happy in this relationship but if I leave her to find out
whether or not I'm then happier I know I'll never get her back." The
irreversability of the decision to leave effects its seriousness.

But, whatever, "severity and irreversability" was my original phrase.

>The very notion of choice, 
>of making an active decision about one's own biology or sex role, 
>challenges the base power structures of human society.

Indeed. As well as challenging its base morality, ethics, socio-economic
distinctions...

>Taking on those 
>encoded norms by refusing to stay in one gender, however it is done--
>through semipermanent hormones, permanent surgery, or temporary 
>cosmetic alteration--carries the same societal consequences for the

But not the same psychological consequences; nor, for each individuals,
will those societal or psychological consequences be the same. In fact, on
reflection, the three types of modification you mention do not even carry
the same societal consequences, since within societal interaction one has
to include intimate contact.

Further, you don't say what those societal consequences might be:
ostracization, loss of employment, public ridicule, etc. And these things
can have deep psychological effects: depression, suicidal tendencies, etc.
At the end of the day a major function of gender expression must be
internal happiness: if that is outweighed by the unhappiness caused by
society it seems reasonable that some people will choose to limit their
times and modes of non-'standard' gender expression to reach their optimal
state of happiness. Fine: unless the first time they realize their
depression, realize they are now more unhappy and wish to modify their
gender expression, is after they've had an instant, irreversible operation.

>The medical profession carries a vested interest in 
>preserving the binary sex system and, therefore, in its role as 
>gatekeeper will try to weed out those who would practice some

Well, in the case of the female to male change, doctors are quite prepared
to condone bi-lateral mastectomies and hormonal changes, without requiring
phalloplasty. Equally, breast implants are available to individuals who do
not intend to have vaginoplasty, etc.

Do you have a specific example in mind?



There seems to be the view that the medical profession are 'the enemy' in
this case. Why so? Doctors don't seem to be the enemy when it comes to
things like removing tumours, clearing up infections, setting broken limbs.
Yet, in all these cases there is an element of observation on the part of
the doctor: the biopsy, the swab and culture, the x-ray. Is it not possible
that the psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and surgeons involved in the
sex change process are there to help; to clarify intentions, point out
potential problems, act as shoulder to cry on, ensure hormones aren't
causing endocrinological damage, etc.

Yes, according to the WJW FAQ:

What does `mataglap' mean? Mataglap is an Indonesian word meaning
"dark eye" or, probably, "dilated eye." It is an indication that
someone is about to go berserk and start killing people at random. I
applied the word in Aristoi to a berserk form of nanotechnology that
devoured the planet.

Strange, I thought it was the name of a small village on the

A first step, but hardly any proof of his theory. 

Another thought: it is known (I can cite some articles) that caffeine
drinkers perform better at memory tests, reaction tests and similar
cognitive stuff (taking confounding variables into account), and
nicotine seems to have other cognition enhancing effects. It is not
unreasonable to think that the introduction of coffee, tea and
tobacco into the western culture accelerated its growth in areas
where this kind of effects are useful (like technology).

"Random" might have been a non-optimal word to describe what I meant.
You are of course right in that our experiences are not random
(otherwise we would not be able to learn anything; and if they were
completely ordered we would quickly learn the rules and never have to
learn after childhood); but most of the experiences we learn from
have not been planned as learning experiences, and might not even be
good learning experiences (making a simple mistake when driving can
be fatal).  Hence the interest in better ways of growth. A better
word may be "unplanned" experiences.

Schools may be good or bad in different respects (and not all of them
are Prussian either, although new forms of learning are needed) but
they certainly help us learn a lot of things that would be very
costly to learn on our own (like reading or writing or basic
physics). A good education can teach us things we would have needed
decades to learn on our own. The problem is that (by definition) they
are best at transmitting academic knowledge and not other important
aspects of human growth.

I don't see why it carries a vested interest in preserving the binary
sex system. In fact, it would probably gain money/prestige/influence
if body modifications became more common. 

I think a more likely explanation for the resistance is that the
medical profession is conservative, both scientifically (it has to
be, the treatments must be *very* carefully tested and validated
since failures can be deadly), socially (most influential doctors are
older and well-paid) and traditionally (it is after all one of the
few guilds left). 

Still, I think there will be a change. Many medical students do not
consider transhuman ideas unethical or too wild, just very hard to
implement (the problem of being an expert: the more you know about a
problem, the harder it seems until you solve it). In a few years they
will be parts of the medical profession, and while they will likely
become more conservative, the seeds are there.

A couple of weeks ago someone was asking about the Earth passing through 
dust clouds in space. Here's the Risks article I mentioned (from Risks 
Digest 19.23)... should be exciting:

From: Jonathan Nash <jnash@qis.net>
Subject: 1998-1999 Leonids may damage satellites

An article in the 9 Jun 1997 issue of *Science News* warned that the Leonid
meteor showers in 1998 and 1999 may damage satellites.  The Leonid meteor
shower occurs around the middle of November and usually 100 meteors an hour
may be visible. In the Far East in 1998, 100,000 meteors an hour may be
visible. In 1999 there will also be a very heavy Leonid shower in Western
Europe.

"A Leonid storm occurs every 33 years, when Earth passes through the
meteoroid storm shortly after Temple-Tuttle has neared the sun and spewed
fresh particles. On 17 Nov 1998, Earth will hit the Leonid stream just 9
months after the comet has passed closet to the sun.  In that short
interval, the torrent of new meteoroids won't have had time to spread out.
Our planet will encounter a dense swath of debris, creating a veritable
tempest.

"The dust particles are tiny, so chance collisions with spacecraft aren't
the prime worry of scientists. Rather, researchers express concern about the
potential of these particles to create localized clouds of electric charge,
or plasma, that can penetrate satellites and short-circuit equipment.

"The high speed of a Leonid meteoroid - about 72 kilometers per second, more
than three times that of an average meteoroid - favors the production of
clouds of charged material, notes Brown. These can generate lightninglike
discharges inside satellites, zapping fragile electric components.

"Another meteor storm, this one associated with a swath of cometary debris
known as the Perseids, is credited with taking a satellite out of commission
in 1993 (SN: 2 Oct 1993, p. 217). However, the potential for damage is highly
uncertain...  Come 1998, 'everyone is going to go through this test, whether
they like it or not.'"

I'm not entirely sure what you mean here, but I don't consider filtering
rude at all; this is why I've tried to ensure that the Roswell posts were
clearly marked so that people could filter them out. 

As for requesting that people end threads, that doesn't seem like a bad
idea if it isn't of general interest; I don't plan to continue discussing
the Roswell crash both because of that and because I've said just about
everything I have to say (though I may comment some more on the
interstellar travel subthread).

As EvMick pointed out, the magnetic poles switch every few hundered thousand
to million years.  And it doesn't seem to require any external astronomical
event.  It's something to do with the dynamics of the liquid metal of the
Earth's core.

As far as I can tell, it is possible that the Neanderthals couldn't talk, or
at least not nearly as well as we could.  They might, for exmple, have had a
vocabulary of a few hundred words, and a grammar that only allowed two-word
sentences.  This is a stage in the development of human language that kids
spend some time in around age two, whch allows sentences of the forms "gimme
juice", "go house", "brown dog", etc.  It's a long way from real language,
albeit a huge advance over no language at all.  It may well not be enough to
support a culture that permits the development and appreciation of art.

That's my cockamamie theory of why the Neaderthals lost out.  For another
theory, possibly less cockamamie since it was come up with by an
archaeologist after much thought, I reccommend "The Prehistory of the Mind"
by Steven Mithen.  It's a theory on the cognitive architecture of the minds
of the hominids, based on archeological evidence.  It's fairly cool stuff
and may even be right.  It's a well-written book.

My 19-month-old daughter can speak three human words (juice, me, and done)
and four animal sounds (woof-woof, sssss, baa, and moo).  And we don't have
pets or live on a farm; this all from looking at books and occaisional zoo
visits.  Mithen claims that there is a part of the brain specialized to the
learning of facts about plants and animals, and it's easy to believe when I
watch my daughter learn stuff about animals faster than she learns about
things our culture considers important (talking, cleanliness, fairness...).

--CarlF

PS.  She's also obsessed with trains, which I think file under 'animals' in
her brain.  When we drive around, she spots railroad crossings out the
window and points them out with great excitement.  If trains were animals,
she'd be spotting game trails.  All this from someone who poops at random
and frequently trips over specks of dust!

Just came thru the Arizona Port of Entry on I-10 heading east...thermometer
says 105.

I'm hauling farm tractors and their extra duals.  Four duals (tire...about 2
foot thick by 7 ft in diameter...maybe 500lbs each) are stacked like donuts
on my upperdeck.
I strapped them down...each strap has a breaking strength of 12,000lbs...a
working strength of 5,000lb.  The rule of thumb is to use 1.5times the
working strength times the weight of what is restrained.  (1.5 x 1,000 =
1500...) one strap was way plenty.

But I noticed that the first strap I tossed over had a cut in it.  So I added
 two more straps just for giggles....I like my redundancy to have redundancy.
 I arranged them in a TeePee or Net fashion...each one going thru a clevis
that I put on the top of the tires.

Tightened down as hard as I could on the winches...pretty secure.

The guy here at the port asked me if I had another strap...he pointed out
that one was cut.  To fix it...the "or else" was implied...but none the less
real.

Now I never argue with cops...they got the guns...and the prime rule of life
is that if youre bigger you get to hit.  So I added another strap.  3 good
straps at 5 thousand  pounds each...plus one that's got to be good for at
least 2000 to hold down a weight of about 1000... 

So I pull around again...Nope...no good ..bad strap....fix it.
(remember....it's 105 degrees.)

Now I'm a little bit irritated..So I pull ALL the straps off ....except
one...being sure it was really, really pretty....  And pull around there
again....

He looks at the staps...he looks at me..I grin....he looks at the  straps
again..He didn't see a cut ...everything was fine...I got to go.

Go figure.

Check out the Intersex Society of North America <http://www.isna.org/> to

Your desire to argue is also a social signal.  Many people would like
nothing better than to agree with all their friends on every
conversation topic that comes up.

To elaborate, people want political issues which are closely aligned
with aspects of their own values that they want to signal to others,
and which do not overly threaten how things actually get done.

Not that I dont think psychedelics have been useful tools in the
development of human consciousness, but there are some other
scientific theories that help explain humanitys preference and
ability for innovation and creativity.  The "exponential increase in
novelty in modern times", though driven by our evolved capacity for
curiosity, seems surely due to an outward-looking focus on science,
commerce, gadgetry and rising awareness of cultural diversity through
much-enhanced communication channels rather than any inward-looking,
spiritual focus or drive to return to nature as noble savages.

One theory about how our capacity for curiosity and creativity evolved
was described recently in a 970712 Science News article by Bruce
Bower: "Humanitys Imprecision Vision: A Volatile World May have
Forged Minds That make a Virtue of Uncertainty", describing the work
of Smithsonian anthropologist Richard Potts who "exalts uncertainty as
the way of the world and the instigator of human nature" in his 1996
book _Humanitys Descent_ and the 960816 issue of Science magazine.

Potts theory of "variability selection" claims that "animal species
best able to scrounge a living from whatever resources were available
gained the upper hand over pickier creatures" that were more optimized
for specific niches.  Most of Potts claims are based on sedimentary
and fossil records of climate change which supposedly show that
"hominids had to react nimbly each [of the many] time[s] the
environmental rug was pulled out from under their feet".

     As long as we're in a urban-oriented market economy where the 
     decisions of some end up having a detrimental financial or 
     sociological impact on the rest of us, then it's the decision of the 
     collective citizens to decide and it's my hope that the "makers" are 
     getting fed up with the "takers" and the "fakers" (to use your terms 
     <G>).
     
     There are an extraordinarily large number of people who have seen fit 
     not to exert discernment concerning the management of their own lives. 
     In my mind, participation in a structured community has a membership 
     fee.  The addicted, the disinfranchised, the non-contributors need to 
     shape up or be shipped out.  An extreme of this is some place like 
     Singapore which is cleaner than Disneyland but you get caned, jailed 
     and even executed for things we permit in this country for the sake of 
     allowing personal freedom or expression.  The price we pay for 
     allowing it is crime, filth and a burgeoning segment of human inertia.
     
     I want community connectivity and agreement on common goals that 
     enable us to advance and thrive.  What's in the way is ego, avarice 
     and apathy.  Our sense of freedom is so skewed by our sense of ego 
     that it's amazing that anything productive happens!
     
     So, (off soapbox), if someone's going to smoke themselves into 
     high-cost health care they can't pay for, I will seek to prevent them 
     from smoking because my sense of compassion isn't willing to 
     compromise once they have a life-threatening need for health care 
     whether they set it up mindlessly or willingly.  I also want to go 
     after their illness providers (tobacco companies).
     
     If someone's going to be diving into nutrition-less food, making them 
     listless, obese or subject to heart disease, I would want to educate 
     them and I would campaign for the companies who make value-less food 
     to produce something for the greater good, not just for their 
     stockholders.  It's not okay although we accept it as such in a 
     free-for-all (freefall?) market economy.  Accountability is absent and 
     profit and success justify anything that the right to free choice 
     doesn't cover.  So...I wasn't quite off my soapbox.  I feel better.
     
     Oh and yes, speaking as a gay man and not a transexual, I feel that 
     the person desiring a sex change needs a lot of professional advice 
     and time before making a physical transition that is so highly-charged 
     in our culture.  Gender is paramount in our culture and it's a lot 
     more than just futzing with your genitals.

An excellent post.  But I have a nit to pick.  I think the concept of
"declining society" is itself a meme....and a very debiliting one.  To my
understanding relegions derive much of their power from guilt.  That guilt is
based upon "fall from grace".  Or a prior "Golden Age".  I don't buy it.  

Reading the works of Julian Simon is one of the reasons I don't buy it.

I'm just a dumb truck driver.  But I assisted my wife in raising a son.  He's
OK. And his wife and he are raising my GrandKids.  Doing a good job best I
can tell.  They, as did I and my wife, have a PRIME TENET of child raising.

"NEVER LIE TO THE KID"

If you don't know....tell him.
If you don't want him to know..tell him.

but never lie

Santa claus...the tooth fairy....relegion...and other modern fantasies

      I would regard a third world shepherd as a leaver, a western world
      rancher as a taker.  The distinction being on their overall impact on
      the world at large.  The shepherd's flock might eat up the grass in a
      meadow which locally may locally impact the population but a modern
     cattle facility can spoil groundwater and produce over abundant 
     amounts of methane, not to mention how much grain it takes to feed the
     cattle that one doesn't get back nutritionally or substantively in t=
     he resultant meat or dairy consumption for which the cattle are 
     raised.
     
     Anton Sherwood replied (no <G>s so I'll have to assume 
     tongue-in-cheek):
     
     Your low-impact shepherds stripped the Mediterranean of its trees
     and enlarged the Sahara.
     
     and I am compelled to respond:
     
     Regarding "my" shepherds, do you have any data on how many centuries 
     it took for their systematic devistation to take place?  If this data 
     exists, could you provide me with a correlation on their environmental 
     impact vs. the U.S. environmental impact in the last, say, 100 years.  
     Yeah, those shepherds, a swarm of locusts they were.  And look, <G>.
     
     Leaver cultures screw up environmental balance quite often but it is 
     not planetary in impact.  When they (or their herds) consume all that 
     is available, it has a direct effect on population since they have 
     impacted their own sustainability.  But because of their limited 
     scope, they presumably do it unintentionally because their focus is on 
     day-to-day survival.
     
     Correlation: the first banks stored grain because somewhere along the 
     line someone figured we didn't have quite enough foresight to control 
     our consumption.  Of course we were good at burning and pillaging back 
     then as well.  The idea to store grain (the gold seed turned into the 
     gold coin) was a good one but the incorporation of which  has created 
     a much more severe measure of imbalance and one that has a viable 
     global threat attached to it.  
     
     Since we've evolved beyond what nature intends as keeping a balance on 
     population (you eat it all at once or there are too many of you, you 
     starve), I am hoping we can swing the pendulum a bit back towards 
     center.  We've ensured our survival against need but can we guarantee 
     our survival against greed? We have the technology, the intelligence 
     and the organizational structure to implement such a paradigm but our 
     greed and ego seem to be hell-bent on prevailing.  Looks like there is 
     still some evolving to do...

I thought that this might be of interest to some of the computer
professionals on the extropians list. If I had to take a wild guess,
I'd figure that this is going to go the way of the MicroChannel
bus (for those of you who remember that).  The open PCI bus seems
much better established right now than ISA was at the time of
MicroChannel, when ISA was already beginning to show its flaws.
Without Intel's participation, I doubt i2o is going to get very
far, and given that Intel has been a heavy supporter (e. g. the
Triton chipsets) of the PCI bus so far, I don't know why they'd
want to backtrack.  But from a memetic-evolution perspective, this
looks like a bunch of yeast cells getting together to form a
"Committee to Discourage Sexual Reproduction". At a simpler
level, this is just trade-unionism, I guess.

The i2o Bus: A Conspiracy Against Free Software?

Bruce Perens (bruce@pixar.com)
Wed, 16 Jul 97 11:40 PDT 

Check out http://www.i2osig.org/ "i2o" is a developing "non-proprietary"
standard for high-performance computer peripherals. Unfortunately, it's a
closed standard, it requires a NDA, and you need a license to develop
software for it. Their terms are:

        Membership is $5000/year.
        You can't develop software or hardware for it without being a member.
        You can't disclose source code for your drivers.
        You must stop making hardware or software for it if you lose membership.
        Members can vote out other members.

The backers of this are Microsoft, Novell, Hewlet-Packard, and NETFrame.
It looks as if the i2o agreements are deliberately written to exclude free
software.

I suspect that if i2o peripherals become popular, free operating systems
will be locked out from running on PC hardware.

Please take a look at this and give me a reality check.

Almost certainly, they couldn't have spoken any human language, because their

develop fully functional language without using their mouths at all; *our*
language centers are quite adept at making do.  So they could have had their
own language, had their brains been set up for it (which we don't know).

Or no language at all, or a language as complex as ours (although I'm
inclined to doubt the last).  

I agree that the Neanderthals probably lost due to inadequate culture; but
why their culture was inadequate is a very open question.  Their bodies were
clearly under less pressure than ours to speak well; our larynxes give us a
substantial risk of choking from food.  Quite possibly their language centers
weren't up to ours; that certainly would have prevented sophisticated
communication even though their bodies didn't.

There could have been non-linguistic reasons they didn't have a sophisticated
culture.  Maybe different groups just didn't get along.  Maybe their
intragroup confilects were too severe.  Maybe something else about their
brains was different.  Maybe they didn't have elders (how long did they live,
anyway?)

Interesting, they could learn from us, to some extent.  They have found one
Neanderthal burial site.  Normally burial was a human custom; before this
they didn't think Neanderthals ever buried their dead.  The speculation is
that they learned it from humans.  I believe there were even flowers in the
grave (well, they found pollen, to be precise).  Would that count as art?

I agree, "declining society" sounds like I have some utopian vision of how it
should be, but I couldn't think of another way of putting it.  Any ideas?

The following was reported by The Economist:

*       Advanced Tissue Sciences, an American biotechnology company,
claimed it would soon be able to grow a HUMAN HEART IN THE LABORATORY.
The company has already managed to grow heart valves, heart muscles,
blood vessels and a human finger joint. The European Parliament approved
on first reading a law that would harmonise national PATENT LEGISLATION
ON GENETIC ENGINEERING, and would allow continent-wide patents for
genetic inventions.


Not my field so I cannot comment on credibility.

        Few words have as much emotional baggage as the word "ego".  The
term has become so convoluted in the last century that it is now commonly
accepted as a synonym to arrogance and narcissism...things that are seen as
"bad" in the eyes of society.  Rick's paragraph above gives the impression
that there is a contrast between "agreement on common goals" and one's ego.
First of all, to have a goal, one must have his\her own reason for setting
the goal...one must pursue it for his\her own self.  When, say, a thousand
people have the exact same goal for their own egoistic (not to be confused
with egotistic) reasons, then you have a thousand people working to make
that goal reality; these are a thousand individuals --not a mass with one
name: community.

        Secondly, one cannot have true freedom without having ego.  If one
is bound to another's ideals, he\she is just that: bound.  The only
non-physical limits that exist are the ones that each individual decides to
create or adhere to him\herself.  *Nothing* is blocking a person from
taking a machete and decapitating his\her neighbor except for his\her own
moral limitations.  Nothing is stopping me from doing 80 miles per hour in
a 50mph zone...however, I must consider the consequences.  In addition,
every person has freedom, however, every person has to look at the
ramifications and effects that every step he\she makes will cause.  Only an
individual --with an ego-- can make his\her own decisions to adhere to
limits or break them.  Nothing is barring any individual from working with
another person or a thousand other people, and by no means does having an
ego quell productivity...quite the opposite has been proven time and time
again.

What nobody mentioned is the most common reason for now worrying about the

tangentially touched upon above, but mostly couched in ideas of
environment.  My favorite example is, to paraphrase Ralph Merkle 
(http://www.merkle.com) A horse and a car are both means of
transportation, but you don't worry about you car going feral, running
away from the garage, and living on tree sap in the forest. Cars aren't
engineered to "live" without carefully refined fuel.  Neither will
molecular robots or assemblers without a lot of deliberate work.
Certainly, our defenses will be up by the time that is feasible.
Although the organic quality of the creation of the "Seed" in the Diamond
Age is aesthetically intriguing.

This is a common meme, but I'm not sure it's correct.
I think that the major driving force for flattening
the organization is the advent of the PC. Each manager
has become a great deal more productive, so we need less
managers. I know, all the studies say otherwise, but the
economic forces that drove the growth of management hierarchies
were the increases in productivity of the organizations that
employed them: those organizations became more proifitable than
their competitors and won in the marketplace, because the tasks
the managers were doing increased the productivity of the
companies. Now many of those tasks can be done more efficiently
because the computers help. Therefore, companies need fewer
managers to provide the same level of management.

"Voyage From Yesteryear", James P. Hogan, 1982.

At 372 pages, I think we'd better call it a novel, not a novella.

The book is one of my favorites, and I feel that
EvMick is correct. It is an accessible and enjoyable exploration
of a world whose population has effectively unlimited material
resouces. It lets us think about that aspect of MNT without having
to consider the additional radical increases in technological
capability that will occur with MNT.

And just to prove that *no* sub-sub-topic is too minor to escape mention

I wish I had you with me at 1 in the morning two nights ago. I was
driving home and saw my best friend, who had just gotten back in town,
on the side of the road surrounded by three police. I, of course,
stopped and approached the scene to inquire. One very large cop saw me
stop and started coming down towards me as I started moving towards him. 

(This is pretty much how it went.)

"Don't move any further."

"Okay, but that's my friend, there."

"I don't care who it is, don't move any further."

"Can you tell me what's going on?"

"No, I cannot."

"Can I ask him?"

"For our safety you cannot move any further towards the scene."

"Will you tell him to call me when he gets to the station?"

"I'm not here to run a message service."

(At this point I can see my friend with his hands against the car
getting frisked.)

"What's the charge?"

"I'm going to have to ask you to get back in your car and leave the
scene."

(Now I'm getting irritated).

"Officer, is he going to jail?"

"Listen, if you don't leave now, you're going to jail too."

"So he *is* going to jail then. Which one?"

And so, with that, I was arrested, charged with "Interfering with Police
Business, " and locked up for the night. At first, it was an interesting
experience, going to jail, getting booked, giving the cop my shoelaces
so I couldn't hang myself and thereby spare myself the wrath of the
State. But then it became rather tedious, locked in a room with drunken
college students, bar-brawlers, wife-beaters, drugged-up thugs,
drugged-up wimps, and various pushers.

At ten in the morning they loaded us into a paddy-wagon and brought us
to court where I waited around in another cell for four hours until they
called me for my arraignment. I walk in the courtroom, the prosecutor
*STARTED LAUGHING*!! He looked at the charging document and said, "For
the misdemeanor of interfering with police business we feel that one
night in jail is more than sufficient penalty for a law student. We
recommend nolle prosequi" The judge smiled patronizingly and said, "The
court rules the charge nolled. Please learn to keep your mouth shut."

I was fit to be tied, the bastards.

So then I was sent downstairs a free man, where they locked me up for
another two hours until they finished my damn paperwork! I told the
sherrif that I demanded to be let out given that the prosecutor had
chosen no longer to prosecute my case, and that I am not responsible for
whatever bureaucratic nonsense they had to do. The sherrif laughed and
said, "You're free when the computer says you're free."

So, I finally got out of jail 15 hours later, all for caring about a

That doesn't mean anything. As a pivot point it is merely a fulcrum if
reaction mass is expended, according to Newton's Third Law. Since the
rider on the swing is at a standstill, and has no way to push against
anything, how do they develop the significant levels of momentum they
do?

Without further stuttering, the cycles in magnetic alignment in seafloor
lava is relative to the precession of the magnetic pole, which has been
shown to be tightly tied in with the differential in rotation between
the mantle and the core. As this precession is cyclic at around 40,000
years, from what I've heard, this is a decent stopwatch for such
geologic changes, so long as the moons orbit is not significantly
changed over time, which would change the tidal drag vector on the crust
and mantle, thus changing the path and cycle of the precession of the
magnetic pole. NOTE: this is not related to the 26,000 precession cycle
of our rotational axis relative to the stars.

But what is the energy put into? If true action/reaction holds, the
rider moving its center of gravity higher will only reduce the momentum
at that point in the swing, so it will not move any higher. If true
action/reaction holds, as it is popularly understood, the rider should
not be able to gain any momentum on each swing without causing a
reaction....

I seem to remember someone (Carl?) mentioning a filtered Extropian list a 
while back. Does anyone know if such a list exists?  If so, what criteria
are used for filtering? Even the digest is getting to be too much to sort

Woof, where do I begin?  Most directly, the medical profession exists 
as an extension of the society that it resides in, as evidenced by 
the different medical codes prevalent in various cultures. 

There is a long and sordid history of medical science being used 
against persons who do not conform to whatever the contemporary 
gender stereotypes happened to be at the time.  In fact, as the 
gender perceptions changed, so did the treatments inflicted upon gay or 
transgendered persons and the populations targeted also changed.  We would 
like to think in this modern era that we have moved past all that, 
but gender 'anomalous' persons still suffer tremendous abuse at the 
hands of doctors and psychiatrists in the name of 'curing' or 
'normalization'.  Aversion therapy, reparative therapy, involuntary 
surgery, involuntary commitment or imprisonment, beatings and torture 
occur with such frequency even in Western countries that Amnesty 
International has added sexual orientation to its charter and 
produces an annual report of such abuse yearly (my copy is outdated, 
so I won't quote stats).

If you were to take a poll of your gay/bi/les/trans friends, chances 
are that a majority could recount some experience, ranging from 
unpleasant to terrifying, that involved a medical or psychiatric 
professional.  Those who live in rural areas, out of access to a gay or 
trans-friendly clinic often skip necessary treatment altogether.  
Recent examples:  (i) Loree Cook-Daniels, is compiling a study on elder 
abuse and already finds a very high incidence of mistreatment and 
abuse of gay and trans patients by the staff, more so than in the wider 
patient population.  (ii) In Washington, D.C., last year a transgendered 
person was left to bleed to death in the street by paramedics who 
stood by and ridiculed him, and a gay man who was stabbed was also 
denied treatment and had to find his way to the hospital on his own.  
(iii) In my home town, a man known to be gay was left to bleed to death 
in the corner of the emergency room.

In the world of psychiatry, the Bem Sex Survey, an instrument used to 
determine whether a person is 'masculine' or 'feminine' has come 
under fire because more and more persons are scoring as 
'androgynous'.  Rather than undertake an examination of how this 
might indicate some serious human evolution, researchers are calling for 
a new instrument that would definitively score persons as masculine and 
feminine, thus preserving the division.  Such an approach could not 
possibly reflect a 'conservative' approach by these researchers, 
because it blatantly ignores the data.

I wish I could remember the name of the book, but it can be found in 
university bookstores, a history of medical treatments directed 
against gay/bi/les/trans persons in modern history, and the thing is 
over five inches thick, small print, dense documentation and 
citation.  It recounts the instances individuals singled out for 'treatment' 
for not adhering to physcial and psychological expectations for their 
assigned gender.  In some cases, student populations in high schools and 
universities were screened against the worst stereotypes and 
assumptions, and women who did not look feminine enough were 
particularly singled out for further 'treatment' or 'counseling'.    

I could go one, but this message is rather long and plenty of 
literature exists on the topic, not to mention plenty of persons 
willing to recount their expereriences if asked.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

 IAN: If the basis for the meteor theory is 
 witness accounts of a fiery object streaking 
 toward TWA 800, then the meteor account is
 without basis once we are familiar with
 the details of witness accounts.

 I have spoken with several witnesses in detail.
 I have collected almost 30 detailed accounts.
 The primary reasons to discount the meteor 
 theory based upon the preponderance of 
 witness accounts are:

  1) pilots with the advantage of having
  a higher point of view saw the object
  rise up from the surface of the earth.

  2) the curved nature of the trajectory 
  of the missile-like object [1]

  3) the diminution in the observed 
  size & width of the flame and "exhaust 
  trail" as the streak approached TWA 800,
  which indicates that the fiery object 
  was going away from observes. In fact, 
  many say that it became small that it 
  vanished just before the first explosion.

  4) the wreckage shows no sign of 
  penetration caused by a projectile
  on a downward trajectory [2] 

 One witness, Tom Dougherty, to whom 
 I spoke at length and to whom I raised 
 the possibility of a meteor (to which 
 he said "no way"), indicated that the
 streaking object not only curved in
 its overall trajectory but about 1/3
 of the way up, took a sudden sharp
 turn and then "corrected itself."

 I posit that at that moment the missile's
 guidance system temporarily locked onto  
 its target drone, but then reselected 
 the larger target/signal, TWA 800. 
 This may have been that drone: [3].

Is the Mandelbrot Set real? Well, there are some points that we know for sure 
are in The Mandelbrot Set and some points we know for sure are not.  However, 
there are other points that we'll never be able to determine to be in the set 
or not, and to make things even worse, we can't discriminate  between those
impossible points and those who's status is just difficult to determine. 
The bottom line is that we can't know everything about The Mandelbrot Set, 
and can't even define the limits of our ignorance, but is that really any 
different from any other object? Also,  does OUR ability to have knowledge of 
an object determine if it really exists  or not? Actually, if some (not all) 
of the interpretations of Quantum  Mechanics are correct then the answer to 
that last question is yes.

This brings up a related question, I've heard it said that The Mandelbrot Set 
is the most complex object in mathematics, but is it? The shape is 
fantastically complex, as well as beautiful, and it would take a computer an  
infinite amount of time to render it, but the program itself is amazingly 
simple, only a few lines long, hell I wrote a Mandelbrot program when I was a  
kid. How could a dumb kid who didn't know his ass from a hole in the ground  
write a program that could, given enough time, produced the most complex  
object in Mathematics?

Complexity is not as clear cut an idea as it would seem, even the formal   
definitions contain subjective elements, and they don't seem to correspond  
very well with our intuitive understanding of the word. By some standards a  
frog is more "complex" than a human, it certainly contains a lot more DNA.   
             
Some say AIC is a measure of complexity, but there are problems. 
The  Algorithmic Information Content (AIC) of a message string can be 
found by measuring the length of the smallest computer program that can 
produce the string, and that's just another way of asking how much the string 
can be compressed. The AIC is largest for random strings because the 
smallest program that can produce a truly random string is the string itself, 
it's completely incompressible. Accordingly, the gibberish a monkey produces 
by banging on a typewriter contains far more information than a Shakespeare 
sonnet of the same length. This is almost the exact opposite of what we 
usually mean when we say something is complex. Another rather serious problem 
with AIC is that we can never find it, we can only find an upper bound. 
Greg Chaitin proved a few years ago that in general you can't be certain that 
there is not a program shorter than any you know about that will generate the 
string.  This also means that although most strings are random and thus 
incompressible, you can't prove that any particular string is random. 

Charles Bennett of IBM thinks that in addition to AIC we need another measure  
of complexity he calls "Depth", it's a measure of how long a program must run 
to produce its result, not how big the program is. The trillionth's prime 
number or the Mandelbrot set can be generated with very short programs, but 
they must run for a VERY long time, so they would have very little AIC but
enormous depth.   

Depth helps but it doesn't solve everything, the works of a monkey are still  
more complex than Shakespeare. I think part of the problem is that all  
information is not of equal value, and it's difficult to get a handle on that 
mathematically.  I also think it would be a mistake to equate complexity with  
virtue, in fact all things being equal, the opposite is true. A simple 
program is better than a complex one that does the same thing. A simple  
ecosystem such as a temperate forest of oaks and conifers is more resilient  
than a very complex one like a tropical rain forest.

When you say "puns" I take it you mean "wordplay" in general...

Well, there's plain silliness. But stuff that makes your burst out laughing?
Yeah, pretty much has to do with somebody getting the short end of the stick.

I know Heinlein commented on this in _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and I
wouldn't be a bit surprised if he was cribbing from someone else.

I think I know where you're headed with this one, Michael. :)

But the conventional explanation is the same as the "jogger in the
O'Neill cylinder" explanation: the reaction is a tiny cyclic change 
in angular momentum of the entire Earth, every full swing.

The rider does have something to push (or pull in this case) against, the 
Earth. The child on the swing goes one direction and the Earth moves in the 
opposite direction, very, very slowly but then The Earth has a lot more mass 
than the child. The total amount of momentum is exactly the same.

     I've got two points of curiosity and would like to hear from any 
     researchers (official or other) about:
     
     Eidetic Imaging:
     
     A kind of heightened mental visualisation. From my limited reading and 
     intermittent experience it can be described as the moment where mental 
     images cease to be voluntary and tenuous and suddenly begin to paint 
     themselves into sharper, intense and more luminous detail so that the 
     image or series of images seem very suddenly to be more experienced 
     than imagined. So suddenly that I wonder what threshold is being 
     passed: chemical, electrical? Or whether this is simply a matter of a 
     rapid re organization of consciousness into a kind of extreme inner 
     subjectivity?
     
     In case you're wondering this is not neccesarily a psychedelic nor 
     schizophrenic meandering. My first and so far only prolonged 
     experience of this sort of thing was way before ingesting anything so 
     tasty. It has been documented that children experience this more than 
     adults.
     
     Anyway, I was wondering whether any of you may be experimenting on 
     college students...for all I know California may be teeming with 
     eidetic workshops but I can't find any in my phone book.
     
     
     Anti Matter:
     
     I once heard some science show say that the energy yield from a 
     theoretical anti matter engine would get us to Pluto in nine 
     minutes...I more recently heard that a wee chunk of it has been 
     manufactured and am curious as to what's to be done with it. 
     
     Anyone got any clues?

The pivot point acts as the connection point between a fixed and multiple
free-moving members, not really a pendulum in the classical analysis sense. 

If it were a simple pendulum problem, it would not be possible for a person
to start from rest.

The force that you have forgotten is the tension in the rope.  Analysis as
a classical pendulum generally excludes this force because 1) it is in
equilibrium, and 2) it is contained in a single member.  When the swinger
pulls on the rope at some point between the seat and the pivot, the x-axis
component of the tension is modified, evidenced by the sudden bend in the
rope around the point where the hands are attached (at which point the rope
should be analyzed as *two* individual free-moving members around an
additional pivot point).  Because one point is fixed (the pivot) and the
other point is not (the seat), there is a net change in force around the
second pivot point (the hands).  In other words, the swinger is actually
pulling themselves towards the pivot point, and the unbalanced x-axis
component of this applied force is manifested as acceleration.  This is why
where you hold the rope makes a difference in how fast you gain speed.  

This problem is really a classical multi-member statics (or dynamics
depending on your analysis technique) problem.

M-hm.  I won't ask what weird force brings this about.
Instead I'll observe that if it happens as often as danny implies,
there shouldn't be a Hawaiian chain, because the crust would slip
away from the hot-spot before the volcanic cone is more than an
unremarkable lump on the seafloor.
Alternatively, if the great shimmy happens every N million years,
there should be several chains like Hawaii, scattered about the globe,
appropriately staggered in age.

I'm unfamiliar with the "aquatic ape theory"...apes appear unsuited to an
aquatic enviroment.

One "theory" which I read once (Analog SF/SF...back in the 70's or 80's I
think, fact Article) dealt with cursorial hunters and the origin of man.

A cursorial hunter being defined as a pack hunter, like wolves.  Early man
would chase his intended prey until it collapsed...then feast.

Supportive physiological facts include man's exceptionally high leg length to
body height ratio (relative to other primates) exceptional cooling system

Subject: The Pournelle Political Axis
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Several years ago Baen Books published a series off books called (I beleive)
"New Frontiers".  They were published semi-regularly for a while...almost
monthly I beleive, and contained fact and SF.

One of the fact articles was an essay by Jerry Pournelle which I remember as
"The Pournelle Political Axis"

Briefly this states that the traditional  Right/Left dichotomy is inaccurate
and that there is in fact a second dimension to politics. These axes
are:Rational vs. Mystical and Good Government vs Bad Government.

Take Rational vs. Mystical as the vertical Axis and Place Rational at the Top
and Mystical at the Bottom with a zero in the middle and tens on each end.
(10,0,-10). 

Rational being defined in the form: Questions are inherently answerable and
problems are inherently solveable. (scientific method)
Mystical being defined in the form: There are some things that man is not
ment to know. (relegion)

At right angles to this the horizontal axis with  Loves Government on the
Right , zero in the middle and Hates Government on the left (-10,0,10)

Loves Government being defined in the form: The more the
better,...centralization....socialization....in control
Hates Government being defined in the form: would rather kiss a rattlesnake
on the lips than haves

This forms four quadrants : the upper right being Rational and Loves
Government (communism as an example)
                                      : the upper left being  Rational and
Hates Government (Libertarianism as an Example)
                                      : The Lower Right being  :Mystical and
Loves Government (The Christian Coalition ,Nazis)
                                      : The Lower Lefti being : Mystical and
Hates Government   (some really weird folks...can't
                            think of an example...relegious anarchy of some
sort.)

The degree of how strongly a position was held is quantified( 0 to 10 ).  I
would venture to guess that most of the US is floating around zero but with a
tendency toward being right of verticle and below the horizontal.  I would
venture to guess that Extropians are off the scale in the upper left quadrant
(-10,+10)...out past Libertarians and some Anarchists.

But I haven't heard anything more about it in years...outside of the
Libertarians "World's Shortest Political Quiz" which is in the same format.

Is this useful...or merely interesting.  Accurate? It got Jerry Pournelle a
Ph.d. if I recall.

        Actually, there may be a *little* bit of truth in what Danny is
saying.  Feeding off of my geology experience, I seem to recall that there
are two different forms of tectonic movement: convergent and divergent.
When a divergent tectonic movement takes place, the plates split apart,
causing magma to escape...a perfect example is Iceland which is always
splitting and growing igneous rock.  Convergent movement is when two plates
collide or "converge" producing magma in that way.  What I presume Danny is
getting at is that there may be a large convergent movement without a
head-on collision, causing the pole or continent to move.  However, though
this is conceptually a possibility (isn't everything!?), it has never
happened before on this planet (as far as anyone knows) and the odds of it
happening are tremendously infinitessimal.


P.S.: Just to clarify something, Hawaii is a bit of an anomaly.  It was
  --and is being-- formed by weaknesses in the seafloor which were
  punctured under pressure.  These punctures sent up spits of magma in
 the form of pillow basalts which, in turn, created the Hawaiian
islands.  The punctures still prove to be very active in Hawaii
judging by the high amount of volcanic activity...it is probable that
      within the next million years there will be many more Hawaiian 
      islands...and more opportunities to trap future tourists!  ;~)

**************************************************************
Being dedicated to the future progress of humankind

**************************************************************

----------
This is a common meme, but I'm not sure it's correct.
I think that the major driving force for flattening
the organization is the advent of the PC. Each manager
has become a great deal more productive, so we need less
managers. I know, all the studies say otherwise, but the
economic forces that drove the growth of management hierarchies
were the increases in productivity of the organizations that
employed them: those organizations became more proifitable than
their competitors and won in the marketplace, because the tasks
the managers were doing increased the productivity of the
companies. Now many of those tasks can be done more efficiently
because the computers help. Therefore, companies need fewer
managers to provide the same level of management.


Dear fellow Extropians,
To some extent the point made is valid.
It must be remembered, however, that the PC is neither the beginning nor
the end.
There is a bigger and broader picture (or paradigm).
Changes in human behavior in response to education and inovation have, I
think, far more to do with changes in organizational structure.
Humankind does, after all, progress.

Enjoy,

Abraham Moses Genen

This sounds like what has been called 'astral travelling'.  Check out a
book by Susan Blakemore (?) (I think it might be called 'Out of the
Body') on the subject. She's a good scientist who had this kind of
experience, and investigated it, taking in turn all theories about it
>from the wooliest magical ones to the most rigorous scientific, and
weighing up their pros and cons. The magical theories say the 'astral
realm' is genuinely independent, like physical reality, and kind of
connected with it, but there's no good evidence for this yet.

I would be interested if anybody else has some up to the minute research
info. on this.  The phrase 'eidetic imaging' makes it sound like there's
a new branch of knowledge opening up, coming at the thing from a
cognitive psych angle.

'Astral travelling' (which is probably the same thing as 'lucid dreaming',
but while awake) has been practiced extensively in the Western occult
tradition, less extensively in Eastern traditions (except the Tibetan
Buddhist, which has a whole branch of yoga devoted to it).  

It's conceivable that there may be some therapeutic value in the process
- it's like, you 'travel' through the 'realm' of your own personal
symbolism, which is grounded in your personal (perhaps also social/memetic)
history and your deepest desires (or society's/the species'), which you
engage in 'dialogue' in personified forms ('archetypes'?)

It's interesting that the reverse of this (external reality seeming to
be internal) is also a logical possibility - perhaps some forms of
schizophrenia and/or autism?

I think our disagreement is only a matter of emphasis. I feel that
the inovations (usually of a technical nature) drive the whole
process. In the case of downsizing, nearly all the analysis of
the phenomenon have centered on the resulting behavioral changes,
and not on the underlying technical change. It's true that
the behavior is interesting, but it typically lags far behind
the enabling technology because habits are hard to change. You
usually have to wait for the older generation to retire: look
at the ages of the folks who still have secretaries. One should
be able to predict organizational changes by looking at new
technology, but we don't do a good job of this. In essence, the PC
is automating a lot of management jobs out of existance. This trend
should have been predictable with the advent of the computer.
Instead, we worried about automation of productins jobs, which
mostly didn't happen: workers mostly just became a lot more
productive.

You mention that the PC is neither the beginning nor the end,
and you are quite correct. As a simple example, the typewriter
brought the secretary's job into existance, and the PC abolished
it. The computer revolution is accelerating, and will IMO lead
within the next 9 years to the development of an SI that will
change our current society beyond comprehension. This is an
extreme example of technology driving organizational change.
If unforseen factors prevent the SI development we will still
see radical organizatinal changes based on computers. Many of
the advantages of a large company disappear when each individual
can use a PC to do the jobs that were traditionally done by the
corporate infrastructure: billing, accounting, payroll, taxes,
purchasing, contracting, etc. These capabilities are automatable,
and this is what permits an individual to easily become a
contractor instead of an employee. With the advent of the Web,
other aspects of running a business become accsible to the
individual, such as advertizing, sales, customer support,
and marketing. It will take a while for society to learn
to use these new tools, but we should in theory be able
to predict some of the consequences.

This is going to be a buzzword used to milk New Age suckers of their money.
 "Eiditic" is really a type of memory - a perfect memory of all sensory
information, kind of an upgrade from photographic.  Pretty much only children
have it - they lose it by adulthood.  Actually it's not perfect, although
that's its reputation; just very good.

Absolutely nothing will get you to Pluto (which is 8 light-hours away) in 9
minutes.  They have anitmatter in the lab, yes, but as individual atoms,
which is about 10e26th of what you need for a drive.  Don't buy any tickets
yet.

I have a real problem with this idea.  The keywords to my problem are
"rules", "good", "bad" and "unplanned".  Who sets the 'rules', who decides
which expirences are 'good' or 'bad'?  (and who's ganna make their cute
little jackboots)  If we plan experiences to develop children to fit into our
ideals how will they ever evolve, innovate or rebel.  Imagine if 50 years ago
someone had the same idea and planned your life so that you would develop the
ideology of the time (a good little christian boy); what makes you think we
know any better?  Some animals are born with the ability to walk, we learn it
from trial and error.. there's a reason for that.  The less you are
programmed (which is what 'planned experience' amounts to) the more adaptive,
innovative and creative you are.

How long does it take a child to 'pick up' language from listening to its
parents?  and how long does it take to teach a child a language at school?  

The difference between learning to speak and learning basic physics is that
speaking is all around us, it is tacit learning.  Physics, despite being all
around us, is not as obvious for children to simply 'pick up'.  The way to
accelerate learning is to put this information all around students and let
them take it in tacitly.  The toy of the future could be a holographic
projecting nano-assembler.  To a little kid it looks like a bunch of brightly
coloured balls that do weird thing when pushed together.  But the information
learned from using it (what structures are strong, which ones calapse, etc.)
will stay with them for the rest of their lives, not as something they
learned at school, or something they had programmed into them, but as
something obvious and easy, like the ability to speak.

I had to think about it for a while, but now I'm pretty sure I don't agree with
this.  All I had to do was reflect on some of my favorite stand-up comedy
routines, and many examples came to me that weren't puns, and which didn't have
anything to do with pain.  Here is but one example.

Norm McDonald once made fun of the winter olympic event known as the
"biathalon," which is a combination of cross-country skiing and rifle
marksmanship.  Ski, shoot, ski, shoot.  The humor Norm found in that was all
the other types of sports we might similarly make up.  We could, say, sprint
100 meters, and... fish.

No pain or puns.  Just absurdity and comic timing.

I have a hunch that if you come to a thorough understanding of this phenomenon
you will understand why your "Lorrey Drive" will not work.  I initiated a
thread on sci.physics last week about another momentum-conservation-violating
"space drive" which you had referred to a while back, and which is available
at the online IBM patent server.  It would be helpful for you to attempt to
understand why that device will not work, either.

The point you are missing is the existence of Coriolis forces when a mass
moves in a rotating reference frame; and further, that a "pivot point" can
experience forces in other than the radial direction.  In the case of the
swing, the pivot point where the swing is attached is itself pushed back and
forth, but being attached firmly to the Earth the motion is not noticeable.

Consider in particular the case where you are crouched in a swing, moving from
left to right, and you suddenly stand up as the swing goes through the vertical
position.  By conservation of angular momentum, you can see that your horizontal
velocity will increase.  But by conservation of linear momentum, some other
object must increase its velocity to the left to counter your increased
momentum to the right.  That object is the Earth, and the pivot point will feel
a force to the left as you stand.

Unfortunately, such companies would almsot certainly be torn apart by
IRS regulations concerning who is and is not considered an employee
for tax purposes. Operating as an independant contractor is highly
discouraged by the tax laws. Do too much work for one entity, and
suddenly both you and they will be in trouble with the IRS.

As someone who makes his living doing consulting work, I'm acutely
aware of the issues involved...

I do lots of interviewing, and frankly I'd love to see a world in
which we ended the idea of degrees. I've seen too many people who knew
what they were doing and had no degrees, and vice versa.

I rarely even am as concerned about what someone knows as I am with
their work habits and whether they can think. So few people can think
clearly about abstract problems that I'm willing to educate
half-educated employees who can think clearly much more than I'm
willing to hire someone who can do a narrow skilled kind of work but
who can't learn quickly or think well in unusual circumstances.

When someone goes to get a job in many creative fields, one actually
does bring a (literal) portfolio of one's work to prospective
employers, who examine it and make a decision based on it. I'm not
averse to seeing us return to such things.

On the other hand, we can have private organizations like the
Educational Testing Service construct such things without government
intervention. Such tests may in fact be useful for screening out
riff-raff prior to an interview process, but usually no objective
measure (like GPA or presence of a degree) is good for more than
screening anyway...

I'd say that the odds are very high that, with enough investment, this
would be possible without any massive technical breakthroughs.
HOWEVER, at the moment it would be damned expensive. For more on that,
see the bottom of the message.

The usual concept -- that of fusing egg cells or at least their
nucleii -- has been tried. It doesn't work.

Howver, the recent Scottish sheep cloning work leads to some hope in
this regard.

There are two parts required here -- conducting some sort
of artificial meiosis and recombination, and then getting the
resultant set of recombined genes into an ovum in such a way that you
start to get an embryo out of the process.

Now, I'm not sure how to do both of these, but we now know how to do
half of the problem for sure, and there is a possible way to do the
other half.

To do the recombination is fairly easy conceptually, although I don't
believe anyone has actually tried it in practice.

Although your chromosomes are usually floating about minding their own
business in an unravelled state, mitosis causes your chromosomes to
bunch up into nice easy parcels. With the aid of some fairly
conventional tools, it should be possible to physically extract
chromosome pairs from a cell in mid-mitosis, use enzymes to break
the centromeres, and extract one chromosome from each pair of a cell.

Then, given 23 chromosomes from you, and 23 from your partner, you
could conduct mix and match in the laboratory. Admittedly you don't
get crossover, but who cares? (As an aside, you could use this
technique to have a child of more than two parents -- even fourty six
parents.)

Now, the chromsomes have to be re-implanted in an appropriate somatic
cell so you can get growth and division so you have lots of cells for
the next step. Unfortunately, the one problem is that what you end up
with after nuclear reimplantation of the chromosomes isn't necessarily
a viable cell. To my knowledge, the experiment hasn't yet been done
(though it may have been). However, if you started with chromosomes
from two individuals from the same kind of somatic cell -- say
skeletal muscle cells -- and re-implanted into somatic cells of that
type from one of the individuals -- a viable cell might
result. Certainly getting this part to work is a matter for research,
but it isn't entirely outlandish to think that it could work.

Luckily, this is the only major problem. Given a cell of this type, we
know what the rest of the procedure has to be.

The other part of the problem is, of course, to turn the resultant
recombined cell into a viable embryo. Luckily, we've had a
breakthrough in this recently.  One could presumably use the Scottish
method to induce a quiescent state in the somatic cells resulting from
the previous step, and then use the resulting nucleii for nuclear
implantation into an egg cell donated by either you or your partner.

(I would suggest that you not use a third party's egg cell if you want
for whatever reason to retain the "family mitochondrial
DNA". Admittedly this is merely a sentimental consideration, but is
that not, in fact, what this whole operation is -- a sentimentally
based attachment to one's own DNA?)

I'd say that none of this is beyond the realm of the near-term
possible, but it is all, as I've noted, frightfully expensive. I would
suggest, however, that as there are large numbers of women with
similar desires, that large scale fundraising might be possible for a
privately funded research and development effort on this, and that if
the research properly funded and organized, solid results might be
possible in only a few years.

I would very seriously suggest that you might want to begin organizing
in this regard before the idiots ban all research in this area --
whether you have a partner in mind for this or not.

Just so, and I certainly do not appreciate the volumes of junk

        Sorry to burst your bubble, Danny, but in the last decade there has
been substantial evidence to prove that the remainder of Atlantis is an
island of Greece called Thera.  What the generally accepted theory amounts
to is that Atlantis was directly above a plate boundary in the
Mediterranean Sea; the island of Atlantis had a volcano in the center of
it.  There was a tectonic disturbance which triggered the eruption of the
volcano, as well as a large tsunami which virtually submerged the island
and the civilization... in effect, there was utter destruction.  The time
of these happenings is estimated to be around 1350 B.C.; there is
apparently an eyewitness account from Egypt in which a scribe detailed a
large "fire upon the water."  We all know that theories such as this are
hard to prove, but from the facts I have read on this situation, it seems
to be the most feasible and supportable... moreso than a pole shift.

        By the way, what does the topic of Atlantis have to do with
anything extropic?  Chances are, the Atlantean civilization could not have
been very advanced...judging by the lack of evidence of their existance.
As Forrest said, there are numerous other venues that deal with wildly
hypothetical "maybe" science than this mailing list.  Useless talk is the
worst pollutant: not only does it pollute the mind, it corrupts the concept
of knowledge.

This is all possible (and has been done here and there) with the current
corporate form as a legal entity. The problem is the cultural
assumptions used in the implementation of the organism which the
corporation legally describes. Most of these derive from feudalism.

Saw interesting PET scans in Science News. One of a person who learned

Tut, Tut....

I see nothing in what Rev. Madnys wrote which assumes that the act of
reading a book confers wholeness by itself. Now, the aphorism below
might be useful in the quest for wholeness:

"Be ever vigilant in knowing thy assumptions."

I tend to hope that the transhuman ideal includes being less screwed up.
We are learning more and more about redesign, and Nature isn't the most
logical designer around... AFAIK, Dilbert is in the wrong future here...

See my other posting on this. Photons may have hidden variables and know
they exist, but I don't know that. This is a kind of "Copenhagen"
approach to consciousness. If something cannot be tested, the simplest
assumption is that it does not exist. Communication is essential for
testability here. I suppose souls are conscious too, but I don't know
how to establish either souls or their awareness, as their very
definition include ineffability, which to me translates as "nyaah nyaah
nyaay, this is real and you can't say otherwise". Really useful, you
know?

Show me something better! The thing that the TT has is that it limits
the kind of communication to separate out factors such as what the
participants look like, and that said communication is linguistic. BTW,
all digital communication can be seen as linguistic.

An important point. Consciousness is indeed defined by how we see it!

As I said, let's hear better ones. I like simplicity, self reference and
TESTABILITY to be part of such definitions.

have fun!

Cerebral Palsy is an interface problem. What I am referring to is the
inate ability to have language at all. KoKo meets condition 1; it's
problematical whether KoKo can really meet condition 2. Saying "Koko
wants banana" does not meet condition 2. "Koko feel angry" is on the
edge. "Koko thinks Koko angry" probably meets condition 2. I don't know
if Koko ever said something whose topic is self reference.

That's why condition 2.

Go back and read condition 2. Self awareness by itself, without means of
communication, is not consciousness as defined above. My computer here
as I write this posting may be self-aware, but I have no way of
accessing this. The point is to create an operational definition which
can be subjected to experimental testing.

I believe a cruise missile meets your definition quite nicely. Will
drives it to its target. Exploding empowers it. Many religions state
attainment of Heaven as the ultimate self interested goal, so I guess it
will have to be a cruise missle from Iraq.... :-)

No... go read it again. It has to discuss its awareness of its
existence. Per your definition, even little Sojourner is arguably
self-aware. Is reporting sensory experience self awareness??

I once viewed Hoagland's video on the Mars face (and sundry other
topics, but mostly about the face). The more he talked, the less
believable it became. Various measurements were made from the face to a
number of less than distinctive features in the nearby landscape, and
then the kind of numerology one learns to associate with pyramidologists
appeared, "proving" the possibility of advanced civilizations, etc, etc,
etc. 

Sorry, folks, I trust my MEGO response as a sure fire bullshit detector.
Hasn't been wrong yet.....

Unfortunately, such companies would almsot certainly be torn apart by
IRS regulations concerning who is and is not considered an employee
for tax purposes. Operating as an independant contractor is highly
discouraged by the tax laws. Do too much work for one entity, and
suddenly both you and they will be in trouble with the IRS.

As someone who makes his living doing consulting work, I'm acutely
aware of the issues involved...

Dear Perry and other fellow Extropians,

I suspect that as business and education environments evolve, laws and
regulations which effect business and education will also evolve (though
not at the same speed) to meet the needs of the community. 

That's been my experience. I wouldn't worry about it too much.

Enjoy!!!

I think our disagreement is only a matter of emphasis. I feel that
the inovations (usually of a technical nature) drive the whole
process. In the case of downsizing, nearly all the analysis of
the phenomenon have centered on the resulting behavioral changes,
and not on the underlying technical change. It's true that
the behavior is interesting, but it typically lags far behind
the enabling technology because habits are hard to change. You
usually have to wait for the older generation to retire: look
at the ages of the folks who still have secretaries. One should
be able to predict organizational changes by looking at new
technology, but we don't do a good job of this. In essence, the PC
is automating a lot of management jobs out of existance. This trend
should have been predictable with the advent of the computer.
Instead, we worried about automation of productins jobs, which
mostly didn't happen: workers mostly just became a lot more
productive.

You mention that the PC is neither the beginning nor the end,
and you are quite correct. As a simple example, the typewriter
brought the secretary's job into existance, and the PC abolished
it. The computer revolution is accelerating, and will IMO lead
within the next 9 years to the development of an SI that will
change our current society beyond comprehension. This is an
extreme example of technology driving organizational change.
If unforseen factors prevent the SI development we will still
see radical organizatinal changes based on computers. Many of
the advantages of a large company disappear when each individual
can use a PC to do the jobs that were traditionally done by the
corporate infrastructure: billing, accounting, payroll, taxes,
purchasing, contracting, etc. These capabilities are automatable,
and this is what permits an individual to easily become a
contractor instead of an employee. With the advent of the Web,
other aspects of running a business become accsible to the
individual, such as advertizing, sales, customer support,
and marketing. It will take a while for society to learn
to use these new tools, but we should in theory be able
to predict some of the consequences.

Dear Dan and other fellow Extropians,

I think that we agree. What you say about a matter of emphasis is quite
valid from several points of view.

Actually, I prefer to perceive it as a matter of perspective, cause, and
effect rather than simply emphasis; but, I readily acknowledge that our
differences are probably quibbling.

Ultimately, I suspect that we will all be dealing with a lot of flat,
interactive, virtual organizations that provide a plethora of (hopefully
useful) goods and services. 

You can understand, however, that I'm still quite concerned with the
degree of social and economic interaction and security that would prevail
in such a society.

Again, we must understand the chicken and egg syndrome as it applies to
the interelationships between social, cultural, scientific and
technological change.

It's something that's a bit more complex than many of us would like to
consider. 

Shall we consider the "Big Picture."

Enjoy!!!

Whoa!  Very cool.  How did they determine which area was being used?  Just have
the people speak the particular language while they've got the scanner running?

The larynxes themselves are not fossilized, but the other bones put
constraints on the shape and directions of the air passages (especially once
you take into account muscles, which can often have their shapes and sizes
inferred from attachments).  This apparently leaves no room for a larynz
unless it folded back on itself in a peculiar way.  I think this is related
to Neanderthal's enormous nasal turbinates.  Also, the hyoid bone help shape
the larynx; I can't tell you whether Neanderthals lacked it or had a
different shape.

The point is still somewhat under dispute, because, as you surmise, it's hard
to be definitive about soft tissue when you just have bones.

The tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy - is not so dangerous to the
public welfare - as the apathy of a citizen in a democracy!

The success of a nation should be measured not by the number of its
millionaires, but by the absence of poverty!

The lunatics of today usually become the visionaries of tomorrow!

        Few things make me mad; I often get frustrated, but there is truly
very little that maddens me...one of the things that *does* make me mad
--even on a mailing list-- is insolence.

        It is in my opinion that one should always respect another and hold
him or her in high regard until he\she breaches that respect.  I also think
that one should respect another's beliefs or views to some extent...not
barring questioning the fundamental core values of that person's beliefs.
However, one thing that I always hope to see in every person I meet is the
acknowledgement of reason --*why* they do the things they do and believe
what they believe.  When I come across a person who *can't* or *doesn't*
acknowledge the reasons for their beliefs or actions, I cannot accurately
communicate with that person...it is almost futile for me to even try.  [As
many may have noticed, I'm skirting around the point to ensure that this
"rant" is not ad hominem.]

        Extropy is probably the broadest lifestyle that the words "belief
system" or "philosophy" can apply to.  This is because of the few mandatory
memes that make up the philosophy...these memes are so taken for granted
that they are almost taboo --particularly to those who have been familiar
with the philosophy for a considerable amount of time.  One of these few
mandatory memes is reason.  All extropians --or those who welcome extropy--
acknowledge their reasons for doing what they do and believing what they
believe: reason is essential to optimistic realism (as opposed to wishful
thinking).  With reason, all extropians --or those who welcome extropy--
look towards the future...times when they can kineticize human potential in
a progressive manner.

        When posts are made that insult the above memes (I can't think of a
better word), it insults each individual extropian...it is insulting each
extropian's way of life.  When claims are made that one is more extropian
than another, it breaches that respect which is ever so important.  When a
person does not possess the few mandatory memes mentioned above yet claims
to be an extropian, that is a disgrace to the lifestyle.  When one worships
mystical beliefs that are not provable and have no reason, then that person
should not call themselves extropian.  

        By ranting like this, I am extrapolating upon the way *I* live and
my perspectives.  I hope that I have not offended anyone by involuntarily
trespassing on the grounds of *their* perspectives.  If I have stepped on
any toes, please tell me so...it won't hurt me.

I've heard even more bizarre stories (a friend of mine was actually 
arrested in a similar situation but a pocket knife was found on him during 
the search...$200 fine and 1 year probation for carrying a concealed weapon 
on top of the 'interference'.  It would have taken an additional $500 in 
lawyer fees (on top of the $500 he paid) to appeal the sentence (with the 
additional hazard of possible jail time if the case was lost).  His lawyer 
quipped something about the judge 'must be having marital problems again'. 
 My friend thought the lawyer was joking but apparently sentences DO depend 
somewhat on the mental state of the presiding judge at the moment of 
sentencing.

(Yes I know, rare isolated cases....that is, until it happens to YOU.)

We've discussed what would have happened if it was a journalist as the 
'interferer'.  We concluded there would be no arrest and all information 
would have been given (especially if it was a TV crew).  Kinda sad.

I understand that police are now living in paranoia what with all the cop 
killings going on.  I do not understand the blatant hostility that police 
seem to exhibit more and more frequently.  I use to think that the 'Protect 
and Serve' posted on police vehicles was directed toward ME.  I now know it 
means to protect and serve the state (community), individuals are dangerous 
and untrustworthy.

Unfortunately humans do live in societies with laws and regulations 
enforced by a system in which they have next to no control over.

I wonder how such things as a life sentence would be determined/carried out 
IF in the future a consciousness could be uploaded into a matrix or 
biotechnology allowed a cybernetic life extension of century+.  It may be 
better to have a society in place able to deal with such things before such 
technology makes it possible.

It scares me at some of the things I've found out are 'illegal', and even 
more scared at what additional things you can be charged with.  'Ignorance 
of the law is no excuse'.  I wonder where that came from.  Of course it's 
an excuse!  If you'd known it was illegal you probably wouldn't have done 
it.  Blind justice doesn't mean reasonless justice.  (I wonder how many 
judges know ALL the laws in the jurisdiction they preside over...including 
those silly ones left over from over a hundred years ago that were never 
taken off the books?  I just saw a documentary where it once was illegal to 
take a bath in Boston.  The puritanical ethics there at the time determined 
one should concern oneself with spiritual purity and taking a bath was 
considered a concentration on matters of the flesh.  Funny, but the 
documentary never divulged if the law ever expired or was revoked.)

Well, as the saying goes, a free country 
would beat hell out of what we've got now.
And yet there's lots worse places--on average.

Nonetheless, I think Janet Reno would look right
at home in a green fedora and black leather coat.
She'd look even better in a glass booth in the Hague.
"I take full responsibility..."--riiiiiiiiight.

Allow me to recommend a book:

_Popular Legal Delusions_ by Mark Rollinson
ISBN: 0-9614303-2 ; First ed. 1992, Pub: Summertown 
Texts, Signal Mountain, TN

I think Laissez Faire Books still sells it,
marked down to $15 or so.

What bliss to be alive at such a time!  What astounding, crippling
stupidity in the world that this was not the lead story with screamer

details are scant or dubious; fair enough.  Still.)

You are arguing in a circle here.  You can't use your belief that they
are true to argue that they are true.  I already *know* that you believe
they are true - you've already told us that.  What I was asking for was
some sort of reasoning - not necessarily a 'proof', you understand, but
just your rationale.

I didn't say I don't believe them - I haven't really made up my mind on
the matter.  I used to believe it more than I do now.  But lately, I
have come to believe that psychedelics just give you a whole load of
what I call 'meaning hallucinations' - i.e. under their influence, your
brain generates all kinds of significances, meanings, etc., to try and
explain to itself what the fuck is going on.  Now perhaps *some* of
those meanings have some basis in reality, and perhaps even point to
some weird shit's being true.  But there's nothing in the experience
itself - nothing in *any* experience -  it seems to me, that guarantees
its own truth, that wears its truth on it's face, so to speak. 
Experiences must be matched against each other, tested against each
other, before you can hope to come close to the truth.

Now, I enjoy my experiences as a kind of 'trip', really just a sort of
roller coaster ride, in which I get all sorts of notions.  I don't take
any of them seriously *at the time*; if any of them stand out, I note
them for when I'm straight, and test them when I'm straight, against my
accumulated experience, and the accumulated, tested  experience of
humanity in general (science).

I'm not totally hostile to such notions as you put forth.  In fact, one
of my favourites (going back to the McKenna thing) is the notion that
psylocybin mushrooms are a kind of travelling alien entity.  It kind of
makes sense in an Extropian context, that genuine ETs might not look at
all like what we would expect them to look like, and their technology
might appear incomprehensible to us.  In an Extropian context, you could
say that perhaps psychedelic mushrooms are a Power!

My worry was that you just seem to be a wee bit hostile to, and
uncomprehending of, science.  You see, it's not that scientists are
trying to spoil anything or get one over on you, it's that they want to
get things right, and the best way to do that is to test, criticise, and
test again. This may *seem* destructive, but in the end, it is
destructive only of falsehood.

EVIDENCE OF AN UNUSUAL MASSIVE GALAXY CLUSTER
Gravitational lensing is the bending of light and other radiation
by a massive gravitational entity such as a star, a black hole, a
galaxy, or a cluster of galaxies. The effect is predicted by
Einstein's Theory of Relativity and was first detected during a
total solar eclipse by Eddington in 1919. The first example of
gravitational lensing of light from a quasar was discovered in
1979. The result of gravitational lensing is the production of
multiple images of the lensed object. Since the radiation
signature of every object in the sky is about as unique as a
fingerprint, when one sees a small group of nearby images with
identical radiation signatures, one concludes these are multiple
images of a single entity produced by an intervening gravita-
tional lens. This is the basis for a report this week by M.
Hattori et al (various installations in DE, JP, US) concerning
the gravitational lensing of a distant quasar (redshift parameter
z=3.27). What they have deduced from the multiple-image quasar
data is the existence of a massive galactic cluster gravitational
lens intervening between the quasar and Earth. But when one looks
for the cluster one finds only the x-ray evidence of it without
the expected luminosity of galaxies in a cluster. The conclusion
is that this lens is indeed a massive cluster of galaxies at
redshift z=1 [corresponding to approximately 3 x 10exp(10) light
years], but a cluster in which most galaxies are dark. This dark
cluster of galaxies also contains a large amount of iron. It is
apparently the most distant galactic cluster discovered in x-rays
thus far, and the authors suggest it may be a new type of
astronomical object that will require some revision of current
theoretical models of the structure and history of galactic
clusters. (Nature 10 July)

ANALYSIS SUGGESTS SAN ANDREAS FAULT MAY BE IN A CRITICAL STATE
Geophysical faulting is a break in rock structure that occurs
when pressures in the Earth's crust are strong enough to cause
fracture and displacement. In some faults the movement is
vertical (thrust faulting), causing one side to be pushed above
the other, in others the displacement is horizontal. Earthquakes
usually occur at fault lines, and the relationship between the
occurrence of earthquakes and existing faults is for obvious
reasons an important area of research. The present consensus
theory of earthquakes is the elastic rebound theory in which
earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of shear strain
resulting from fault slip following years of slow strain
accumulation. In other words, what we call an earthquake is the
result of an abrupt adjustment of accumulated strain forces
produced by a discontinuity in the crust. Among the countries
with a significant interest in seismology (the study of
earthquakes) are China and the U.S., since both countries have
experienced devastating earthquakes in the past. This week there
is a report by Chi-yuen Wang and Yongen Cai (University of
California Berkeley CA US, and Peking University CN) of a model
analysis of the response of the California San Andreas fault to
regional compression. The authors conclude that regional stresses
resulting from crust plate convergence and thrust faulting in the
Coastal Ranges could trigger major earthquakes on the San Andreas
fault. The far from trivial intertext here is the collaboration
between China and the U.S. in the study of the seismology of
California. (Nature 10 July)

NEW PROBE OF ATOMIC NUCLEUS PROTON-PROTON INTERACTIONS
A quark is a hypothetical fundamental particle, having charges
whose magnitudes are one-third or two-thirds of the electron
charge, and from which the elementary particles may in theory be
constructed. The quark model of the atomic nucleus, independently
proposed by Gell-Man and Zweig in 1964, has now had 33 years to
establish itself. The current view among nuclear physicists is as
follows: each nucleus contains a population of protons and
neutrons, collectively known as nucleons, as well as a host of
other particles that bind the nucleons together. Each nucleon, in
turn, is made up of three quarks bound by what is called the
strong nuclear force. (Physicists now recognize four fundamental
forces: gravity, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear
force, and the strong nuclear force.) The quark model is just
that, a model, and if the model has lasted for more than 30 years
it is because with it one can explain in a consistent manner the
results of laboratory experiments involving the collisions of
particles with atomic nuclei. But no quarks have ever been
isolated, and they remain theoretical constructs. Still, if
quarks do exist, if nucleons are indeed composed of more
fundamental entities, there are always new strategies to be used
in the laboratory to examine the interaction of nucleons with the
hope of revealing their internal structures. Two weeks ago Gerco
Onderwater et al (Netherlands National Institute for Nuclear and
High-Energy Physics, Amsterdam NL) reported experimental results
that have been called by other physicists "a fundamental
milestone in the understanding of nuclear structure." In brief,
what the Dutch team has done is to knock a pair of protons out of
a nucleus at the moment when the proton-proton interactions are
at their most intense, thus providing a method to reveal the
intimate relationships between nucleons. The experiment was
designed to catch two protons at a time they were so close their
quark cores would be touching. Nuclear physicists are now hopeful
that with such a method the mysteries of nucleons may soon be
solved. (Physical Review Letters 30 June)

FIRST ANALYSIS OF DNA FROM A NEANDERTHAL BONE
About 10 kilometers east of Dusseldorf in Germany, in the valley
of the Dussel, there is a little town called Neander. One hundred
and forty-one years ago, in the summer of 1856, some workmen
broke into a cave to get at the limestone inside and discovered a
set of ancient bones. Most of the bones were smashed to bits by
the workmen, but some of the bones, including part of the skull,
survived, and the skeleton was soon recognized by anthropologists
as belonging to an ancient race of men who came to be known as
the Neanderthals. A Neanderthal fossil had actually been
discovered some years earlier in Gibraltar, but not recognized as
such. Neanderthal-like fossils have also been found in France,
Spain, Italy, Yugoslavia, Iraq, China, Java, and Israel. For more
than a century, one of the central questions in paleoanthropology
has been whether modern man evolved from this race -- or was the
Neanderthal a separate branch that became extinct? Until
recently, the primary laboratory method of investigation of such
a question was analysis of the morphology of bone fragments. This
week, the field of paleoanthropology has apparently crossed an
important watershed, as M. Krings et al (University of Munich,
DE; Pennsylvania State University, US) report the first analysis
of DNA from an extinct human, in this case DNA extracted from the
actual Neanderthal skeleton found near Dusseldorf in 1856. The
key to the investigation was the analysis of mitochondrial rather
than nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is usually present in
concentrations two or three orders of magnitude greater than
nuclear DNA, and they were able to find enough of it still intact
to amplify with the PCR technique and piece together a total DNA
sequence of 379 base pairs. Comparison of this sequence with
contemporary human sequences leads to the conclusion that
Neanderthal and modern man are separate evolutionary lines, and
that the latter did not evolve from the former. The work will
have to be replicated with other Neanderthal fossils, but most
paleoanthropologists are excited by the results and expect them
to be confirmed. The technology of evolutionary paleoanthropology
has evidently now progressed from caliper measurements of bones
to measurements of bone DNA fragments. (Cell 11 July)

AN INTERESTING CASE OF ANT-PLANT MUTUALISM
In biology, symbiosis is an intimate and protracted association
of individuals of different species, and mutualism is a type of
symbiosis in which both participants receive benefits from the
association. An intriguing mutualism is that between ants and
Acacia trees. In East Africa, one finds Acacia trees that are
"ant-guarded": the ants live on the trees inside modified thorns
(pseudogalls), patrol the branches, and attack any insect or
vertebrate herbivore, thus protecting the plant, but also
preserving the plant for the use of the ant. But this plant
requires cross-pollination by visiting insects in order to
reproduce, and what one observes is that during the pollination
periods the ant-guards essentially remain in the guard-house and
cross-pollination by visiting insects proceeds without
difficulty. Which of course provokes the question of what are the
signals involved in this delicate bit of cooperative maneuvering?
This week P. G. Willmer and G. N. Stone (University of St.
Andrews, UK; Oxford University, UK) report that during the
pollination period, the young Acacia flowers apparently release a
volatile chemical that deters the ant-guards. The ants thus
patrol before and after pollination, but not during the
pollination period itself. (Nature 10 July)

PATHOGENIC ASPECTS OF HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL DNA
One of the more remarkable structures found in eukaryote cells
(cells that have internal membrane-bound organelles such as a
nucleus) is the mitochondrion. An organic chemist confronting for
the first time the exquisite catalytic polymer machinery in the
mitochondrion cannot be faulted for experiencing vertigo. Each
mitochondrion, and there can be hundreds in each living eukaryote
cell, is involved in the synthesis of high-energy phosphate
compounds absolutely essential to the viability of the cell and
its replication, and in human mitochondria it is all done with 13
different proteins and 24 different RNA molecules, all coded for
by the mitochondrion's own self-replicating DNA. Which leads us
to the second aspect of this biological wonder: all mitochondria
are apparently the relics of primitive organisms that in the
early era of the evolution of life were incorporated and coopted
into eukaryotes. They have become part of the eukaryote, dividing
when the eukaryote cell divides, replicating their own DNA, and
thus passing as partners from one cell generation to the next.
Mitochondrial genes were discovered only in 1963. And our
knowledge of the pathological effects of mutations in mito-
chondrial genes begins only in 1988. Most of these pathologies
are quite special, but this month Douglas C. Wallace (Emory
University, US), who in 1988 was the first to trace a specific
disease to an inherited mutation in a mitochondrial gene,
presents his view that defects (some of them perhaps preventable)
in mitochondrial genes may also be involved in common medical
conditions such as aging and heart disease. The first decade of
the study of mitochondrial pathology is not yet finished, but we
know enough now to expect the decades ahead will reveal signif-
icant new insights into both the pathology and molecular biology
of these remarkable structures. (Scientific American August 1997)

A RECOMBINANT GENE THERAPY FOR HUMAN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
A cytokine is any substance that promotes cell growth and cell
division. Certain cytokines are endogenous, and need to be
controlled by cell regulatory mechanisms. When these mechanisms
fail, endogenous cytokines may be implicated in serious human
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where apparently
deregulated cytokines cause the inflammatory response that
produces the symptoms. As a promoter of cell growth and division,
a cytokine acts as a messenger to cells, and the transmission of
the message requires a binding of the cytokine molecule to a
cytokine-specific receptor on the cell surface. This receptor is
either a protein or a protein complex or a part of a protein, and
one would expect that if we could synthesize the receptor and
introduce the synthesized product into the extracellular fluid,
the cytokine for which this receptor is specific would bind to
the receptor and be prevented from delivering its chemical signal
to the cells. Test-tube synthesis of most complex proteins
produced by biological cells is not yet possible, but what one
can do, after calculating the DNA code for the active part of the
receptor protein, is incorporate the necessary DNA sequence into
the genome of some mammalian cell line, and have these cells act
as chemical factories to produce the cytokine receptor that we
are unable to synthesize otherwise. We then gather the factory
product, administer it to the patient, and expect the cytokine
receptor to bind its specific cytokine in extracellular fluid and
thus reverse the course of the disease. This is essentially what
"recombinant gene therapy" is all about. It is a field less than
a decade old, and like all fields involving clinical medicine, it
moves slowly because procedures that involve human patients must
be carefully developed. This week, Larry W. Moreland et al (12
authors at various installations, US) report the successful
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with a recombinant human
cytokine receptor complex produced by the method outlined above.
It is a beginning. Like all treatments involving recombinant gene
therapy, much work needs to be done. But the path ahead is clear,
and there is an expectation of important results from this area
of clinical medicine. (New England Journal of Medicine 17 July)

A RESURGENCE IN CUBA OF A DANGEROUS MOSQUITO
Dengue is a human disease caused by a virus, which in turn is
transmitted by a mosquito (Aedes aegypti) through a mosquito
bite. In some place, the disease may be called "breakbone fever"
or "dandy Fever". The disease is endemic throughout the tropics
and subtropics, and in adults an attack of dengue fever usually
lasts several weeks and then it passes. There is a variant,
however, that infects children, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and
this has a mortality rate of as much as 30%, most deaths
occurring in infants less than a year old. Dengue hemorrhagic
fever is prevalent in Southeast Asia, China, and Cuba. An
important fact about the disease vector, the mosquito Aedes
aegypti, is that it likes to breed around human dwellings and in
man-made containers. Which leads to the expectation that dengue
could be eradicated by a concerted effort to eliminate containers
and other man-made debris used by the breeding mosquito. Such
concerted efforts have been underway now for 50 years, and
apparently they have all failed and the mosquito Aedes aegypti
has been victorious. This week there is a report of a serious
outbreak of dengue in Santiago, Cuba, with estimates of the
number of cases as high as 30,000. (Science 11 July)

Last year I got a chance to hear from the director of Los Alamos Nat'l Lab.
 I asked him if the lab was working on any weapons with a yield substantially
greater than thermonuclear weapons.  His response was, "I cannot comment on
that at this time."  After the seminar, one of our professors asked him,
"Haven't you manufactured some anti-matter?"  The director refused to answer.

I take it that means that it exists in a national laboratory, but they have
not yet acknowledged its existence.  What is to be done with it is another
matter entirely.

This is an excellent point.  Estimates of the odds are almost a self-
fulfilling prophecy; if everyone on the planet thinks, "yeah, sure, and
pigs might fly!" then cryonics would get resource-starved and its odds of
political and technological success go to nil. If everyone on the planet
thinks, "whoop de do, we CAN live forever!", we'd see early revivals within 
the millenium. Compared with a moon landing, cryonics is not exactly rocket
science :-)

And then there's the plausibility of Everett's multi-worlds interpretation
of QM; if there's any chance that cryonics might work for you, then, Everett
being on the mark, a plethora of you will make it. Why should you care
if you don't survive in a millionty-billionty other universes, so long as you're fat and happy in this one? 

Any odds are better than sods.

Subject: Estimating the probability of success of cryonics
Date: Sat, 19 Jul 1997 14:19:23 PDT

I tried to post this a few days ago, but it seems not to have made it.
-----------------------------

Periodically, someone posts an analysis of the form

Probability of success =

    probability of event 1 x
    probability of event 2 x
        .
        .
        .
    probability of event n

While this approach is entirely reasonable in the abstract, it
is only valid when the different events are independent.  Usually,
however, the events listed are correlated in various ways, resulting
in a serious error in the overall estimate.

For example, if two events are:

      government allows revival
and
      not put in zoo

we see that there is a likely correlation.  If, for example, after the
successful revival of people in cryonic suspension the Supreme Court
rules that they have the same rights they had prior to suspension,
then the government would be more likely to block attempts to put
you in a zoo.

Similarly, the items

      will awake without dire pain
and
      my cryonics organization is willing to revive me

are also correlated.  If there is a significant probability of waking
in dire pain, the cryonics organization will likely conclude that
further research is required and that those in suspension should not be
revived until the problem of dire pain is solved.

My experience is that lists with more than three or four items suffer
from severe correlations, which invalidates the simple multiplicative
estimate of the total probability of success.

In general, cryonics will fail only if:

1)  Information theoretic death occurs at some point in time
2)  Technologies that are feasible in principle are never applied
    in practice.

In addition, it is theoretically possible that cryonics could be a
technical success but would still be undesired if, on waking, you
found that being dead was preferable to being alive.  We could
therefore add a third item:

3)  I don't like the result.

Even this short list suffers from correlations.  For example,
unsatisfactory results (item 3) could be caused by failure to
apply appropriate methods (item 2).

Some lower animals, like the Antarctic nematode, can be frozen to liquid
nitrogen temperatures, rewarmed, and go about their business just fine. 
But these animals are particularly adapted to the cold.  No mammal has been
frozen and revived; we don't have the technology today to repair freezing
damage.

This is not a test of whether cryonics works, of course.  Cryonics works if
the patient's condition is stabilized in a state that *future* technology
can repair.  Tests of this are currently underway -- check back again in
100 years or so to see how these tests come out!

There is much cause for optimism, though: humans and other animals have
been successfully cooled to near-freezing temperatures, their blood washed
out and replaced with a perfusate solution, and restored to normal life and
health (do lit searches on "deep hypothermic surgery").  And the freezing
procedures used appear to preserve brain structures in good order, which is
what would be required (at a minimum) for successful repair.

>Also, what's the difference between cryonics and cryogenics.

"Cryogenics" is an incorrect term for cryonics which is often used by the
media to let you know that they really haven't done any research into the
topic at all.  The same applies to laypeople as well, of course -- if
someone tells you they're convinced cryogenics can't work, then you can
tell immediately that they actually know nothing about it.  Rather
convenient, really...

Afaik the processes yielding antimatter are low-yield (not in the warhear 
sense), and you can't store antimatter in quantities, anyway. This is 
something reserved for future transhuman physics, an energy conserve to 
drive tiny interstellar von Neumann probes e.g. via light sails, of the 
Forward drive.

Doesn't seem likely. How does one contain mg chunks of condensed 
antimatter? UHV maglev containment sure doesn't suffice.

If all goes well with my flight arrangements, and if I can find this 
mysterious commuter train from San Francisco into Palo Alto, I should 
arrive in Palo Alto around 8:30.  

For us Easterners, that's a prime time for dinner. Is anyone else 
arriving that night who wants to get together?

I hate to be mean, but...

That is a remarkably naive statement even for the "new" extropians
list, and given postings here about about beef getting caught in your
stomach and planets flipping over because of all the other planets
being in some special position, etc., thats saying quite a bit.

Bureaucrats do not shift their positions to accomodate the needs of
the community. They change things to accomodate THEIR needs, which are
usually diametrically opposed to those of the surrounding
community. Business is becoming more regulated every day, not less,
and I've seen no evidence of business regulation generally evolving to
meet anyone's needs except for the need of government bureaucracies to
grow and increase their own funding.

Your comment betrays a remarkable lack of connection to the real world.

I realize I should probably phrase that more diplomatically, be kindly
and considerate, etc., but I'm just not in the mood.

[Boy, I long for the old days on this list. Right now, it appears that
the tolerance for uncritical thinking is at an all time high. What
happened to the extropians list where anti-statist, hard science
backed discussion was the norm?]

Find a Physics book and look up 'forced simple harmonic motion'. It's just
a matter of solving a pretty simple differential equation, and common in
Physics.

Beer seems to be drug of choice in the UK... but in one of his magazine 
articles from the sixties Hunter S. Thompson mentioned that many of the 
Haight-Ashbury hippies worked as computer programmers. I don't have the

Sorry, I must have lost or accidentally deleted the second paragraph of my

Actually it wasn't the absolute success rate they were quoting, but that
laser-guided bombs were no more effective than old unguided bombs and far
more expensive. They weren't impressed with cruise missiles, either,
though the success rate was classified out. I think it was a GAO report. 

I guess this didn't make any US newspapers? It merited a quarter-page or
so in all the 'quality' newspapers in the UK. Interesting example of media

(i.e. from current STM/solvated (bio)chemistry to dry, rigid
machine-phase systems). Fortunately, there might a comparatively
simple way to widen that bottleneck.

Jerry March, "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 3rd ed. John Wiley &
Sons (1985), pp. 961-962 says (copious references omitted): "It
was mentioned above that even alkanes undergo Wagner-Meerwein
rearragements if treated with with Lewis acids and a small
amount of initiator. An interesting application of this reaction
is the conversion of trycyclic molecules to adamantane and its
derivatives. It has been found that _all_ tricyclic alkanes
containing 10 carbons are converted to adamantane by treatment
with a Lewis acids such as AlCl_3. If the substrate contains
more than 10 carbons, alkyl-substituted adamantanes are
produced. Some examples are [ Fig: tetramethyladamantane from
norbornene + cyclic polyenes Diels-Alder adducts and diamantane
from hydrogenated annelated aromates ]. If 14 or more carbons
are present the product may be diamantane or a substituted
diamantane. These reactions are successful because of the high
thermodynamic stability of adamantane, diamantane, and similiar
diamond-like molecules. The most stable of a set of C_nH_m
isomers (called the stabilomer) will be the end product if the
reaction reaches equilibrium. Best yields are obtained by the
use of "sludge" catalysts (i.e. a mixture of AlX_3 and t-butyl
bromide or sec-butyl bromide) or by passing the substrate in the
gas phase through a tube containing a chlorinated
platinum-alumina catalyst. Though it is certain that these
adamantane-forming reactions take place by nucleophilic 1,2
shifts, the exact pathways are not easy to unravel because of
their complexity. Treatment of adamantane-2-14^C with AlCl_3
results in total carbon scrambling on a statistical basis".

Obviously, small carbon diamondoids are trivial to obtain in
good yields (the almost-forgotten adamantane rush preceded that
of the buckball craze decades before). Through this is not
mentioned in literature, I guess large branched/cycled
carbohydrogens rearrange to (defect-rich, but who cares)
diamondoids easily enough. A statistical small carbon cluster
synthesis is therefore easy to accomplish. A random CAS
(Chemical AbstracS) inquiry from years ago said that
quantitative polyfluorination of adamantane is easy to
accomplish by an electrochemical process (anodical fluorination
of adamantane in anhydrous HF).

Carbon-carbon bond formation via Wurtz-class metalloorganyles
(Grignard, lithium, copper, or whatever) reactions is a
time-honoured technique of organic synthesis.

Manipulative proximal probe spectroscopy and GA solution of the
knapsack problem are the new pungent spices in the statistical
pot.

A possible scenario would involve cooking a wild mixture of
different polycyclic alkanes at high temperatures
(alternatively, in the gas phase), then a flash chromatography
of the quenched mess to get rid of the coarsest muck. Using de
novo designed antibody affinity columns, an arbitrarily precise
separation stage could ensue. Alternatively, halogenated and/or
metallated adamantanes could be spread out on HOPG tablets at
cryo UHV conditions, and be mapped via a STM/SPM scan. Those 3d
puzzle pieces best fitting the virtual machinery mold (which
requires a _hefty_ (GA) crunch run), and then be assembled via
manipulative proximal probe microscopy. Once in place, they
crosslink by multiple C-C instantly, irreversibly. (Using
phlegmatized surface groups, this should be worthwhile to try
even in solvated phase, xref autoassembly via complementary
surfaces).

By this means, a first generation of diamondoid devices could be
assembled. If they are stiff enough to avoid progressive defect
runaway at autoreplication, the bootstrap bottleneck is thus
shattered to pieces.

modeling star in above speculative scenario, synthetic chemistry

Much as I hate to defend the socialists, the recent crash was the result
of a test of the remote *manual* docking system. The automated system has
worked well (or at least safely) for years, but the Russian space program
can no longer afford to buy the automatic docking units. Hence if Mir
stays in space they will soon have to rely on this manual system for all

That "all information is not of equal value" implies meaning, or
semantics.  The AIC and "depth" measures are strictly syntactic. 
Semantics basically involves categorization and context.  

In the most general terms, it seems to me that complexity could be
measured by the number of different functional relationships a system
can maintain, and might further be weighted by the number of functions
it can perform simultaneously.

As for getting a handle on this mathematically, set theory seems to be
helpful for analyzing relationships between things other than numbers.
You might enjoy Luis Rochas essay "Evidence Sets: Contextual
Categories" at http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~rocha/es_contx.html  which
describes how 
<Evidence Sets are set formalisms which extend fuzzy sets and interval
valued fuzzy sets through the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DST)
[and are] well positioned to model human linguistic categorization
processes because they offer a mechanism to explicitly contextualize
uncertainty. Each of the graded intervals of membership is associated
with a particular context, which can then be reduced or eliminated as
more evidence is gained through an extended theory of approximate
reasoning or through the incorporation of more knowledge into the
model by pragmatic, evolutionary, strategies.>

JKC:
<I also think it would be a mistake to equate complexity with virtue,
in fact all things being equal, the opposite is true. A simple program
is better than a complex one that does the same thing. A simple
ecosystem such as a temperate forest of oaks and conifers is more
resilient than a very complex one like a tropical rain forest.>

The temperate forest is more resilient than the tropical forest by
whose measure (survivability against current human agricultural
practices?)  What is "the same thing" that these two types of forests
do (provide a green coloring on the map?)  Im sure ecologists have
better measures of forest complexity, Im just not familiar with them.

As for programs: I can write a terse program with lots of hardcoded
constants and clever optimized algorithms that is simpler than another
program performing the same fixed function, and probably much more
efficient in its execution speed; but, the more complex program, which
might have much more parameterization and be more data-driven by
looking up values in external files, is going to be more flexible and
possibly more maintainable.

Simplicity IS virtuous at a certain level of abstraction and
operation, but monotonic functions usually tend to get assembled (or
gobbled up) into more complex organizations. 

Bruce Edmonds argues in his "What is Complexity?" essay at
http://www.fmb.mmu.ac.uk/~bruce/evolcomp/evolcomp.txt
that 
<Complexity . . . is unlikely to have any useful value as applied to
"real" objects or systems.  Further that even relativising it to an
observer has problems. It is proposed that complexity can usefully be
applied only to constructions within a given language. It is argued
that complexity is usefully differentiated from the concepts of size,
ignorance, variety, minimum description length and order. A definition
of complexity is proposed which can be summarised as "that property of
a language expression which makes it difficult to formulate its
overall behaviour even when given almost complete information about
its atomic components and their inter-relations." Some of the
consequences of this definition are discussed.>

Perhaps you are really saying, as Edmonds put it, that "the reduction
in complexity of our interaction with any part of reality is an
essential component of our existence"; or, the more simplicity we can
achieve in our interactions the more fit we will be (Kauffmans
"number of conflicting constraints" notion of complexity).  But, its
also wise to remember that this makes us more dependent on all these
black boxes or infrastructure that weve built to simplify things
for us.

I think you mean Britain... and no, not really, though it has a hodgepodge

'bill of rights' from 1689, but most of that's ignored by now; there was
no restriction on later laws restricting those rights. That's at

Interesting to see which rights they considered valuable in those days,
compared to today. In a couple of cases (e.g. 'cruel and unusual

Rights, but in that case the founders had enough sense to prohibit future

Unless you find some new laws of physics, your will use the energy
to power a reaction drive, sending photons in one direction and
your ship in the other. You will not exceed the speed of light.
Therefore, you cannot reach Pluto in less than 39 hours (as I recall.)

If you intend to use the energy to accelerate to .5c and then
decelerate,
your matter-antimatter drive will need to to use twice the mass of
the ship. That's a lot of antimatter. Production of that amount
of antimatter will take several orders of magnitude more energy than
the human race has generated in all of history.

Conclusion: find some new laws of physics.

Aha... this may explain our difference of opinion. You're talking purely
about the amount of time required for maintenance when it's neccesary,
whereas I'm talking about the frequency of maintenance and the frequency
of failures. 

Sure, major maintenance on a more complex plane is going to be more
complex and time-consuming, but from what I remember Bach's books he'd get
up in the morning for an hour or two of maintenance on his biplane and
even then every few weeks the engine would fail for some reason and he'd
have to make an emergency landing. In comparison, he'd jump into his jet
(T-38?) to fly between Florida and California with only a cursory
preflight check; and it never crashed. In both cases they had major
maintenance every once in a while, which would be much more work for the
jet than the biplane. 

So complexity may increase the effort required to maintain an aircraft,
but has little bearing on reliability. And since much of that maintenance
involves taking things off, looking at them, and putting them back on,
built-in nanosensors could eliminate most of that.

You missed the point; the shield is just supposed to be a big hunk of junk
which flies along in front of your ship and erodes when hit. But you're
right; you would have problems holding it in place while braking.  I guess
you'd just rely on the exhaust from your engines vaporising anything small
before it hit you; if you hit anything big you're dead anyway, shield or
no shield.

Can you cite a mission number, because I don't remember that. I have vague
memories of coming back early because of a blocked water dump valve, but
that was a problem because the fuel cells need to dump water overboard,
not because it affected the toilet.

Sure, but that's due to government designs, not an inherent problem with
spacecraft (BTW, wasn't the last shuttle flight over two weeks?). And it
still doesn't affect the fact that the majority of maintenance is fixed
regardless of flight time. If a fuel cell breaks or a valve blocks up you
just tear it out and fit a new one; that may require a few hours of
overtime, but it's nothing compared to overhauling the engines.

If I understood this message, it is possible to use fairly
standard "traditional" chemical techniques to create
"adamintine" particles in bulk. Adamintine is approximately
the same as diamondoid. Thus, you end up with a large
collection of unsorted, imperfect diamondiod "Lego blocks"
that are we may be able to sort and assemble using STM
technology. Is this correct?

If so, I still don't understand how the STM can assemble
these things. I can see how it might select a "block" of
the proper type, orient it, and move it into proximity to
the work in progress, but I don't see how to snap the
block into place. Is this so grossly oversimplified
as to be meaningless?

Yes, I was amazed when I turned on my television set after arriving
from a net-less weekend in northern Sweden and seeing the artificial
womb. This is important news, although previous work along the same
lines have been done (including at the Roslin institute).

Together with in vitro fertilization and cloning this technology
allows us (in theory) to completely separate sex from reproduction. 

As transhumanists, now is our chance to use the chock value of this
news (together with the relative news drought of the summer) to start
some serious debate about the definition of humanity and what destiny
we want to seek as a (or several) species.

I wonder, what exactly is extropian?  And to be extropian, do you have to
know what an extropian is or does, or do you just have to want to increase
your personal extropy?  And if that is so, then surely everyone is extropian,
someone with a defeatist attitude has just built that attitude on top of a
nice clean extropian foundation.  After all, if we didn't want to improve
ourselves we'd all be primates.

Sigh. It seems like I'm constantly frustrated by linguistic problems
of getting my point across in this debate. Well, labor improbus omnia
vincit:

We grow as humans by our various experiences. Some experiences are
trivial and do not help much (e.g. making my bed this morning), some
are slightly useful (e.g. I just learnt the hard way never to put a
soft drink bottle in the fridge over a weekend), some are important
to us (e.g. driving with my brother I learned this weekend that I
actually *like* the northern swedish countryside) and some are truly
transforming experiences (e.g. understanding and proving my first
geometric theorem). 

Most of these experiences occur more or less by chance - I certainly
didn't plan any of the above experiences except making my bed. Over
our lifetimes we accumulate experience and hopefully develop into
true humans (and transhumans); most of the truly well developed
people I know or have read of have lived long and eventful lives,
with both tragedies and triumphs.

I don't think it is possible or desirable to remove this accumulation
of experiences into personal growth, but it seems to me that at
present we have not attempted to support it. Some people (IMHO far
too few) seek out experiences since they know they will grow from
them (this was one of the reasons I started with ninjutsu), but we do
not yet have a "science/art of personal growth". This is what I want
to look into.

For example, I know I'm still fairly young and naive, and that my
view of the world is likely a bit unrealistically positive. While
I can intellectually understand this, it won't change my underlying
mental structures, personality and behavior much. Many people learn
this the hard way: personal disasters rob them of their naivity, and
their over-optimistic views are destroyed by traumatic events;
afterwards there is a complicated struggle to develop a more mature
mental model of the world, which many people fail (becoming depressed
or cynical). Is there really no better way than to experience painful
loss to develop a more mature worldview, a lesson which ought to be
among the earliest for a long lived transhuman? In what ways can we
make the personal growth and maturation process more efficient, less
painful and more transhuman?

No. First, the statue was *much* too young to relate to the origin of
humanity (the fact that there is an airport today near some runic
stones doesn't mean the vikings had air travel :-). Second, that
people have used psychotropic drugs doesn't show that they have
affected our evolution, just that people have known about them for a 
long time.

Something that might be used to support (or falsify) McKenna's theory
is to compare societies where psychotropic drugs have been used with
societies where they have been rare or not used, and see which have
had the fastest memetic evolution. As a suggestion, what about
comparing Greece and Rome (fairly non-psychotropic as far as I know)
with India (some use, at least) and the indian civilizations?
According to McKenna the amount of novelty among the Atztecs would
have been larger than among the Greeks.

The energy is "put in" as gravitational potential.  Imagine standing on
the swing.  Through most of the stroke you crouch, but when you reach
the apex of the swing, you stand up.  At that point, you have used to
muscles of your legs to raise your center of gravity above where the
swing put it.  As you crouch again on the downswing, you will arrive a
little bit higher on the other side than you would if you hadn't done
that maneuver, and of course when you get there, you'll stand up again
adding yet more gravitational potential.

I think nobody knows yet. But my bet is on a reorganization of
consciousness == brain activity patterns. Maybe a self-supporting
mental pattern is set up, and it becomes "real" to the experiencer (a
bit like how novel characters can start to act against their author).

Yes, it is intriguing. One theory I have is that the child perceptual
system is not yet fully developed, and at first just contains the
"basics" of perception with comparatively little interpretation and
further processing. This means a lot of computational resources are
free, and can sustain eidetic imagery. As the children grow up,
neurons get recruited into cellular assemblies coding for
interpretation, experiences and interconnections, and the eidetic
imagery gets lost due to interference from our higher level systems. 
We don't see the world as we did as children, we see a lot of
concepts.  This might also explain idiot savants - they lack many of
the interfering (but normally very useful) higher level systems, and
their minds can devote themselves to single tasks.

Rather 9 days or weeks (see Robert Forward's publications in the
field). The important problem is of course to manufacture enough for
use as fuel - at CERN they just created nine antihydrogen atoms,
which is obviously insignificant. I have some papers found on the net
at http://antimatter.phys.psu.edu/:

Antiproton-Catalyzed Microfission/Fusion Propulsion Systems for
Exploration of the Outer Solar System and Beyond, by R.A. Lewis et al

Productionand Trapping of Antimatter for Space Propulsion
Applications, by Holzscheiter et al. 

The first paper suggests that 10-1000 nanograms of antimatter might
be enough to use for catalyzed microfusion/fission. The second
discusses how to gather this amount and store it.

Yes, but no need to confine to SPM tech for sorting and assembly.
Sorting may be via traditional chromatography, distillation, etc.
Positioning can also be done (currently to less than 10 nm) via optical
funneling ("The Optical Reactor") - a new method somewhat akin to my 
"Optical Assembler".
Sorted (or unsorted, depending on the specificity of the receptor)
"blocks" might also be attached to chemical receptors incorporated in 
larger, more easily handled structures.
A silicon micromachined version of my "Active Cell Aggregate" might be
able to provide versatile, 3D motion envelopes for final assembly.

Maybe choose two blocks with complementary surfaces. Use van der Waal 
or hydrogen bonding to keep them positioned. Maybe cause a single-site 
reaction at the edge of the interface?
Maybe the blocks can become large enough to be complete parts, only 
needing to be assembled.

A central advantage of a nanotech spacecraft would be the ability to self-repair
in fight (see "The Starseed/Launcher", http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb).
This might also include repairing biologicals.

Im my proposal, a single shield is replaced with a "convoy" of shields 
("point probes") and forward-looking sensors, rather than being 'dumb matter'.
Much less mass required, and the shields can serve other functions as well.
With sensors far enough ahead, it may be feasible to explosively disassemble 
the starship to navigate around the larger obstacles, or simply create corridors
through the ship for smaller objects to pass through.

 But you're

Could use "leapfrog" braking, or force beams to stand off the shields.
Alternatively, equip each separated portion with its own brakes.

 I guess

Even more important will be the energy conversion efficiency. Unless
this can reach a few percent, antimatter propulsion will always be 
restricted to pioneer missions. There are just too many economically
competitive systems. My new article, "The Interworld Rapid Transit 
System", dicusses these issues. It is a proposal for a transportation 
network between established orbital positions, and does not rely on 
rockets of any sort for primary propulsion.

To give a concrete example of the superiority of hierarchies,
organizational theorists say that hierarchies are able to switch directions
faster than flat organizations.  Because the communication flow is
determined, and everyone knows who they are supposed to listen to, a CEO
can make a decision and be fairly confident that it will be heard and
implemented down the company structure.  Without PC's on networks, and the
means of tracking their costs and opportunities, small teams wouldn't have
a hope of gathering the information they needed to make the right decisions
about what they should do next.  And then the cost of coordinating that
decision with all the teams they are dependant on would be astronomical.
But with the new technology, and a fast market-like mechanism for signaling
requirements, you can devolve the information-gathering task to local teams
and get the flexibility of small groups without the lumbering behavior of
uncoordinated bureaucracy.

People have been doing psychedelics for millenia, I'm no spokes person for
psychedelics, but the experience proves itself.  The most dominant things
that I find about psychedelics is that it can give you an experience of the
deepest, most mystical, most profound feeling of love and understanding there
is.  It can also be very adventurous, soaring to the deepest canals of the
mind.  Positive energy is the key to life, and psychedelics, especially
mushrooms, teach it.  It jusy makes so much sense that they are the cause of
our growth out of monkeys and our access into language and a higher
intelligence.  The mushroom experience has a big impact into our language
using abilities.  We only use 10-15% percent of our brains, and I think this
is because we have lost our connection to the source that brought it to us
originally.

Maybe we only used 10-15% of our brains when we didn't know what the other
85-90% did, but now this is nothing more than a pervasive scientific myth.

If psilocybin unlocks the power of 90% of our brain, why do we not see an
academic elite of psychedelic drug-users? (not to suggest that
there aren't any brilliant psychedelic drug-users!)

I, for one, like to use more than 10% of my brain, and I can even do it
WITHOUT psilocybin!

I hate to be mean, but...

That is a remarkably naive statement even for the "new" extropians
list, and given postings here about about beef getting caught in your
stomach and planets flipping over because of all the other planets
being in some special position, etc., thats saying quite a bit.

Bureaucrats do not shift their positions to accomodate the needs of
the community. They change things to accomodate THEIR needs, which are
usually diametrically opposed to those of the surrounding
community. Business is becoming more regulated every day, not less,
and I've seen no evidence of business regulation generally evolving to
meet anyone's needs except for the need of government bureaucracies to
grow and increase their own funding.

Your comment betrays a remarkable lack of connection to the real world.

I realize I should probably phrase that more diplomatically, be kindly
and considerate, etc., but I'm just not in the mood.

[Boy, I long for the old days on this list. Right now, it appears that
the tolerance for uncritical thinking is at an all time high. What
happened to the extropians list where anti-statist, hard science
backed discussion was the norm?]

Perry

Dear Perry and other fellow Extropians.

With all due respect I must regrettably inform you that your perception of
the interaction between legislation and social change is incorrect.

At least that has been my experience during the last fourty years in
governmental administration, legislative drafting and analysis.

Enjoy!!!

     ...say those whose motto is to "protect and serve".
     
     Hegbard Celine's recounting of his "interference with police business" 
     pissed me off so royally.  Those types of situations really get my 
     activist ire up and I really need to get in touch with that.  For a 
     person who rather simplistically advoicates peace, all it takes for me 
     to say "screw that!" is one unreasonable asshole of a cop who, given 
     the lack of better psychological profiles that would otherwise screen 
     him out of such "service", is instead the one the limited mental 
     capacity, the gun, the billy club, the computer and radio and most 
     importantly the judicial power to screw up your life, whether for 24 
     hours or 24 years.
     
     When I was speaking of "ego" earlier, I wasn't talking about the lay 
     usage.  Ego is a sense of self.  It is the skewed sense of self that 
     starts a slow drift towards sociopathy that I was speaking of.  
     
     This cop and his extraordinary lack of judgment exhibited what I 
     consider sociopathic tendancies, is not fit to wear a uniform of what 
     is euphemistically referred to as a "peace officer".  I wish there was 
     a way to realistically get through to people like that but 
     unfortunately, right now I can't think of any.  I'm too busy 
     fantasizing about a cyber scourge of this man's personal credit 
     profile which makes his daily life a real chore <G>.  I knew I

     The nature of my questions is not to advocate believe in UFOs, 
     government conspiracy or anything else that has sensational zeal.  The 
     point is (I feel) these myths exist in our culture for a purpose, to 
     work out something that likely exists as an unrecognized undercurrent 
     within our culture.  Beliefs alter our perception.  The truth used to 
     be that the world was flat, the earth was the center of the universe, 
     epileptics were demon-posessed, that women who did not marry and lived 
     independently of men were dangerous witches, that homosexuals were 
     mentally ill.  I shall not presume to think that just because we've 
     presumably aced the laws of physics and come up with hundreds of other 
     technological marvels that we've got the schematic of the universe 
     down pat.  The next frontiers are much more vast than an ocean or a 
     continent.  They are the far reaches of space and the inner workings 
     of the mind. (cue music...)
     
     Incidentally, the nursery rhyme you dug up for reasons a or b (c 
     doesn't seem to apply) is in itself pertinent, albeit not to this 
     discussion.  However, I'm sure someone in the know will pipe up with 
     the likely political allegory tied to the woman in the shoe story, 
     although I don't think it's a cold war connection <G>.

I addressed this in some other post here recently.  The way space and time
are defined in our universe; no, it's not even meaningful to travel faster
than light or to get somewhere (or pass information) FTL.  Relativity creates
a whole barrel of nasty paradoxes and then discreetly covers them with the
light-speed-limit veil.  FTL seems "possible" to us because we don't think in
terms of relativity.

As a loose example, I always wondered why black hole boundaries are absolute.
 After all, if you're just barely outside of the event horizon couldn't you
see a light ray peeking up from just inside?  Then I saw and interesting
article in Scientific American on the behaviour of light and centrifugal
force near a black hole.  Now I understand why you can't see through a black
hole's event horizon, from any distance (and boy, those mothers are even
creepier than I thought).  

Anyway, my points is that once you better understand these things, the
physics way makes more sense.  If you really want to understand more, get a
good book on relativity with some "paradoxes" in it.  Think about what
happens when you have multiple observers, in various places and with various
speeds.  After a while you get a little bit of a handle with how space, time,
and motion fit together in this odd universe of ours and notions of FTL
travel/communication start making a lot less sense.

Actually I would be *very* cautious about this.  What worries me is this
: there's a lot of evidence to suggest that infants are a bundle of
expectations - possibilities waiting to be fulfilled by events in the
world.  This is how nature and nurture interact, in the broad sense. 
Artificial wombs would have many positive benefits, for sure, but I
worry that infants raised in them might be mentally disturbed by the
lack of typical womb-like sounds and sensations, and also the responsiveness
and 'feedback' or 'communication' between mother and child in-womb (e.g.
infant shifts position, mother shifts position, stuff like that).  

If the artificial womb makers are aware of this possibility, and make an
effort to duplicate as much as possible the 'feel' of a true womb (at
least to a degree above the threshold of the infants ability to
discriminate), then no problem.  But otherwise, it's a worry.

But what makes that funny? 

If there was no person involved, how absurd would it be? The notion of
skiing isn't very absurd. The notion of shooting isn't very absurd. But
put a person in the situation of skiing and then shooting, skiing and
then shooting, it becomes a bit absurd. Take it then to another level
where a person is running, and then fishing, that becomes really absurd
-- according to certain criteria. I would say that without the person,
it isn't absurd at all. 

I think EvMick was suggesting that a situation recounted at someone's
expense -- whether explicitly or otherwise -- is the essence of what a
joke is. 

I think I agree.

Hmm, exactly what evidence do you refer to here? You wording is
rather fuzzy.

That ought to be noticeable in the sheep that are brought up this way
(it is very unlikely basal stuff like this would be restricted only
to humans; mammals in general have some clever ways of ensuring the
mother-child bond and emotional development). If it really is
important with a more natural artificial womb the lambs ought to show
averse emotional reactions when brought up. 

My personal main worry about the procedure (as shown in the brief
film clip I saw) was that the womb was transparent and in a lighted
room. I'm not certain, but this *could* affect the development of
vision (both positively and negatively). 

We'll see when the data is published.

Quite likely. There are already systems for digital banking here in
Sweden, and I foresee that in the enxt ten years bank offices will
become rarer and bank tellers will more and more become monetary and
economic consultants rather than simply tellers (that work can be
done by computers). Their status is likely to rise.

An excellent point.  Actually, if I may quibble, the 'secretary' role as we
have thought of it over the last hundred years (post-typewriter) combined
two jobs that were previously of substantially different nature: the
secretary and the scrivener.  The 'secret'ary (pre-typewriter) was literally
someone who was allowed access to the boss's secrets.  They were what we
would today call an aide or assistant.  (Hence the title 'Secretary of the
Treasury', etc.)  The scrivener was someone responsible for taking
dictation, copying the boss's documents in nice handwriting, and making
hand-copies if that was necessary.  The advent of the typewriter improved
the efficiency of scrivening so much that it could be folded into the
secretary job.  

Scrivener was very much a lower-status job than secretary; when they got
amalgamated the resulting job was still low-status, but it got the
high-status name.  Now that the scrivener/typewriter job has been entirely
taken over by machines, the remainder of the secretary job has been renamed
'assistant' and has increased in status.

I wonder what other jobs will have their drudgery automated away and will
thus both decrease in number and increase in status?  Bank tellers?

What you are touching here is really a subset of the apparent conflict, as
seen by many on this list, between:

Linear <> nonlinear
Mechanical <> biological
Controlled development <> evolution / self organising
Newtonian physics <> chaos theory
Planned <> Random

I think the solution is to find a balance between these artificial
opposites. All of these things exists. The nonlinear side tends to think
that beacuse many things have a tendency to self organise in an rather
efficient manner, that it is the only way to do things. Also a lot of
people find that because the fractal ideas are new, that they also are
better. That I think is a complete misunderstanding. Extropians and
Transhuman ideals stands for exactly the opposite. Transhumans wants to
controll and transform the universe the way we like it. The most powerfull
force on earth (and perhaps in the universe) is the logic, planning and
controlling mind.

Chaos theory can help describe complex systems. It dosn't have to be the
way intelligence design these systems to work.

Your subset is the conflict between Planned education <> Random
experiences.

It's all part of the thing we call life, and I don't really think that it
can be planned. If you try to plan which part of your education should be
planned and wich should be random, then then there wouldn't really be any
random experiences. :-)

You can plan to spend a part of your life experimenting though, and that's
probably a vise thing to do.

OK, I see your point. But the problem is more general than the
medical profession; it is as you say our society which doesn't take
well to deviations from accepted gender and sexual norms. Saying that
the medical profession has a vested interest in preserving the
current state is a bit imprecise; it is like saying the journalists
or the weightlifters have a vested interest in the status quo - it is
the society in general that opposes changes, the medical profession
is just the part which relates to this problem (sex change). So to
really deal with the problem we have to deal with social attitudes.

Hi Danny,

As someone who has always been fascinated with the story of
Atlantis (I like to think of them as the first Extropians!) I would
like to correct a few misconceptions.

As E Shaun Russell has already pointed out, we know where
"Atlantis" is! The remains of what we think of as Atlantis is the
current Greek island of Santorini, formally known as Thera. The
people who lived there are currently referred to as the Minoan.

Thera (and its people) was largely destroyed in a caldera, the most
powerful type of volcanic explosion we know of, the current island
of Santorini is crescent shaped and a visit there will impress you
with how big Thera actually was. It is believed the volcanic
activity had been increasing steadily for days, possibly weeks,
before the caldera occurred. The Minoan's apparently fled to
another stronghold, the island of Crete, where they were virtually
wiped out by the tidal wave following the massive explosion.

 Poets, Plato, time, gossip, and Hollywood (and Donovan ;) ) have
done the rest. A great deal of this has only been discovered since
the late fifties and is still going on today. They do seem to have
been considerably more advanced than their neighbors, but nothing
on the "Hollywood scale". (i.e. no nuclear power or any other such
thing.)

Truth is once again stranger, and more wonderful than fiction.

We could be Atlantis.

I don't know what Wurtz-class metalloorganyles are, but I assume that you
mean C-C bond formation by activated carbon nucleophiles (Grignard etc).
This  proceeds by back side attack with consequent steric inversion.  This
is of course impossible with a polycyclic diamondoid target.

What other reactions might work for subunit linkage?  Diels-alder won't work
because it requires highly unsaturated reactants, which are not permitted by
the harsh conditions for rearrangement into diamondoid building-blocks.
Radicals might work, though any easily removed radical group would probably
also be destroyed in the building-block phase.

	In fact, an anit-matter drive employing equal amounts of reactable
matter and antimatter is not as efficient as some related alternatives.
The magnitude of the radiated (non-usable) EM flux would mean lots of
shielding, thus incurring payload/fuel ratio problems...to name just just
one basic inefficiency of such a drive system. A far more efficient and
more technically feasible drive would employ a small amount of anitmatter
with a larger amount of thrust material, such as water. The generated
thrust of such a drive is very high and the associated payload/fuel ratio
is also correspondingly high.

Cheers,

Yes the signal has noise.  But it is not all noise.  The solution
isn't to throw away the signal, but to find less noisy signals.

But can you design a credential/test which strongly correlates with
these features?  If you could, and if others employers value these
features like you do, you could make a *lot* of money creating a
credentially service.

A pretty-free market currently provides certain credentails, and the
market is pretty open to those who want to market new credentials.  So
if you think you have a good idea for a product here, I encourage you
to create it.  But in the absence of much serious effort here, I think
it is also reasonable for the rest of us to think that it is pretty
hard to beat the existing educational credentialing services.

I've always been curious why IQ scores don't appear on resumes.  IQ is
a well documented and studied credential shown to have high
correlation with future success.  Personal interviews, in contrast,
look really lousy in academic studies.  Is it a signaling problem,
where anyone who would choose to put their high IQ on their resume is
likely a member of a small subset of the high IQ folks who you don't
want?

Amusing perhaps, but I find it very hard to take these seriously as
explanations of human behavior.  It is not obvious to me, for example,
that people want to ignore reality, that efficiency precludes
interesting emotions, or that sane society is boring.  And I find the
idea that wars are made to divert people from research rather
implausible.  Perhaps these quotes don't do the book justice.

Could you please be more specific? What events have occurred in
your forty years of experience in government that cause you to
disagree with Perry's analysis? The four lines that you posted
(after quoting *all* of Perry's post) have no content: they're a
simple assertion of your experience without any details or evidence,
and you might as well have forgone posting them at all for all the
useful information they contain.

Essentially you've informed all of us that you disagree with
Perry, and that's all. Did you relly need to quote every single
line of Perry's post to do that? Do you think that your
informing us that you disagree with Perry did anything to
improve the quality of information being presented to list
subscribers?

>From Celia Green, "The Human Evasion": 

  "Society begins to appear much less unreasonable when one realizes its true
function. It is there to help everyone to keep their minds off reality. This
follows automatically from the fact that it is an association of sane people,
and it has already been shown that sanity arises from the continual insertion
of `other people' into any space into which a metaphysical problem might
intrude."

  "It is therefore quite irrelevant to criticize society as though it were
there for some other purpsoe - to keep everyone alive and well-fed in an
efficient manner, say. Some degree of inefficiency is essential to create
interesting opportunities for emotional reaction. (Of course, criticizing
society, though irrelevant, is undeniably of value as an emotional
distraction for sane people.)"

[snips]

  "To the sane mind, even aggression against people is infinitely better than
aggression against infinity. And it is the chief defect of sane society that
it is boring. It is so boring that even sane people notice it. And so, from
time to time, there is a war. This is intended to divert people's minds before
they become so bored that they take to some impersonal kind of aggressive
activity - such as rseearch, or asceticism, or inspiration, or something
discreditable of that kind."

  "In wartime, rather more purposeful activity than usual is permissible. Even
sane people relax their normal beliefs that nothing matters very much, and
some time next week is soon enough for anything. This is regarded as justified
because the war is always about something connected with *other people*, and
may be regarded as an assertion of the belief that *the thing that matters
most is politics*."

[snips]

  "Society, they say, exists to safeguard the rights of the individual. If this
is so, the primary right of a human being is evidently to live
unrealistically."

[snips]

  "Sane people regard an apparently purposeful activity as disinfected by
numbers - i.e. if a sufficiently large number of people is involved, they feel
sure that they outcome will be harmless to sanity, no matter how frenzied the
labours may seem to be. The most large-scale examples are war and politics.
Into these activities, people allow themselves to enter with almost single-
minded devotion."

  "Both war and politics have played a particularly helpful part in retarding
the march of progress. In fact, the history of the human race is only
comprehensible as the record of a species trying ont to gain control of its
environment."

It's an amusing book, though it seems to be out of print. The full text
is on the Web somewhere (try a search engine).

I have proven that, given a very weak notion of rationality, mutual
awareness of the mere fact of disagreement is enough to eliminate all
informational sources of disagreement between two agents.  (See:
http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/calibration.ps)  Thus if Abraham and
Perry were rational in this sense, Abraham's notice of disagreement
would be extremely informative.

In 'The Bell Curve' is an appendix which claims to explain the tortured
history of using tests (including IQ) as a method of employee selection.  It
would appear that all tests on which blacks score lower than whites on the
average have been banned, as being discriminatory.  This doesn't explain why
IQ scores do not appear on resumes outside the US, however.

I say 'claims to explain' because I no longer trust 'The Bell Curve' to tell
the balanced truth.  I've seen enough criticism of it to believe that it is
as slanted as possible without actually telling barefaced lies.

Actually there is strong anthropological evidence that the greeks had

documented.  For those who don't know, molded rye yields LSD.

As a general comment on this thread..I think there is more to

to augment ourselves, is well though out on this list.  However, 
technology in <itself> provides more of a quantitative increase rather

Yes, that's one of the peculiarities. We human apes seem rather
better suited to an aquatic environment than most land mammals
(look how much money Californians spend on swimming pools, for
instance ;), and our closest relatives, the other apes, seem rather
less well suited to an aquatic environment than most land mammals.
Human beings also have a dive reflex built into the neurological
wiring that controls our breathing, similar to the dive reflex
found in pinnipeds, cetaceans, and other aquatic mammals. This dive
reflex (and voluntary control of the breath) seems to be missing
from our ape cousins, whose breathing seems to be as automatic and
involuntary as their heartbeat.

The Aquatic phase of human evolution, unfortunately, falls into
the "Fossil Gap" that lies between Lucy (the first fully bipedal
human ancestor, and apparently the immediate successor to the
Aquatic Ape, if such a thing ever existed) and the earlier common
ancestors of the modern pongid apes (including Homo), whose existence
is almost as poorly documented in the fossil record as the existence
of any hypothetical wading hominids is.

FFI http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5168/aat.html, which is not
very academically oriented, but has the best available (that I
could find) single collection of links to a few sites and cites
that are academically oriented.

(And then there is the curious fact (?) that newborn human infants
know how to swim, and can apparently keep themselves alive without
difficulty in an aquatic environment, although the skill is lost
-- unless practiced? -- within a few weeks. I'm looking for further
recorded evidence of this.  I have seen video footage of swimming
human infants, though.)

Lots of stuff I've picked up here and there- especially the physiologically
oriented research on myelinisation of the infant brain towards the end
of pregnancy being sufficient to mediate some emotional responses. Also
cognitive psychology as a whole, which suggests the general pattern that
the brain works that way (lock/key) - e.g. Dennet, Edelman. Also Oliver
Sacks' book on deaf people learning language (was it? - my memory is
really pretty crap, so I'm the wrong person to ask for precise details
about anything!)

Hmm - would we recognise what a disturbed lamb would be like?  That sort
of thing requires a bit of the old *verstehen* I think, and I'm not so
confident that the kinds of researchers involved in these projects would
notice - not that they're bad of course (it's not their speciality), but
I would be more confident if they recognised the importance of the kind
of point I am making, and had (say) some cognitive psychologists or
maybe even psychotherapists along for the ride, looking out for just
this sort of problem.  I do think it's extremely important to check this
out before we create a generation of psychos by accident or oversight.

I hope so - as I say, I'm not that confident that the kind of scientist
involved in this kind of research is competent to notice the kind of
problems we're talking about.

My question was, given that (perhaps unsorted, perhaps
not all perfect) "adamantine" building blocks can
be synthesized using "traditional" chemistry, and then
sorted and oriented using an STM, Then how to you hook them
together using the STM. If I understand your reply, you
are discussing "harsh conditions" in solution phase. Does
the STM have to operate in a solution-phase environment?
I had assumed that the building blocks could be deposited
on a suitable work surface for the STM, and the environment
then adjusted as needed (vacuum, noble gas, whatever.)
Then you can employ the STM to sort and orient. At this point
you aren't in solution phase, but you aren't in machine phase
either. You are in "STM phase", or something. Now, is there a
way to hook the blocks together?

As is doubtless painfully obvious, I'm no chemist. My mental
model, using "blocks" and "hook together", may be so grossly
oversimplified as to be worthless. If so, let me know.

Thanks.

Yes, I was assuming perfect conversion efficiency, so I should have
stated that twice the mass is a lower bound. Since you won't allow
me perfect efficiency, I'll need even more mass, and so will you.
In theory I can reach near-perfact efficiencies without new
laws of physics. I chose .5c because the relativistic effects are
fairly small, so we can solve the following two equations:
      ke=1/2*m*v*v (kenetic energy is half mass times velocity squared)
and
      e=m*c*c   (the matter-antimatter conversion of mass to energy)

remembering that we have to accelerate and then decelarate, and that
half of the energy goes onto the reaction mass, and that you must
carry your reaction mass with you.

In fact, I didn't really do the calculation. I just took the result
on faith from Krause, "The Physics of Star Trek".

The point is, even with perfect mass-to-energy conversion and perfect
conversion into kenetic energy, you need a LOT of mass to go
fast.

Puns are funny because they inflict pain, at least in people who had

Eric, here's a research idea: test infant apes for native aquatic
agility. Its my suspicion that its just something developed as a womb
survival insitinct, and that any feral apes capable of diving are
quickly eaten by crocodiles or watersnakes, which would certainly induce
a rather high pucker factor against swimming for ones fellows. This croc
free req for aquatic ape habitat would in my mind either point to likely
places to find such ape fossils, or disprove the theory.

huh, the news here said that they had brought the cargoship in on manual
untile the last few meters or so and then flipped on the automatic
system. The automatic system supposedly overshot and caused the tanker
to bounce off SPEKTRA and rip off a couple solar panels.

In any account, Mir's present troubles are an excellent illustration of
the problems that can occur on extended missions with little support
that I have been trying to explain...

I would expect that if we are talking about stable weapons here, that
can be stored, an antimatter weapon would not contain stored antimatter,
but would be a device that generated a large amount of antimatter in a
short amount of time and released it at once. I would expect that this
could possibly be acheived with a device that used a fast meltdown
powering a compact accelerator that fed into a temporary containment
chamber.

Sorry, Hawaii is formed by a phenomenon thats been going on for many
millions of years, as the chain extends underwater almost to the
aleutians. It turns out from radar and sonar data, that there is an
upwelling of really hot stuff from the lower mantle, through the mantle,
to the underside of the Pacific Plate, which punctures the plate and
forms islands. As the Pacific plate slowly drifts over time across this
upwelling, new punctures are created and new islands form. That the
Hawaiian chain is so long and so straight indicates that the Pacific
plate has been on a steady course for a couple hundred million years at
the very least, so the plates would not slide over the mantle as you
say. The dynamo pheonomenon that I was talking about, and you may have
miscronstrued, is the differential between the rotation of our mantle
and the core. The moons tidal drag causes the mantle to rotate slightly
slower than the core. This differntial in speed keeps our core molten
and generates our planets huge magnetic field. At the level of the lower
mantle, the magma is hot enough to be so viscous that this dynamo may
tumble like a gyroscope failure in catastorphic circumstances, like I
had previously mentioned...

What is meant by "effectiveness"? How is that any different than
accuracy, and how would anything besides accuracy matter, besides
possibly penetration.

The anti- weapons systems reports that came out after the Gulf War were
issued by the congresisonal budget office, then under the control of
democrats. The CBO is notorious for twisting and cherry picking data to
fit foregone conclusions, to the benefit of the party in the majority in
congress. Due to this, their reports are not considered by anybody but
the mainstream US media to be worth a hoot, and the media only pays
attention to them when the democrats are in charge there. Granted the
effectiveness of many weapons systems did not, in the final anlysis,
meet up to initial projections, but they also turned out to be nowhere
near as bad as the CBO would have you beleive. This was all covered in
the media, and Aviation Week did a bit of indepth on the whole issue,
exposing the CBO figures as hopelessly inaccurate as the military's
initial projections were in the other direction

As socialist as the British press is, I imagine that they prefer CBO
data to the truth any day when reporting on US politics. I guess they
still are perturbed by one of our F-111's Paveway bombs hitting the
French Embassy in the raid on Tripoli, after the French denied us
airspace for a direct route. They'd better hope those bombs get more
accurate, you never know when a negative piece in the Times will result
in the misrelease of a couple hundred kilos over a certain office in
London.... ;)

This is an important point to include: Bach's biplane had no phased
service program established by the manufacturer, while the business jet
most certainly had a very extensive one, which went a long way toward
preventing most breakdowns due to wear/use. If Bach had a similar
program for the biplane, I would expect that he could expect a similar
reliability, if not better.

It also includes replacing parts at timed intervals on a rigorous basis.
Changing fluids, greasing joints, replacing gaskets, o-rings, filters,
etc. testing circuits, replacing bulbs, switches and sensors as they
wear out. Monitoring insulation resistance, ground connections, etc.
Large components need to be replaced and rebuilt at timed intervals,
like generators, drive systems, pumps, motors, etc..

If you are using  a conventional reaction drive, you can expect the
exhaust to privide a bit of a shockwave, and you can just let the sheild
coast on ahead of you at high speed, so long as you are going to remain
on the same course. Otherwise, you'll have to have some near bussard
level magnetic systems to develop an EM shockwave in front.

That may have been it. I remember the pundits making jokes about the

Sure, I'll just do a couple 36 hour long spacewalks and change that fuel
cell in space, without a ground crew or equipment to support me. A multi
year voyage needs to carry its own entire maintenance departments with
it, with a stockpile of spare parts and consumables. Oh and I'll need a
collapsible space dock to help contain the mess while everything is
apart.

Here's an excercise to get some minimal idea of what I am talking about:
if you have a motorboat, take it, sufficient supplies, and tools and
parts out onto a body of water. Then proceed to dissasemble the engine
and totally rebuild it without returning to land and before your
supplies and patience runs out.

THink you can do it before getting washed onto rocks or swamped in
stormy seas? Wanna bet your life?

The claim is that I would be arrested for placing my IQ score on my resume?
Similarly for putting "Mensa" under org memberships?  
I find such claims hard to believe.

Okay, I'm no scientist. So the subjects that make you raise your
eyebrows and smirk, are not necessarily the ones that elicit the same
reaction from me. Given that no one is issued a list of taboo
subject-matter when they join this list, such pseudo-science should be
expected. Anyway, if it's as worthless as you think, don't bother
responding. Let the thread die. If it doesn't die, then somebody wants
to discuss it. "Extropian" is so damn broad that an argument for or
against discussion of any topic is possible. If hard science as it
applies to extropy is what some consider the most important facet of the
extropian meme, maybe we need more than one list.   

I love it loud,

Crocodiles are a major obstacles, but perhaps not insurmountable if the
aquatic phase was relatively late and they had spears.  In any case, there's
always the seashore.  Something with hands and rocks almost has a ready-made
niche with shellfish there.  I would think transient lakes in the Sahara (one
that shows up for a few thousand years under appropriate climactic
conditions) might also be free of crocodiles.  (anybody here know?)

Unfortunately even if we could be sure of, say, a coastal origin, the coast
of  Africa is still a fairly big place.  Worse, sea level has varied a lot
too; so the target area would be thousands of miles long by a hundred wide.
 Rather big.  Even if we narrow it down to East Africa it's *still* big.

An excellent point.  Actually, if I may quibble, the 'secretary' role as
we
have thought of it over the last hundred years (post-typewriter) combined
two jobs that were previously of substantially different nature: the
secretary and the scrivener.  The 'secret'ary (pre-typewriter) was
literally
someone who was allowed access to the boss's secrets.  They were what we
would today call an aide or assistant.  (Hence the title 'Secretary of the
Treasury', etc.)  The scrivener was someone responsible for taking
dictation, copying the boss's documents in nice handwriting, and making
hand-copies if that was necessary.  The advent of the typewriter improved
the efficiency of scrivening so much that it could be folded into the
secretary job.  

Scrivener was very much a lower-status job than secretary; when they got
amalgamated the resulting job was still low-status, but it got the
high-status name.  Now that the scrivener/typewriter job has been entirely
taken over by machines, the remainder of the secretary job has been
renamed
'assistant' and has increased in status.

I wonder what other jobs will have their drudgery automated away and will
thus both decrease in number and increase in status?  Bank tellers?

Could you please be more specific? What events have occurred in
your forty years of experience in government that cause you to
disagree with Perry's analysis? The four lines that you posted
(after quoting *all* of Perry's post) have no content: they're a
simple assertion of your experience without any details or evidence,
and you might as well have forgone posting them at all for all the
useful information they contain.

Essentially you've informed all of us that you disagree with
Perry, and that's all. Did you relly need to quote every single
line of Perry's post to do that? Do you think that your
informing us that you disagree with Perry did anything to
improve the quality of information being presented to list
subscribers?

Eric Watt Forste ++ arkuat@pobox.com ++ expectation foils perception -pcd

Dear Eric and other fellow Extropians,

I respectfully suspect that Eric may be kvetching for the sake of
kvetching.

During my service to the US Congress I was involved in drafting and/or
analyzing several thousand pieces of legislation that effected and
(hopefully) helped to advance the cause of social evolution. 

I could name more than a few pieces of legislation I helped to formulate
but it would be quite meaningless in the overall context of our continuing
social evolution.
Obviously, any given policy determination has, by itself, usually, a very
minor effect.  

Possibly, part of the problem is that almost no one outside of a few
professionals are aware how much legislation is introduced  in the House
and Senate any given term. Much of what is drafted, amended and passed is
quite technical and, unfortunately, quite complex and arcane. 

Almost all of the public is quite unaware of how the legislative process
actually works. Among the many things I'm still learning is that any
relationship between political science as taught in most colleges and
universities and governmental administration as it actually functions and
transpires is purely coincidental. Civics, as taught in almost all
secondary schools is, at best, horribly superficial and frequently
misguided. The same, of course, can be said for the teaching of
evolutionary biology at most academic levels.

During my current work with the NYS legislature, I frequently focus on
consumer protection legislation as an example in point. But, most of my
modifications to the general business law, the general obligations law,
etc., receive scant public notice.

Since the focus of this discussion is supposed to be on the philosophy of
advancing humanity through various means I dont see any point in being any
more specific. My purpose in this academic exchange is to expand my
horizons by learning as well as expressing my experiential views.

I trust that you will all respect that.

Enjoy!!!

If my post was "kvetching for the sake of kvetching", then what the hell
is this? Blathering for the sake of blathering?

Consider *this* post kvetching for the sake of my not having to start
using killfiles on the extropians list.

I believe the claim Carl was referring to is that employers who
routinely used such scores or organizational memberships to qualify
or disqualify job applicants could be sued and fined for illegal
discrimination in employment. I have no idea whether this is the
case, but this claim seems much more plausible to me than the
one you were thinking of.

I think its more a matter of psychology on the part of the personnel
manager. I mean, what sort of person has a goal in life of becoming a
director of human resources? I'll bet its someone who did poorly on an
IQ test and enjoys jerking around the lives of people more skilled and
intelligent than they are. Job applicants would therefore be smart to
not mention their intelligence. I've also noticed this same phenomenon
on the part of department heads. They never want to hire someone smarter
than they are, unless they are that rare non-egotistical type...

I suspect this is true, and that is part of the problem that so many on
this list have with these regulations.  Why don't we take the IRS rules
about contractors as one example?  You said to Perry that we could
comfortably expect these regulations to adapt to suit organizations as they
change.  In fact, the IRS tightened the rules for when you can call someone
a contractor just as many companies have started to use contracting
heavily.  I have been asked by firms, for whom I believed I was clearly
contracting, if I would please sign on as a temporary employee just to
avoid IRS issues.

If contract relationships are the wave of the future, why is the IRS making
it so difficult to operate this way?  It's relatively easy to explain if
you take a public choice approach and assume that the IRS wants to maximize
it's revenue and power with little regard to the effect on the economy.
How would you interpret the situation?

Regards,
Andrea

Danny is taking the pole shift thing in circles (pardon the pun).
If I am not misremembering, first he said the Great Alignment will
flip the Earth in a day, so that Antarctica is on the equator.
When the astrophysicists in the audience asked what force could
do that, Danny said the crust (which is far less massive than the
rest of the planet) goes slipping about, as a whole (a phenomenon
distinct from continental drift), leaving the mantle behind.
I pointed to Hawaii as evidence that it must not happen often.
Danny responds:

: Maybe the whole world turns, and not just the crust.

Well then, we're back to the big question:
What force can flip a planet over in one day?

Sorry if we're being dull, Danny.
Maybe there's a magic RPG list that would be interested.

Wise words.  On the other hand, look also at some wild alternative
possibilities available within the canonical paradigm, discussed in Paul J.
Nahin's extensively bibliographied book TIME MACHINES, published in 1993
not by Nit-Wit Press but by the American Institute of Physics.

With (at least) one conspicuous exception; the suggestion is that

point away from the spine.  We love to swim; chimps are hopeless.

Maybe the *loss* of such sensations at birth is more traumatic

Pluto is more than five light-hours away.  Thanks to special
relativity, though, a big enough engine can get you anywhere in
the universe in an arbitrarily short subjective time.  Whether
you'd be three-dimensional after the ride is another question.

Dan Clemmensen responded:

39 astronomical units, not 39 light-hours.  The astronomical unit
is the mean distance between Earth and Sun, about 498 light-seconds.

Dear transhumans: 

Over the years, there have been innovations in cryonics not only from a
technological standpoint, but also by ideas developed through various
mediums and approached in countless ways.

We have innovative writings such as Ettinger's _The Prospect of Immortality_
and "Man into Superman_.  

Fred and Linda Chamberlain starting Alcor Foundation, Max More starting
Mezar, Paul Wakfer's Prometheus Project, and ideas into articles by Mike
Darwin and Steve Harris.

There is science fiction such as _Chiller_ by Benford, _Tech-Heaven_ by
Nagata, and _The Door Into Summer_ by Heinlein.

There is biographical accounts such as _Great Mambo Chicken and the
Transhuman Condition_ by Regis.

Also, television and film:  _Late for Dinner_, both "Picket Fences" and L.A.
Law" episodes dealing with cryonics.

There are innovative actions such as outsmarting the Riverside Coroner's
office in preserving Dora Kent's head. And services such as starting of
Cryonet by Kevin Brown.

Can anyone suggest creative undertakings about or relating to cryonics?

Thanks!

quoth E.Shaun--
:         Actually, there may be a *little* bit of truth in what Danny is
: saying.  Feeding off of my geology experience, I seem to recall that there
: are two different forms of tectonic movement: convergent and divergent.
: When a divergent tectonic movement takes place, the plates split apart,
: causing magma to escape...a perfect example is Iceland which is always
: splitting and growing igneous rock.  Convergent movement is when two plates
: collide or "converge" producing magma in that way.  What I presume Danny is
: getting at is that there may be a large convergent movement without a
: head-on collision, causing the pole or continent to move.  However,
: though this is conceptually a possibility (isn't everything!?),

I don't get it.  Yes, the plates move in different directions,
that's obvious.  If every pair of nearby plates were converging
(or diverging), the planet would have to be shrinking (or growing).
I can't visualize what Shaun is suggesting here - that two plates
may approach each other without colliding?  Or that some collisions
have a lateral component (that can't be surprising)?

: it has never happened before on this planet (as far as anyone knows)
: and the odds of it happening are tremendously infinitessimal.

Yeah, I'd say it's unlikely for all the plates at once
to come loose from the mantle and race about.

On another hand, remembering Haldane's Rule --
I saw something on teevee that said the surface of Venus is determined
from crater counts to be all about the same age; okay that isn't
disturbing, except that the age appears to be HALF a billion years!
What caused that catastrophe, and is it likely to happen again?

: P.S.: Just to clarify something, Hawaii is a bit of an anomaly.  It was
:   --and is being-- formed by weaknesses in the seafloor which were
:   punctured under pressure.  These punctures sent up spits of magma in
:  the form of pillow basalts which, in turn, created the Hawaiian
: islands.  The punctures still prove to be very active in Hawaii
: judging by the high amount of volcanic activity...it is probable that
:       within the next million years there will be many more Hawaiian
:       islands...and more opportunities to trap future tourists!  ;~)

Blaming Hawaii on weak spots seems to put the cart before the horse.
The conventional story, as I understand it, has a "hot spot" of rising
magma (cause unknown) which, as the Pacific Plate moves over it, pushes
volcanoes through.  Presumably every plate has weak points where magma
is more likely to get through than the surrounding area; that's why
Hawaii is a sequence of cones and not a single long ridge.

I confess that my attention is limited, too, Mr. 
Forste, and that in my experience, simple, direct
speech is prized by most of the people I respect.

Mr. Genen seems to be more attuned to making
orotund, supercilious-sounding pronouncements 
than to direct response. Rather like excerpts from
"Yes, Minister". His proud yet veiled description 
of his years spent crafting an ever-more-snug 
creche of laws for all of us to be cradled in
may point to a cause. OTOH...

Perhaps this obliqueness is evidence that we
really are blessed with a stranger in our midst.
"Didn't know what principled argumentation was..."

Possibly he knows how to decode the 18 hours of
"noise" recorded by a certain head-mounted camera.

Then again, the best way to yank someone's chain
is to pretend you're not doing it. Diplomatic
provocation, more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger, 
contrived urbanity, that sort of thing
I suggest we all give Mr. Genen enough chain 
that tension is hard to apply. If it's just a 
"brainsizing" exercise, he'll tire of it 
and wander off soon, if not soon enough.

Meanwhile, step up preparations for Plan B.

I think there are 2 root causes of junk science, one is noble and one is not. 

1) People feel a sense of awe when they contemplate the universe, as well 
   they should. Mystics, Scientists, religious people and flying saucer nuts 
   all have this in common.

2) Laziness. Junk Science fans remind me of kids who gorge on jelly beans,  
   they just wallow in awe and don't do their homework that would allow them   
   to explore and find an even deeper beauty.

It's no allegory it's cold hard fact. My uncle told me his neighbor had a 
friend who's brother heard a man in a bar say that his former commanding 
officer dated the sister of the man who cleaned the pool of the postman of 
the CIA interrogator of the son of the old lady who lived in the shoe. Well 
one of the sons, she had a lot of children actually. 

This is IRONCLAD proof that the story is true, there is no other possible  
explanation. The fact that there is no physical evidence of any sort for any 
of this must mean there is a huge conspiracy of government and the evil 
moneyed interests to suppress this technology because it would turn 
comfortable footwear into affordable housing for all. 
                  

        >although I don't think it's a cold war connection <G>.


Not so,  poor housing caused a lot of resentment in the Soviet Union and was 
one of the reasons for its downfall. Now that the cold war is over there are 
signs that the tight grip over the old lady's technology is starting to 
loosen up, you will note that basketball shoes have gotten much more 
sophisticated since 1989, further proof that there was an old lady who lived 
in a shoe and she had so many children she didn't know what to do.

triplet CAU in messenger RNA  is a "real" object it MEANS the amino acid 
histidine but I grant you, only in the context (language) of life, their are 
no special chemical characteristics that relate one to the other. One type of 
transfer RNA has an anticodon that connects to the CAU triplet of messenger 
RNA like a key fitting into a lock. At another part of the transfer RNA 
molecule, an amino acid can be attached, in this case histidine. However 
transfer RNA can't tell one amino acid from another, the amino acid 
attachment part is IDENTICAL in all tRNA molecules, but in practice, only 
those that have the anticodon for CAU are attached to histidine. The reason 
for this is an enzyme ( aminocyl-tRNA synthetase). 

This enzyme can tell one amino acid from another, and it can tell one tRNA  
molecule from another, and it can a attach a animo acid to it. However, this  
enzyme does NOT look at the anticodon at all but at another part of the  
transfer RNA, the DHU loop. In the lab the DHU loop from one type of tRNA has 
been grafted onto another type of tRNA and that changes the genetic code.  
It's also interesting that this enzyme is a protein encoded by, what else,  
the genetic code. I can't point to exactly where the genetic code is, because  
it does not reside in any one of these stages, it resides in all of them.

This could be AIC or depth, I can't tell which because Edmonds doesn't
say what he means by "difficult". At any rate, by this definition the
gibberish produced by a monkey would certainly be more complex than any
article in the journal "Nature". I want a definition that is not the opposite
of our intuitive understanding of the word, I haven't found it.

In the interests of forming a clearer concept of the future...
Does anyone have any suggestions regarding what might *not*
have changed, after a Singularity? For example, the
fundamental laws of physics, whatever they are, should
presumably remain as they were. Perhaps there are economic
laws that would remain valid (but will there still be
"markets"?).

Perhaps the consequences of a Singularity are highly
contingent, in that they depend critically upon the
goals of the beings that survive the nano-wars, or
Transcend first, or whatever. The characteristic shared
by the definitions of Singularity that I can think of
is that they all refer to technology. Whatever else
it is, the Singularity is a point at which "godlike"
technologies arrive, technologies with which one might
reshape the universe or construct new ones. The
consequences of the Singularity depend on what is done
with those technologies; what does *that* depend on?

Under your model, I suppose that follows, but I utilize Judith Lorber's 
paradigm of gender as a social institution in itself, a product of human 
invention adopted for its usefulness in allocating societal 
benefits and responsibilities.  The maintenance of constructed gender 
differences underlies most other societal institutions, most of which 
are constructed along the differentials in varying ways.

Because gender-bending of any sort reveals the artificial
constructions and learned behaviors that constitute the institution 
of gender, (however constructed in whatever society) it would 
therefore be in the best interest of all other societal institutions 
to constrain that behavior, to control who has access to it, to 
determine how much to marginalize or integrate it.  The medical 
profession, as part of both the social institutions of community 
service and academia, has developed its own methods to accomplish 
this.

Well, the Aquatic Ape theory holds that.  However, there's really no reason
the aquatic phase had to be then.  The aquatic phase could have been between
Habilis and Erectus, or between Erectus and us.  There could have been
multiple aquatic phases, for that matter.  AAT wants to explain bipedalism
via an aquatic existence but that's hardly the only way to explain
bipedalism.  

Indeed, the gracile bone structure that distinguishes us from other hominids
is rather a mystery, but if we were semi-aquatic and the other hominids
weren't, it would at least serve some purpose.  We don't know whether other
hominids had any of the other purported aquatic adaptations, such as
hairlessness, sweating, subcutaneous fat, or a diving reflex; there's none
left.  I understand there's evidence that Erectus was quite a runner, though,
and that would make one expect sweating at least.

My understanding is that anti-matter, despite being highly energetic, makes
poor bomb material.  The results would resemble something more like an
extremely energetic fizzle than an explosion and is far too difficult to
handle in quantity.  Not at all economical in comparison to more
conventional nuclear materials.  Research in anti-matter as a military toy
has been directed more towards (anti-)particle beams and the like.

As I stated in a previous post, it is quite apparent from the tax code that
the government would prefer it if everyone was a corporate cubicle dweller.
 I too make a living doing consulting work, and the take of various
government agencies (always >50%) fits very nicely under my definition of
tyrannical.  They get to take more than half of my money and in return I
have to put up with harassment and absurd legislation that in no way
reflects my interests.  What a deal!  The IRS regulations concerning
independent contractors is essentially a way for the government to squash
free-market capitalism and financial independence.  Governments thrive on
dependency, be it dependence on the government or on a company.  Either way
they win in the long run.

Most people's conception of what military accuracy is or should be is often
seriously out of sorts with reality and economy.  The old Copperhead
"smart" artillery rounds were about 20% accurate at hitting tanks at
$25,000 a piece.  An equivalent "dumb" round costs ~$500 and on average
requires 500 rounds expended per tank kill (most heavy armor today requires
a direct artillery hit for a kill).  The $500 dumb rounds may sound cheap,
but when multiplied by the number required for the same effect, they
usually cost more.  In a battlefield environment it is absolutely amazing
if you have 50% accuracy.

But a more important factor is speed.  An artillery battery using "dumb"
rounds requires approximately 30 minutes to fire 500 rounds.  5 "smart"
rounds can be fired in less than a minute.  Since most battles are over in
less than 30 minutes, it is well worth the extra money for the quick
lethality of "smart" weapons.  This is especially true when you are going
head-to-head against similar equipment.

The 9000 small-arms rounds per kill sounds a little high, but if true
wouldn't surprise me.  Rounds are usually expended for purposes *other*
than killing people.  For example, suppressive fire isn't intended to kill
anyone but uses up a lot of ammo.

Also we have subcutaneous fat like pigs, otters and other semi-aquatic
animals. Human babies can be born in water and naturally float; try this
with a baby chimpanzee and you end up with a dead chimp baby. Elaine Morgan
has championed this view originally put forward by Sir Alex Hardy in the
1960s in the book "The aquatic ape" (1982, Souvenir Press).

One of their strongest arguments is that we are have a diving reflex -- put
your body under water and your pulse rate automatically drops to conserve
energy -- and this is something that seems to be lacking in other apes, but
exists in aquatic mammals like the seal.

In addition to subcutaneous fat our nose and nasal passages are constructed
such that we can dive (and have showers!) without getting water in our
lungs. Again try this with a chimpanzee.

The idea is that our ancestors learnt to foraged in shallow waters for food
and bipedalism could by explained as an evolutionary pressure to help us
stand upright in shallow waters while we foraged.

There is even a suggestion as to when this might have happened ~6.5 million
years ago the Danakil Alps in the Afar triangle of Northern Africa became
islands and any in this area would have been cutoff from the African
mainland for over a million years. During this period they may well have
learnt to exploit food along the coast and become so suited to this aquatic
lifestyle that may of the features we now take for granted -- bipedalism,
lack of hair, subcutaneous fat etc had already developed -- when they
returned to the African mainland to continue their evolutionary
development.

And of course other arguments used for bipedalism (e.g. it developed as a
way to keep body temperature down on the hot savanah) are not incompatiable
with the idea that it originally developed to for a semi-aquatic lifestyle
and then was used by evolution for other reasons.

The problem with this theory is that it lacks any hard fossil evidence and
I doubt whether any palentologists take it seriously today. Of course its a
little hard to think what would be really knock-down evidence for or
against. And no one seems to have explained why we do have a diving
reflex...

Sounds quite inefficient to me; you need a lot of energy to make the
antimatter, why not use that energy for an explosion directly? 

Something that is often overlooked is that almost all the energy in
some explosives come from normal energy sources (hydroelectric,
nuclear, oil etc) which are used to drive chemical reactions during
production (the rest is the chemical energy in the ingredients). So
the plastic explosives from (say) Akzo-Nobel are really hydropowered! 
:-) 

As somebody pointed out, antimatter makes a somewhat lousy explosion. 
The first reaction between it and the environment produces so much
heat that both turns into a mixed plasma fireball (ambiplasma; I like
that term). Inside the fireball the annihilation rate is lower (since
the density has gone down), so it will remain for a fairly long while
(how long?), radiating hard gamma radiation. Not my weapon of choice
if I wanted a big blast, but if I for some weird reason wanted to
sterilize a continent I might blow it up in the stratosphere.

Actually, if you look at what I wrote (included below) I didn't draw
any conclusions. I'm not sufficiently well versed in anthropology and
history (and lack the time) to do a fair comparision (although I
think it would be worthwhile).

It seems that you misunderstood my comment about the Greeks and
Romans; while there certainly were some use of psychotropic drugs
(like the molded rye bread suggested by Bobby Whalen) as far as I
know they where never widely used or accepted during the classic era
(the use seem to have spread during the hellenic era); wine (and
opium) seems to have been the intoxicants of choice. From what I know
of the Roman empire the same held there. The comparision was more
Greco-Roman = little psychedelics, Indians = more psychedelics. 

The big question is how to accurately measure novelty. Maybe one
should look at the number of occasions thinkers came up with ideas
people in general (and not just the rulers) disagreed with?

Hello, Refreshingly Skeptical and Intelligent Fellow Extropians....

I am Rudi Hoffman in Daytona Beach, FL, and I have been quietly reading these
outstanding posts for about a year...I am so damn glad that there are so many
sharp people out there whose orientation is extropian, and whose biases
reflect my own.

Knowing how we are excited about technology and how it can expand our
effectiveness, I just wanted to post a brag about my new Compaq Presario
4814, obtained thru the magic of signing a Office Depot "Don't even bother to
pay for it for six months plan"...cooolll!...obtained about 6 hours ago...I
could not sleep I was so excited about playing with it..:)

Anyway, it is a screamer!  233 MMX, a 100 meg Zip drive, 24 speed CD rom, 32
MB SyncDram (How is this different than regular RAM, I wonder?), a 56K modem,
and an astonishing 6.5 GIG hard drive. And a 17 inch moniter with seamlessly
integrated speakers!


I want you tech freaks to drool a bit, if you don't mind:)

I think I have more computing power than a government could have afforded
perhaps 25 years ago...maybe 35... 

Anyway, Drexler, etc. seem to be right about the costs of storage and
computing power continuing to plummet...

Just finished a tape called "Being Digital" by Negriponti...great, inspiring
stuff.

I correlated it with Gate's "The Road Ahead" (Another enlightening read) and
Drexler's "Engines of Creation " and "Unbounding the Future"...

We are definately leading increasingly "Science Fiction" lifestyles...

What a GREAT time to be alive...

On another thread, I wanted to add my belief / observation / opinion that
psylocybin mushrooms may or may not have added to the evolution of the
race...but they have added a great deal to my personal evolution.

One of the few things, besides technology, skepticism, and cryonics, that I
am "evangelical" about.  They should be a "REQUIRED COURSE" in college...I am
only half joking about this.  They are great!  This posting may keep me from
being president one day...unless we have become VERY Libertarian!

Warmly,

Rudi

The laws of physics are by definition unlikely to change, although if
you can build basement universes the constants and symmetry breakings
might be different ("Well, I have always thought having 2-dimensional
time is a bit gauch").

If there are limitations (which conservation laws seem to imply),
then there will likely exist scarcities, and economics of some kind
may apply. For example, in a rapidly growing technosphere
reproduction can be exponential but the amount of resources grows as
t^2. 

Memes are likely to remain, possibly in new forms. Replicating
information patterns seem to be the lifeblood of the singularity, so
they will definitely prosper. Whenever there is dense communications
and host systems they will have the opportunity to grow. Possibly new
levels of complexity can appear (like the 'kemes' mentioned in
_Sailing Bright Eternity_ by Gregory Benford: predatory
intelligent memes).

Yes. One could imagine a pluralist singularity, where diversity grows
exponentially as previous memes are amplified, mutated and selected
faster, or an uniform singularity where somebody actually succeeds in
becoming a SI and turning the solar system into food. In the later
(and partially the former) case the memes and values present will set
the future course.

Values.

I always think the best things about computer specifications are that they
give one a chance to have a good laugh at the primitiviness of technology
when reread in x years time. (Where x increasing tends to zero.)

As for Negroponti: didn't you find his book a little lacking in enthusiasm
or inventiveness? Perhaps it's just because of the audience at which it is
aimed.

Re: Negriponti... and "Being Digital".  I usually read the book. This was a

one of my favorite Athiest/ Skeptics Penn Jillette.  

The book/tape is not trying to be as cutting edge as Drexler, IMHO.  

More along the lines of Bill Gates' "The Road Ahead" without quite as much
clarity of thought and details.

In another thread, I just finished "WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A LIBERTARIAN, A
Personal View" by Charles Murray.

Wonderful, clear thinking, well expressed fundamentals of personal
responsibility and freedom.
This is the guy that wrote the controversial "The Bell Curve", which I have
and intend to wade thru and skim.  It is about 2 cm thick, and I am trying to
average 3 books a week and still have a life and become a millionaire, so I
have learned the art of skimming.

I would like to add two other examples, first is Sly Stallones film
"Demolition Man" for it's depiction of Cryonics as something very
likely to occur in the near future, as well as technologically
straightforward.

The second is one I've never seen mentioned in these discussions
before, the "garage-tech" cryonic suspension in an episode of
"Miami-Vice". Briefly, Crockett and Tubs break into an office where
they expect to find a drug lab, and instead find a garage-tech
cryonics lab containing a hollywood class dewar (complete with
viewing window) containing a missing regae star "Romilard Nevin".

 They are told that Nevin died as the result of fugu poisioning
during his tour in Japan (Nihon) and has been in suspension ever
since. The interesting part comes as they reveal they have
discovered the cure for pufferfish toxin and are preparing to
revive Nevin. When asked if this is possible, the assistant says
"of course" and holds up a large three ring binder, "it's all right
here."

The rest is really to good to miss, so I won't spoil it.

The Invisibles 

The best comic to come out in many years.  Beautiful art and writing.
Chock-full of dynamic optimism and spontaneous order.  Plus plenty of sex,
drugs, and cool technology.  The good guys and the bad guys fight over which
way the Singularity is going to go: total freedom or total control. 

Battle Angel Alita

In the last few issues alone, the author has raised questions like: are
cyborgs morally inferior to all-flesh humans immortalized by nanotechnology?
What's the moral status of people whose minds have been uploaded to
computers which are then placed in the brain case of their original body?
How can we know we're not in a perfectly simulated world?  All these
questions and more settled by grotesquely violent hand-to-hand combat!
(sorry about that last, but hey, it's a comic book...)

Transmetropolitan 

Only one issue out, so it's a little hard to tell.  The author is a fan of
spontaneous order and utility fog.

None of these are suitable for children, not even a little bit.

No, the claim is you could be sued for ASKING certain kinds of
information of an applicant.

This I find very easy to believe. For example, simply asking an
employee or potential employee how old they are is liable to get you
into serious trouble these days. Stupid? Yes. True? Also yes.

Now, why don't certain things like IQ appear on resumes? One claim
might be because a) most applicants don't know, and b) you'll never be
able to get employees to bother to find out if no one can ask the
information.

I'm not sure I believe that, though.

I'd say that a more rational explanation is that for any job that
actually requires intelligence, three minutes of phone interview do
far better than an IQ number can do for you. IQ is just too crude. I
suspect other far better screening tests could be derived (I have a
set of stock questions I ask interviewees with objective answers) but
at the moment there isn't one, at least not one that I could use in
*my* hiring decisions.

That wouldn't stop most of us. Hell, you can buy any sort of "illegal"
drug you want on the free ("black" is a dirty word) market.

The fact is that psychedelic drugs are (at very best) an aid to
self-exploration, and have no other impact. They certainly don't open
up some magical way to be far smarter than you already are.

However, that's not what I'm here to post about.

What I find really disturbing about this discussion is that we are
having it at all.  Half the people posting here are, quite frankly,
about as critical in their thinking as trepanned chihuahuas. This is
not the Extropians list of yore, where polymaths gathered to swap
INFORMED discussion.

Danny (<CALYX@aol.com>) and the rest are astounding to me. The
amount of junk they can post ("earth's polarity is going to reverse!
drugs are the way to observe other physical dimensions! 50 pounds of
raw meat are lodged in your stomach RIGHT NOW!") doesn't seem to have
much of a bound. Stuff that wouldn't make it past the bullshit
detector of a kid with high school chemistry, biology and physics is
posted as though it were something worth discussing.

Yes, I'm an elitist of sorts. I'd rather hear Carl Feynman woolgather
about ways to build craft to explore the Sun's atmosphere than hear
the empty-headed wannabes mumble along. Why? Because Carl is a better
thinker and his speculations are thus far more interesting to read,
that's why. I'd say that Carl is, in fact, "better" than "Danny", at
least at informed speculation on scientific topics of interest to me.

(And no, I wouldn't mind at all if the fuzzy-headed crowd felt
insulted and left. In fact, I highly encourage them to do so.)

I've been researching this recently. There are two new products out that
claim to provide connected-speech recognition, and a third from a VAR who
says they've got the offline dictation-later recognition scenario solved.

The two companies are Dragon Systems and IBM. 

I'll post more in another message soon, late for work.

Critical point is noise floor of the sound card.

Current leader for s/n: Turtle Beach Pinnacle or Fiji.
Downside: Turtle Beach is a small company, sometimes has to
orphan products rather than write new drivers for them.

You can also check comp.speech newsgroup, it's buzzing.

OOH! OOH! I get to grind one of my favorite axes!

I agree the drek content has gone way up.  I think some of this comes from
the Extropian commitment to dynamic "optimism".  Really, I maintain the the
purpose of our brains is to figure out what is going on in the world, whether
that's good, bad, or indifferent.  A positive attitude towards problems is
handy; but it's very possible to be too enthusiastic about ideas or
possibilities and ignore reality.  

I've spent seven years of my life working for companies that made medical
devices.  Both have ended up making relative failures.  In both cases, the
prime problem was that the management was too optimistic and not realistic
enough.  Both devices would have ended up much better if there had been some
hard-nosed attention to the devices' defects, because they were soluble.  But
the people were so convinced they'd invented the greatest thing since sliced
bread nobody bothered to check.  

Anyway, I see the same with the trepanned chihuahuas here.  They get so
excited about some wierd idea like UFOs being extraterrestial aliens that
they forget that being cool doesn't equal being true.  (Really, being true is
the best kind of cool anyway, but that's another story.)

It's not just UFOs, though.  There's no more evidence for diamondoid nanotech
than for UFOs.  Drexler and some others have raised the possibility and
addressed some simple issues like building gears; UFOlogists have raised the
possibility and addressed some simple issues like sheilding.  While there
isn't much negative evidence against nanotech, there is some evidence against
ETs in the form of the Fermi paradox; but it's not overwhelming.  And, after
all, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

I'd call myself a "dynamic realist".  I really think that would be a better
term for Extropians, at least as it was when I got into it.  Perhaps that
sort of name would discourage the trepanned chihuahuas a bit and encourage
the rest of us to at least wear hard helmets when we start acting that way.

     Hi Rudi,
     
     Daytona sounds nice.  (I am from Tampa originally now in SF and was

     Anyway, I really appreciate your enthusiasm.  It is indeed an

     well on our way to singularity in no time!

Between the time of your death and infinity, the chances are you will be
resurrected in some form.  There are several ways in which this could happen.
 You could preserve your brain at the time of death and have it reanimated at
a later point, you could simply die and then at some point in the future
exist as a computer simulation or you could wait until you are a natural
rerun.

If time is infinite then theoretically every eventuality will occur an
infinite number of times.  Therefore, at some point we will all be
reincarnated in every possible form that can carry on our conscious mind.
 However, there is likely to be a very large amount of time between death and
resurrection, unless we are in control of the process (cryonics).  

For a rerun to occur (a being that develops so similar to yourself it carries
on your consciousness) the surrounding world would have to be exact in every
detail up to the point of your death (so that the being has the same memories
and 'thinks' it is you).  For transhumans this seems pointless as you gain
nothing from it, it does hold one interesting point to all those looking
forward to an afterlife.  They will live, but they won't know they've died.

Simulation as a posthumans recollection of the past, or as an experiment
could also rerun dead minds.  After simulating the consciousness of our
chosen victim, we could then put them into a steady state of evolution to
become fellow posthumans.

Preserving yourself at the time of death gives you a smaller time frame in
which to be reincarnated and would hopefully mean you'd have someone around
to tell you what happened.

Not dying in the first place seems like a good idea, but whatever happens
you're not going to die.  However, you might be resurrected in the year
98,000,023, be reincarnated in a mirror universe (not that you would know) or
be subjected to some nasty multiple consciousness paradoxes.

In short, even if we are all immortal, it's better to be in control of your
own resurrection (especially if time turns out to be finite, in which case
we're all screwed).

"Qualitative" and "quantitative" are differences in precision.  These terms
are somewhat arbitrary and may be losing something here.

I may have missed something, but I fail to see how psychedelics would
improve the technology experience in any useful sense.  Technology must
beget better, faster technology because my ability to think and create
using technology far exceed the capabilities of current technology.  All
psychedelics aside, humans have the natural ability to devise interesting
and useful scenarios that exceed the bounds of current technology (read
that as "imagination").  The rapid growth of technology means the eventual
realization of everything I can conceive of creating.  This alone is reason
enough for the forward progress of technology and is as qualitative as
anything I can think of.

My basic problem with the "psychedelic tribal etc. is qualitatively better"
meme, is that it tends to limit real advancement by promoting the beauty of
mysticism over the beauty of understanding ("ignorance is bliss" vs.
"applied knowledge can lead to bliss with hard work").  Psychedelic-rich
tribal communities solve few real problems.  Their subjective
("qualitative") experiences lend little towards promoting the objective
quality of their lives, other than as a form of escapism perhaps.

I wrote that the AIC and "depth" measures of complexity are strictly
syntactic, whereas semantics basically involves categorization and
context.  

John K Clark replied:
<I don't think the two are as strictly segregated as some think and I
don't you need humans of even intelligence for semantics.  A sequence
of amino acids MEANS a shape, the way the resulting protein folds up
in water at the temperature and acidity found in life.>

OK.  I should have written that these two measures are *mostly*
syntactic.

http://turing.pacss.binghamton.edu/dietrich/table-of-contents.html
provides an outline of a new book called _Thinking Computers and
Virtual Persons_ edited by Eric Dietrich.  One of the papers is called
"Syntactic Semantics" by William J. Rapaport.  The following is from
the summary of this paper:

< Rapaport argues, contra Searle, that computers can understand
natural language and thus be humanly intelligent . . . Rapaport agrees
that computers are syntactical, but argues that syntax suffices for
semantics, hence computers are not purely syntactical. The internal
relationships between representations turns out to be sufficient for
semantics. Rapaport's arguments are made all the more compelling
because he and his colleagues have a system that understands some
English.>

This seems similar to your argument using the DNA code.  I havent
read the Rapaport paper, and you both seem to have a point that there
is some semantics in the syntax, however, I intuitively question
whether *thats all* there is to semantics. (In the same spirit that I
question statements like "evolution is stupid" or "evolution is
blind".  And, no, Im not talking about God or spirits, Im talking
about levels of control in cybernetics.)

I wrote (without really thinking through the implications) that
complexity could possibly be measured by the number of different
functional relationships a system can maintain, and might further be
weighted by the number of functions it can perform simultaneously.

John replied:
<Not a useful definition because we can't know how many relationships
a  system can have.>

A good point - I wasnt really thinking about how *all* those
relationships could be *measured*.  Instead, I relied on Bruce
Edmonds' somewhat more formal definition of complexity: "It is
proposed that complexity can usefully be applied only to constructions
within a given language".

John replied:
<A language doesn't need an observer, consider the Genetic code. The
nucleotide triplet CAU in messenger RNA  is a "real" object it MEANS
the amino acid histidine but I grant you, only in the context
(language) of life, their are no special chemical characteristics that
relate one to the other.>

Perhaps life is the observer of that language and organisms are the
speakers.  My point, and perhaps Edmonds point, is that when we
examine any descriptive language (or formal system) *from the outside*
there is always something at another level that the language fails to
describe.

My quote from Edmonds was:
<A definition of complexity is proposed which can be summarised as
"that property of a language expression which makes it difficult to
formulate its overall behaviour even when given almost complete
information about its atomic components and their inter-relations.>

John replied:
<This could be AIC or depth, I can't tell which because Edmonds
doesn't say what he means by "difficult". 

One of the main points of my post was that there are other measures of
complexity besides just the two you mentioned.  Edmonds specifically
describes at least five measures: Computational Complexity, Kolmogorov
Complexity, Bennett's Logical Depth, Lfgren's Interpretation and
Descriptive Complexity, Kauffman's number of conflicting constraints.

John continued:
<At any rate, by this definition the gibberish produced by a monkey
would certainly be more complex than any article in the journal
"Nature". I want a definition that is not the opposite of our
intuitive understanding of the word, I haven't found it.>

Because, in the monkey example at least, you havent described the
system completely enough.  The monkey has no knowledge of the language
for which the typewriter is a recording device.  So, the monkey plays
with it and produces gibberish.  If I were to sit down at a piano
(having no musical knowledge), Id just produce a cacophony rather
than a symphony because I dont understand the language of the piano.

Im reminded of something Hara Ra wrote in the post you were
originally responding to:
< Mathematical theorems and conjectures are statements of how to
generate and investigate strings finite in length, grammar and syntax
which describe the mathematical objects and operations in relation to
same (the strings representing the objects only!)>

Im not very competent at either chemistry or math, but you seem to be
seeking something similar to describe human-level intelligence.  Im
suggesting that there are many levels of complexity operating in
nature and that a reduction of the kind you are suggesting might be
useful for some purposes (possibly for making upload copies) but
wouldnt suffice for more complex (oh oh, theres that word again!)
goals (such as the automorphing of that upload once it was
established).

Not necessarily, if the probability of the eventuality decays to zero
fast enough.  In particular, if the universe is open, time may be infinite
in the sense that the universe goes on forever, but it may be that the
probability of life existing decreases towards zero, as argued by Tipler.
The net result is that your chance of reincarnation may be small.

However an open universe is thought (based on my dim understanding of
cosmology) likely to be infinite in spatial extent, with an infinite
number of stars and galaxies, all sharing our own laws of physics.
Your reasoning would then apply equally well to (non-re-) incarnations
occuring in an infinite number of ways across the infinity of space.

Not at all, you could be created "from scratch" as an exact match of your
current body/mind.  There is no reason why the surrounding world would have
to match.  You would experience a discontinuity if the external world
changed, of course.

This is only one possible circumstance, to resurrect ("surrect?") a person
and allow him to live out a simulated existence which may match his earlier
life.  Would they notice if the simulation did not actually match what
happened before?  Not clear this question is meaningful!

Sure, this is the basic thesis of Tipler's "Physics of Immortality".  Also
similar to Hans Moravec's essay in an old issue of Extropy magazine.  Ever
hear of that mag?

The real reason is because the universe may not actually be infinite in
either time or space, or conditions distant from our own may be sufficiently
different that we cannot expect to experience infinite (or even many)
incarnations.

Tipler tries to argue that your resurrections will mostly be positive, but
not many people found it convincing.

If the infinities do exist, you can only control some fraction of your
incarnations.  I don't see any way to stop someone from reincarnating all
possible past humans and putting them into Hell.

This sounds a bit conspiracy-theorist to me.  How exactly would all
social institutions be hurt by behavior that helps people understand
how gender is constructed?

Are there any books which do describe this well?  If not, maybe you
should write one.  Academics can hardly be expected to put in forty
years like you did before they analyze things.  So its up to people
like you to set them straight.  

I am especially interested in this issue because there's a good chance
I'll be a professor of political science within the next two years.

Yup.  A high quality open list can stay that way only if participants
are willing to take the time to discourage those who make low quality
posts.  This can be via a moderator, flaming, careful critiques,
obscure language, an appearance of boring topics, or whatever.  Of
course some of these techniques are more "civilized" than others.

Academic research indicates that even one hour interviews are much
worse predictors of success on a job that IQ scores.  So either you
are mistaken about your ability, or you are a very exceptional
interviewer.

Robin, I hate to point this out, but your either-or is incomplete.

Other possibilities exist, including: the academic research is faulty,
the interviews are of differing kinds, "success" is defined differently,
"a job" is defined differently. Those are just off the top of my head.
"If you can't think of at least three reasons, you're usually not
thinking hard enough." :)

I certainly agree that interviewing is not commonly taught and is a
bit like playing poker.

This raises another axis of potential polarization: is the Extropians
list for proselytization or is it a clubhouse?

I don't happen to be a dues-paying member--if it would really improve the
s/n, I'd be willing to consider that *and* a "freshness-dated token quota"
scheme, together.

Perry, I think you're looking back through rose-colored glasses here.  I
haven't read Extropians in almost 5 years, and I distinctly remember you
complaining back then about how bad the list had gotten.  "I didn't start
this list to have to argue basic science and basic libertarianism!", or
something along those lines.  So, the list might still have quite a bit of
drivel, but I don't think it has gotten worse and I don't think it's fair
to tell all the young'uns how great it was in the golden age.

The problem of s/n in virtual communities is a hard one, and we haven't
solved it yet (though not for want of trying).  Any day now I'm going to
follow up on Robin's reference to the Low Golden Willow filter, and see if
that works.  There was also some talk about an internal Extropy idea for
rated posts, and Robin has a token payment mechanism that would be fun to
try.  The filtering system that we had back in '92 didn't satisfy me in the
end, I think because it seemed to break a sense of shared community.  And
maybe the approach of yelling at people who post stupid things will work,
though you have more energy and flair for it than I do.

Later,
Drea

P.S. Does Extropy limit list membership to dues-paying members?  I would
expect that to limit the people here just to troll.

Who put you in charge? Since you didn't mention my name specifically, I 
cannot assume you were referring to me.  However, if you believe any of 
my posts have been lacking in critical thinking, please point them out.  
I agree with you that there is a lack of reasoning among some who make 
posts on this list.

I too enjoy hearing Carl Feynman's posts. And yes, I prefer to hear more 
established scientific extroplations on this list. I must say however, 
that it is people like you that give me the creeps! As we approach the 
singularity, I hope that those ahead will have more tolerance of those 
behind, than you do.  Otherwise I fear, we will end up with some nasty 
form of nanotechnological ubergoo from the likes of you!

By the way, its going to take a lot more than elitist posts such as 
yours to get me off this list.  In fact, just on principle I feel like 
posting all sorts of pseudo-scientific and non-sensical drivel. But 
lucky for you I have better manners and will spare you such agony.

Cheers,

Bobby Whalen

I have occasionally had to interview people, and I don't feel that I
have been very successful at it.  Good interviewing (on both sides of
the table) is extremely important these days.  It can give a tremendous
competitive advantage if you can identify the superior candidates in
hiring.  Anybody here willing to offer suggestions or books which help
teach these skills?

That is deeply a matter of opinon.  I happen to enjoy my computer, my 
smart drugs, and our expanding perceptual/conceptual universe via Space 
Telescopes and Nanoprobes.  However, I do NOT enjoy having to work 40+ 
hours to maintain it.  Although my job is quite interesting and 
enjoyable for the most part, I would rather be spending more of my time 
in liesure pursuits. Obviously tribal cultures have not advanced their 
postion, but they have no impelling reason to do so when the majority of 
their time is spent having sex and fun.

The reason I'm not droping my clothes and running to the rain forest is 
because I basically agree with you as to the process of maximizing ones 
extropy.  However if work is the be all and end all of our extropic 
pursuits, we need a serious re-assement!  I for one, plan on taking my 
nanotechnoligcal self(s) into the farest reaches of the cosmos in seach 
of the biggest parties I can find!

My future is maximum fun, minimum work!  I work hard only as is 
necessary to increase my extropy and no more.  I plan on surving the end 
of whatever happens to this universe - not so I have to work more, but 
work less.  I plan on tweaking the physical constants as much as 
possible, to ensure that whatever basement universes I create will 
maximize fun, minimize work/fuss.

If it wasn't for the tribal cultures I've spent time with, and the 
psychedelics I have imbibed, I don't think I would appreacite the subtle 
point I am trying to get across here.  Its the difference between a 
computer artist and their tools.  As a computer artist you are in the 
conudrum of having to *balance* your time between keeping up with the 
latest tools of the trade and actually creating something with them.  
Balance is the key word here. Tribal cultures have a lot to teach us 
about balance.  That is my opinion.

Warm Regards,

Bobby Whalen

It is strange that libertarians - who should have a grasp of the nature
of spontaneous orders and the nature of civil society - should somehow
see an unwritten constitution - like Britain's as somehow less real or
effective than a written one.  And it is certainly not just
"politicians" who refer to our constitution - it's the subject of
countless academic books and courses. (To be perfectly accurate, of
course, one should add that parts of the British constitution are indeed
written).  Walter Bagehot's The English Constituion (Kegan, Paul,
Trench, Trubner, London, 1867; 2nd edn, 1872/Oxford University Press,
1928/Fontana Library, Collins, London, 1963) is still worth reading.
(Bagehot was a classical liberal at the conservative end of the liberal
spectrum). Also still worth reading is W. Ivor Jennings, The Law and the
Constitution (University of London Press, 1933). George Burton Adams,
Constitutional History of England (Jonathan Cape, London, 1921; 2nd edn,
revised by Robert L. Schulyer - who was also a classical liberal - 1935)
is good and has an implicitly classical liberal slant.  Harold
Stannard's The Two Constitutions: A Comparative Study of the British and
American Constitutional Systems (Adam & Charles Black, London, 1949) is
also indispensible.  A more recent study (by a conservative) of the
state of the British constitution is Philip Norton, The Constitution in
Flux, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1982.

My own essay "The Case Against a Bill of Rights", South African Freedom
Review, 2(2), Summer 1989, pp. 19-33 (photocopy available from me at the
address below for $1 in US cash) provides a good (in my view!)
discussion of why what is really imortant to preserve liberty is the
nature of the civil society and its "deep structures" of belief and
social practice/tradition. What is written in a constitution (eg the
quite liberal constitution of the old USSR, or the current US
constitution for that matter) is far less important in
creating/preserving liberty than the constituion of society itself.

I've been using a filter on extropians for some time.  Only people who
seem to be making useful contributions (in my not-so-humble opinion)
get through.  (It's a positive filter, not a negative one.)
Unfortunately, when the people I respect stoop to word-throwing
contests with the people I can't see, I have to wade through the empty
words from one side of the snow-ball fight.

When someone I respect responds to someone I didn't know before who
had an interesting comment or question, I often remember to add the
newcomer to my list, and I start seeing more messages.  I occasionally
miss an interesting part of a discussion, but not often enough to make
me want to change the way I read the list.

Wasn't there a thread on S/N ratios a while back, with some proposals

The Extropian is IMO dedicated to the advancement of humanity, that
is to the idea of improvement. Pseudo-science is a serious diversion,
in several ways. It's perfectly acceptable to invoke new physics,
but you must do so explicitly. Otherwise, you are simply exploring
an alternate universe that has no relationship to the improvement
of humanity.
   Topics that I have no interest in include:
 Roswell (would require an unrealistically large conspiracy)
 Abrupt pole shift (violates law of conservation of angular momentum)

In general, I simply skip this garbage without reading it.

I find Negroponti one of our main cheerleaders for technology.  I

of the important memes in it--the essays are compiled from Wired 
magazine and meet meets mainstream style requirements only.  In the

activity for him due to dyslexia, so I give him serious points for 
producing a book in the first place.

I've never worked at a company that had everything right, but a few came
close.  Most of the companies that had dynamic payscales were small
consulting groups and the like.  In these cases, it is actually rather
obvious since the client companies can be billed for each type of task as a
separate line item and rated according to market.  This makes it easier for
the payroll system to reflect these changes for both direct and indirect
costs.  The only negative side is that these companies tended to have a
more rigid management structure and technique.

One notable company for which I have worked a relatively lengthy time is
Sesame Software, Inc. out of Scotts Valley, CA.  In this company the rate
is usually fixed (although not always) per project and not per task.  You
work when you want to and can work on pretty much any open task you want
to.  Most employees can get medical and 401k, etc. even if they work on a
somewhat transient basis.  Telecommuting is generally the rule.  They will
gladly teach you new skills "on-the-job" if it is within the scope of what
they are currently doing.  A pretty good company overall with virtually no
bureaucratic heirarchy, although lately the company has been waffling a bit
IMO.  I still work for them on a part-time basis.

>And how was the type of work and market value determined?

The types of work were broken down by significant category.  The software
business has numerous obvious divisions.  (Java programmer, Oracle
programmer, Oracle DBA, Unix C/C++, SAP programmer, NT applications, Web
design, Unix TCP/IP apps, etc. )

The breakdown for various projects and market value is usually negotiated
between the client, the management, and the employees.  These keep the
figures at a level that is somewhat average for Silicon Valley.  Most of
the basic market values are arrived at over time and are adjusted
occasionally to reflect the changing market for that skill.  It isn't
something that changes on a weekly basis.  Usually if one asks around, they
can get a feel for the going price for a particular skill.

My first experience with transhuman technology came out of reading
science fiction. Naturally, when I finally encountered people who were
actively pursuing these technologies, I had no choice but to be excited.
Sometimes, when reading the posts of Carl Feynman, Anders Sandberg, and
the other highly credible scientific minds on this list, I still feel
like I'm reading SF -- future-things desirable and unfathomable at the
same time. 

I have learned much from these people, even though I have no arsenal
from which to debate them. 

However, at the same time, and for the same reason, the level of
intelligence on this list is so high that I am hardly surprised when one
references a pet theory for no other obvious extropian reason than to
merely pick the able minds that surface here. Accordingly, some of these
theories are pseudo-science and it is up to the knowledgeable to label
them such (with rational reasons, of course). I might add that a modicum
of restraint is generally necessary to end a public thread in this
manner. To avoid flame-wars, wouldn't a private e-mail be the best way
to discipline the offender of your sensibilities? Unless, as Perry
hinted, your aim is to insult them into unsubscribing, I would be apt to
say that enough private e-mail would be sufficient to shut most people
up.     

I dunno, maybe I'm too dynamically optomistic :-)

That's very true. Perhaps it is the immutable character of the
IQ score that makes people afraid of it. If you are low on education
you can get some more, at least in principle; but if you have a 
low IQ that means you are stupid and there's nothing that can be
done. Then there is also the embarrasing racial aspect of it. Many
people believe that it would have bad consequences for society if
a parameter became generally recognised as importantly correlated
with performance when the average value of that parameter differs
strongly between different ethnic groups.
As for the applicant who puts his IQ on the application form, he
would of course not be prosecuted, but maybe the employer would, if
he used such information on a large scale. As far as I know, it is
actually not legal in the USA to use IQ-like tests in hiring 
decisions, unless that specific test has been specifically proven
to be a reliable predictor of the specific task the man is hired
for. Developing a specialised task test, and proving its reliablity,
is usually so expensive and problematic that companies prefer to
use other methods.
I don't know about the situation in other countires where it might
be fully legal.

Ah, thank you.  I knew there was another system I was forgetting.  What

I think it is largely intended as a clubhouse.  Mailing lists are pretty
inefficient methods of proselytization, but they can be good venues for
current believers to keep in touch and keep up-to-date.  The preaching and
introduction can then be left to the magazine, or to our individual contact
with Outsiders(tm).

I was mostly curious, since someone had suggested Genen might be trolling
for flame responses, and the dues requirement would be evidence about the
likelihood of that.  I agree with you that charging for admission would not
in and of itself be sufficient help for s/n.

you really should read that "Valley of the Nerds" article, I posted the http
address for it a while back but you can just netsearch for it, a few
different pages have it posted... it really does bring up some interesting
points and names some big names in the computer industry as psychedelic
users... according to the article the founder of Lotus Corp. says that his
business plan wouldn't exist as it does without the use of recreational
chemicals... another example in the article is a programmer in silicon
valley, who was stuck on a problem for quite some time then did some
psychedelic drug and while under the influence was able to solve the
problem... psychedelic drugs are tools, it all depends on how you use
them... anyone can pick up a paint brush, not everyone can paint...
basically the way I see it is that psychedelic drugs make people think in
ways that you normally don't, it's like natural selection, psychedelics
cause mutated thoughts, which usually are worthless, just like any mutation,
but occasionally there's the one mutant idea that is revoultionary... just
like the mutation that gave fish feet... most of all psychedelics are
definitely not for everyone, and for the most part warp your mind... but it
really is in how you use them, and to say that they are worthless,
specifically in western ideals is a sad deception... I am a technofile, I
consider my self an extropian, and being an atheist am not very spiritual...
but to say there's nothing to psychedelics, and to call cultures that use
psychedelics failures because they don't have gadgets is really an
expression of xenophobic ignorance... ok I'm rambling (not like that stops
many of you) but that's quite enough for now, so to sum it up, 

PSYCHEDELICS - NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME WISHING ALL THE
STRAITEDGE PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE THE LIST SO DON'T WISH THAT UPON US 'FUZZY
HEADED' ONES 

and also read that article... psychedelics did have an impact on the
computer industry... sure most sys admins and clean livers, but really sys
admins and engineer really aren't shit, it's the R&D people, innovators,
pioneers that impact the industry and among them use of psychedlics is
higher in proportion than to the rest of western society, no I don't have
any numbers or statistics, just what I've seen and people I know... ok yes
I'm still rambling... bis spater all

"consumer protection" laws for New York.]

I suspect this is true, and that is part of the problem that so many on
this list have with these regulations.  Why don't we take the IRS rules
about contractors as one example?  You said to Perry that we could
comfortably expect these regulations to adapt to suit organizations as
they
change.  In fact, the IRS tightened the rules for when you can call
someone
a contractor just as many companies have started to use contracting
heavily.  I have been asked by firms, for whom I believed I was clearly
contracting, if I would please sign on as a temporary employee just to
avoid IRS issues.

If contract relationships are the wave of the future, why is the IRS
making
it so difficult to operate this way?  It's relatively easy to explain if
you take a public choice approach and assume that the IRS wants to
maximize
it's revenue and power with little regard to the effect on the economy.
How would you interpret the situation?

Dear Andrea and other fellow Extropians:

It seems that the IRS regulations as it relates to independent contractors
is as complex as it is because of the abuse of the independent contractors
provisions by many small, virtual (and fly-by-night) organizations. 

Particularly, I've found that a large number of sales and migrant farm
organizations tend to improperly hire young people as independent
contractors in order to avoid many labor regulations. In an inordinately
large number of incidents these young and quite unsophisticated people are
exploited and ultimately abandoned without any assets by these
unscrupulous companys throughout the country. Regrettably, the US
Department of Labor and the IRS lack the staffing to prevent most of these
horrible (approaching slavery) human rights abuses. 

As with many things the reality is far more complex and brutal than the
ideal and the theory.

Think about it some more.

Enjoy!!!

Exploited how?  Is fraud being committed?  If so, wouldn't existing
fraud law be a better tool to use against these people than
regulations that obstruct the innocent business relationships of
older and more sophisticated people who are not engaging in fraud?
If fraud is *not* being committed, then perhaps I may once again
trouble you by asking you for specifics?  Perhaps an example or
two?

Strong words.  Perhaps you might mention which human rights are
being abused in these cases.  But why should these situations be
the concern of the federal government?  Might not these situations
be handled better at the state level?  I'm just troubled by your
mention of the US Dept of Labor and the IRS, without a thought for
the responsibility of the states to operate against crimes in their
territories.  Only I'm not sure which crimes are being committed,
because although you hinted heavily that crimes were being committed,
you didn't actually name any (except slavery, which these purported
misdeeds only "approach").

I am troubled by my use of the word "situations" above.  But I find
I have no recourse to any other word, because your hints have no
substance behind them.  There are these unpleasant *situations*,
don't you know, which can't be named or even described in detail,
and it's because of these that the IRS must harrass corporations
in Silicon Valley who hire contractors for terms longer than 18
months.  There's a specific example of how these "situations" and
the regulations that are supposed to redress them affect my life.
I have a rather comfortable contract right now, a potentially
long-term one, but I just recently found out that my client will
have to give me the heave-ho after 18 months, willy-nilly, or suffer
from IRS persecution.  How this helps the poor innocent children
who are being exploited in Oklahoma (or whatever you are vaguely
hinting at, Mr. Genen), I have no idea.

Are there any books which do describe this well?  If not, maybe you
should write one.  Academics can hardly be expected to put in forty
years like you did before they analyze things.  So its up to people
like you to set them straight.  

I am especially interested in this issue because there's a good chance

I confess that my attention is limited, too, Mr. 
Forste, and that in my experience, simple, direct
speech is prized by most of the people I respect.

Mr. Genen seems to be more attuned to making
orotund, supercilious-sounding pronouncements 
than to direct response. Rather like excerpts from
"Yes, Minister". His proud yet veiled description 
of his years spent crafting an ever-more-snug 
creche of laws for all of us to be cradled in
may point to a cause. OTOH...

Perhaps this obliqueness is evidence that we
really are blessed with a stranger in our midst.
"Didn't know what principled argumentation was..."

Possibly he knows how to decode the 18 hours of
"noise" recorded by a certain head-mounted camera.

Then again, the best way to yank someone's chain
is to pretend you're not doing it. Diplomatic
provocation, more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger, 
contrived urbanity, that sort of thing
I suggest we all give Mr. Genen enough chain 
that tension is hard to apply. If it's just a 
"brainsizing" exercise, he'll tire of it 
and wander off soon, if not soon enough.

Meanwhile, step up preparations for Plan B.

In this case, I wish to kvetch.

For my part, I have refrained from entering into the service of
my government. Would that all my fellows would do me such
favors. Consider yourself advised and informed.

Unfortunately, I don't think that there is any such generic law.
There is a recent trend to use "graphology" as part of the
hiring decision. Graphology is a pseudoscience whose practioners
claim to be able to determine personality traits of the writer
of a handwriting sample, based not on the words but on how the
letters are formed. We also use lie detectors, even though
studies have shown them to be completely unreliable.

I've been reading science fiction for most of my life. I read more SF
than
all other categories combined, and I read a lot. the family budget for
books
exceeds $200/month. Good science fiction is characterized by careful
treatment of science: the author knows that you cannot go FTL unless
you invoke a new law of physics. An SF book in which the earth's poles
moved abruptly would be dismissed by the entire SF community, with
scathing reviews, unless it included a reasonable description of a
mechanism to account for the angular momentum and the absence of
catastropic vulcanism.

One great thing about science fiction is that it's a very enjoyable
way to learn a lot of science. I'm no more willing to read SF
with bogus science in it than I am to read posts on this list with
bogus science in them. I am, however, more than willing to discuss
the relevant real science, including questions from participants whose
scientific education is incomplete, when an Extropian topic
warrants it (which is often.) I'm weak in chemistry, and I've been
asking for help on this list about the use of a STM to hook
adamantine building bloks together.

This will be my last post on this META topic, which is now beginning
to clutter the list. I'll shift to private e-mail if needed.

Subject: Neanderthals and Art (long and speculative)
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I've been giving some thought to Neanderthals, language, art, and their
extinction.  I do see a way that a lack or art could have put Neanderthals
(or any other hominids) at a major disadvantage vs. Sapiens, if Sapiens was
indeed the only one to care about art.  It enlarges on my suggestion earlier
that Neanderthals were held back by socialization rather than stupidity or
inability to communicate.  Since this is just an idea, I'm sorry I can't
provide many references.  

I hope I'm not too much of a TC (trepanned chihuahua) here :-)

One suggestion for the value of art is that it serves for sexual selection.
 This is certainly the case for a few other species; bower birds strive to
build beautiful nests and mockingbirds strive to develop large vocabularies
of mocked songs.  It's also at least part of the game for humans today; we
dress up, dance, get flowers, sing love songs, etc. as part of courtship.
 Let's suppose that other hominid species used other things, like appearance,
for sexual selection.  

Now Neanderthals, and presumably Erectus, had a social organization similar
to other social great apes - relatively small groups of tribes.  Presumably
these groups related to each other as other apes did - minimally or with
hostility, save for occaisional exchange of mating partners.  I do have to
mention bonobos as an exception, in which different groups do often get
along.

After all, if one male Neaderthal encountered another from a different tribe,
what would they have to gain by interacting?  They're unlikely to have much
to trade - both will have similar, limited, technologies and hence similar
items.  If they can communicate (not a given), they could exchange knowledge,
but most knowledge will be of their own ranges and it's obviously
double-edged to tell a potential rival how to forage or survive in your own
territory.  Good general knowledge is pretty hard to come by and even harder
to check - if one gave another a bum tip, he wouldn't know until much later,
and checking tips often can be risky even later.

Now let's suppose that proto-sapiens developed an sexual selection for art
during the isolation in which the species sapiens developed.  Rampant sexual
selection during speciation is quite possible, particularly if the species is
pretty well adapted to the conditions it's in.  Irish deer, whose horns got
so large they drove themselves into extinction, are an example.  It would
explain our funny voice boxes - bad for choking, but real good at carrying a
tune.

Now what happens when two Sapiens from different tribes meet?  Unlike the
Neanderthals, they *do* have something to trade - their art.  They can swap
stories, share tunes, recount jokes, trade clothes (maybe), share designs,
etc.  If they do, each goes home to his or her tribe a little better equipped
to joust in the sexual selection.  Plus, they can check the traded items at
the point of transaction - is the song catchy, the story moving, the design
pretty?  They've got a built-in protection from shoddy merchandise.

Now while humans don't always "all get along", this provides an opportunity
for cooperation between members of different groups quite absent in any
modern ape, and possibly in any other hominid as well.  While other hominids
might as well be mildly xenophobic (nothing to gain from dealings), sapiens
benefit from having friends in other tribes to keep an ear out for the latest
trends, as it were.  So instead of family groups or small tribes of up to a
few dozen, humans are organized into meta-tribes with hundreds or perhaps
even thousands of members.

The real killer, of course, comes from the combination of poetry/song/epigram
with verbal meaning - the oral tradition.  Over time, you will tend to see
catchy and meaningful combine.  These oral traditions travel freely over the
meta-tribes.  While oral traditions do contain a lot of drek, people want to
teach their children true and useful things and so oral traditions contain a
lot of truth as well.

So what happens when the isolation is breached and Sapiens faces off with
Erectus, Heidelbergensis, Neanderthal, and possibly other hominids we don't
know about?  Well, the other hominids were apparently stronger; those brow
ridges were probably handy in a fight, and Erectus at least might well have
been a better runner.  But their small isolated social groups can't mantain
nearly the knowledge base of the Sapiens meta-tribes, and based on human
history, those meta-tribes will tend to get together if it comes to a fight.
 Neanderthal was probably more than a match for Sapiens 1-on-1; but 1-on-10
and Neanderthal would have been bird food.  They'd have been outcompeted
and/or outfought.

This doesn't require that the other hominids lack languages.  Neanderthal in
particular had quite a big brain.  Human children spontaneously invent
languages to communicate with each other if not provided with any (and
sometimes even then).  That kind of linguistic facility would have been quite
handy for Neanderthal or any other hominid, and they might well have had it.
 It's just that without art they would tend not to have a social system that
would best make use of their ability to communicate.

*End of main point*
*Major digression and TC alert*

As I write this, my Warcraft II game manual sits on the table in front of me.
 (Yeah, yeah, I have a real useful life)  As I look at the picture of the
evil orcs, I realize they are depicted with brow ridges, protruding jaws, and
a low forehead.  They eat meat, they are violent and xenophobic, they are
inhumanly strong, and they have no appreciation for beauty.  In other words,
they are passable caricatures of non-Sapiens hominids, as I am hypothesizing
them.  (the protruding canines are definitely wrong, and the green skin is
pretty unlikely).  Isn't it interesting how readily we assign an imaginary
evil so many features of our dead rivals?

No doubt Sapiens was equally unsavory to them.  I'm sure our heads would have
appeared deformed, and our bodies sickly.  Our preoccupation with art would
no doubt have seemed insane to them - humming to ourselves, arranging
seashells on strings (and I'll bet Neanderthal at least would have been smart
enough to notice).  So we saw them as orcs and they saw us as deformed
residents of an insane asylum.  No wonder we didn't interbreed much, if at
all.

I think that prior to responding to your question I need you to 
re-read the post you took it from.  The first paragraph summarizes 
Lorber's premise, and the second paragraph forms the logical 
extension vis-a-vis the response of societal institutions to a 
transgressive act.

Most people who have read Lorber have a strong reactions to her work, 
but she is widely acknowledged as a formidable intellect, with an 
impressive editorial and academic resume--throwing around terms like 
'conspiracy theorist' seems a shallow, almost knee-jerk response to 
her work.

Forrest: Have you read my Dynamic Optimism essay? Your comments suggest
that you haven't. The whole *point* of D.O. as distinguished from other
forms of optimism is its critical attitude. Being dynamically optimistic is
incompatible with ignoring reality. Critical thinking has always formed a
core part of being extropian.

Once you understand the difference between dynamic optimism and wishful
thinking, do you still disagree with D.O.? If so, what exactly do you
disagree with?

Thanks,

Max

NOTICE TO THE EXTROPIANS LIST:

My new policy: in order to make peace with the estimable Mr. Genen,
and avoid any charges of kvetching, I'll confine myself to responding
only to those parts of his missives with which I agree. If I do not post
a response, it may be that I think he's a self-described career meddler
in others' affairs, and proud of it, as we've both said; upon the other hand,
it may simply be that I'm too in awe of his worldliness and--what 
was the word?--pondering? to dream of adding a jot from my own 
callow, feckless, worthless few decades' experience of trying 
to create the future's writing and thinking tools, so that 
those who choose might be free to live science fiction themselves
rather than read it while living in chains--which bankrupt time, by the bye, 
some as the son of a politician, tells me among other things that 
much harm is done for others' good; excepting, of course, 
any law ever drafted by present company--I'm sure we needed every one 
of them more than we need(ed) a world hypertext library 
or a fundamental shift in how we perceive ethics.

Can you tell I've been reading 18th-century authors lately? :)

Forrest used an unconventional quoting system; I actually wrote the section
you're replying to.  No I haven't read the essay. We're all agreeing on being
positive and realistic, and on what we'd *like* "optimism" to mean.

>Once you understand the difference between dynamic optimism and wishful
>thinking, do you still disagree with D.O.? If so, what exactly do you
>disagree with?

The terminology.  "Optimism" does have something of a Polyanna connotation
(not to say that optimists are necessarily either Polyanna types or
unrealistic).  Qualifying optimism with "Dynamic" doesn't make me think "oh,
that's the levelheaded realistic type", nor would I think it would make
anybody else who hasn't read the essay think that.

When I read "dynamic optimism", I think of my last CEO, who always believed
the company would start making pots of money "next year" (it still hasn't).
 His optimism (here in the wishful thinking sense) certainly dynamically
adjusted to the vicissitudes of reality.  ;-)

Haven't seen them in concert, but I know the cuts you are referring to.  

"Insomnia" is really pretty good and sounds quite fresh next to the
plethora of stale stuff that seems to be emerging from that genre.  This CD
will likely become an addition to my already rapidly growing collection of
techno/trance/ambient/etc CDs. 


On a completely different music thread, I am once again in the business of
making music!  After bowing out several years ago for a number of reasons,
I recently forked over $15k to start accruing a ton of gear so that I could
satiate my more artistic side (I am an admitted audio gearhead).  With a
little patience and time I will soon be producing some decent cuts of my own.

If anyone on this list would like to collaborate musically, I would be more
than happy to do it.

I have thought about it and I strongly disagree with your assessment on a
number of levels.

First of all, I disagree with the concept in principle.  The abuses of a
tiny minority do not justify retribution against the entire population.
And I find the IRS regulations to be mostly irrelevant when applied to the
hypothetical scenario you describe above.  I'm not sure I even understand
how being an independent contractor makes migrant workers sudden victims of
abuse.

Secondly, I disagree with your statements as a matter of reality.  The IRS
could not give a damn about the miserably small amount of tax revenues (if
any) generated by migrant farm workers.  The IRS *does* care a great deal
about the tax revenue possibilities of the professional independent
contractor segment
which often generates taxable income in the 30+% range.  I don't think it
would be a stretch to say that what the IRS really wants is greater control
over the taxability and finances of independent contractors, who by their
nature enjoy significantly more (theoretical) flexibility in such matters.

And lastly, you make it sound like companies that hire people as
independent contractors are some type of new "bogeymen".  The crimes of the
IRS far, far exceed that of the companies they purportedly accuse.
It is simply inexcusable for the IRS to punish an entire industry and
professional working population based on an anecdotal situation involving
migrant workers.


Yet another independent professional,

                    Friday, July 18, 1997


                    Teacher says she'll plead guilty to child
                    rape

                    by Ronald K. Fitten
                    Seattle Times staff reporter

                    A former elementary-school teacher who had an affair
                    with a 13-year-old boy said yesterday she plans to
                    plead guilty next month to two counts of second-degree 
                    rape of a child.

                    Mary Kay LeTourneau burst into tears outside the
                    courtroom when asked why she plans to plead guilty.
                    She left without commenting.

                    LeTourneau, 35, was arrested in March and charged with
                    child rape for allegedly having numerous sexual
                    encounters with her former  student. She had taught
                    the boy, now 14, in the second and sixth
                    grades. He was a student at Cascade Middle School in
                    the Highline School District during the period of
                    their alleged sexual involvement.

                    The Normandy Park woman, who taught sixth grade at
                    Shorewood Elementary in Burien, said through her
                    attorney that she would enter the guilty plea Aug. 7
                    at the Regional Justice Center in Kent.

                    She could be sentenced to up to seven years in prison.
                    Her attorney, David Gehrke, said that as part of her
                    plea, he will try to convince the prosecution and the
                    sentencing judge that LeTourneau instead should
                    receive treatment.

                    Gehrke said he hopes she will be allowed to
                    participate in the state-operated Special Sex Offender 
                    Alternative (SSOA) program, considered the most
                    restrictive available to sex offenders.

                    Gehrke said LeTourneau has been evaluated by two
                    state-certified sexual-deviancy counselors whose
                    recommendations will be sent to a probation officer,
                    who will recommend whether she should be
                    considered for the program. If she is allowed to
                    participate, treatment would continue for at least
                    three years.

                    The attorney said that other conditions of a plea
                    agreement could require her to serve up to six months
                    in jail, have no contact with the victim for 10 years
                    and no unsupervised contact with any children,
                    including her own, without permission from her
                    probation officer and her treatment counselor.

Supplementary information:
--------------------------

The boy in the case has no complaints-- Ms. Letourneus was 'grassed' by 
two relatives, it seems.  No-one in the case alleges any harm to anyone -- 
except to the accused herself.  She currerntly faces a choice between up 
to twnty years in jail as a 'child rapist', the loss of her own family, 
and/or forced attendace for brainwashing sesssions, 'aversion therapy' (an 
oxymoron) etc.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Lisa Johnson is the Prosecutor at the 'Regional Justice Centre' at Kent, 
Seattle, WA (206-205-7400).  She has a voice like iron, and is a Legal 
Positivist (i.e. the 'law' is whatever the State says it is -- the legal 
doctrine which broght the world the USSR and Nazi Germany).

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Norm Maleng is the ( elected -- Republican ) Chief Prosecutor. There's an 
entry for him in Covert Action Information Bulletin (http;//www.pir.org).
He's on 206-285-3389.  Somerthing to do with the Imelda Marcos regime's 
inaptly-named 'intelligence' death squads killing two longshoremen of 
local 37 in Seattle, within the US itself...  

There's a US$ 15 000 000 civil judgment still outstanding in the case. It 
seems that some death squad members somehow got away...

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------


Interestingly, the hideous 'demonstration' killers of young JonBenet Ramsey in 
Colorado left a note with a sign-off 'Victory, SBTC' -- believed to be a 
reference to 'SUBIC BAY TRAINING CENTRE' -- the non-defunct US Naval base 
in the Philippines.  

I'm an external adviser to the Boulder, Colorado District Attorney's 
office in the case, BTW.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Norm Maleng's Deputy is one Dan Satterberg, another 'voice of iron' and 
another Legal Positivist -- 206-296-9067.  

In addition to being indifferent to Ms. Letourneur, Dan Satterberg seems 
completely indifferent to massive criminal law violations on his own 
doorstep, relating to the issue of 'backdoors' inserted into Windows95 by 
Microsoft Corporation based in Seattle -- violations which should wipe 
Microsoft out for violating Federal Laws (including the _Nation Security 
Agency's Charter_, which directly obligates NSA to protect the computer 
security and the copnstitutional rights of of all US citizens), 
obligations to Windows95 customers and directly prejudicing the security 
of NATO itself-- _the backdoor access routines have been 'hacked_.'

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

 JonBenet Ramsey's father John Bennett Ramsey's billion-dollar company 
(Access Graphics) works with Larry Ellison and Oracle as a prime 
contractor on Network Internet Termimals; Oracle is a key Microsoft rival 
and marketplace alternative.  Their chosen Operating sustem has no 
trapdoors and backdoors). This unlikely to endear them to some governemt 
officials involve with the Windoze95 scam.

I think not. Not as described in McKenna's tapes of his Amazon
adventures.
And Amanita Muscara has NO psilocybin in them, and grows under birch and
pine
trees, not often encountered in the tropics.

Telling someone politely that their posts are not appropriate is not
flaming IMHO. Even using moderatly impolite vernacular such as
"Bullshit" is still only being mildly expressive. Your post is not even
smoke, let alone a flame.

Sure, as part of some other mission agenda. Eventually there should be
another Mars orbiter (hopefully one which does not explode on retro
rocket firing) and this info will come in as part of a bazillion other
images....

I suspect it will be a while before body modification is a mass market
item. The black market for same will arrive first....

Nice response, but I don't understand how I got Mandelbrot wrong. I am
stating
that IMO the platonic notion that the entire Mandelbrot set exists is
unreal,
and what is real is our limited representations of same in our physical
brains,
which are finite.

This sounds like the beginning of a really cool web page for the Extropy

And Natasha, how about a similar list for artists??

Given how the technology which became the Mac OS started at Xerox Parc
and didn't go anywhere until Apple hired Allen Kay, I am skeptical of
much going on here until it escapes the Xerox corporate culture.....

And who's going to edit this mess into something useful??

McKenna is a visionary prophet and meta philosopher, not a scientist. I

At the times in question the Sahara was a temperate climate, possibly
much like the American Midwest. My major objection is that dung beetles
rule Africa, and all piles likely to grow mushrooms will not remain
intact long enough to do so. An elephant dump turns into a sheet about 2
inches thick within 48 hours, and vanishes in about a week. Shroom
mycelium incubation to fruiting takes 2 weeks minimum.

Several of my job interviews included a brief test or homework problem
used to evaluate my compentency and turn of mind. I'll give you an
example (a real one).

When being intervied by Tymshare, for a programming postion:

	Given a 32 bit word, identify the position of the most significant
	'1' bit. Maximize speed, minimize resources used.

	Note: This problem has an obvious solution, which is too slow. There
	is another obvious solution, which takes WAAAAY too much memory. (This
	note was not provided as part of the test, but as a hint to those of
	you who might want to solve this little puzzle. I'd be happy to analyse
	any answers.)

Point is, most educational credentials are so much whoo whaaah.

Benford never went into any detail about it, and it was mainly an
imaginative plot device and something that fit well into the theme of
his pentalogy (the struggle and co-evolution of different phylums of
"life"). His basic idea seems to be that once you have sufficiently
rich "memospheres" where memes can thrive (like the Internet?),
predatory memes can appear, some kind of meta-lebel entities which
are not directly observable to the hosts of the memes (humans or
computers). In fact, since they somehow *eat* memes, we can't event
think or understand them. I seriously doubt that the last is
possible, but it is a fun idea that there could exist beings which we
are *by definition* unable to comprehend.

This exceeds my tolerance level. Post stuff like this on the
psychoceramics list,
not the Exi list. Reading the Exi FAQ might be enlightening. Does anyone
recall the "Harmonic Convergence" ??? (WARNING: Rhetorical Question

Yes, I read it a couple years ago. Maybe 
choose a more descriptive name, like "Realistic Optimism" or such.
Unfortunately, it is not perceived as more than wishful thinking 
by those who have not read a definition, Gary Stix for example. His 
infamous *Scientific American* report "Nanotechnology: Waiting for the 
Breakthroughs" (April, 1996) contains wording to the effect that "..the 
dynamic optimism school of technological forecasting..." which I am fairly
sure he got from the Extro site.
  The central thing I find disagreeable is others telling me how and what to 
think, yourself included.

Irish elk are extinct because they were hunted to extinction.

I remember reading that the Basque people have genetic markers
unlike any other known group of H. Sapiens. Since they occupy a
geograpic area that was a former Neanderthal stronghold maybe that
fact deserves a second look.

So you spin your own techno? If so, what software do you use? I ask only
because the guitar-based ska band I've just recently split with
(Miskatonic U.) was leery about venturing into electronica, and that's
the direction I see myself heading musically.

"V for Vendetta", a graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd

A lone man, who's face remains unseen behind a Guy Fawkes mask
throughout the graphic novel and who's identity is never revealed,
fights a well coordinated battle to bring down a fascist government in
an alternate history late 1980s England. His goal: to replace the
fascists with ... nothing.

One of the finest and most moving literary efforts I've ever seen --
whether in or out of the graphic novel medium. Portions *literally*
brought me close to crying, and I could not put it down. I don't know
how to recommend something more highly. The politics (to the extent
that they are spelled out) are also 100% anarcholibertarian correct,
but thats almost secondary. When I compare V to the very poor efforts
Ayn Rand made to produce high literature that incorporated political
themes (in which both the literature and the themes suffered), "V"
compares extraordinarily well.

I agree, it is a very good novel. I also think his novel _Watchmen_
(with Dave Gibbons) simply has to be mentioned. 

It is IMHO one of the most fascinating and multi-layered novels I
have ever read, a kind of _Gdel, Escher,Bach_ looking into the
concept of superheros and morality instead of recursion and
self-reference. I would say at least two of the protagonists could be
seen as metaphors for the transhuman (Ozymandias) and the posthuman
(Dr Manhattan), and some of the issues raised are definitely
important for us.

As Andrea noted, a big negative of this approach is that you don't
know what others have read or who you are talking to when you write.
If people were to publicly post their filters, and some stats were
published on who is read, then maybe this negative would be mitigated.

I meant no insult to her or you.  I do not know of her work other than
via your comment.  It seemed to me that, according to you, she is
saying that all social institutions conspire to hide the construction
of gender.  I would be happy to learn that I am mistaken.

     I would shudder at an IQ being on a resume or job application.  A 
     focus on that assumes that a known/unknown/contrived IQ will actually 
     be appropriately applied by the potential hiree.  Working with C++ 
     programmers, I've hired and had to manage a number of what I observed 
     to be very intelligent people who were so socially inept (some with 
     seriously bad hygiene) as to make them veritably useless in teamwork 
     scenarios.  
     
     IQ is only one aspect of a person's value and qualifications.  I liked 
     what the book "Emotional Intelligence" had to offer in that respect.  
     
     If one's "intelligence quotient" is all a person has to offer, it's 
     not a good balance by my perspective.  That is, unless the person's 
     only responsibility is to interact with silicon-based life forms.  The 
     carbon-based ones require a little more interactivity.
     
     A interesting coincidental footnote:  i.q. is also a Latin 
     abbreviation meaning "the same as".  A curious connection to the 
     measurable "sameness" that is all an IQ test can ultimately provide.

I will strongly recomend Cubase 3.05 of Cubase VST I have made all my
records  in Cubase and it's a great tool.

Others favour Logic though so that might also be worth a check.

It's simply that things similar to replicators are a potential future
technology, while pole shift is stupid pseudo-science.  With nanotech we
may have some of the capabilities of replicators within our lifetimes.
Don't you see how useful it is to start thinking about the implications
of such a revolutionary technology?  But pole shift?  Anybody with an
inkling of understanding of science should be able to see what a stupid
idea that is!

(FYI, a more accurate term is "mailing list", although some subscribers
may be receiving it in digested form.)

There are larger implications.  By filling the list with stupid ideas,
we will attract the kind of people who like such things.  It's a fact
of life on the net: quality attracts quality, and the opposite is true
as well.  Ultimately the goal of comments like Perry's is to encourage
the kinds of discussions that will attract and keep the many fine thinkers
the list has had.

It is true that in the past, the mailing list has suffered from bickering
and negative comments.  At the same time, there were informed, intelligent
discussions on a wide range of topics.

Actually I think Perry spoke for many readers.  I haven't been happy with
some of the recent topics.  In fact, I suspect that Perry restrained himself
for some time, hoping that the spate of pseudoscience would blow over.
Instead (as happens all too often) it only encouraged more of the same.
At some point you have to respond.

Yes, but the nice thing is that your IQ gets better and better if you
repeatedly test (train) yourself. So much for the use of IQ :-)

I believe there is excellent correlation between linguistics and genetic
analysis, promoting mere linguistics to puissant palaeolinguistics status
(it may have been a SciAm article). Particularly the Basqs seem to be able
to having preserved their identity since the last glacial, as their
language shows strong similiarities to certain Central African dialects
(sorry, no refs, my neurons are dying busily).

Small amounts of time add up. How much value you attach to your
own time is your own affair, but you assume inaccurately if you
assume that everyone values eir own time at the same rate.

More than once on this list I have been informed that I didn't know
what I was talking about, usually politely. There are so very many
interesting things in the world to study and discuss, it seems
rather stupid to insist on discussing a particular subject in a
particular forum that some members of the forum have objected to.
Ninety percent of the topics that are brought up here elicit no
objections. If I were to bring up a topic of discussion and meet
objections to it from more than one of the list old-timers (ooh,
I'm biased, because I guess I've gotten to be one of those myself
by now), I would take that topic to a forum where it was more
welcome. And I usually follow this rule on any forum, including
those forums in which I am *not* an old-timer,  not just the
extropians list.

This very discussion is particularly unwelcome to many (not all)
because it is metadiscussion. At the very least, you could
follow the convention of flagging it as such (illustrated on the
subject line above) so that it may be more easily filtered by
those who have no time to follow metadiscussion.

To the best of our knowledge, if things go on as they have been
going on for ages, we are all trapped on this planet and we are
all doomed to die. Think about that next time you are impatient
with a person who feels that e has no time for nonsense. Some
folks are actually working hard for your and my benefit, and
some of them use this list to obtain useful information.

I think "Realistic Optimism" would elicit only a "huh?" from most people.
The reactions I have mostly heard to dynamic optimism have mostly been
positive, *especially* when accompanied by a brief explanation.

Your first sentence above suggests a universal response. How many cases are
you basing that on? It does not match my experience, though my experience
usually involves using the term and explaining it. I'm not terrible
concerned about Stix's usage, since his whole article was an irresponsible
piece of slash-and-burn attack on nanotechnology. (Scientific American even
managed some kind of apology for Stix piece on the web, thanks to Ralph
Merkle's incisive response.)

Thanks for telling me about your experience with the term. I'd like to get
a better idea of whether you are talking about one or two cases or many. If
"dynamic optimism" really does produce a negative response according to
several people, I would have to consider renaming it. However, I wouldn't
rename it simple because some people occassionally misunderstand it, not
having ever read a definition or explanation. *That* can happen to any term.

Onward!

I agree that, for some people, "optimism" has a Polyanna connotation.
Perhaps adding "dynamic" in front doesn't always avoid that. However, when
I use the term, I *always* explain it and seem to have practically always
thereby prevented misunderstanding. Those who actually read the essay
generally like the term.

The term "realist" is open to the same problems. I've met many people who
like to think of themselves as realists. Sometimes these people dislike
optimism. I've found that sometimes this is because they think like
pessimists, defeatists, or fatalists, and *believe* that is realistic!
Others who call themselves realists actually think dynamically
optimistically. They see realism as involving the virtues of dynamic
optimism. They just don't call it that. "Realist" to me, often evokes the
image of someone who believes they think clearly and reasonably when they
really want to label their perhaps unrealistic biases "realism".

Okay, so for you the term (without having read what I wrote about it)
evokes that image. I don't know the details of your ex-CEO, so I don't know
whether he is being dynamically optimistic and has a decent change of
making a breakthrough, or whether he's deluding himself. It's a difficult
question that I address in the essay. After all, you might have gone up to
Edison after his first hundred attempts to build a lightbulb and said:
"Edison, old buddy, be realistic. You've tried this a hundred times and
it's obviously not working. Give it up."

Most things were invented at Xerox Parc (Ethernet, the mouse, GUI, etc).  All
of these have become sucessful (as you said no thanks to Xerox).  Xerox
Parc's new policy is to create new start-up businesses to market it's new
technologies, apparently they are given all the freedom they want.  We'll

I meant 'natural rerun', one which happens to _evolve_ into the same
conscious being as you.  For this to happen without outside intervention, the
conditions of the growth would have to be exact to a very high extent.  This
idea is flawed however, because if the events before your death where exact
then you would still die (without the intervention of an intelligent being).

I was just offering a different reason, to say "even though it may be

for it.."

If you don't die you shouldn't have anything to fear (I doubt that cloned
consciousness would have much effect on you if you are still alive).  If you
do die you could be resurrected for all kinds of reasons.  The moral of this
stroy is: never piss off a transhuman!

How much does time effect your incarnations? For instance, could your
consciousness end in the present and continue in the past?  or has that been
in Extropy magazine already??

Thats interesting, the only thing that can be said is maybe dung beetles
werent around 100,000 years ago.  The theory is that mushrooms grew in

Cosmology aside, this is precisely what I never understood from _The

interactions with my environment.  How can neural nets, or whatever
Omega might use, spring full-blow like Athena from the head of Zeus
without some kind of interactive growth or training?  How can
brute-force resurrection create something human-level or greater
*that once existed* from scratch without also simulating all the
environmental input factors that conditioned that being?

Even if there are only x^y states of matter possible and infinite
computational resources at Omega could compute all possible
combinations, how could The System ever *select* those
configurations that might have had some resemblance to actual history
(which would seem to be required in order to call this a
resurrection)?

I would like to start a thread on hybrids and speciation 

        Hybrids between two related species have been a common
occurrence in biology. It is a point where the way nature really works
and the way biologist view nature break down. The Biological Species
Concept would suggest that organism that can interbreed successfully
would be within the same species....but clearly organism that have
different behaviors, physical features, and even environments have been
known to breed when brought together either naturally or with human
intervention.

        Hybrids are considered to be flukes, accidental pairings, which
lead to unfit progeny. This is often the case between distant, although
related animals. One must only look to the mating of a Horse and Donkey:
a viable, strong creature, but sterile. The genes of those parents are
lost forever and it is an evolutionary dead end. See FIG 2.  

        We normally think of speciation occurring via a SPLIT in gene
pools, via environmental barriers or behavior restraints. Two species
move apart from one another and will never be a part of the same gene
pool again. At least, that is the usual thinking when we talk about
reproductively isolated species. See FIG 1.

        What if the Hybridization occurs between two sister species, and
the offspring are better adapted, have higher variability, and are
fertile. These creatures would not be evolutionary dead ends, instead,
they would be evolutionary BEGINNINGS! FIG 3 shows just that. For a
hybrid to take root in the parent species niche, we would expect this
pairing happens often. 

        I did a short review of the hybrid literature this morning, but
I did not see anyone suggest that this could very well be mechanism for
speciation in ANIMALS, but a recent blurb in SCIENCE, Vol. 277, July 18,
1997 (p 316) suggests that the native crayfish population has been
invaded by an exotic crayfish population; however, both population are
being replaced by the fertile hybrids.

Let me all know what you think.

Yes, I would.  I'd like to put "The Autmorpher" to music, similar to the
tracks I mentioned.

Anyone in Brussels interested?  We have a techno music contingency there.

Generally, it does seem correct that in order to create a person who
thinks he has experienced X, we have to have simulated X to at least
the level of detail remembered by that person.  If you want to create
someone with memories of combat in Vietnam, you will have to have created
specific combat events for him to remember.

It may not be necessary though to simulate every detail of the Vietnam
experience down to the water droplets dripping from leaves in the jungle
all around him.  According to some studies we've discussed here, the
actual amount of data which goes into long term memory is very small on
average, perhaps only one bit per second or so.  Naturally, some times
are remembered much better than others, and even forgotten events can
have a significant influence on future behavior.  But broadly speaking it
may be possible to have a way to create a person with memories which
realistically simulate a Vietnam experience without actually simulating
every detail.

Even if it turns out that detailed simulation is sometimes necessary,
there can still be economies of scale.  There could be a generic
20th century simulation which could be used as the basis for creating
huge numbers of possible 20th-century citizens.

This reminds me of an interesting point raised by Hans Moravec here on
this list once.  As Mark says, in some ways it seems that selection is an
important step in giving "reality" to the simulated systems.  If you had
infinite computer power, you could simulate every possible system in every
possible sequence of states.  But this raises the question of whether
you have actually accomplished anything in doing so.  In some sense,
it seems like by generating every possible system, without actually
selecting out those which are meaningful, you have blurred them all
together and it is as though you haven't generated any systems.

I'm not sure I agree with this; Moravec is a Platonist and believes that
all these systems have reality independent of whether they are actually
instantiated.  Simulating a hypothetical being merely gives us access to
him; he exists independent of our efforts.

A more materialistic view is that the only systems which can have reality,
including awareness, are those which are actually implemented at some
point in the real world.  In that case, simulating a system which
represented a conscious being would in fact bring him into existence.
This would be true even if his simulation was just one variant on an
infinite number of themes, monkeys typing on infinite typewriters.

These are indeed both excellent graphic novels, some of the best in
the field. 

But I think you'll find that those who wrote them (Alan Moore, David
Gibbons, and the Scotsman whose name I've forgotten who writes the
'Invisibles', another more recent good comic) are pretty solidly
left-wing.  Not stupid, knee-jerk lefties, mind you, (I mean, I have no
doubt that they've probably given libertarian and extropian ideas some
serious consideration) but leftists nonetheless - I'm pretty sure of this
because they come from the 2000AD stable, which was a*very* left-oriented
UK comic all through the 80s, and had a few offshoots (e.g. a comic
called 'Crisis') which were as red as they come.  So unless they've
changed an*awful* lot since then ...

To interested List-Members:

Besides developments in intelligent filtering and content rating systems 
for S/N ratio, has anyone though of simply creating separate lists for 
gradiations of S/N?

An example would be:


Level 1: Very High S/N

     On this list only the most critical and well-thought out posts 
would be allowed via a moderator.  These posts would be in the form of 
Journal Articles/Peer Review.  Sort of an online Extropy Journal.  
Reviews and responses would have to go through a moderator or be posted 
on levels 2 or 3.

Level 2: Moderate S/N

     This list would consist of posts with the expectation that that 
they be of a critical and well reasoned nature.  In many ways, this 
would resemble the list in its current form.  If peoples posts start to 
get too fuzzy, then point them out as you see fit.  If they show an 
honest attempt to increase the S/N of their responses, they should be 
encouraged.  This list would give others of a more fuzzy-headed nature 
to improve their critical thinking skills amidst other highly 
intelligent subscribers.
    
    {One of the things I enjoy about the current Extro-List is the 
opportunity to meet *PEOPLE* who share like-minded goals.  Sometimes its 
nice just to be able to chat with other kindred spirits in an open and 
inviting arena. So we should have a level 3.}

Level 3:

Any and all who consider themselves extropic would be encouraged to 
makes posts on this list so that we can all get better acquainted.  This 
is would be a place for people to make connections.   Consider this list 
an ongoing 24/7 extro party.  People who hang out too much on lists 1 
and 2 should be encouraged to take their shirt off once and awhile, 
lighten up and party.  


*Keep in mind these are only examples I made up as I went along.  It 
comes from the earnest desire to see all of the people on this list get 
the best of all possible worlds - and perhaps start getting along with 
each other.


Warm Regards,

Bobby Whalen


P.S. People who spend too much time on list 3, should be encouraged to 
subscribe and listen in on the more serious discussions of lists 1 & 2 - 
maybe they will learn something.

Bobby Whalen wrote suggesting a three-level hierarchy with a
mailing list at each of the three levels. I think it might be
more interesting if we were to use a different electronic medium
for each of the three levels.

For instance, Bobby's level two could be carried on by those who
are interested in reinvigorating the alt.extropians newsgroup.
This would also produce lots of spam for people to exercise
their filtering tools on.

Level three could be an #extropy channel on IRC. Just pick a
servernet.

Just a thought.

Yes, that was a SciAm article, but the linguistic similarities were to
Athabascan languages, which are a group of Amerind languages in North America
separate from the main group and due to an invasion of related peoples across
the Bering strait or landbridge significant after that which created the main
group of Amerind cultures.  I think there were two isolated Siberian
languages related to them as well.  I remember these details because I was so
struck that they found the relatives of the Basques (which had been a mystery
for centuries) and even more struck by who the relatives turned out to be.
 Small world, indeed.

I'm working on the actual _form_ of the OTC. 
We could have an awards ceremony.
But how to choose the nominating committe?

Danny, are you by any chance going to be at 
the Extro conference in August?

Danny, I think singing "100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" after
inhaling nitrous oxide at the dentist is interesting. Fascinating.
Absolutely the best use of my time imaginable. Hey, LIVE A LITTLE!

But I don't do it in front of people who've made it clear that they think
it's a waste of time, unless they're being paid to listen--like my
dentist. I especially don't try to convince them it's not a waste of
their time.

Have a clue, they're cheap. Some experiences are personal, and don't
travel well. Self-transformation through the use of nootropics is
possibly a matter for this list. "Food combining", by my guess, is
over the edge into the Twilight Zone. Nth-hand reports
of self-sustaining electrolysis used to power cars are useless.

Being hardheaded is hard, sometimes. But the hardheads have helped
keep the rest of the humans alive. Cut them some credit. OK?

Well, *is* there a new species here?  If members of the two sisters species
can and did mate, producing well-adapted and perfectly fertile offspring,
were the two really separate species in the first place?  Speciation really
isn't an all-or-nothing kind of thing, and this is treading in a grey area.
 Scientists, ecologists, and bureaucrats spend a lot of time arguing over
such things as whether the California Gnatcatcher is a separate species from
the Mexican one, or just a separate sub-species.

There was an isolation of sorts, that which produced the two sister species,
or sub-species, or whatever.  If the isolation that made the sister species
was not adequate to avert fully fertile interbreeding then generally they are
considered merely sub-species and expected to merge, and the resulting merger
is just an evolution from the original species, not a new species.  But this
is just definition (and frequently ignored if one of the subspecies has
environmental interest lobbying for it).

There's one case, I read, where an apparently new species of grass in North
America is thought to be a hybrid between a North American and an imported
species that appear to be not fertile, at least normally.  This case would
indeed meet your definition.  In general plants are more tolerant of distant
outbreedings than animals.

Yes, but are you trying to elicit a positive response here?  Are they
positively reacting to the concept of "optimism based on facts and critical
thinking", or positively reacting to whatever "dynamic optimism" makes them
think of?

Maybe they're just reacting to the purveyors of the idea, as in Dr. Hanson's
"ideas as clothes" concept.  In that case we could switch to "blmfgh" with no

Who is "they" please cite a reference.

Are you postulating a mass gain, or a lower density? If so, what is the
physical mechanism?

But this complaint applies to *everything* that appears on a resume.
It is all noisy signals of the variable of interest: how well could
they do the job?  Each item is only one part of the total signal, and
could lead to disappointment if assumed to directly imply anything
about how they'd do.

Perhaps we are merely the last ape to have not lost it? Perhaps it
predates apes, and modern apes have merely been forced to evolve such
features away in the fact of such waterborn threats?

I would hardly expect chimps to have evolved any sort of swimming
capacities or features, as they have a negative buoyancy, while humans
have a positive buoyancy. That they are so physically dense and we are
light would explain why we have such features and they don't.

You'll also notice that I mentioned the bit about surveyed sites. With
exact coordinates, which were not possible before the age of GPS, a
laser bomb could home in on a precise point with inertial guidance and a
touch of help from the launch plane. Without such exact data, its
accuracy is much as reported.

Probably the dumbest decision made in the last decade was to retire the
A-10. The A-10's GAU-9 30mm cannon, which shot steel jacketed rounds
with spent uranium cores, were probably the most economical way to kill
tanks devised. With a couple hundred rounds in a burst, such a weapon is
even usefull against the new "compound" armor which uses exterior
explosive plates. Much more cost effective than the Maverick missile.

THis is why the infantry platoon's M-60 gunner typically has an
estimated life expectancy in a firefight of around 60 seconds. Since the
M-60 puts out the most lead in the least time of all weapons in the
platoon, the enemy's first goal is to take out the M-60 gunner.

Smart munitions designed for use in high threat environments, like the
theoretical soviet invasion of western europe, are especially valuable
compared to smart bombs, as such an environment gives the average ground
attack plane a life expectancy of less than ten missions. They are also
good for single run attacks, which allows a greater level of surprise
than attacks which require multiple runs to take out a target. THis is
why attacks like Tripoli and the Isreali run on Bagdads nuke plant in
84(?) were so successfull.

This was one of the amazing factoids that MacNamara's bean counters came

Perhaps, but as far as I know no other primates (not merely apes)
display the whole range of adaptations (voluntary breath control,
metabolic dive reflex, downward-turned nostrils, streamlined hair
patterns, neonatal swimming ability, extensive subcutaneous fat,
all of which are of unquestionable advantage to a wading/diving
lakeshore animal).  Add in the several other unique traits of Homo
sapiens that may have been of advantage in an aquatic environment,
such as bipedalism, semihairless skin, and possibly modified coital
position, and Ockham's razor starts cutting into your suggestion
rather deeply.

Can you name one other primate, even a very "primitive" one,
that displays even three of these aquatic adaptations? It seems
unlikely that such a large array of distinct adaptations could
have developed as a group in some common ancestor of very many
species, and then be systematically eliminated from all of the
descendant species except one, which preserved so many. If one
species preserved so many aquatic adaptations, then it would
seem very unlikely for selective pressure to have wiped out the
whole suite of adaptations in the cousins without any vestigial
remainder. Vestigial remainders are fairly common in mammals
generally, so it seems that when evolution wipes out a trait, it
rarely does so without leaving a trace.

My concern with this idea however, is that it may have the opposite 
effect of which I'm intending - to destroy the sense of community I'm 
trying to nurture.

Many people here say they respond to ideas most. For me, the *people* 
behind those ideas are just as important. Because the real power of this 
list has been the opportunity its given me to meet like-minded people 
with whom I can share ideas and polish my thinking.

I would hate to see this list disintegrate into factions of people 
hiding behind excessive filters - although I sense this may already be 
happening to a large extent. (Or is that just my paranoia talking?)

SO this means that the Indians discovered Europe first, not the other

Danny, the continental plates may only cover 80% of the earth's area
(which I doubt), but the rest is taken up by the pacific and indian
ocean plates which are subducting under the North American, SOuth
American, Australian, and Asian plates. If what you suggest is true,
then we would have a much greater meteoric impact record than we do and
be living under much greater greenhouse conditions. Thus only the
continental plates have grown as divergence continued, but those growing
plates rode over older plates that subducted under them.

20% of the earth's surface covers a volumebelow it in a cone shape to
the core of approximately 25 billion cubic miles. Given that Pangea  was
in existence as late as a couple hundred million years ago, we would
have to be seeing around 100 cubic miles of meteoric accretion to our
planet EVERY YEAR to equate to a 20% increase in earth's surface area.
As this is obviously not true, then the idea that our earth's surface is
20% greater than in the time of Pangea is ludicrous. We would have to
experience the equivalent of 10 Yucatan extinction asteroids every year.
This obviously would have exterminated life...a long, long time ago.

`Kuwabara's findings have been published in the Journal of

`Kuwabara said he had maintained goat fetuses for up to three
weeks in a plastic tank, until the end of their incubation
period....

`Many of the experimental goat fetuses incubated in the

added.'


Goats gestate for av. 151 days, so the last 21 max is not as dramatic as it

Just so.  For people with a declared interest in memetic engineering,
extropians do make some odd choices in self-marketing.  The logo, whether
you wish to admit this or not, doesn't just resemble the new Hong Kong flag
(which, it's true, came along rather later), but tends to elicit creepy
connotations of swastikas and the Africaaner racist/fascist emblem.
`Dynamic Optimism' just makes me snigger, I fear, as I'm flooded by
memories of Charles Atlas ads in the back of pulp magazines - improve your
puny physiques with dynamic tension, that sort of nerdy, try-hard,
sucker-born-every-minute thing.  

None of this has anything directly to do with the worth of the ideas
signified.  Forrest suggests that `Realistic Optimism' might be preferable.
 I'd recommend `critical optimism' (and ixnay the caps, a standard mark of
crackpotism).  Using the word `critical' does tend to turn off a lot of
people whose mental functioning operates at the Men Are From Ma's level,
but it fits in to the mainstream of western philosophical analysis, not to
mention Popperian accounts of how science works.

"Stale" is subjective, but I frequently have to wade through 20 CDs to find
one that grabs my attention.  I agree that there is a little lag time as
far as distribution goes, but most of it is perceived rather than actual.
Music distributors in this country generally don't care about a these
genre's because they don't sell well in the U.S.  Its not that it isn't
available, its just really difficult to find.  Fortunately, electronica is
becoming more popular in the US, which may help remedy the situation.

Ska? Cool! I am fan of (old-school) ska.  I do have to say that "ska" as
currently defined in popular media is significantly different than the CDs
I collected from the 80s (and before).  It seems that the term "ska" has
been co-opted to create the latest "cool genre".  Bands like No Doubt may
demonstrate some ska influences, but the music doesn't really resemble ska
as represented by The Specials, Madness, and even earlier groups like the
Skatellites(sp?).

Yes, techno and electronica in general is a genre for which I have an
affinity.  My personal influences tend to be in the techno/trance/ambient
area, but occasionally the influence of 80's darker synth pop (along the
lines of the New Order, Pet Shop Boys, Cure) sometimes appear to trickle
into my work, most likely because I have a fairly large collection of that
stuff as well.  At one time or other I have been involved in nearly every
major music style I can think of.  I like music for its own sake.

I currently use Performer, but have used a few other packages.  The state
of sequencers is such that it doesn't really matter what you use as long as
you learn how to use it well.  Having not previously used sequencers under
MacOS, the choice of Performer was completely random.  I don't currently
have any audio recording capability, but I am looking into the various
digital 8-track hard-disk systems, both modular and computer-based.

A few weeks ago, the NEAR spacecraft on its way to 433 Eros took
some photos of 253 Mathilde on a fast flyby. 253 Mathilde is only
the third asteroid (unless you count Ida's tiny moon Dactyl) to be
imaged from close proximity, after Galileo's Ida and Gaspra.

Images are available at:

	http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/near.html

253 Mathilde is the first carbonaceous chondrite asteroid to be
thus imaged. Carbonaceous chondrites are richer in volatiles
containing carbon atoms than are the stony sort of asteroid
represented by Gaspra and Ida. This is interesting because carbon
atoms will probably be extremely important to all future forms of
life.

The NEAR spacecraft is scheduled to go into orbit around 433 Eros
sometime in February of 1999, and settle in for long-term study.
Personally, I find this much more exciting than the recent Martian
hoopla. 433 Eros accounts for about half the mass of all the
asteroids that cross inside Earth's orbit, so one might call
Eros the Queen (or King) of the NEOs.

<< >that's the levelheaded realistic type" >> 
 
Being "levelheaded (and) realistic" is a pessimist's way of putting-down
people who look at the world and its problems as an opportunity 
 
To me "be realistic" equals an admonition to be pessimistic.  EXAMPLE:
 "Don't try to do something innovative in life and leave a legacy, you should
be more realistic." 
 
If I had been "realistic"  I would have given up looking for my new heat
resistant microorganism long ago.  After all, what are the chances of
discovering a new species?  Well, I was NOT realistic . . . The new heat
resistant species I discovered is called _Talaromyces trachyspermus_.

Yes.  But only to pessimists and losers.

I don't know the latter. I'll admit the the *old* spiral logo, with four
rather than five arrows, could look like a modified swastika. I have not
found that to be a problem with the current one. It's interesting how
reactions vary. You find the spiral logo poor memetic marketing; many
others have told me the exact opposite. I'm glad to hear input on this and
will keep monitoring it in case the balance of opinion shifts.

While I dislike "Realistic Optimism", I do rather like "critical optimism".
However, in version 3.0 of the Extropian Principles, critical thinking will
be emphasized under the principle of Self-Ownership. I agree about the
capitalization, except that they are appropriate when used to refer to the
principle directly. They are not appropriate in a sentence like "are you
thinking with dynamic optimism?" Caps have a legitimate place but
definitely should be used very sparingly if you're not to look like a loon.

To the extent that gender as a social instition underlies all 
other social institutions, each of which has developed control and 
management mechanisms, yes.  Or, in her words:  'Social statuses are 
carefully constructed through prescribed processes of teaching, 
learning, emulation, and enforcement.  Whatever genes, hormones, and 
biological evolution contribute to human social institutions is 
materially as well as qualitatively transformed by social practices.  
...the building blocks of gender are socially constructed statuses."  
That's from _Paradoxes of Gender_, 1994.

Danny, work with us here, huh?  

I made the original posting.  

In it, I reported that an episode of the cult TV show `Millennium' had
claimed that a fantastically infrequent linear alignment of seven planets
would occur at that date (and dramatised the claim, allegedly showing us
viewers its truth on a Net-accessed orrery).  I made my posting for two
reasons:

1)  While I found it extremely unlikely that such a coincidence would occur
shortly, I didn't have access to any astronomical database that would help
me test my doubt.  Luckily, a number of extropians did indeed provide the
answer - which was, not surprisingly, that any `alignment' was so diffuse
and impressionistic that the image of a string of planets stretching
outward from the sun on 5/5/2000 was a blatant and misleading invention of
the scriptwriters.  (Yes, it's fiction, but there's a dangerous DMZ between
willing-suspension-of-disbelief and misinformation.)

2)  I knew that all manner of boneheads are concocting and promulgating all
manner of truly stupid memes linked to a year 2000/2001 `apocalypse'.
Among these is the good old Theosophical standby about polar flipflops, but
I didn't need to spell this out because everyone here is aware of the
deluge of crap washing back and forth through the badly trained brains of
many of the world's literate and semi-literate but essentially uneducated
people.

I was initially concerned, therefore, that if an astronomical coincidence
of this kind was indeed due - as, it turns out, it isn't - we would be in
for a rough time as the boneheads ran around in circles squealing and
pointing at the sky.  Hale-Bopp beam-me-up Redivivus, big time.

I did not anticipate that my sceptical scientific inquiry would start the
squealing here and now *on the extropian list*.  That is, my post was not a
troll.  But by golly it certainly chased some funny looking critters out
from the undergrowth.  :(

Technologically driven sexual progress?  :-)

Seriously, I think there is a significant sexual component to developing
technology, and more directly than through intermediating art.  Cars seem
indelibly connected to sex, and just about every new communication technology
gets used for pornography.

I also can't help but think what the results would be if our current sexual
selection, based on art and bodies, were partially redirected to, say, solid
scientific thinking, or novel technological improvements.  I wonder, too, how
H. technologicus would get along with H. Sapiens.

I don't think they sound that bad, at least not the best of them, but I
agree that they're not as good as one would expect. I've used ReadtoMe,
which is avilable free from http://www.pixi.com/~reader1/ If you want
something which is (a) free and (b) pretty damn good given (a), I'd advise
you to head in that direction.

I wonder if 'professional' programs for the blind are any better: does
anyone here have any experience of those?

I certainly don't know enough, but I think the beetles were around
long before that. I base this on the fact that there exist related
scarabeoid beetles in quite remote climates (e.g. here in Sweden we
have the tordyvel [don't know its latin name]) and continents (all of
them except antarctica) which suggest that the family has been around
for several millions of years. I just found a reference 
http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/eukaryotes/animals/arthropoda/hexapoda/coleoptera/polyphaga/scarabaeoidea/fossils.html
that suggest their mutual ancestor Aphrodiites was around in the
lower jurassic. They seem to have dealt with dinosaur dung just as
well as elephant dung.

I also think it the beetles form an integral part of the svannah
ecosystem; without them the dung would not fertilize the soil as
quickly and the open grasslands would not be possible (note the neat
loop here: grasslands suit grazers, grazers produce dung, dung helps
the beetles and makes the grass possible; once started it is
self-supporting). 

So, I think the dung beetles have an alibi.

I think hybrids *can* play a role in speciation, but they certainly
don't explain how the process got started. After all, if you just
have one species it cannot hybridize. 

It should be noted that the concept species is rather fuzzy; it isn't
as clear-cut as it is explained in elementary biology textbooks. 
There is for example a seagull (I think it was) that lives along the
arctic coast from Norway to eastern Siberia. The norwegian and east
siberian birds cannot interbreed, but both can breed with the west
siberian birds (species splitting in action?).

There are a great many examples of such phenomena described in section 5 of
http://wcl-l.bham.ac.uk/origins/faqs/faq-speciation.html.

Here's a famous (and ironic) story:

In 1927, the Soviet cytologist Karpchenko crossed the radish, Raphanus
sativus, with the cabbage, Brassica oleracea, trying to produce a plant with
the leaves of a cabbage and the roots of a radish. Despite the fact that the
plants were in different genera, he got a viable hybrid.  The hybrids were
interfertile with each other, but not interfertile with either parental
species. Unfortunately the new plant (genus Raphanobrassica) had the foliage
of a radish and the root of a cabbage.  It is not recorded whether Stalin
had him shot for his failure.

Topic change:

I found document this by recalling that I had once heard of such a case,
years ago, and the organism's name was raphanobrassica.  That made it easy
to find this document through Alta Vista.  Perhaps in the age of search
engines, the best way to learn information is to assosciate a few bizarre
buzzwords with any topic, just as I assosciated 'speciation through
hybridization' with 'raphanobrassica'.  Then it will be easy to pull up the
actual information when you need it.  

This might be called the 'hapax legomena strategy'.  (A hapax legomena is a
word or phrase that occurs only once in a given corpus).

It occurs to me that I have been using this strategy unconsciously.  Rather
than keep bookmarks to some topics, when I need to know about technical
diving, I look for articles containing 'trimix', and when I need to know
about stellar nucleosynthesis, I look for 'helium flash'.  Who needs a
bookmark file when you've got a vocabulary?

 I have a question for you technical types:

Reference : SHIVA a science fiction book of some years ago which postulated
drawing power from the Ionospher by "shorting' it to ground using laser beams
to ionize a path.

Reference: Forest Bishops Web Page...his article on an Antartic Mass Driver
(Orbital  Catapult ) ...in which he speaks of the "initialization" of a
pathway...

my question:  what would happen IF a pathway to the ionisphere is
ionized...surely current would flow...hell of a lightning bolt?  Or
not....please elucidate.

 That ought to be noticeable in the sheep that are brought up this way
 (it is very unlikely basal stuff like this would be restricted only
 to humans; mammals in general have some clever ways of ensuring the
 mother-child bond and emotional development). If it really is
 important with a more natural artificial womb the lambs ought to show
 averse emotional reactions when brought up.

Actually I beleive the story is somewhat different....I spent four years on

Of course...I may be wrong....I was more interested in other things than
history while I was there....but that is my recollection from the museum I

     if they don't agree with it.
     
     By virtue of the discussion this thread has caused, people like Danny

     cooperative effort.  I for one am not clutching my pearls in panic

No, being levelheaded and realistic means looking at the facts as objectively
as possible, being practical, etc.  Check the definitions in any dictionary,
pessimism != realism.  Pessimistic people will often use it a catch-phrase to
support their own slanted view of the world and it's *very important* not to
let them get away with it.

But it means nothing of the sort.  You've been had by pessimists good at
debating.  One, properly, should do a cost-benefit for doing something
innovative and leaving a legacy.  If the benefit is high, as it is for most
of us, it will justify a slim chance of success.  Besides, the chance of
doing *something* interesting and new isn't that slim if that's what you try
for.

I would tend to agree, just look at the "newly refurbished" Bosstones.

The ska scene (and to a lesser extent the now overinclusive punk scene)
was born out of a certain disregard for mainstream values and tastes.
Die-hard skinheads (I'm talking about "rude boys" not the white
supremacists) have become very territorial these days about their music.
I've been to three ska shows already this summer (Blue Meanies,
Pietasters, Spring Heeled Jack) where the MTV-birthed neo-ska crowd
found themselves trampled underfoot -- literally. A lot of old-timers
react violently to this adolescent infiltration. For them, it's a
lifestyle -- and they don't want anyone diluting it.

Skatalites.

I was at first intrigued by the notion of a ska band with a frontwoman.
I had seen pictures of Gwen Stefani in Spin and RS, along with articles
suggesting that No Doubt's "unique form of ska" owed much to her bizarre
vocals.

Then I listened to them.

True her voice is quite interesting, but there's very little ska to be
found in the music -- just a horn or two and some quick upstrums on the
guitar every now and then.

As far as my favorite ska groups go, I love the Specials and the
Skatalites -- you almost have to. Old Bosstones, The Pietasters, and the
Toasters are also way up there. My friend's band Spring Heeled Jack is
phenomenal (along the lines of Reel Big Fish) and then there's all the
ska-core like Mephiskapholes, The Skeletones, and Voodoo Glow Skulls. 

If you ever get the chance (and it seems unlikely since they've broken
up) but Connecticut ska-lord Joe Curran's old band The Spicy Gribblets
puts on perhaps the greatest live ska show I've ever seen.

As do I. I'm not so up on my electronica, although I dig the hard-core
stuff like Cubanate and Atari Teenage Riot. Also, Prodigy and the
Chemical Brothers are my main techno-based staples.

I've been toying with the idea of working a ska-techno hybrid, possibly
even reggae-techno. I'd be interested to hear any DJs that may have
already attmepted this.

I need to do some serious homework on this. I think I'll start by
looking at Performer. Thanks.

The problem here is your equation of less-scientific with more
sensational with science fiction.

"Elvis Clone Reveals Jackie O's Secret UFO Diet!" is sensational,
and it is less-scientific. Tarring science fiction with that particular
brush should have gone out with the 1950s. A pity it hasn't.

I freely grant that I should learn more diplomacy.
Thank you for the reminder.
Perhaps some of the other correspondents to this list should learn
more science. Perhaps not.

As I said before, it boils down to whether this is a clubhouse or an
outreach list. This may be a hard choice.

All they need to do is to get someone to record their voice for each word,

 American, Australian, and Asian plates. If what you suggest is true,
 then we would have a much greater meteoric impact record than we do and
 be living under much greater greenhouse conditions. Thus only the
 continental plates have grown as divergence continued, but those growing
 plates rode over older plates that subducted under them.
 
 20% of the earth's surface covers a volumebelow it in a cone shape to
 the core of approximately 25 billion cubic miles. Given that Pangea  was
 in existence as late as a couple hundred million years ago, we would
 have to be seeing around 100 cubic miles of meteoric accretion to our
 planet EVERY YEAR to equate to a 20% increase in earth's surface area.
 As this is obviously not true, then the idea that our earth's surface is
 20% greater than in the time of Pangea is ludicrous. We would have to
 experience the equivalent of 10 Yucatan extinction asteroids every year.
 This obviously would have exterminated life...a long, long time ago.

No, Im saying the whole planet was 80% the size that it is now.  And
scientists can tell this by the way the continents fit right now. When you
put them together there are spaces between them which grow in size the
further north and south you go, but this space is no longer there when you
shrink the whole planet to 80% of what it is now, then they fit perfectly.

Aarrrgh!  It's true.  I have also been doing this, which explains why I can
only find out information about topics I already know.  For those areas I'm
not familiar with, bizarre buzzwords never set in my memory.  I don't even
think I read them: "...crossed the radish, Rmpphmmm smmtmvm, with the
cabbage, Brmmphmm olmmlmmm, trying to produce...".

I suppose it's an improvement that you need to be a domain expert to search
effectively, instead of having to be a search system expert.  It's
interesting that we're seeing a proliferation of guide services (The Mining
Company, Netguide, Excite & Yahoo, the Subject Clearinghouse), where you
only need to find one site on a topic to learn the basics & the buzzwords.
A nice split in information access methods between experts and novices.

Actually, it's worse than that.  The job itself can be a noisy signal,
since people often mold a job around their skills.  If I find an applicant
who's very good in one area but not great in another, I think about how I
can adjust the job requirements to them.  And often I don't even have a
perfect idea of the job I need done.  (Mind you, the solution is often to
hire people who seem *really* smart, regardless of their background, and
use them in what ever way works.)

I find I'm bothered by the claim that interviews are not predictive, though
I  have heard that in many places.  At a previous company, we gave a
take-home programming test to the applicants that looked interesting.  At
least once I chose a programmer who had a less impressive test but better
people and verbal skills, because they would need to work in a team with
non-programmers.  Some how I don't think IQ would have captured that
difference.

Planet growth is one of the theories of continetal drift.  The idea is that
as the Earth cools it starts to expand (at an ever decreasing rate) and the
continents break up, mountains form, etc.  All of the continents were
connected but they didn't cover the Earth entirely, and 80% of the size is
very unlikely.

Sumer was a comparative nipper.  The oldest city cultures now known with
any certainty are, I believe, the surprisingly precocious neolithic
cultures of what used to be called Anatolia (the plains in the southern
part of Turkey) - true cities like Catal Huyuk (6500BC) and Hacilar
(5700BC). Jericho also has strata going back to 7000BC. Crete was kind
of contemporaneous with this sort of thing as well. There were also many
surprisingly large settlements along the Adriatic and in the Balkan
regions. 

Basically, there seems to be pretty good evidence for a fairly uniform
and sophisticated pre Indo-European culture across the whole Mediterranean
and Balkan region from about 7000 BC to about 3500 BC, which seems to
have been gradually destroyed by successive waves of invasions by
bastards with bronze swords, who subsequently got to build all the
monuments.  Kind of depressing really.

Really? WOW, talk about migrations. I'm surprised there wasn't more
cultural diffusion along the way. I'd at least expect them to come down
via Iceland, which would be right in line with the main Atlantic
currents. Is there evidence that they crossed Asia to reach western
europe? Is this archeologically prior to the aryan migration?

WHich if it were true, there would be no forward progress in our
civilization. If we were all pessimists, we'd still be sitting in the
trees debating the merits of simple tools and basic language. That we
are where we are means that a true "realistic" attitude is a lot more
optimistic than many pessimists would imagine...

Anders Sandberg wrote about the kenes in Greg Benfords novel _Sailing
Bright Eternity_:

<Benford never went into any detail about it, and it was mainly an
imaginative plot device and something that fit well into the theme of
his pentalogy (the struggle and co-evolution of different phylums of
"life"). His basic idea seems to be that once you have sufficiently
rich "memospheres" where memes can thrive (like the Internet?),
predatory memes can appear, some kind of meta-lebel entities which are
not directly observable to the hosts of the memes (humans or
computers). In fact, since they somehow *eat* memes, we can't even
think or understand them. I seriously doubt that the last is possible,
but it is a fun idea that there could exist beings which we are *by
definition* unable to comprehend. >

That wasnt really a spoiler because theres a diagram right up front
in the book that shows this hierarchy of intelligences ;-)  

Im not sure these would be predatory memes in the sense of eating.
Its probably more a situation of control levels as in cybernetics.

Here are some excerpts that ARE more of a spoiler and give some flavor
for the story:

Benford has the 'voice' of the Syntony describe how: "a new stage
deploys. Above the apparent order of the gene world, above even the
drama of organisms ... the largest theater of all ... self-replicating
ideas in the minds of machines . . . called kenes." 

I wonder, though, if 'above' is an inappropriate concept. Perhaps
microbes and genes are just as intelligent as human organisms *on
their own level*. The same would hold for kenes and memes. Benford
seems to somewhat recognize this when he says "all wove and lurked and
had no conscious voice. They broke onto the conscious stage only with
force, sudden actors in a play that no one faction wrote."  I take
this to mean that they can only be conscious or act through their
embodiments or instantiations.

Then, showing an uncharacteristically bitter bias against humans,
Benford spoils it for me by saying "A human could not do that. Could
not step outside and watch itself have an idea". 

Hmph! I know that I have watched myself have ideas, though I certainly
cant do this with any kind of consistency or completeness. Then
Benford starts ranting about "The messiahs. The fever-eyed shamans.
Bastards," and how the Hunker Down was necessary "to shrug off the
addictive superstitions that beset all humans in groups". 

I wonder, though, whether intelligence and ignorance arent both
scalable. Where we are intelligent, Benford's so-called "Highers" know
nothing, and vice versa. This culminates in the deterministic dictum
of the Syntony: "Know this: All matters known to you further the
affairs of the lesser levels, to our wishes. We do not negotiate. We
do not dictate. We cause to happen." 

I think its possible that there is both upward and downward
causation, depending on what level you are observing.  Also, I wonder
if Benford really believes this. For example, he has Nigel say to
Abraham, when they seem to be floating in some kind of cyberspace
being examined by the Powers: "Ignore all these onlookers. Even Gods
can be just a backdrop, if we choose." 

The next step is to recognize that consciousness might be scalable.
The Syntony can not be conscious ("all wove and lurked and had no
conscious voice"), only its agents, on whatever level, can do that.
And if consciousness is scalable, then we could possibly abandon our
genomic bias and transform our viewpoints to any other level. 

As sages have said for centuries, "as above, so below".

   Yes, but a choice that should be left to each individual user.  If 
you want a clubhouse, nothing is to stop you from creating a filter that 
only allows only certain users posts to filter thru.  I believe there is 
already someone on this list, who has successfully done this.

   Myself, I welcome a more *open* forum - here's why. People rant on 
rave on this list about using critical thinking skills.  Part of the 
price of being open to new and *unexpected* good ideas, is to take the 
risk of receiving bad ones.  You have a brain - use it. Use your 
critical thinking skills to sort out the good from the bad.  Nothing 
irks me more, than someone else ramming there opinion of "correct" 
thinking down my throat. Its not only rude and disruptive, but it's 
frequency on this list, has given extropianism a bad name among people 
who would otherwise be its supporters.  That makes me sad.   

Please everybody, think for yourselves!

I was trying to say that you dont need scientists to explain it, you can tell
from looking at how the continents fit.  I got the info from a book called
science frontiers, and it is a composium of articles, they refer to
"geologists" in that article.  Why do need a specific name?  If you want more
info it's the "expanding earth hypothesis" and goes way back, 1933.

      forensics... It doesn't go from 0 
      to 50 percent, it goes from 0 to 100." 

  Kallstrom is saying that a given piece of wreckage is 
  either  100% evidence of a crime or it is  0% evidence 
  of a crime, it is never a fraction of 100%, such as 20% 
  or 60% evidence of a crime. That expresses the standard 
  of Aristotelian logic: X is either A or not A, X is not 
  both A and not A at the same time. That Aristotelian 
  standard of logic is, however, most often false.


  SAY HELLO TO FUZZY LOGIC

  Fuzzy logic is the cutting edge in the field of logic. 
  Fuzzy logic establishes that there are degrees of truth 
  with respect to a given statement and physical facts. If 
  I say that a glass of water that is 70% full is "a full 
  glass," that is 70% true (hence the statement is both 
  true (70%) and not true (30%) at the same time). [2]

  If, in accord with Aristotelian standards, we say that 
  because the glass is not 100% full, the statement "it's 
  a full glass" is therefore 0% true, then we discard 100% 
  of the truth about physical facts that the statement does
  contain, which is 70% of the truth it claims to contain.

  The fuzzy-logic conclusion "Statement X = 70% true" tells 
  us more about physical facts than the "X = 0% true" con-
  clusion of Aristotelian logic. Fuzzy is more accurate. 

  The Aristotelian standard of logic the FBI applies dictates 
  that if the wreckage of TWA 800 contained evidence that sat-
  isfied the standard  "100% evidence of a missile hit"  by 
  95%, such that there was  95% evidence of a missile hit, 
  then the FBI would, by the rules Kallstrom has stipulated,
  declare that there is 0% evidence of a missile hit, since
  if there is not 100%, then there can only be 0% evidence.

  I would say that the TWA 800 wreckage satisfies the 
  standard  "100% evidence of a missile hit"  by a very 
  high degree: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/crash.htm 


  IN CONCLUSION

  With Aristotelian logic in hand, the FBI can (a) sweep 99%
  of the truth under the rug, (b) claim there is 0% evidence 
  of a missile hit, and (c) still claim to be truthful, where 
  a "truthful conclusion" is defined as one derived from the
  flawed black-and-white standards of Aristotelian logic. I 
  believe that's exactly what the FBI is doing, and here's 
  the evidence: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm

There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time during
the last 15 years. As I recall, there were no dung beetles in Australia.
When the settlers introduced cattle the dung piles began to kill the
grass.
I forgot the outcome, but I think the settlers ended up importing them.

Yes, indeed.  Quite.  My little attempt at a joke or two, sorry.  Perhaps

on this list.  I took it for a tease, and fell in with it here.)  

And yes, there is surely something better I can do with my life, if

You're doing better, but you're not there yet.

Please cite a reference that we can look up somewhere. This theory
is still outside the bounds of physics as I understand it, but
closer. The problem is that gravity is hard to stop, and the
forces needed to hold up the weight of the planet require that
the core have a particular compressive strength at each depth.
The only way any part of the core can become less dense is if it
can do so by while still maintaining its compressive strength.
Temperature is another factor.

Would a geologist on the list please help me out here? Danny's
theory is a bit harder for an amateur like me to refute than was
the pole shift.

You are correct in principle, but your solution would be rather
expensive
both in initial cost and in storage space. Still, it may be time to
look at this approach again.

This is essentially a good idea. It violates no known laws of physics
:-)

Lets see: the english language has a bunch of words, but the typical
working vocabulary for this sort of thing might be about 15,000, roots,
with (say) an average of 4 words per root. (I'm guessing, but check a
dictionary.) So, we need to pay a reader to read 60,000 words, four
times
each. With associated overhead like clicking a button when the word is
flashed on the screen, the paid reader might do a word every 4 seconds
for (say) 4 hours per paid workday. That's 3600 words per day. Call it
20 workdays, and you can probably get it done by cheap labor (i.e., a 
high school kid.)  OK, the up-front cost isn't as high as we thought!

Now, what about the storage cost? I'd guess that a word will take, on
average, half a second to speak. A modern particular realtime
continuous speech compression algorithm known as A-CELP can compress
high-quality speech into 4000 bits/sec, or 500 bytes/sec. I strongly
suspect that you can derive an off-line compression algorithm that can
cut this in half, to 250 bytes/sec, or 125 bytes/word. So, our database
isn't too big after all: 7.5Mb. On a modern computer, that's nothing.

The computer would still have to handle the words other than these
60,000
based on a phonetic dictionary, and any word not in the reader's list
or in the phonetic dictionary would still have to use the rules
dictionary,
just as the current crop of programs do. However, we can use a much
bigger
phonetic dictionalry than today's programs, because we can most likely
write a program that can parse the phonetic spellings from the Random
House Unabridged CD-ROM or any other CD-ROM dictionary (after paying the
royalty, of course!)

Yes, grammatical analysis would be needed for stressing, and yes, it
would
be a big problem. My guess is that the program would get it wrong about
half the time. Its amazing how often a radio announcer messes up an
advertizement when a word is used in an unusual way.
For instance the emphasis should be different on the second word of

Dear Abraham Moses Genen:


At this point, I have become quite interested in what you do. I
generally consider much of my work product to be, at the very least,
imperfect. You, on the other hand, seem to have a high opinion of your
work product, evidenced by such statements as the following:

> During my service to the US Congress I was involved in drafting and/or

> (hopefully) helped to advance the cause of social evolution. 

I would probably not say something like this, and thus, it causes me to
raise an eyebrow. If the human condition needs such serious advancing,
how can you ever be happy with a few scant bits of legislation? 

In the same post you also said:

> I could name more than a few pieces of legislation I helped to formulate
> but it would be quite meaningless in the overall context of our continuing
> social evolution. 

But you were so proud of them just a second before you wrote this. I'm
genuinely puzzled. Are you trying to be inscrutable?

Here's my question to you:

In your estimation, what is the current state of the human condition?
And in what specific direction, that is, to what specific goal do you
see your work in the legislature advancing it?


Boat Drinks,

Hagbard


P.S. What do other list members think characterizes the current human
condition?

Geology has come a very long way since then. The contenental drift
theory
(Plate tectonics) hsa been around even longer, and indeed started from
just the same observatin you mention: the contenents do fit together
like a jigsaw puzzle in many places. The theory was initially
disparaged,
since it didn't fit the conventional wisdom of the time and since there
wasn't much else going for it. Then, in the 1960's, came the Deep Sea
Drilling Project (DSDP), in which the drill ship Glomar Challenger took
a lot of drill samples from the ocean floor. The samples showed that
the midocan ridges are very young, that the magnetic reversals are
symmetric about the ridges, and that the crust gets progressively older
as you move away from the ridges. Sure enough, it really did look like
the
whole thing is expanding! However, the alternative explanation was that
the conental plates are being pushed away from the ridges and are
overriding
other plates or are banging into each other. Sure enough when geologists
looked at the other side of the plates, they found subduction zones.
These
are places where one plate is overriding another. Siesmic studies have
looked at these zones extensively. Siesmic data can be used to create a
picture of the insides of the earth using a mathematical procedure
known as tomography (the same math that is used with X-ray data to
to a CAT scan). Data shows the subducted plates (which are still cold
and dense compared to the upper mantle material) driving far down
into the mantle. A lot of related phenomena (such as oceanic trenches
and volcanic arcs) are highly correlates and with and easily explained
by
this theory. Counter-evidence is hard to come by, and a competing
theory (such as expansion) will have to explain all of these phenomena
before it can compete.

Now I have a neat speculative theory for you: why does all the major
motion
seem to be toward the center of the Pacific, causing the "ring of fire?"
Maybe something (antimatter meteor?) took a chunk out there and the
earth
is now adjusting? (Estimated silliness factor on this is 90%, but what
the heck.)

Comment from our geologist friends?

The big three are:

Dragon NaturallySpeaking (shipping now)
IBM ViaVoice (in NDA beta)
DigitalDictate (apparently a VAR for IBM products; 
they're supposedly ahead of the pack on providing 
deferred-recognition products at present).

They're all pretty easy to find. I also just found 

www.voicerecognition.com 

but haven't evaluated them yet.

I've got more info on sound card choices and noise 
control (evidently noise contributes to increasing 
the size of the "search beam", whatever that is--I 
assume that means "makes feature extraction harder"),
if anyone wants it.

I think we are well out on a limb in regard to this list's focus, but just
to be accurate dung beetles were released in Australia by CSIRO to deal
with the millions of cow pats. The result was a huge success and its good
to see a positive introduction of a species to Australia after all the
negative ones (e.g. rabbit, fox, cat, buffulo, pig). Another useful
introduction of a species was type of month introduced as a natural
predator for prickly pear (another introduced species that went out of
control once it was introduced).

libertarian:

...2. One who approves of or advocates liberty. 

1878 Seeley Stein III. [doesn't give anything else].

1901 F.W. Maitland in English History Review July 419. ...In such
matters Englishmen are individualists and libertarians. The picture of
an editor defending his proof sheets ... before an official board of
critics is not to our liking. 

There's other cites from 1906, 1966, 1969, and 1972.

The archaism "libertine" may in certain contexts be synonomous with
"libertarian." I think this word is much, much older -- Roman Empire or
thereabouts.

Sorry the Shorter OED doesn't have list the original citation. Perhaps
someone with access to the complete OED could help better. For what its
worth the shorter says:

Libertarian. 1789. [f. Liberty + ARIAN, after Unitarian etc] 1. One who
holds the doctrine of the freedom of the will. Opp. to necessitarian. Also
attrib. or adj. 2. One who approves of or advocates libertry 1878. Hence
Libertarianism, 1. principle or doctrinces.

Thanks--I needed that. :)

I'm well aware of the word "libertine", and that's one of the brushes
libertarians get tarred with, for sure--what I'm actually trying to do is
trace the Non-Aggression Principle as it actually appears in literature 
that calls itself libertarian (not libertine! :) ).

A claim has been made elsewhere:

Well, you can't comb the hair on a bowling-ball - if everything is
moving, at least one convergence and one divergence are inevitable.
But I believe conventional wisdom says the Pacific Ocean is the scar
left by a really big collision which ripped out the Moon.  Frivolously 
I might suggest that the continents are just trying to slump into that 
hole.  Problem: I believe conventional wisdom also says that Pangaea 
has converged and split up more than once.

	I'm something of a student of exploration. Specifically, I'm most
interested in the 19th century American expansion into the Southwest. I am
currently in the midst of compiling an historical analysis on how
exploration as a social phenomena extends the concept of humanity. 

	It is my contention that the notion of a physical Frontier to be
explored, settled, tamed, understood etc. is central in determining
whether or not humanity(either en masse, or individually) can "evolve", in
any meaningful use of that term. Thus, I am curious as to whether or not
any of you think that extropianism can succeed as a movement within the
confines of a society without an accessable Frontier.

	Is it likely that extropianism, or any phenomological decendent of
such, can truly take hold within this society? And if so, do we risk
becoming a subculture? 

Cheers,
	Nigel.

What's this "our" business? Your chain of reasoning invariably leads to the 
conclusion that the only thing that's real is your thoughts, an obvious 
absurdity. On the other hand, If you'd said the only think that's real is 
John Clark's thoughts then it would be a much more reasonable theory.

Leaving solipsism aside, it's possible that you're correct, but is there any 
reason to think that The Mandelbrot Set is less real than the chair you're

...and then I sent it without pasting in the following:

"A libertarian is a person who believes that no one has the right, under
any circumstances, to initiate force against another human being, or to
advocate or delegate its initiation. Those who act consistently with this
principle are libertarians, whether they realize it or not. Those who
fail to act consistently with it are not libertarians, regardless of what
they may claim."

So I'm trying to find out when those two things started being associated
(the term and the belief).

Yes, this is similar to what I have read during my (spotty) studies
of history and archeology. 

It was Platon who wrote about Atlantis, although he attributed the
story to Solon who was said to have heard it from the Egyptians. It
is not unreasonable that the Egyptian folklore remembered it, ash
layers and signs of big flooding along the coast have been found from
the relevant era, and the disasters mentioned in Exodus could quite
well be based on the Thera disaster.

The moral is: don't build your civilization in a geologically
unstable area. Hmm, and I'm going to California in two weeks... :-)

Yes, it is amazing how hard it is to search for unfamiliar stuff. But
once you know a little, it becomes easy. Just another reason to get a
braod education - read everything you can get your hands on!

The next step is of course that you try to describe what you are
looking for, and automatic thesaurus generators list buzzwords/hapax
legomena that you might want to search for (or do a search for each
of these, showing only the results which fit your descriptions). I
just read about one such system that automagically generated a
thesaurus of terms related to Drosophilia Melanogaster from a set of
research databases. Of course, one can use "find similar sites"
functions too.

Hmm, how do one use the scale? By voting about it, or are there some
absolute standards (number of proven correct claims/total number of
claims)?

I think plenty of extropians (and transhumanists) believe there are
accessible frontiers. The most obvious is space; practically all
transhumanists I know think space colonization is important. Another
interesting possibility is the net as a new frontier: not a physical
frontier but an information frontier where new structures and worlds
can be created or discovered. 

Perhaps these movements are really a reaction to the lack of
accessible frontier? If there is no physical frontier, we must create
our own frontier, in space, on the net or in human evolution.

I don't think this society is compatible with extropianism, but it
might change so that (and be changed by) extropianism can take hold.
If this society does not change in such a direction, extropianism is
likely to become a subculture instead. 

It is my personal belief that it is possible to "infiltrate" the
mainstream with extropian memes, methods and projects in the long
run. The result might by something completely new.

Yes, that was a slight give-away :-) When I saw it, I got quite
curious about what those high-level things were, and Benford didn't

Yes, they are like the metasystems of Principia Cybernetica. Just as
an ant can't understand an anthill, a meme (or set of memes) can't
understand a keme.

I got the impression that the Syntony behaved in a fairly haughty
manner simply to get the right reactions from the humans. It might
have suited their purposes to make the humans look down on them. If
they had been awed by the Syntony they might have ended up as just
another group of followers, which would not have increased the
diversity of the manifold.

An interesting idea. Are we perhaps "conscious-centric"? We regard
conscious systems as better than non-conscious systems just because
we (apparently) are conscious. It might be just as silly as
anthropocentrism or the belief in a fixed self. 

One of my visions of a posthuman state is a wast sea of mental "lego" 
blocks (perhaps implemented as a wast tuple space running on a
jupiter brain?). They are constantly tumbling into each other,
forming transient systems of all sizes. External influences affect
this sea, making useful systems emerge and then melt back into the
sea when their purpose is completed. It might be that most of the
system is unconscious and nonintelligent, but parts become conscious
if needed. A bit like the Thinker caste of Bruce Sterlings classic
story _Swarm_.

Confusion?

Most humans doesn't seem to have any real grasp of what is going on,

I personally distinguish the reality of physical objects from the
reality
of mathematical constructs. However I can't see a difference in the
reality
of the Mandelbrot set and the reality of the number 1, or of the set of
real numbers.

Personally in one of the two companies where I've had to conduct
interviews we did essentially the opposite (high scores on our programming
tests were far more important than 'social skills') and it worked well.

Personally I loved 'V for Vendetta', at least as a work of art and
political propaganda; I wasn't as impressed with the story itself. V never
really had any problems to solve, he/she/it could do just about anything
they wanted to. And am I the only one on the planet who thought that
'Watchmen' was so-so with an ending ripped straight out of an Arthur C
Clarke essay? 

With some reservations, I really liked the British version of 'The
Adventures of Luther Arkwright'; the US printing screwed up a lot of the
art and the comic suffered from an average publication rate of one issue a
year so the later issues are far more impressive than the early ones.

Yes, but left-wing in the Iain Banks sense; more like anarcho-socialists
than authoritarian socialists. I think I have far more in common with them
than with, say, the avowedly capitalist Tory party.

2000AD left wing? Some of the 80s stories certainly leant that way,
particularly those by the authors in question, but I'd have a hard time
seeing Judge Dredd as left-wing (though I suspect he'd have loved to work
in Stalinist Russia...)

Here's my theory: money.  Whoever gets the first really good speech-to-text
product out there is going to make tons of money.  Contrairiwise,
text-to-speech is clearly only going to make a few hundred kilos of money.
Hence, the smart money is investing in improving speech-to-text.  

Some anecdotal evidence toward this point: I know three people who are
working on speech-to-text (and I know them by three different routes, so
it's not a circle of friends).  I don't know *anyone* working on text-to-speech.

There may also be an element of 'the good is the enemy of the best': present
day text-to-speech is good enough to understand, so the motivation for
improving it is less than for speech-to-text, where present day tech is
still annoyingly inaccurate.

I don't believe Robin's statistic about IQ being a better predictor of
outcomes than interviews, because I don't know how one can objectively
measure outcomes in the sort of environment I'm in, or how one can
control for the fact that some people are just plain much better at
interviewing and hiring than others. (I've noticed that certain
managers are notorious for making bad hiring decisions and that others
create very solid teams -- how does one control for that in a study?)

I do know this -- my own hiring decisions have almost always been
extremely solid, and although I have some small objective tests I use,
including some simple tests of things like reasoning skills, a lot of
it depends on how people react to my interview.

No, he's saying that things which don't exist in reality can exist only as

Yes.  I can find a chair in physical reality.  I've yet to find a Mandelbrot
set, and have strong reasons to believe I'll never find one.  The Mandelbrot
set is more analogous to the *concept* of chair, which also exists only in
our minds.  In this case, however, there are no representations.

I've heard that theory.  The problem is that the moon is about 4by old, while
Pangaea appears and disappears on about a 600 my cycle.  The continents move
out (ring of fire) but then they move back (ring of blah?).  They've cycled
about 6 time since the moon formed.  Also, the current theory of moon
formation is that a *big* rock smacked the earth and knocked the entire crust
into orbit, in little bits.  Most of it stayed up there to form the moon.
 But as a result, there's no particular place the moon's material came from.

But I've also heard a another theory.  Continents, especially large ones,
thin the rock over which they sit, making it easier for magma to pop up,
creating new rifts.  Once formed, the rift creates an ocean.  However, once
the continent is gone, rifts are more likely to close and eventually do, and
the continents drift back together.  So you get a cycle: Pangaea - Pangaea
rifts apart - Atlantic/Pacific/multiple continents - Atlantic rifts close -
New Pangaea.

Supposedly the Atlantic closes rather than the Pacific because it's always
smaller.

I have no problem in principle with the existance of statists like
AMG. AMG is free to continue believing his attempts and those of
others to regulate people's lives to be "good for them" or whatever he
wishes. On the other hand, I'd frankly prefer that he not hang around
here if that's what he believes.

Occassionally, I find it interesting to actually debate things with
statists. That is to say, I occassionally enjoy demolishing their
arguments, and since their arguments are nearly always very poor, this
is not very stressful. However, I tend to pick the time and place for
such things when *I* wish to do so, not when others do.

The question has been brought up "is this a clubhouse or a recruitment
effort". It's obviously a clubhouse, or at least was originally
intended as such. I must admit that the original intent might not
matter, and that many institutions evolve and that answering a fuzzy
non-eprime question like "what IS this thing we call the extropians
list" isn't even possible.

However, for those that care what my original intent was, back in the
mists of time, when I asked Max for permission to open the doors on
the electronic discussion ground for readers of "Extropy" magazine,
I'll re-iterate it:

The world is a big, dark cold place full of statists, deathists,
Rifkinites, etc. Every day, all of us do battle with that world, in
greater or lesser ways. Every once in a while, its nice to kick off
the shoes and have some intelligent discussion with people who
basically agree with you. There are VAST areas of unexplored terrain
just within the "extropian sphere". How *do* you deal effectively
with things like the defense problem in an anarchist framework? What
are possible strategies for creating the first assemblers? Are there
nootropics that are actually of real use? (Those just off the top of
my head without any real pause for thinking.) Sure there are places
for discussing all this stuff elsewhere, but they are vastly
outnumbered by the number of places where even mentioning you're an
anarchist or mentioning you are trying to live at least as long as
the unverse continues will get you hostility.

There is also the issue of pure cameraderie. Simon Levy recently
mentioned to me that the biggest tangible long-term benefit to him of
the Extropians mailing lists was the set of long term friendships he
forged through it with like-minded people, and I tend to agree with
him there. I can meet statists like AMG any time or place I like --
how easy is it, though, to meet fellow anarchocryonicists?

Lastly, there are a lot of things I've legitimately learned through
exposure to lots of other smart people who basically share my world
view, and lots of opportunities I've gained over time to refine my
ideas and in some cases alter or abandon them. Although one might not
think it, my viewpoints on a lot of topics, and many of my practical
every-day attitudes, changed a lot because of my exposure to smart
people who were coming from the same direction but who disagreed with
me on particular points.

There is nothing wrong with "recruitment" and such, but there are
valid functions in the world for both places where one debates ideas
like the extropian world view and for places where one kicks back and
relaxes with one's fellow extropians. This is not to say that the
extropian world view should be a dogmatic fixed set of ideas
unamenable to debate or change, but only that *CONSTANT* debate about
things people already basically have their views set on is tiresome,
and one wants a place to get away from it periodically. An idea set
that is defended from questioning is doomed to become an encrusted
dogma, but one doesn't want to spend every minute of one's entire life
questioning every premise, either.

Andrea (as she so often does -- thank goodness we have a rational head
or two about) points out that I'm perhaps romanticizing the turbulent
past of the list and that there has ALWAYS been conflict between the
periodic interloper who thought that democratic socialism was the
bee's knees or some such, and that we shouldn't think there ever was a
"golden age". Fair enough. However, whether or not in the past we had
less or more "junk" posted isn't ultimately important -- what is
important is "what do we want". [As an aside, although I remember the
problem being smaller years ago, I must admit that my memory isn't
what it once was -- oh, for a limitless solid state infrastructure
instead of this limited cranium full of squishy neurons!]

The thought is that both groups migrated from a common origin in Central
Asia, which seems to generate invading cultures, (Athabascans, Aryans, Turks,
others of varying success).  The Athabascans were unusual in that they were
able to get to North America as well.  It's thought that there was cultural
diffusion along the way - but the remains have been exterminated by susequent
invasions along more-or-less the same routes.

The Iceland route requires serious deep sea vessels, which (probably) weren't
available.  Also, the Athabascans are in northwestern North America, although
they made it as far south as the Mexican border; the Navajo are Athabascan.

>europe? Is this archeologically prior to the aryan migration?

No evidence I'm aware of, other than easier travel via the land route and the
remaining language isolates in Siberia.  Yes, it's thousands of years prior
to the Aryan migration - something like 6000 or 8000 BC.

This is from the ever-so-handy Dictionary of Word Origins (it's for =
the word 'liberal' - but liberal and libertarian are obviously =
etymologically related):

"liberal  [14]  The Latin word for 'free' was _liber_. It came from =

have denoted 'people, nation' (in which case the underlying =
etymological meaning of the word would be 'being a member of the =
(free) people,' as opposed to 'being a slave'). From _liber_ was =
derived _liberalis_ 'of freedom,' which passed into English via Old =
French _liberal_. Its earliest English meanings were 'generous' and =
'appropriate to the cultural pursuits of a 'free' 'man' (as in 'the =

as a designation of a particular political party in Britain dates =
from  the early 19th century.
  "Also from Latin _liber_ come English _libertine_ [14] and =
_liberty_ [14]."

The number in brackets indicates the century of the word's first use. =
[14] means the word was first used in the 14th century.

Pre-rant:  Of course humans can't "effect" "what is going on" -- there's
too much of it, and it's already going on!  Maybe when we can make our
own pocket universes, or live in virtual realities, we can "effect" what
goes on in them.  However, we _can_ "affect" what is going on now, or
"have an effect on" it.  Look them up.  (Grammatical/semantic pre-rant
complete -- we now return you to our regularly scheduled discussion.)

Fear.

Fear of the unknown.  Fear of failure and fear of success (both are forms
of fear of not living up to expectations, the first now and the second in
the future).  Fear of rejection.  Fear of ridicule.  Fear of pain.  Fear
of loss.  Fear of abandonment.  Fear of attack.  Fear of change.

I think fear helped keep our ancestors alive thousands and millions of
years ago, but I think that its survival value has diminished greatly given
how small the chances are that any given thing will kill us.  As a matter
of fact, when I feel a twinge of fear at (say) talking to a crowd, I say to
myself "You know, all they can do is hiss and boo -- they're not allowed to
gun me down.".  That helps me -- your mileage may vary.

Hopelessness.

A feeling that there's nothing they can do about all the wrongs that are
going on in the world (death, taxes, hunger, violence, corruption, etc.).

I concur that psychoactives have uses.

I consider the "trepanned chihuahua" label to apply to anyone
who *barks as if part of his brain was sticking out*, rather
than someone who has (or might have) done drugs.

That may not have been the intent of the originator of the term.

Dear Eric and other fellow Extropians:

The situations I mentioned involving the exploitation of contract labor
and other forms of independent contracting have been fairly well reported
in the media over the years, although most of the reports could have been
a bit more detailed . 

I'm not sure if you really want me to dig into the archives to provide you
with a plethora of incidents and specifics to counter your apparent
preferrence for minimal regulation. Leave it to say that I sincerely
believe that all forms of laborers deserve some sort of substantive safety
net. This, believe, is part of our social contract.

Anyway, those who wish to do some research into the history of  labor
exploitation and unfair practices in interstate commerce are free to do
so.   

If you wish to do some further research check with your state department
of labor regarding intrastate violations.

Enjoy!!!

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians:

Actually, :-) some of them will in fact be frustrated and disgusted
politically appointed bureaucrats who have gotten into a rut and are
simply mad at the world. 
Others are simply those who are in the private sector and feel that they
might be discommoded by change. Frequently, the general run-of-the-mill
kvetching is simply an outlet or sublimation of other anxieties or
agressions that have nothing really to do with with whatever they're
kvetching about. 

Such is human nature.

Dear Anton and other fellow Extropians:

In a recent message Anton asked me what the most significant piece of
legislation I ever worked on was. He stated that this was done to please
the Anarchists among us. (Yes, I was at the Woodstock festival way back
when, but, that's another story.)

I'm not really sure that I can fully answer that question since the long
term effects of some of the legislative actions I was involved in have not
yet had their full effect.
On the other hand one of the laws that I helped promulgate many years ago
has already had a significant effect in the State of New York. It was, if
nothing else, one of the most enjoyable and enlightening inquiries I ever
worked on. 

I guess that it's nostalgic story time.  

Many eons ago I became involved in a legal and sociological inquiry into
social referral services. Sometimes, under certain circumstances, they are
referred to as computer dating services. This inquiry resulted from
consumer complaints about a computer dating service that was opperating in
NYS. 

It seems that some door-to-door salesmen were involved in selling the
service for in excess of $1000. while using a retail installment contract
with a fairly high interest rate. They claimed in their sales pitch that
the matches that they could make using a computer would be absolutely
compatible with their client's profiles. They offered a guarantee of
compatibility or your money back. Obviously, the claims and the refund
offer were somewhat lacking in sincerity.

While conducting the inquiry and gathering evidence I was able to
determine the following:

1. The company did not have a computer.
2. There was no data base of compatible characteristics.
3. Only very (highly?) limited social and psychological research had been
done in the scientific disciplines on the subjects of social, intellectual
and emotional compatability.
4. Congress had refused to appropriate funds to the NIMH and other
interested social scientists to conduct research and other studies in
human compatibility (This obviously contradicts the claims of many well
know politicians claimed interest in "family values") as a waste of
taxpayers funds. 
5. The information on clients of the company was available for commercial
exploitation (and possible blackmail).

As the evidence of possible wrongdoing accumulated we held a public
hearing in advance of preparing and intoducing legislation. Among the
experts I consulted with while accumulating evidence were Dr. Margaret
Mead, Dr. Benjamin A. Passamanick, Dr. Stanley Milgram, Dr. Abraham Maslow
and numerous other prominant social scientists. I also interviewed several
hundred of the consumers who had given money to the company. In the
process I think I learned a little about human behavior.

Following the hearing a bill was introduced in the NYS legislature which
resulted in Section 394-c of the General Business Law. 

The legislation, which regulated for-profit organizations involved in the
sale of commercial social referal services saved a lot of people a lot of
money in the very short term. It provided guarantees that the privacy of
the people who became involved in social referral service schemes would be
protected. It provided a basis whereby legitimate research in human
compatibility could be conducted. It helped to educate many professionals
as to the extent of the problems of  "The Lonely Crowd." 

Ultimately, the actions we took, in addition to passing needed regulatory
legislation,
resulted in some changes and improvements in our social systems. 

While these changes may seem minor in the overall scheme of things, I'd
like to think that It had some real effect on educating and otherwise
helping a lot of people over the years. 

Even if we don't accomplish all we that we would like to accomplish in our
lifetimes, as long as what little we do accomplish aids our society in
some material way and makes the world we live in a better place, then, I
think, we have lived a worthwhile life.

Enjoy!!!

     Guru George stated:
     
     Basically, there seems to be pretty good evidence for a fairly uniform
     and sophisticated pre Indo-European culture across the whole 
     Mediterranean and Balkan region from about 7000 BC to about 3500 BC, 
     which seems tohave been gradually destroyed by successive waves of  
     invasions by bastards with bronze swords, who subsequently got to 
     build all the monuments.  Kind of depressing really.
     
     Rick responds ;->
     
     Thus the first clamor towards owning beach front property was born.  
     Seriously though, as things turned out, it seems like more barbaric 
     tribes of humans short-circuited what may have been a much 
     sooner-to-arrive age of prosperity for those emerging cultures.  Don't 
     know enough about the history other than to skim the surface but I 
     find it fascinating how history seems to be defined by its wars.  
     Maybe this is where it all started.  When things are going smoothly,

NOTICE TO THE EXTROPIANS LIST:

My new policy: in order to make peace with the estimable Mr. Genen,
and avoid any charges of kvetching, I'll confine myself to responding
only to those parts of his missives with which I agree. If I do not post
a response, it may be that I think he's a self-described career meddler
in others' affairs, and proud of it, as we've both said; upon the other
hand,
it may simply be that I'm too in awe of his worldliness and--what 
was the word?--pondering? to dream of adding a jot from my own 
callow, feckless, worthless few decades' experience of trying 
to create the future's writing and thinking tools, so that 
those who choose might be free to live science fiction themselves
rather than read it while living in chains--which bankrupt time, by the
bye, 
some as the son of a politician, tells me among other things that 
much harm is done for others' good; excepting, of course, 
any law ever drafted by present company--I'm sure we needed every one 
of them more than we need(ed) a world hypertext library 
or a fundamental shift in how we perceive ethics.

Can you tell I've been reading 18th-century authors lately? :)

     I was going to pipe in with apathy but I think confusion probably

     majority of people subscribing to Judeo-Christian principles (and I

     walking the Jesus walk...which is not anything like Church Lady's

     technology can't come up with infrastructures to handle 
     disenfranchisement of an increasing number of stray humans.  After 
     moving to SF, I initially carried a roll of quarters to dole out.  It 
     didn't take long for me to stiffen my gaze straight ahead as I passed 
     by the shaking paper cup of the drifter or the disoriented mumblings 
     of the crack head or otherwise mentally ill derilect.  I started out 
     not understanding how there could be so many.  Not figuring it out and 
     not deciding to make it my life quest, I am presently choosing apathy. 
     I still don't understand.  I have rationalized my stand because I have 
     classified many of them (not including the mentally ill although they 
     implicitly qualify) as non-contributors.  
     
     I say that if you want to be a participant in a culture, you should be 
     contributing to it, adding value.  Although I acknowledge that the

     the mark quite often but it does often sound like a Russian with a

     I assume this would require more than look up tables to decide when to 
     pronounce "lead" as LEED or LEAD or "live" with a short or long "i".  
     That's just one of its shortcomings (but it WAS free).  I was going to 
     go about looking for a better program.  If I could capably understand 
     (and more enjoy) the inflections and timbre AND it hit more on the

     articles and books while making my bed or some other mundane task.  
     Seems like the blind would appreciate this as well.

A failure to honor money-back guarantees could be addressed by
standard contract law.  And if customers wanted privacy enough they
could only buy such products that guarenteed privacy.

So the key here seems to be that you identified what you considered to
be a low quality product, which customers weren't treating as such.
You thought you knew better than them about the product quality, and
proceeded to make it difficult or impossible for them to buy that product. 

This sort of situation is exactly the sort that I have focused on
modeling in my academic work on product bans.  (See:
http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/whyban.ps) So I am interested to learn
more about your reasoning.

Did you consider the possibility of just warning customers that you
considered this product to be low quality?  For example, you could
have printed a flyer which you required salespeople to give potential
customers prior to a sale.  (A similar things happens with moving
companies now.)  Did you consider just taxing the products you disliked?

Who exactly did you think would thank you for this work, and reward
you politically.  Customers who would otherwise have bought the
product?  Those who would have sold the product?  Those who sold
competing products?  Other concerned citizens?

Well, I rarely criticize people for being narcissistic. (If
someone is being narcissistic *and* getting on my nerves, I try
to find something other than narcissism to criticize them for.)
And I have always loved Dali's painting "The Metamorphosis of
Narcissus", which hangs in the Tate in London for those of you
lucky enough to be on that side of the Atlantic.

Perhaps there is nothing wrong with being "conscious-centric".

Also, shipbuilding was pretty well advanced in the Eastern Mediterranean
by then, and (as far as I remember) there was active marine trade between
Crete and Egypt during the height of Minoan civilization.

It makes sense that Plato and Solon would have heard this story from the
Egyptians, too, and not from their own ancestors, since their own ancestors
were of the illiterates who finished off what was left of Minoan civilization
after Thera. As far as I'm concerned, civilization means a society that is
capable of producing and preserving literature, not just urban society.
That's why Sumer and Egypt are conventionally listed as the "first
civilizations", even though Neolithic urbanization in Palestine and 
Anatolia precedes Sumerian and Egyptian urbanization. The Sumerians and
the Egyptians learned to write before the Anatolians and Palestinians
did.

(I'm using "literature" in the widest possible sense, a sense that would
include modern cinematic works and physics textbooks, for instance.)

This quote says only that gender *is* constructed, which I have not
disputed.  It does not address my question, which is why social
institutions would want to hide the fact of that construction.  If you
recall, our conversation started this way:

AFAIR that's not what NASA and the Russians have been saying on the Net. 
I could see that perhaps he switched on the automatic system when he
realised that he was about to crash it, but that would still leave the
blame in his hands, not the computer's.

Not really; Mir has plenty of support, and that's what caused the problem.
A fast relativistic ship couldn't be holed by a transport because no
transport could catch up with it, and it would have to be equipped to
repair itself without external intervention.

How long do you think the RKBA would have lasted in America without the
Bill of Rights? How would the CDA have been defeated without the First
Amendment? The advantage of a written constitution is that you have a
specific set of restrictions on government that you can point to when they
get out of line. It may not prevent abuse, but it's a good start.

I agree, but a written constitution provides a lot more protection against
the mob when they're out for blood. Compare the latest Supreme Court
judgements to the banning of all handguns and proposed ban on all rifles
over .22 in Britain.

This could be fun.  I think an interesting experiment would be to create 
an extropian web-based (cgi) voting scheme with user-authentication, 
where we could rate scientists on both their scientific merits and 
extropian relevance.  For example the scientists responsible for the 
cloning of sheep and the exowomb would be given high extropian ratings. 
The results of this ongoing democratic survey could be displayed as a 
2-d grid with extropian merit as one axis, and scientific merit on the 
other.  It might look something like this:

Sure; I think her writing is over the top and motivated largely by her
desire to be recognized as a genius. However, I think the basic idea is
sound and it's a fun rant. Of course she's British, so it may well be more
valid in British society than others.

Well I think that one look at the turnover of the movie, TV and publishing
industry would make that clear... but her main idea is that the human race
values other people far more than knowledge about reality; most people
would rather be alpha-human in their little social group than learn and
create, and that even most of those who start out desiring to do the
opposite learn in time to follow the crowd. In my experience this is
generally true. 

> that efficiency precludes

She's not saying that, exactly; as I read her she means that sane people
would rather be able to say that they really want to do something but that
they can't do it because society prevents them, than to actually go out
and do it, and risk failing in the process. Again I'd say this is
generally true in British society but less so in American.

Try living in a socialist country for a while... or at least a more
socialist country than America.

Hmm, I think it's somewhat implausible but wars have often seemed to be
fought to take people's minds off of reality. For example the Falklands or
the Gulf War, both of which greatly improved the politicians' popularity
because people were able to forget just how bad they were doing at home.

For another perspective on this, check out John Lilly's "Programming and

PET scans work by injecting glucose with some tritium atoms replacing
some of the hydrogens (correct me if I am wrong here, it's been a
while). Tritium decays to helium 3 by emitting a positron. The areas of
the brain which are active metabolize the glucose, trapping the tritium
in the tissues for a short time, so the PET is a map of metabolic
activity. A variety of ways are used to activate the areas of interest,
I would surely think speaking the target language would do here. As I
recall, the article didn't say.

As does Terence McKenna. I have a more mundane POV. As the psychedelic
occupies the inhibitory sites, the noise level in the brain increases.
Noise when applied to a complex system will evoke whole complexes of
experience, well beyond mere pixillated snow type effects. Such
evocations will have all of the attributes of psychedelic experience.
What I have noticed is that the user of same only comes out with some
variation of what they went in with. Terence, for example, has a mind
full of interesting concepts to start with, so the result is even more
interesting. Dull friends of mine can take shrooms and have an ecstatic
trance of very little if anything. If a genuine hyperspace link were
true, wouldn't even the dull ones have interesting stuff to report??

BTW, exploring one's noise can be very useful and creative.

Robert Anton Wilson lives in Capitola. I've been there a number of times

not
nearly 90.

And the little ecology of parasitical businesses. I had a fire in my
garage. The insurance people are only going to pay 85% of the repair
costs, if I use their contractor. I went to the planning office. Now I
have a 5 page form with a checklist of 50 things REQUIRED just to submit
a plan! The paperwork is harder than the job itself! I will have to hire
an expert to deal with these 50 items or this will never get done.
Sample item: "all floor, wall, ceiling & roof framing with size and
spacing of members (show compliance with table 25-Q (UBC) Nailing
Schedule)". So, another $600 just to create the plan, $700 to file it,
no guarantee of approval.

With 30 days for approval at best, 3 weeks to get documents ready, I may
have to wait through the winter to fix the goddamn roof.

Conclusion: Building codes are not Extropian.

Positive experience is fun, and likely to be useful personally and in

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I am considering the following three research projects for my new 2 yr
position as a health policy scholar at UC Berkeley.  My immediate goal
is to get a tenure-track position after this one, which I think will
require that I focus in more depth on a single topic than I have in
the past.  I'm interested in advice/preferences regarding my choice.

The three projects are:

1) "Incentive Contracts" (http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/buyhealth.html)

    Examine more closely my proposal to bundle health and life
insurance, in order to give caregivers a more direct incentive to
support health.  Its a good idea for a product, but the problem
academically is the product idea is too simple and has never been
tried.  Academics would rather hear a theory to explain why this
product isn't offered, or data on actual trials so see if it works
better.  This project could lead into a health economist position.

2) "Explaining Product Bans" (http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps)

    Elaborate and test my theory of product bans as a response to the
cheap-talk nature of warning labels.  Theoretically, I could allow
regulators to tax products, in addition to labeling and banning them.
Empirically, I could see if this theory can explain statistical
regularities in actual ban vs. labeling choices in some health area
(such as drug approval or professional licensing).  This project could
lead to positions in either public economics, public policy, or
political science.

3) "Why Do We Disagree?" (http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps)

    Elaborate my theoretical result that error-prone but "savvy"
agents cannot disagree for information reasons.  Perhaps do
anthropological-style interviews of pairs of people who disagree on
specific health policy questions, to suggest hypotheses for more
formal empirical and/or experimental study.  This project might lead
to a position in political science, where they approve of such
methodogical breadth.  It might also lead to a position as an economic
theorist, though economists don't care for interview methods.

Well maybe, but they also undoubtedly cost a lot of money (and wasted a
lot of money, bureaucracies being what they are) that could probably
have been put to better use (hey, you were making value decisions for
others - why can't I?).

They also took the responsibility of decision away from people and
infantilised them just that little bit.

What other possibilities did you consider and reject, may I ask?

Absolutely!  Another one is the Scottish S-F writer Ken McLeod (Star
Fraction and The Stone Canal).  He actually knows some of the folks in
the Libertarian Alliance here in the UK (they figure in the dedication
of Star Fraction)!

Ah well, there's the subtlety of British irony for you!  I think the general idea was
to make fun of American 'cultural imperialism', and extrapolate
its horrendous possibilities (as they see them), while at the same time
pointing to how we are all suckers for it at the same time.

In the abstract, of course you are right.  Where I would disagree with
you is that your legislative activities pre-empt, and destroy the
possibility of, people building their own safety nets together, and
building a real sense of communal solidarity, with the money they would
have had if you hadn't appropriated it from them in taxes.  Not to
mention the fact that self-help builds self-esteem and the confidence to
challenge abuse.

Have you ever heard the story of the broken window, BTW?

Don't get me wrong, the programming test is the most important factor.  We
certainly didn't interview anyone who wasn't up to par on the test.  But we
were hiring programmers to work on small teams with producers and artists,
and to occasionally deal with clients.  Are you arguing that programming
test results will predict a candidates ability to handle team dynamics and
to support artists and designers?  Or are you arguing that those skills are
more easily learned than programming skills?

Perry and I are arguing in favor of our anecdotal evidence over research
and statistics.  Not something I normally like to do, but somehow I think
that certain kinds of jobs are harder evaluate in a statistical manner.

Now, nevermind the usual lament about our memory not being what it used to
be. (I suspect I only remember the old list because I haven't read it for
so long, so those memories haven't been overwritten by new memories of the
list.)  I think Perry might have an actual problem down the road, when he

STARTED about his idiotic economics - grrrrr), but he doesn't give much
support for why memory should fade as badly as he makes it.  He seems to be
extrapolating from current aging trends, and then makes his longevity
treatment incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and fixing memory
problems as it does other problems of aging.

If we don't make his assumptions, do we still think this will be a big
concern?  If we fix Alzheimer's, what are the reasons to think that
long-term memory is more limited for 140 year olds than for 40 year olds?
If this really is a problem, maybe it's a use for those life-recordings,
no?  It would suck if you lost all the experiences that happened between
childhood and when you get uploaded.

Personally Concerned,
Andrea

It makes sense that the first firms to take this approach are themselves
consulting companies.  They have the pressures of variable business and
cost issues, and they already need to track costs pretty closely.  Making
this work for a product company seems harder to me, but I'm not sure why.  

Possible reasons: 
 -- long-term product development needs people to see the firm's best
interests as their own

 -- products require more coordination than contracted projects or
services, despite what coders think. 

 -- products aren't as well thought-out initially than tasks a company
plans to out-source

 -- the difficulty of signaling that the same task is more critical or more
profitable on one product than another

 -- the difficulty designing products to interface with other company
product and to scale appropriately (i.e. company needs that are separate
from market needs)

 -- if a product has direct impact on a company's revenue, then upper
management needs to meddle or it would never get out the door ;-)

Am I off-base here?  It could be that this is happening left and right,
it's just happening slowly.

Here's the one example I have.  Chris Cole, the person I mentioned in my
earlier post, has what he calls the "Product Author Model".  Senior coders
in his company pitched ideas, and when they are given a green light they
were responsible for design and implementation of that entire product.
They were funded for their salary and other costs of developing the
product, including salaries for other coders (though Chris believed in
small coding teams, much like Brooks in _The Mythical Man-Month_).  Product
Authors also got a cut of the profit from that product, usually around 6%.
If people are interested, I can come up with some more details about this
model.

As a long-timer, I have to agree with Perry's assessment of the initial and,
to my mind, recurring benefit of this list:  intelligent discourse with
people who share overlapping and rare working hypotheses about how the world
works--and about how to work the world.

Perry, among others, has often taken on the task of educating newbies about
the basics.  But I've never regarded that as the list's primary purpose.
 Other means of education--like background reading--strike me as much more
efficient.

Of late, I've as a rule deleted huge chunks of posts.  Very few current
writers, frankly, impress me very much.

of humanity as a whole; not to say that there aren't *good* things...

What is a frontier but an unexplored and uncharted area? I think to
limit your hypothesis to the *physical* frontier is avoiding the
problematizing fact that *everything* that is currently unknown yields
for humanity a frontier. The human brain is a frontier, the atom is a
frontier, the universe is a frontier. Indeed death itself is a frontier.
All these are unexplored and uncharted -- and all either are or will be
accessible in the (near) future.    

Another thought just occurred to me. In light of the frontiers I just
mentioned, what is it about these frontiers that spurs evolution? A part
of it might be the necessity of overcoming obstacles heretofore unknown.
This pushes the envelope of ingenuity and creativity, and therefore, the
ability of those doing the exploring. Another tool in the toolchest,
so-to-speak.

I'll approach these from the point of view of which would improve the
world the most from my perspective.

First, I think (3) is the least pragmatically useful.  The paper was way over
my head, and to the very limited extent I could understand it, it didn't seem
to match the real world.  I don't know whether the problem is that people
aren't rational, or whether their stated reasons for their beliefs don't
match their real ones, or what.  But I doubt that anyone's going to change
how people choose their beliefs.  So it seemed mostly of academic value.

(1) and (2) are both interesting and suggest possible ways that the world
could improve.  However (1) scares me a little.  If my HMO also issued my
life insurance, it would seem like it was balancing my life vs my death on
strict financial grounds.  Maybe this makes sense economically, but it
gives me a very uncomfortable feeling.  "Sorry, we've decided it's cheaper
just to pay out your life insurance than to cure you.  Have a nice death."

(2) looks promising.  I think we may well see a climate in which
alternatives to strict government regulation are explored.  The rise of
multinationals, the trans-territorial nature of the net, the increased
access to information, all could work towards government as provider of
authoritative information rather than as controller of interactions.

I just heard an example of how these ideas are in the air.  On the Lehrer
NewsHour last night there was an interview, I think with Charles Murray,
about his book on libertarianism.  In the book he apparently has his
own suggestion (more of a thought experiment) for an alternative, which
would be to let companies explicitly "opt out" of government regulation.
They'd have to make it clear up front that they were doing that,
so you'd have a choice of flying on a government-regulated airline or
one which was unregulated.  Murray argued that unregulated businesses,
in order to compete, would have to make sure they were just as safe as
the regulated ones, but that they'd be able to do it more efficiently.

So from the point of view of making a difference in the world, I would
lean towards the product-ban alternative proposal.  Whether this makes
sense in terms of a career path, I don't know.  But it seems like an
area where some practical results could occur.

Interesting.  I recently posted to the effect that I now don't take
trips very seriously anymore - I actually enjoy them (on the odd
occasion) as mostly just pretty visual and conceptual nonsense that
occasionally throws up something that proves interesting in the context
of 'normal' experience; and one of the main reasons for this change of
attitude was reading the 'Prelude' to 'Consciousness Explained by Daniel
C Dennett, where he talks about dreams and a party game called
'Psychoanalysis' (it has other names too, I think).

The party game goes like this: (quoting Dennett) "... one person, the
dupe, is told that while he is out of the room, one member of the
assembled party will be called upon to relate a recent dream.  This will
give everybody else in the room the story line of that dream so that
when the dupe returns to the room and begins questioning the assembled
party, the dreamer's identity will be hidden in the crowd of responders.
The dupe's job is to ask yes/no questions of the assembled group until
he has figured out the dream narrative to a suitable degree of detail,
at which point the dupe is to psychoanalyze the dreamer, and use the
analysis to identify him or her.

"Once the dupe is out of the room, the host explains to the rest of the
party that no one is to relate a dream, that the party is to answer the
dupe's questions according to the following simple rule: if the last
letter of the last word of the question is in the first half of the
alphabet, the question is to be answered in the affirmative, and all
other questions are to be answered in the negative, with one proviso: a
non-contradiction override rule to the effect that later questions are
not to be given answers that contradict earlier anwers.  

"... When the dupe returns to the room and begins questioning, he gets a
more or less random, or at any rate arbitrary, series of yeses and noes
in response.  The results are often entertaining. ... When the dupe
eventually decides that the dreamer - whoever he or she is - must be a
very sick and troubled individual, the assembled party gleefully retorts
that the dupe himself is the author of the "dream".   This is not
strictly true, of course.  In one sense, the dupe is the author by virtue
of the questions he was inspired to ask.  (No one *else* proposed putting
the three gorillas in the rowboat with the nun.)  But in another sense,
the dream simply has no author, and that is the whole point. Here we see
a process of narrative production, of detail accumulation, with no
authorial intentions or plans at all - an illusion with no illusionist.

"The structure of this party game bears a striking resemblance to the
structure of a family of well-regarded models of perceptual systems.  It
is widely held that human vision, for instance, cannot be explained as
an *entirely* "data-driven" or "bottom-up" process, but needs, at the
highest levels, to be supplemented by a few "expectation-driven" rounds
of hypothesis testing (or something analogous to hypothesis testing).

"...Whatever the utlimate verdict turns out to be on generate-and-test
theories of perception, we can see that they support a simple and
powerful account of hallucination.  All we need suppose must happen for
an otherwise normal perceptual system to be thrown into a hallucinatory
mode is for the hypothesis-generation side of the cycle (the expectation-
driven side) to operate normally, while the data-driven side of the
cycle (the confirmation side) goes into a disordered or random or
arbitrary round of confirmation and disconfirmation, just as in the party
game.  In other words, if noise in the data channel is arbitrarily
amplified into "confirmations" and "disconfirmations" (the arbitrary yes
and no answers in the party game), the current expectations, concerns,
obsessions, and worries of the victim will lead to framing questions or
hypotheses whose content is guaranteed to reflect those interests, and so
a "story" will unfold in the perceptual system without an author.

"...This provides in the most direct possible way a link between the
emotional state of the hallucinator and the content of the hallucinations
produced.  Hallucinations are usually related in their content to the
current concerns of the hallucinator, and this model of hallucination
provides for that feature without the intervention of an implausibly
knowledgeable internal storyteller who has a theory or model of the
victim's psychology.  Why, for instance, does the hunter on the last day
of deer season see a deer, complete with antlers and white tail, while
looking at a black cow or another hunter in an orange jacket?  Because
his internal questioner is obsessively asking: "Is it a deer?" and
getting NO for an answer until finally a bit of noise in the system gets
mistakenly amplified into a YES, with catastrophic results."

This ties in with your theory above, Hara Ra, does it not?  It's easily
extrapolated both to ordinary dreams and to psychedelic experience, in
terms of both sensory and conceptual hallucinations.

Of course, even if this is the correct explanation, there's still room
for the possibility of hyperdimensional communications from transcendental
machine elves and Psylocybin Powers alongside it! But that would make
the job of separating the nonsense from the genuine hyperdimensional
stuff very tricky indeed.

At any rate, this explanation of Dennett's had a very 'cooling',
Epicurean effect on *my* psychedelic experience!

Anders Sandberg mentioned frontiers of space and the Net, there are other=

"frontiers of knowledge."  There are "spiritual frontiers" cropping up on=

various web sites (e.g., www1.sony.co.jp/kurokawa - "I feel that the time=

has come for us to venture into the frontier of the spirit which stretche=

broadly on all sides at the fringes of our established rules and
standards").  There are "frontiers of the heart" (see Michael Malone's
article in "Forbes ASAP" of 12/2/96).  There are "frontiers of art," see
Natasha More's "Extropic Art Manifesto" or A.N. Whitehead's observation: =

"The human body is an instrument for the production of art in the life of=

the human soul.  It unlooses depths of feeling from behind the frontier
where precision of consciousness fails."  There is an extropic need to
complexify both ourselves and the outside world in order to open wide the=

metaphysical space between them, a frontier, for discoveries both
scientific and artistic.

There is a recent history of viewing physical frontiers as promoting virt=
ue
or redemption through various forms of imperialism, whether earlier
colonialism or later global "running-dog" capitalist.  John Ruskin in 187=
8
was very influential in promoting the British mission to expand into the
frontier of less virtuous peoples, quite similar to American "Manifest
Destiny."  Frederick Turner's essay "The Significance of the Frontier in
American History" (1893) argued that since the closure of the frontier in=

America (the claiming of the Cherokee Strip in 1889), opportunities for
growth and self-renewal would be shut off, leading to decadence.  Turner
held that the frontier experience was central to America's character, "th=
e
meeting point between savagery and civilization."  In other words, an
extropic arena of vitality.  From about 1900 onwards, America's political=

elite has looked to the Pacific and Asia for frontier-like expansion,
always westward, although they have been frequently frustrated by the
well-armed foreigners in their way.  This will continue.

Speaking of extropic arenas of vitality, some hold that cyberspace will
eventually have many jurisdictions, rather than One World Government. =

These jurisdictions will act much like the medieval frontiers or marches,=

where sovereignties overlapped and jostled.  In these frontier areas,
before statism took solid root, institutional and legal forms developed
that approximated what "competitive" polycentric government might look li=
ke
(see "Medieval Frontier Societies" (1992) eds. Robert Bennett and Angus
MacKay).

Frontiers are not "goals," a frequent misapplication of the term, they ar=
e
boundaries.  They are really physical, meaning spatial, or rather
territorial.  Any use of the word "frontier" outside of this meaning is
only metaphorical.

The frontier mentality cannot be purged from humanity, no matter how fill=

the earth becomes.  An evolutionary search in fitness space will continue=

not much different from probes at the ends of tentacles of primitive
one-celled animals.  Get out!  Move!  Get away!  Find sustenance! =

"Life is a struggle between seeking and avoiding surprise."  Cultural
speciation precedes human speciation.  Cultural speciation is, by
definition, the formation of sub-cultures.  So becoming a sub-culture is
hardly a "risk," it is the extropic aim.  The idea of a unity of humanity=

a single global culture, makes us itchy.  We are too hemmed in here.  We

CSICOP is an organization, not a scientist. One of its most
promenent members was Carl Sagan. Many of the CSICOP Fellows
are science fiction authors. The scientific articles in
"Skeptical Enquirer" tend to be studies of the nature of
human belief, which IMO is very relevant to extropy. Their
other main thrust is debunking junk science. IMO pruning
out the junk is important, since it lets us focus on things
that are likely to actually advance humanity.

I would not say that they 'want' to hide the fact of the 
construction, I would say that it runs contrary to the interests of 
social institutions to reveal the mechanics of their own 
constructions to the individuals that are affected by them.  Every 
social institution develops its own methods of ascribing status and 
responsibility, with attendant mechanisms for reprimanding or ousting 
those who do not comply.  Iconoclastic individuals can be dealt with 
through ouster, marginalization, violence, or education.  

Lorber posits gender as a social institution;  by extension, utilizing 
the writing of Bornstein and others on trangressive acts, I can say that 
a gender-bending individual, in revealing the constructed nature of 
gender to others around them, will provoke enforcement reactions from 
those fully conditioned into the norms and rules of any social 
institution that intersects with the social institution of gender.  
The individuals may not conciously realize the source of their anger 
or negative reaction, and they may believe that they have been 
wronged in some manner.  The personalization of their feelings masks 
their status as an agent of the social institutions within which they 
live.

     Hi,
     
     After reading Wired's article "The Long Boom" (a feel good 
     piece...hope they make it into a movie <G>), I was sparked by one 
     simple question:
     
     What will be the 21st-century equivalent of the discovery of the 
     electron or DNA? 
     
     Any horizon observers out there care to take a stab at what is 
     presently unimaginable.  And on the flip side, any historical types 
     care to hypothesize about the state of human perception when we did 
     discover our genetic makeup and the existence of sub-atomic matter.  
     
     The most ambitious gesture would be if some mega neuron-firing 
     extropian were to identify the real world conclusive benefits of their 
     microcosmic "a-has".
     
     Extraordinary times indeed!

I personally believe that we'll be hit a technological singularity based
in
an SI within 9 years, but feel free to consider this to be crackpot
monomania on my part. See
    http://www.ShireNet.com/~dgc/singularity/singularity.htm
for details.

Now for a more reasoned response:
   We appear to be in a decade that is scientifically
similar to the 1890's, in that we believe that we have
a nearly complete understanding of the laws of physics.
Very few phenomena that are actively being investigated
by physicists are unexplained by the "Standard Model."
In the 1890's nearly all phenomena that were being 
investigated were explained by the then-current standard
model, consisting of Newton's laws, Maxwell's equations,
and some conservation laws. There were only a very few
things that didn't fit, mostly the "violet catastrophe"
and a few cosmological details. The prevailing attitude
was a belief that only a few details remained to be worked
out.

Within 15 years, the advent of quantum mechanics and
relativity had thrown the world of physics into a ferment.

Now, we can refine your question: what is it that remains
unexplained by the standard model? the answer, according to
all popular accounts, is gravity. We know it's there, and we
know the inverse square law, but we don't see how it works.
Sure, we see many pieces of the puzzle, the most beautiful
piece IMO being general relativity. But the pieces don't
all fit, and they don't fit into the standard model. A whole
bunck of theorists are trying very hard to build a GUT
(Grand Unified Theory) but they appear to represent a minor
ripple on the quiet pond of our overall complacency.

So, again borrowing from "The Physics of Star Trek", by
Krause, if we can learn to manipulate gravity, we can
perhaps get past the hard limits on acceleration and
energy usage that constrain even a modest effort in
space exploration.

That's it for physics. Anyone want to try in another field?

In the abstract, of course you are right.  Where I would disagree with
you is that your legislative activities pre-empt, and destroy the
possibility of, people building their own safety nets together, and
building a real sense of communal solidarity, with the money they would
have had if you hadn't appropriated it from them in taxes.  Not to
mention the fact that self-help builds self-esteem and the confidence to
challenge abuse.

Have you ever heard the story of the broken window, BTW?

Dear Guru George and other fellow Extropians:

Actually, I have never heard the story of the broken window. Please
enlighten me.

Your thesis about self-actualizing safety nets is interesting and may even
be valid to some extent. What concerns me, however, are all the people who
lack the knowledge, skills and abilities to self-actualize themselves. The
increase each year in the number of individual bankruptcys speaks for
itself. 

Don't we have an obligation to help each other?

Enjoy!!!

Although not yet published in a scientific journal, The new York Times has 
gotten wind of what Dr. Ian Wilmut and his company, PPL, are up to. They've 
cloned another sheep, but this time they've inserted a human gene into it 
that is operational in every cell of its body, including the germ cells, 
that means the gene would be passed on into the next generation. Previously 
the only way to do this was very slow and expensive because you had to use 
hard to find fertilized egg cell and the success rate was very low, Wilmut 
can now use any cell and mammals have many trillions to spare. In addition, 
the old method could only add genes it could not remove them, with Wilmut's 
new method genes can be added or removed at will, this could be very 
important, and fast. Pig organs aren't very good for transplants because
each pig cell has a sugar on its surface that the human immune system doesn't 
like, if the gene for this sugar was removed things could get interesting.
                                    
Dr. Lee Silver of Princeton University says of this:

 "After Dolly [the first cloned sheep, also made by Wilmut] everyone would   
  have predicted this, but they were saying it would happen in 5 or 10 years.   
  We are getting closer and closer to human beings too. All of this can be   
  passed over to human beings. Genetic engineering of human beings is now 
  really on the horizon."

Dr. Keith Campbell of the PPL team says:

 "Two years ago people would have thought what we have achieved to date was  
  impossible. I certainly did."
                
Although they certainly deserve it, I'll bet that Wilmut and Campbell will 
not receive the Nobel Prize for this, at least not for many years, it's too 
controversial. I hope I'm wrong.

Continental shifts may have led to evolution explosion

July 25, 1997
Web posted at: 10:12 p.m. EDT (0212 GMT)

LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- One-half billion years ago, for reasons scientists have
never clearly understood, there was an unprecedented burst of evolutionary
activity, greater than any before or since.

Now, researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee have a theory as to why
that happened -- one which even they admit is radical.

The theory, reported in Friday's issue of Science, is called "true polar
wander."  These researchers say there was a massive shift and realignment
of the Earth's continents over a 15-million-year period -- at a pace about
10 times as swift as the shift of continents under way today.

They theorize it could have been caused by polar land masses that made the
spinning Earth too top- and bottom-heavy.

And when the shift was over, land that used to be at the poles was at the
Equator and vice versa.  North America shifted north from the Southern
Hemisphere.

If this shift took place, cold continents would have thawed and tropical
continents would have cooled.  Similar upheavals would have taken place in
the oceans.  And the ensuing environmental changes caused by all of this
created the chaotic conditions needed for rapid evolution.

"Something like 40 different major groups of animals make their first
appearance during this time," says Joe Kirschvink, a professor of geology
at Cal Tech. "It's an incredible bloom."

This evolutionary period is known as the "Cambrian explosion" or "big bang."
It was during this time that many multi-celled organisms emerged whose
descendants, including human beings, populate the Earth today.

However, this new theory is not universally accepted, with some scientists
saying the evidence supporting it is scanty. But researchers at Cal Tech
believe they can test the theory to see if, indeed, "true polar wander"
may be responsible for life as we know it.

Who needs psychedelics when things are moving this fast? There was a report
in last week's New Scientist Magazine that we NOW have the ability to alter
the HUMAN GERM LINE. As of last week. As I was reading the report I was
sitting on the bus looking looking at out the window in a state of shock.
And I couldn't tell anyone. People in general just don't get it. The report
of course says that no one in their right mind would want to do it, but I
guess that rules out the sanity of most of the participants on this list
<smile>. Now that we can alter the germ line what genes would you add? Or
remove? Obviously we only know a little as of yet, but there are still some
interesting things we could try. Weren't their some interesting breeding
experiments with fruit flies increasing the amount of an antioxidant they
produced that dramatically increased their lifespans? Has this research
been tried out in mammals? If you could dramatically increase the lifespan
of your child wouldn't that be the trully ethical thing to do. To be frank
my aliegnece is to kith-and-kin and not to  abitrary bodies whether this be
governments or homo sapiens. Perhaps we really are in the last days of our
race...

A REAL CULTURE SHOCK
Steven Dickman

Human embryos carrying altered genes could become a
possibility sooner than anyone thought. For the first time, a biologist
claims to have grown long-lived cultures of human embryonic cells that
have the capacity to develop into a wide range of tissues. The cells
could find important medical applications. However, in theory, they
could also be used to create genetically engineered humans.

In mice, similar cultures have allowed scientists to make genetically
engineered animals with unprecedented precision. The key is that the
cells are "pluripotent"--they can divide and differentiate to form any
tissue type. Working with a culture of these "embryonic stem cells" held
in an undifferentiated state, geneticists can target genetic
manipulations with much greater precision than would be possible by the
haphazard injection of genes into newly fertilised mouse eggs. They can
then inject the genetically engineered stem cells into an early mouse
embryo. This develops into a "chimeric" mouse in which a proportion of
cells in most or all of its tissues carry the altered genes.

Because those tissues can include the cells that give rise to sperm and
eggs, repeating these experiments in humans would break the biggest
taboo in modern genetics: manipulating the human germline to induce
genetic changes that can be passed down the generations.

The researcher who created the human cell cultures, John Gearhart of
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, stresses that altering
the germline is not his goal. He hopes that the cells will find a use in
conventional gene therapy, in which the altered genes cannot be
inherited, or in creating tissues that could be used for grafts without
the need for drugs to combat rejection. "I believe what comes out will
be extremely beneficial," he says.

Last week, at the 13th International Congress of Developmental Biology
in Snowbird, Utah, Gearhart revealed that he now has seven separate cell
lines growing in culture.

To create the cultures, Gearhart took cells from fetuses roughly eight
weeks into gestation, which had been aborted at a clinic in Baltimore.
The cells came from a structure called the gonadal ridge, which would
have developed into reproductive organs. As such, they are different
from most of the embryonic stem cells used by mouse geneticists, which
usually come from earlier embryos. However, Gearhart believes his cells
have many of the same properties.

One possibility, however, is that Gearhart's cells grow in culture in an
undifferentiated state not because they are pluripotent, but because
they are cancerous. But Gearhart notes that "marker" proteins carried on
the surface of his cells suggest that they are pluripotent. They can
also form clumps of cells that, in mouse cell cultures, are precursors
to further development.

The ultimate test of pluripotency would be to inject the cells into an
early human embryo and show that a healthy human chimera develops--an
experiment that few scientists would regard as ethical. In the absence
of these data, however, other scientists say they are inclined to
believe Gearhart's claim. "The science is solid and the chromosomes look
fine," says Peter Gruss, a developmental biologist at the Max Planck
Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Gttingen, Germany.

Gearhart's cells could find applications in conventional gene therapy.
Gruss says that experiments with mouse embryonic stem cells show that
they can differentiate into the tissues that give rise to blood cells.
If the same is true for Gearhart's human cells, it may be possible to
use them to treat people with genetic diseases of the blood.

Gearhart's main goal is to create cells that could be grown to form
tissues suitable for grafts. If the cells were manipulated to remove
genes of the major histocompatibility complex, which play a central role
in the recognition of foreign tissue by the immune system, this would
help solve the problem of rejection. "These cells would be the best
donors," he claims. But at the back of people's minds is the possibility
that human embryonic cells could be used to manipulate the germline.
This would raise serious ethical concerns, says David Shapiro of the
Nuffield Council on Bioethics in London, as genetic changes would be
passed down to future generations without their consent.

However, Anne McLaren of the Wellcome Cancer Research Campaign Institute
in Cambridge, who attended the Utah meeting, questions whether anyone
would attempt human germline manipulation. "No one in their right mind
would want to do it," she says. McLaren notes that couples carrying
genetic diseases can instead have their embryos screened through
pre-implantation diagnosis and select a healthy embryo to take to term.

Mario Capecchi of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who
pioneered the use of embryonic stem cells to create genetically
engineered mice, says that using genetic manipulation to develop cells
for transplantation would be acceptable. "But as soon as you do it to
create a human being, you've crossed the line."

Wow!  Ten times faster than your nails grow!  

Differ in some details... well, yes.

Plate tectonics usually operate at between 1.5 and 7 centimetres a year.
Ten times that would certainly seem abrupt on a geological scale, but is
nightmarishly slow by ours.

I don't think we need worry about our real estate investments, even if
danny's `polar shift' had anything to do with this new announcement (which
it doesn't).

It was I, and I had already given ratings of 0.5 and 0.3 to Velikofsky
and Hoagland, respectively, so I kept this chart at the same precision
I had already used.

Well, in my experience the kind of people we were hiring in that company
(basically very smart and with a desire to work in a company with few
rules) had no problems working together, or with most customers. Dealing
with managers ("let me get this straight; you're reprimanding me for
making our software ten times faster?"), marketing ("You know these new
full-page ads which claim our software does A, B, C, X, Y, and Z? You do
realise that we *don't* do X, Y or Z?") and stupid customers ("You did
WHAT?") is another matter. Of course that kind of thing eventually made
most of the smart people leave and the share price is now down to 1/10 of
its peak value.

I wasn't arguing that, but I'd say it's generally true. Smart people
usually learn quickly; that's why they're smart.

Comfort?

don't actually care.  The average person's worries go about as far as which
government to choose (at the most), and then they hand the problems over to

 Governments and religions are offering people the easy way out, the delusion
that by voting or praying they're going to make a difference.

Just to prove a point, there was a chat show on a couple of days ago (I don't
know the name it wasn't that important).  They were talking about the
problems with child crime on the streets, a couple of people were discussing
the need to get kids 'off the streets', and then a woman in the audience
stood up and said:

"We don't need to be out on the streets helping these kids, we need to be in
our homes praying for their souls"

The audience clapped and cheered.  There's you problem.

Let's see, fifteen million years versus one day is *how* many orders of 
magnitude? _Nine and a half_. Nope, I still feel comfortable with my
feelings about the belief that it happened in a day/instantaneously.
Even though I never expressed them on this list. :) I just had to point 
one of those "some details" out. :)

That's just passing the buck, you arbitrarily decree that one is in physical 
reality and one is not, but the very thing we're discussing is what physical 
reality is and is not. When I sit in a chair I can't detect it directly, only 
through the agency of nerve impulses from my ass. I can't see bacteria 
directly, only through a magnifying lens. I can't detect the Virgo cluster 
directly, only through a light gathering lens, and even then not as it is now, 
only as it was 2 billion years ago. I can't detect The Mandelbrot Set 
directly, only through the  "lens" of a computer, but at least it shows me 
the set as it is now.
    
Actually that's not quite true, if you're very good at mental arithmetic you 
could detect the Mandelbrot Set unaided. If you're correct about reality then  
something is unreal if it can be detected directly OR with the use of external 
assistance and real if it can ONLY be detected with an external assistance.
This is the exact opposite of the spirit (I don't have a definition) of the 
word "real", at least as I use it.

How's this for an interesting experiment:

We do an extropic scale for list members, with a web-based voting sceme.
 Then we can choose which messages are worth our attention!

I'll start the list off for you:

1. Me
2. 
3.

6.

I think Danny's saying that psychadelics make you feel loved and
understood.

[Hagbard's eyebrow raises]

This suggests to me that the people who would be most attracted to
psychedelics would be those who are, in reality (whatever that may be),
uncared for and misunderstood. I really don't see how even a truckload
of fungi can help these people. For hours at a time they tread water in
a sea of love and understanding, and never have to bother understanding
what it is that makes them outcasts. Not exactly personal evolution --
and if widespread use becomes common -- not exactly an impetus for
societal evolution.

The Orange County (California) Register kindly did its part to advance the

	Indeed I agree that any new field of endeavor is a frontier unto
intself. However, physical frontiers present a different kind of efficacy
to humans. A physical frontier contains within it, implicitly, the
oppotunity to create completely novel human-social/technological systems.
Scientific and/or technological frontiers can of course reshape a society,
but since they occur within the context of a social ordering the novelty
they impart tends to be limited.

	Indeed. In addition to what you've stated above, Frontiersm also
forces humanity to conceive view reality from completely new perspectives.

You're redirecting the discussion into the limits of our epistemology.  Yes,
we know things only through sense data; yes we are fallible.  But,
nonetheless, there is a universe out there, independent of us.  If all humans
died tomorrow the bacteria and the Virgo cluster would still be there, and
the chair would last quite a while.

I am as confident of the chair as I can be of anything; I have extensive
sense evidence of its endelbrot set, and strong theoretical reasons to
believe it can't exist in this universe.

The sense impressions of the real things you mentioned were formed from the
actual things.  The Mandelbrot set sense impressions were formed from a
finite approximation to the Mandelbrot set.  And, as you pointed out, finite
representations of the Mandelbrot set are *very* different from the actual
Mandelbrot set.  I can make a program that creates the sense impressions I'd
get from the Easter Bunny, and use it for wallpaper, but there's still no
Easter Bunny.

    Big Break-Through in Ancient Evolution Theory

    By Michael Miller 

    PASADENA, Calif. (Reuter) - A 90-degree shift of the Earth's early
    continents -- in which the North and South Poles wound up at the
    equator -- may have played a major role in the evolutionary explosion
    that speeded up the development of life, scientists said...

I suspect that people operate with the wrong model of memory -- the
brain isn't a "recorder", and I'm far from certain we have enough room
to really "record" fourty years of experience faithfully, let alone
140. We certainly do forget large chunks of the "less important" stuff
and possibly so that there will be "room" for the newer stuff.

It might suck, but I have come to accept it. If it bothers you a lot,
I suspect a diary might be a simple low-tech way to deal with the
problem.

Robin Hanson:

Kathryn Aegis responds:

In the coming years, we will witness innovations in our current fields,
social institutions and otherwise,  which are not only central to sex
changes and gender differentiation, but also satellite disciplines.

Today, in order to have a surgical sex change, an individual must have two
favorable psychological tests.  This testing is comprised on one licensed
psychiatrist and a certified psychologist or sex therapist or another
psychiatrist. (The second such testing is the choice of the patient.)  The
well-known "Harry Benjamin International Gender Criteria" test is used as a
standard.

Regardless of the lagging personal views of social structures, they will
have to leap ahead because the cross-over of sex and genders isn't going to
stop. It will only become even more complex.  Thus, new fields will develop
and many of them will be sponsored, headed, financed and supported by the
communities who need their expertise and good common sense.  The gay
community has become quite recognized and powerful in many segments of
society.  It is not longer considered a handicap, but a voice of individualism.

Just as the gay community scientists, psychologists and innovative thinkers
will soars ahead in designing regulations for aiding its own community, it
will also become even more authenticated in making reasonable decisions
about the perplexities of sex changes.  Also, the more we virtualize
genders, the more switching over, and back and forth, emotionally and
sexually, will become a party of culture.

Thin Film Microelectrode Bibliography Update 5.

Danny Banks <D.Banks@surrey.ac.uk>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file lists the documents that I have added to the thin film
microelectrode bibliographies that can be found on the web at:

http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/D.Banks/bibs.html

I am very grateful to the IEEE for permission to reproduce abstracts from
the 1996 IEEE/EMBS conference in Amsterdam. Also to Thomas Laurell and
Thomas Stieglitz and their colleagues for permission to reproduce copies of
the posters they presented at the conference.

Many thanks to P Heiduschka (Tuebingen) for corrections and references,
Thomas Laurell (Lund) for reprints, Steve Potter (CalTech) for references,
Wim Rutten (Twente) for web page references, and Jos Smit (Twente) for a
copy of his thesis. Steve Potter has kindly published his list of references
on the web (see the links page mentioned below).

Since the last update, I have also added quite a number of links to web
pages of people involved in thin-film microelectrode work. These can be
found on my links page:

http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/D.Banks/links.html#tflinks

As usual: the bibliography only lists publications that I have, and is far
from complete. Citations / reprints gratefully received. The date of the
update file is the date I started to compile it, in case anyone is
wondering.

Danny Banks.

Yes, and if you look up "reality" you will find "something that exists" or 
its equivalent, and looking up "being" will tell you it possesses the quality  
of reality. I have never found that a dictionary to be very enlightening 
philosophically, probably because lexicographers are not great philosophers 
but also because they get the knowledge to write their book from common usage, 
and that not much use in philosophy where it's customary to push concepts to 
extremes to see where they'll break.  

By itself a dictionary is nothing but one big circular definition.    
All the definitions in a dictionary are made of words, and those words also 
have definitions made of other words also in the dictionary, and round and 
round we go. The way out of this paradox is the fact that much, perhaps most,
of our knowledge in not in the dictionary because it's not made of words.

You're saying that The Mandelbrot set does not exist because it's too complex, 
only simple cartoon like things can be real. Well OK, but then who needs to 
be "real"?  It would seem that possessing the quality of "reality" is not 
desirable.

We can know something about the Mandelbrot set, we just can't know everything.

OK, here's the story of the broken window:-

"A young hoodlum, say, heaves a brick through the window of a baker's
shop.  The shopkeeper runs out furious, but the boy is gone.  A crowd
gathers, and begins to stare with quiet satisfaction at the gaping hole
in the window and the shattered glass over the bread and pies.  After a
while the crowd feels the need for philosophic reflection.  And several
of its members are almost certain to remind each other or the baker that,
after all, the misfortune has its bright side.  It will make business
for some glazier.  As they begin to think of this they elaborate upon
it.  How much does a new plate glass window cost?  Two hundred and fifty
dollars?  That will be quite a sum.  After all, if windows were never
broken, what would happen to the glass business?  Then, of course, the
thing is endless.  The glazier will have $250 more to spend with other
merchants, and these in turn will have $250 more to spend with still
other merchants, and so ad infinitum.  The smashed window will go on
providing money and employment in ever-widening circles.  The logical
conclusion from all this would be, if the crowd drew it, that the little
hoodlum who threw the brick, far from being a public menace, was a
public benefactor.

"Now let us take another look.  The crowd is at least right in its first
conclusion.  This little act of vandalism will in the first instance
mean more business for some glazier.  The glazier will be no more
unhappy to learn of the incident than an undertaker to learn of a death.
 But th shopkeeper will be out $250 that he was planning to spend for a
 new suit.  Because he has had to replace a window, he will have to go
 without the suit (or some equivalent need or luxury).  Instead of
 having a window and $250 he now has merely a window.  Or, as he was
 planning to buy the suit that very afternoon, instead of having both a
 window and a suit he must be content witht the window and no suit.  If
 we think of him as part of the community, the community has lost a new
 suit that might otherwise have come into being, and is just that much
 poorer.
 
 "The glazier's gain of business, in short, is merely the tailor's loss
 of business.  No new "employment" has been added.  The people in the
 crowd were thinking only of two parties to the transaction, the baker
 and the glazier.  They had forgotten the potential third party involved,
 the tailor.  The forgot him precisely because he will not now enter the
 scene.  They will see the new window in the next day or two.  The will
 never see the extra suit, precisely because it will never be made. 
 They see only what is immediately visible to the eye."
 
 This is from Henry Hazlitt's  "Economic in One Lesson".  The lesson? 
 "The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate
 but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing
 the consequences of that policy not merel for one group but for all
 groups."
 
 See, the trouble with your position is this.  The money you use to do
 your thing has been taken from people.  (In the best possible cases) the
thing you've done seems to have had some visible benefit; but what is
invisible is the other stuff people could have done with the money you
took off them in taxes.  Think about it.

We certainly do - a moral obligation.  And how, may I ask is that obligation discharged when
money is extorted from us in taxes and used by *somebody else* to help
others?  Since the money is not given voluntarily (just try to withold
it!) we cannot be acting morally when we are handing over our well
earned dosh, can we?  And this despite the fact that (again, in the best
possible case) it is going to be used to help others.

And there is the further consideration that very little of it will
*actually* be used to help anybody. Most of it wil be used to pay the
wages of people like you.  Well, it's no wonder you've got an interest
in the continuation of statism, is it?

But I tease.  Really, it does you credit that you are concerned enough
about other people to go out and do something about it.  My beef is,
because of the above-described scenario of "what is seen and what is not
seen" (the original title of an essay by Frederic Bastiat, from whom
Hazlitt took the story of the broken window), you are doing it in a way
that destroys more than it creates - much as someone who should putty up
the cracks in the windows of his house, while leaving the front door wide
open.

The unacknowledged *principle* behind the *manner* in which you are
going about helping people is so corrupt, that you are in effect taking
one step forward and two steps back.

IMHO the word "Evolution" is being consistently misused.  Reference prior
examples such as "higher" evolution..."more" evolved...and my favorite
"Devolved".

This implies that natural evolution is directed...has a moral sense...has
values..

>From reading the works of a leader in the field of Evolution , Richard
Dawkins, (The Selfish Gene, Blind Watchmaker, Rive out of Eden)I have a
different impression....namely that evolutionary pressures are relative to
the current situation.  Something that was beneficial in the past may NOT be
benificial now...such as sickle cell enemia.  (remembering that you can't
only do just one thing...and neither can nature)

As the enviromental pressures change and shift so does evolutionary
pressures.  What was once beneficial may now be detrimental..

Which gives us a problem....evolution acts VERY slowly...over at least
thousands and more likely Millions of years...Howevef of late our enviroment
has been changing much more rapidly...

My great-grand father would have been more comfortable and familiar with the
culture thousand years earlier  than his(perhaps...certainly several hundred)

<breaking in rudely>

I've thought about it.  I do think about it... I am thinking aboutl it...a
lot.

The guv. takes over %50 percent of my income.
The guv.  restricts entry into busines by regulation.
The guv thereby chokes off new jobs and increases the cost of living.

At a minimium, were there no guv. meddling, I would have a minimium of four
times the disposable income that I now have......I "guesstimate" that it
would in reality be closer to ten times.

The reasoning follows.  The industry in the US (world) which has the least
amount of  Guv. meddling is the computer industry.  Ref: Moores law...You get
Twice the computer for half the money every 18 months.  I take that to be the
NORMAL course of events absent guv meddling.

It is the birthright of everyone to acheive millionaire (billionaire) status
by middle age...given a free economy.The guv ...by meddling ...is stealing
our birthright and only a few manage to acheive it.


Or as the guy drinking coffee two tables over said (no doubt regarding
something else...but entirely appropriate none the less)..."Another

I think I was thinking about situations where the the values being
expressed have mostly to do with argument itself--being interested in it
and willing to do it, but neither too agreeable nor too argumentative.
In other words, situations where the subject matter is neither
practical nor value-advertising, but mainly a kind of neutral fodder
for an activity that has another purpose.

>Your desire to argue is also a social signal

Right.  But the social signal may be mainly about desire to argue!
In other words, sometimes that signal is just straightforward and
practical, in the sense that it starts an argument that you wanted
to get started.

What I'm saying is that there are other purposes for non-practical
conversation besides value and belief advertisement.  This is straying
a little from your topic, but there are things in common between
different kinds of non-practical communication.  For instance,
the steering toward Grand Issues that the conversants aren't likely
to affect.

We *do* have a "science/art of personal growth".  Any time anyone gives
anyone else an idea about how to grow or learn, that's an example of it.
Storytelling, books, personal conversation, art, performance, workshops...
There are all sorts of communication that are either intended to be growth
experiences in themselves or tell you how to have growth experiences.
Addressing your example, there are all kinds of stories intending to show
what happens when someone is too naive.  A review of a book or a
report about a trip to a beautiful place, or other great experience, would
be an example of indirect growth information.

I think the meta-problem, though, is that we don't all agree on what
the most useful experiences are.  So, you have a range of choice between
being a tyrant (say as a parent or teacher or cult leader) organizing the
experience of people under your control, or letting people (say children)
make their own choices among experiences given suggestions from you and
others.  And for yourself you have a choice of how much to put yourself
into someone else's hands.

>From my point of view, what's wrong is the idea of school.  It's a
predefined program that everyone is supposed to progress through, and
either because it's a bad idea from the start, or because it's just been
badly executed, it just comes to seem a rigamarole, a dues-paying,
a torture, an irrelevance, etc.  A sweaty *course*.  Think of all the
Schools of Education, all the people with PhD's in Education.  Yeah,
we have a science of personal growth--a whole crock of it!

So because things are *too* organized, they end up being and seeming
*not* organized.  If we faced the need for people to organize their
own lives and experiences,(instead of having them organized for them)
maybe we'd be more humble and produce better information and ideas about
how to learn.  (And it might *seem* more like the society around us knew
something about learning (instead of trusting the teacher-experts).)

Life is necessarily more a kit than a course.  People do
produce good information, experiences, guides and ways of stringing
it all together, but (I think) you have to realize the need to choose
not only your own experiences, but even the purposes your experiences
are supposed to prepare you for.  When you look at it from that point
of view, it's almost amazing that anyone can say anything significant
to anyone else.  So then you can better appreciate the learning
materials that are out there!-)  Although I agree there's room for
improvement.

Lately I've been learning to shed a deep assumption that's held me
back for a long time: a feeling that there was a key, a path, and
if only I would follow it, I'd be okay.  It would just be a matter of
applying myself.  Only this key was somehow being kept from me.  So
I was being denied my rightful glory!  Watch that kind of trap!

I lost the Gertrude Stein quote, something like:
  "There ain't no way.  Never was, never will be, and
   the closest we'll ever get to a way is the idea that there ain't one."

All very valid.  I think the fundamental problem is that we form concepts by
finding similarities between exemplars of the properties.  We don't really
think in terms of definitions.  As a result, dictionary definitions end up
fundamentally circular, even though our concepts aren't.  To fully transmit a
concept to somebody, you'd have to transmit all the experiences with which
you created a concept.  Obviously that's a no-go.  Usually we share enough
experiences that just a definition or analogy will suffice.  With
higher-level concepts (and "exists" is a whopper) there's so much experience
behind the concept that such methods don't always cut the mustard.  Our
disagreement here may fall into the category.

We seem to agree on this.

Well, no, incredibly complex things exist (anything living, for starters).
 The Mandelbrot set, however, requires infinite complexity.  That's quite a
tall order.

>We can know something about the Mandelbrot set, we just can't know
everything. 
>How is that different from a chair?

As I said, without humans, the Virgo cluster would still be here.  (I'm going
to slide away from chairs because as human devices they don't fit this
counterfactual)  But the Mandelbrot set wouldn't; it's only in our heads and
computers.  Our heads and computers don't even have that; they have finite
approximations of it, and an equation which can generate it, which given an
aleph-one infinity time and storage (I'll assume that's the cardinality of a
line).  But we don't have that much time or storage.

Now, to be fair, there are alternate meanings for "exist".  For example, the
Mandelbrot set "exists" in a way that the rational square root of 2 doesn't.
 The finite-operation squared circle doesn't "exist", but the squared circle
does "exist" in the same way as the Mandelbrot set (possible with an infinite
number of operations).  I do find my meaning more handy, but to be precise
would require inventing more words.

The guv thereby chokes off new jobs and increases the cost of living.

At a minimium, were there no guv. meddling, I would have a minimium of

EvMick

Dear EvMick and other fellow Extropians:

Despite my advancing years, my wrinkles, arthritis, failing eyesight and
the length and whiteness of my beard, I have not yet retired from service
to the the people of the State of New York and the United States. My wife
has advised me that I can retire from my present position on August 2,
1999. At that time I will accept an offered position and begin to teach
public administration and public policy in one of the graduate schools of
one of our fine regional colleges.

I quite agree with you when you complain that our governmental systems are
far from perfect. The number of policy statements and governmental reform
legislation that I have been involved in producing to improve government
operations never seems to end. That has not yet stopped me from trying to
overcome the numerous constraints that are thrown in my way. 

I also agree with you that some of the money that goes to provide
necessary government services is wasted. I don't think that taxation is
extortion, however. I firmly believe that government does a lot of good
and is quite capable of doing a lot more good than it does. It would
certainly work a lot better if we would all put our egos in our back
pockets and let those of us who have spent a lifetime studying and working
at our chosen careers in professional government service trying to do our
jobs despite the continuous interference of well meaning dilettants and a
herd of politically and ideologically fixated ignoramusus who know little
or nothing about governmental operations except how to gum up the works
with unnecessary regulations and other bothersome clap-trap. 

For those of you who have wonderful theories on how to improve government
let us see how they can be implimented for the broad common good. I've
heard a good deal of criticism of government during my pre-government
education and continuously during my attempts to serve the citizens who
pay me a wage that is far less than I would have earned in the private
sector. 

I have no complaints, however, about what I have been permitted to do in
service for humanity, although there are many who would second guess my
methods until the cows come home.      

It's quite possible that some day, long after I'm gone, someone, somewhere
will come up with a better and more equitable system. 

I'd like to be around to see that happen but although I'm optimistic about
the human condition, I do not perceive any great change in the near
future.

Flame away to your hearts content.

Enjoy!!!

Well, there's at least me.  I spend much more time than I'd like
adding people to my exclude-filter.  The effect is that the clubhouse
feeling is lessened.  And I did think this was a club,
with open doors but with some rules about what we talk about and how.
Maybe you think it "should" be left to each individual "user;" I don't,
and I don't think the rules do (although I haven't read them lately
either).

Yes, but why?  "Want" is just a shorthand.  The question is, *why*, in
your opinion, it's in the interests of "social institutions" (and, as Robin
points out, you seem to mean *all* of them--baseball, trade, the word
"the," etc.) to conceal rather than reveal their own constructions?   Why
don't they benefit by being up-front and above-board instead?  Why
don't they benefit by actively *encouraging* exploration of and challenge
to their constructions?  Isn't criticism helpful?  Isn't openness good
publicity?  At least in some cases?

Think about the analogy to human beings.  It's like saying, "No one
benefits by having their personna examined or criticized."  You don't
think that's true do you?  So why are social institutions different?

An interesting alternative is offered by Max Tegmark.
    http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html
 or http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~max/toe.html

He asks, why not say that all mathematical objects (or worlds) are physically
real?  After all, if our models of physical reality are mathematical
models, what "extra something" is needed for something to be physically
real?

If all mathematical objects are physically real, then (he goes on to say)
we would expect to live in the simplest part of math capable of supporting,
well, scientists, basically.  He says that there are testable
consequences of the hypothesis.  He calls it a "Grand Ensemble" theory.

I love his illustration showing the superset-of links between various
realms of math, starting with Boolean algebra and leading up to General
Relativity and QM.  With Felix the cat pondering the whole collection.

Also some interesting diagrams of the disasters that happen if you
tamper with certain physical constants by small amounts.  NO SCIENTISTS
HERE (most of the diagram)!  You are here (tiny little fenced-in area).

Yes, you said that.  Repeating it is no help.
Where does the extra volume come from?

I should also point out that the continents *cannot* "fit perfectly" on 
a smaller globe.  I need not look at them to say so.  The difference in 
curvature must introduce distortions.  As mapmakers do when squashing
the globe to the plane, you can choose among several kinds of distortion
(of shape, of area, of distance, of straight lines) -- but such selection 
makes the mapping to the smaller globe arbitrary, and therefore suspect.

I'm surprised nobody has said the continents have shrunk by 1/5.

Transferred how?  By injections of gas (or antimatter) into the core?
By dwarves shifting slag out of their mines?

Enjoyed your post.  Have you heard of the new science of evolutionary psychology
, BTW? It is concerned with just the point you mention: that some of our
human nature evolved over a long, relatively stable period of time, to
deal with a certain kind of life, which we no longer live.  The most
obvious example: we love sweet and fatty things. Now they are so easy to
get that we do ourselves damage by gorging ourselves on them.

LOL!  Well, doesn't this suggest something to you?  Combine this

Again, it does you credit that you think like this: the people are
indeed paying your wage.  

I think the fostering of this meme - that government is our employee -
ought to be the main libertarian political task.  It is the perfect
way-station on the way to no government at all. For as soon as people
understand that the government, at best, is simply a bunch of folks they
have collectively hired to do a job, they will begin to think "Ah, if
that's the case, then perhaps we should look more carefully at what it
is we are asking them to do!"  Also "Ah, if that's the case, then I darn
well want some value for money!"
 
 Does this make some kind of sense to you as a compromise meme on which
 we could agree?

This really ignores the essentials of the argument I was making. 

"[A] lot more protection ... ", in comparison to the hegemonic ideas
embodied in society and the judiciary, a la Britain in the 18th and 19th
centuries?  You are not comparing like with like.  And, of course, it is
quite clear that your constitution is NOT secure. Look at the twisted
interpretations used to justify the abandonement of the clear intent of
its Founders. Look at the gradual replacement of its ethos by by new
ideologies, like health fascism (eg guns as an epidemic, victim
disamament as a public health measure etc).   Pointing to the values of
liberty, to common law, to the decisions of a libertarian-oriented
judiciary, to the arguments of constitutional lawyers etc etc is
arguably just as good a start as pointng to a written constitution.  In
order to support your argument (a common one I've heard before from
Americans) you would need to show some awareness of the constitutional
and political history of other countries - something, alas, generally
absent amongst Americans (as evidenced from the initial comments that
started this thread).  

British liberties were just as extensive and secure as American
(arguably more so in many areas) when libertarian ideas had hegemony in
theory and in social practice.  The US constition has been breached
repeatedly from early times, although most signifcantly more recently.
Once the predomininant beliefs and practices that produced a specific
constitution are undermined or reversed then a constitution is nothing
more than a piece of paper and worthless against either the mob - or the
elite power seeker.  And, of course, a written constitution that isn't
the product of the real forces of society is worthless from the start.
Your constitutional safeguards have now been breached in countless areas
and the likelihood of their virtually total disappearance is now high
(in spite of the renaissance of libertarian ideas, which is probably too
little too late in terms of the power of its intellectual and
political/class enemies).  Indeed, ironically, the coming US statism
which is the precise reverse of the intent of the US constitution will
undoubedly be wrapped up in the forms and rhetoric of the old
libertarian-oriented constitution, in order to preserve legitimacy and
continuity - a sick joke of history.  

Do read my article for a more complete exposition of this argument.

The government is doing great, they haven't screwed up at all.  Look at the
government as your average business: One of the most important things in
business is marketing, the government are great at marketing they've got all
the people thinking they can't live without them.  They're taking your money
by force, yet the majority of people think the world would collapse without
the government's services.

The government hasn't even screwed up when it comes to controversy and
conspiracy.  A bit of a conspiracy takes the peoples minds off of the greater
picture (they're getting screwed).  It makes people think "everything would
be okay, if only we could sort out the problems in government" rather than
"everything would be okay, if only we didn't have a government".

The worse thing is, the government employees _believe_ their own bullshit
(AMG).  Because of this the government has become an entity on to itself,
making it a difficult target, there is no person in control of the
government.  The idea that ' we the people' owns the government is completely
true.  The majority of people believing in some form of government and until
they realise they are wrong nothing will change.

No amount of legislation will better the government.  The more we try to 'fix
it' the more complex it gets.  Complexity leads to weakness, loopholes and
difficulty of enforcement (look at the legal system).  We do not need to
think out every possibility and find the correct solution (something we could
never do).  We need simplicity.  What could be simpler than freedom?

The government haven't screwed up, we have.

Several semantic debates occurred here recently. I might characterize
these as arguments on the question "IS thing X an instance of set Y?",
the canonical example of which has been the debate over the "reality"
of the Mandelbrot set.

Almost all such arguments boil down to questions of
definitionalism. "Is the Mandelbrot set 'real'", for instance, hinges
entirely on the question of how one defines 'real'. Answering such
questions does not seem to have much interest to me -- I do not find
the answers particularly enlightening since if one shifts the
defintion, the answer shifts, and thus no interesting data has been
revealed in generating the answer.

The use of e-prime sometimes points out when a question has this
property. Note that one can't ask the question about the Mandelbrot
set without the use of the verb "to be". This indicates to me that
answering the question will not increase my understanding of the
Mandelbrot set (or anything else) particularly much.

The closest you can model the question in e-prime is "does the
Mandelbrot set comply with definition X of 'real'", which I believe
points out my problem with this and all similar questions.

I wrote a COBOL program for an IBM 4090 that was still in
use in 1970, and I've been buying home computers since
1977. Somehow, My home computers always cost $2500-$3500.

Thinkng back causes real brain-warp: I splurged and fully
populated the memory board in my IMSAI8080: I filled it
all the way up to 4Kbytes (that's four kilobytes): people
with less money could elect to populate it in increments
of 256 bytes by purchasing the 256-by-4 bit memory chips
in pairs. The processor was an Intel 8080 with a 2Mhz clock.
My first disk drive was a 5.25" floppy which
could store an astounding 144Kbytes on a diskette. The drive
and electronics cost $1000.

This is very relevant to extropy: That was 20 years ago.
My latest computer has A 266Mhz Pentium, 6Gbyte disk,
64Mbyte mem, and lots of peripherals. It is somewhere
between a thousand and a million times as capable as
my first computer. There is no evidence that this trend
will slow in the next 20 years, but we keep making projections
that underestimate or ignore the consequences. If we add in the
closely-related advances in data cumunications, this is
IMO the single most important trend affecting the future
of humanity.

Don't underestimate the normative weight of the "real."  Social
institutions, vocabularies, scripts often best maintain themselves by
relying on a fantasy of their necessity, inevitability, or self-evidence
(the "given" as "taken", eh Steve?), etc.  The point is not that
institutions deny the particular histories down the path of which they
have been constructed, but to disavow their constructedness *as such*.  Am
I the only one who remembers Adrienne Rich on "Compulsory
Heterosexuality," for example?  I'm the last to deny that robust and
attractive social institutions might could should and often have
maintained themselves in other modes -- the openness you describe, for
example -- but this simply doesn't apply to Western constructions like
race, sex, gender, sexuality, beastliness, and the rest of that pesky
constellation as they have come down to us here and now.  Some feminisms
overestimate the strategic power of exposing the constructedness of
gender, but it's surely just as wrong to underestimate the power of this
exposure.  As for all the intention-speak shorthand happening in this
discussion: *of course*, institutions, scripts and the like don't want to
preserve and augment themselves so much as individuals do and it is by
citing, performing, and otherwise making recourse to these institutions,
vocabularies, scripts as they calculate and undertake actions to their
best advantage, that self-interested individuals also happen to buttress
and invigorate the social structures as well.  Correct?

Everything!  Even the aspects of myself that have formed who I am now.  Take
these memories and reference points and make them clearer and crisper in my
mind.  Even my finest qualities.  Make them even kinder and more sincere.
Even my passions and wonder.  Make them more exciting.  And the areas that
are problematic that have been catalytic in my growth, make them remain ever
so memorable that I can recall them in my private moments as I reflect over
my long, long life.

An old term, after Wurtz (1885), preparation of higher alkanes
from alkylhalogenids:

MeI + 2Na  -> MeNa+NaI
MeNa + MeI -> Me-Me + NaI

(it is also handy for a number of other things, as cooking
alkylosylanes). A variation of this is Corey-House, coupling
alkylohalogenids with lithiumdialkylcuprates (R_2CuLi), under
much milder conditions.

I guesstimate one can even substitute pretty specifically, e.g.
cooking substituted adamantanes by aforementioned Wagner-Meerwein,
oxidizing the sticking out alkane groups to COOH, then turning
them into -Br via Hunsdiecker.

You must be thinking of the alkohol synthesis from
aldehydes, via Grignard route. This is not a sole possible
version however, e.g. tin organyles and silver-halide (iodide)
reactions involve radicals, some things occur on metal surfaces
via SET. Metalloorganyles are a versatile lot.

> What other reactions might work for subunit linkage?

Not too many. One might consider carbenes (I once worked
briefly with these, they also tend to produce polymers when
adding to alkenes), radicals (e.g. via a good leaving group, as
diazo derivates), crosslinking of complementary groups. S-Hg-S
might also be considered.

The creation of building blocks occurs in 2-3 stages, the
first of them very harsh, involving massive rearrangements
(hydride shifts, nonclassical carbocations), the second, e.g.
(electro)halogenation, being much milder. Metallization can be
arbitrarily mild. Once the halogenated diamondoid (notice that
chemists do not use this term) core is in place, it can be be
manipulated in many ways.

Yes, but I wouldn't trivialize it with the label "semantic" because that's 
exactly what Science is all about, showing how 2 apparently different things 
are really related on a deeper level.  Electric and magnetic fields seemed to 
have very different properties, then in the greatest discovery of 19'th
century Physics, Faraday and Maxwell proved that there was a profound 
relationship between the two and both were instances of the set Y, set Y 
being Electromagnetism.

Except that nobody has a definition of reality that's worth a damn, but 
that's OK, definitions are vastly overrated, we seldom use one and even less 
seldom need one. Forget about "reality", I want to know if the Mandelbrot Set 
is different in some very fundamental way from the Virgo Cluster. Can I put 
both things in the same general category, a category that excludes neutral
electrons, square circles or integer square roots of 7? My suspicion is that 
there is no very fundamental difference between a mathematical object and a 
physical one, but I don't know that for a fact and if I'm wrong I'd like to 
know precisely what the difference is. You're objection seems to be that
proving or disproving such things is doomed to failure, you could very well 
be right, but that is yet another thing I don't know for a fact.

I'm skeptical that e-prime is an aid to clear thinking. Every human language 
has "to be" in it and in every natural language it is irregular, indicating  
it's in very common usage (Turkish has only one irregular verb, "to be"). 
If a simple mutation like dropping one word could confer the huge advantages 
to the user that the advocates of e-prime claim, then some language would
probably have evolved in that direction and rapidly spread around the world. 
English has rapidly spread around the world but it has "to be" and more 
irregular verbs than anyone.

I'm happy you asked, since I'm actually working in this area (human
memory) right now. This is what is sometimes called the "catastrophic
forgetting"  problem - if you teach more and more to a neural network
eventually the stored information will start to interfere with itself
and recall goes down. In some networks (like Hopfield nets) this is a
very sudden collapse from a farily "lucid" network to an useless
"senile"  network. In other kinds of networks (like Hopfield nets
with clipped weights) the disaster doesn't occur, instead old
memories are gradually erased by new ones.

We don't know what kind of network the human brain is most similar
to, but for a variety of reasons it is likely that it is the later
case. So far nobody has shown any evidence of catastrophic forgetting
(no, Alzheimer is not it, and besides, getting a lot of education
seems to *prevent* dementia instead of causing it). My current
research is looking into how neural plasticity is controlled so that
new memories doesn't erase old ones too fast or too slowly (the
dreade stability-plasticity dilemma). 

What will happen if we can extend our lifespans for (say) 500
years? My guess is that no catastrophic forgetting will occur, but
that newer memories slowly erode older memories. Childhood memories
might be exempt from this, they appear to be very solid. The 500-year
old might remember what he or shw did the last decades fairly
clearly, while more distant eras have been gradually erased ("I have
some vague impressions of the 21st century, but they might be based
on some VR I once saw..."). Often used skills or memories will
likely remain, while less used concepts will fade. It might be a good
idea to regularly do a test to review what fields one need to freshen
up, say every 50th year or so.

I think it would be a good idea to store them just to be able to
review and document your life for all your future selves. They would
make ideal material for the memory freshening sessions.

OK, here is a wild guess:

A general theory of complexity - something that actually gives us
some predictive ability about the growth of complex systems. Would
probably involve an objective measure of complexity. Evolution and a
lot of other fields could be derived from it - alife, morphogenes, a
lot of "soft" fields would blossom and new fields appear overnight
(complexity engineering, anyone?).

I'm not sure this is possible, but if it can occur, it will likely be
more important to the future evolution of ourselves than we can
imagine.

Actually, dung beetles bury the dung in underground chambers for
their larvae to feed from. Since the larvae won't eat everything (and
themselves excrete), the contents of the chambers are perfect
fertilization of the soil.

Mushrooms are quite specific about where they grow; change the local
chemistry slightly and they won't grow there anymore. This includes
the ecosystem; while some mushrooms grow well in grasslands, others
need certain trees or environments. I'm not an expert on psychoactive
mushrooms, but I suspect they are mainly forest growers? 

(Apropos mushrooms: I hope you have all heard that the chanterelle
has been successfully cultivated! Can't remember the reference, I
suspect french scientists. This is great news for all us lovers of
this yellow delicacy...)

How about the emotional effects on memory. I believe we remember almost 
every detail about the times when we fell in love. Is this why the music
we listened to during our teen-age years usually seams more interesting
than most new music?

Memories of trauma are stored differently.

Then it depends on what you mean by "fundamental", right?  The Virgo
cluster is made of atoms, the Mandelbrot set is not.  The Virgo cluster
interacts with matter and energy, the Mandelbrot set does not.  The
Mandelbrot set has thickness zero, the Virgo cluster has a nonzero
thickness.

Sometimes I have to drive far into the night....if not all night.  When I do
I listen to the Radio...notably Art Bell.  Many of his shows have a very high
"giggle factor"...but some are thought provoking.  For example one night he
interviewed the dude from "Nanothinc" I forget his name... concerning
nanotechnology.(that interview was still available via archived "real audio"
last I looked.)

The other night I heard an extended interview with (Thread One:Roswell)
retired Colonel Carauso.  The interview was conducted with great care.  The
Colonel's credentials were presented and corrorborated by multiple
sources...every contension was supported in great detail. The upshot of it
was that since the 50's alien technology has been infused into our
industry...hence Lasers, Night Vision, MicroChips, fiber optics, etc. etc.
were derived.  The funny little aliens are actually "biots" (Arthur C. Clarke
term..RAMA series...Caruso didn't use it but I felt it appropriate) and the
US military has been at "war" with them for decades.

Later I heard an interview with (Thread Two: Mars) Richard Hoagland.  It too
was carefully presented.  There were multiple supporters to validate the
concepts as they were presented...all had impressive
credentials...exNASA.....a geologist...an electronics/acoustics expert... a
telemetry expert...I think about 4 or 5 in all. Once again everything was
nailed down tight...repeatedly. (The upshot being that somehow the Egyptian
Pyramids, all other ancient earthly pyramids and the Martian "Ruins" were all
connected...that Sojurner is investigating Martian ruins right now...that is
the "Twin Peaks" mentioned in a NASA breifing...which are actually Martian
Arcologies..one of which was badly damaged ,..both of which were mostly
buried by sediments from  the flood which caused the floodplain where the
rover landed.

So where would these two (actually three or four...pyramids..two different
flavors of aliens..UFO's..) ideas and the people who present them...fit on
this chart? And why?

Keeping in mind that :
       all the participants are "experts" in their respective fields...that
is they have        oodles of credentials, awards, and experience.  How is
one expert to beleived and another one not?  Why or why not is one Ph.d more
credible than another. 

        anything the government says is not to be trusted...the government
being a pathological liar...( examples being:the challenger disaster, flight
800, Ruby Ridge, Waco, Campaign Finance, The Kennedy Assasination...Plutonium
injections...Syphiliss Experiments....the extent and danger of fallout from
above ground nuclear testing in the 60s....."non existent "troops in
Laos..the betrayal of Geronimo....ad nauseum...the list is probably infinite.

STRANGE MAGAZINE 18 IS OUT THERE


OPSASNICK REVIEW UPSETS BIGFOOT BELIEVERS; JOHN GREEN ENTERS SASQUATCH
FIELD AS HOAXER


Strange Magazine 18 has been mailed to all subscribers. It should hit
selected bookstores on August 1. There has been a tremendous early
response to issue 18. So far most of the attention has been on Karl
P.N. Shuker's Menagerie of Mystery, Tim Swartz's Oil Pit Squids piece,
the stunning cover by Greg Snook, the thunderbird photo drawings, and
Mark Opsasnick's highly critical review of the book Where Bigfoot Walks
(which includes his honest appraisal of the Pacific Northwest Bigfoot
scene). 


In his review, Opsasnick referred to Bigfoot author/promoter John Green
as a former newspaperman - Bigfoot hoaxer - turned true-believer. This
statement took some Bigfooters by surprise, since Green is considered
by many Bigfoot fans to be a pillar of Bigfoot belief. While we
appreciate his book Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us for the material that
it includes, we do not hold Green in high esteem. Green, as some of you
know, completely ignored Ray Wallace's role in Bigfoot history,
including the Wallaces' position in the Birth of Bigfoot case in 1958,
despite the fact that Green himself visited Bluff Creek in 1958 and
found tracks there. 


Despite the fact that some Bigfoot fans would prefer that the truth be
otherwise, it is a documented fact that John Green's entry into the
Sasquatch field was as a result of a hoax.


In a telephone conversation that reviewer Mark Opsasnick had with
Green, on May 7, 1988, the Sasquatch maven relayed to Opsasnick how he
got started in the Bigfoot business as a result of a hoax that he
pulled. 


In 1955 he wrote an account of a hairy manbeast abducting a woman from
a Harrison Hot Springs spa. This phony account was published on the day
of the jokester: April 1. 


Bigfoot hunter/exploiter Rene Dahinden was one person who thought that
the article was for real. Green recounts the episode in Sasquatch: the
Apes Among Us (Seattle, WA: Hancock House, 1978), p. 49: "At no time
did I have the slightest idea that there was anyone in the community,
or anywhere else, who didn't think the whole business was a joke. In
1956 Rene Dahinden came to my office looking for information that might
assist him in actually finding a Sasquatch...[he] swallowed the whole
thing. His visit made a good story , but I felt rather sorry for him."



Green's hoax article and its aftermath is also recounted in the
Time-Life book Mysterious Creatures (Alexandria, VA: Time-Life Books,
1988), p. 117.


This hoax article inspired the village council at Harrison Hot Springs
to sponsor a phony Sasquatch hunt. Described as a "good-natured spoof,"
this promotional goof for the British Columbia Centennial actually
attracted the interest of the international press.


Green's hoax article had unexpected results-- it drew to him a number
of people who had seen Sasquatch or its tracks, and he soon found
himself an avocation. 


(John Green's Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us is available as from Strange

ROWLETT REPORTS ON THE SURRENCY SPOOKLIGHT


	The Surrency Spook Light is a classic example of the ghost light
phenomena in the best tradition of the more famous ones, such as the
Marfa Light in Texas and the Brown Mountain Light in North Carolina.

	The site of the Surrency Light (called the "spook light" by locals) is
centralized along a stretch of the Macon/Brunswick railway that runs
through Surrency, Georgia.

	This phenomena was first brought to my attention in 1989 by my friend
Mr. James Joyner, who is a resident of nearby Baxley.

	Mr. Joyner has witnessed the light several times and was kind enough
to allow his account to be retold here.

	He described how he was standing on the train track at night when the
light appeared several hundred yards in front of him, hovering over the
railway.

	Mr. Joyner's description of the light was "a very bright,
golden-yellow light, about the size and shape of a grapefruit."

	When he tried to approach the light, it began to move toward him until
it finally blinked out, only to reappear behind him!

	He describes his other experience as similar to the first.

	The Surrency Light has been an observable phenomena since the turn of
the century.

	Explanations for the light vary from the local belief that it is
somehow connected to the famous Surrency ghost that haunted the
hotel/home of A. P. Surrency (for whom the town is named) to a
mysterious geological formation underneath the ground in Surrency, as
theorized by Cornell University professor Larry Brown.

	The Surrency hauntings were first written about in the Savannah
Morning News after the paper received a letter from A. P. Surrency.1

	Hundreds of personal accounts from diaries, as well as books and
magazines, have described tables flying through the air, mirrors
exploding in hallways, clocks running wild after witnesses heard a
mysterious buzzing noise, hot bricks falling from the sky, lights
flickering in the dark, and unexplained voices screaming, crying or
laughing in and around the Surrency house.2

	The hauntings continued until the house burned down in 1925. 

	Geological professor Larry Brown was part of a team that discovered
what may be an ancient reservoir of water or other fluid nine miles
beneath a pine forest in Surrency.

	Dr. Brown is a director of the Cornell University-based Consortium for
Continental Reflective Profiling (COCORP) which is developing a
detailed picture of the Earth's mantle.

	Dr. Brown describes this reservoir as "about two miles in diameter and
apparently shaped like a contact lens."3

	He also states that "we really don't have a good idea what the
formation is composed of. If it is water, it would upset a lot of
scientific theories as it is theoretically impossible for water or
other fluids to exist at such a great depth due to the intense heat and
pressure."

	When one considers the amount, the presence of a ghost light, spirit
manifestations and a weird geological formation, it would almost seem
as if there is perhaps what is sometimes referred to as a "window area"
or Lovecraftian doorway at the Surrency site.

	My own investigation into the Surrency Spook Light is still in its
beginning stage and so will be reported on further as new data comes to
light.

REVIEW

Reverse Time Travel

by Barry Chapman

Cassell, London, 1996, 160 pp., paperback, $16.95.

Reviewed by Douglas Chapman

With simplicity and clarity, Barry Chapman supports his case that time
travel is possible. Starting with "a brief history of everything,"
layer by layer, equation by equation, Chapman uses Einstein's theory of
General Relativity to show that there may be a way to travel back in
time. Such topics as the principle of equivalence, gravitational
curvature, black holes, and the twin paradox are brought into play.

While the present reviewer is not qualified to judge the efficacy of
the scientific theories involved, Chapman clearly explains his
premises.

He asks many of the proper questions. One is that: if time travel
exists, why have humans not knowingly met any travellers from the
future? In response to this, in his "five-dimensional hyperspherical
model" Chapman postulates that the time travellers may have ended up in
different universes from the one in which they started. But then, why
have travellers from elsewhere not shown up in the present universe?
Whatever its limits, his idea does explain why people cannot kill their
parents and then vanish out of existence themselves.

For Chapman, not only is the universe curved, but so are the fifth
dimension and the universes encompassed. 

The universe's customary "curve balls" may abound, but the author tries
for clarity anyway. Useful appendices with supporting equations and a
subject- oriented bibliography make the book as easy to use as
possible. Whether one agrees or not, it is apt to broaden it readers'
horizons.

I think it was a group in Stockholm.

I know this is a very un-extropian reaction, but doesn't the mere 
fact that they can be cultivated somehow make them less delicious? 
Their exclusiveness was sort of part of the pleasure!

What about the old distinction in logical positivism between 
propositions true (solely) in virtue of their meaning and 
propositions whose truth also depend on how the world is? "There is 
an x such that x is the mandelbrot set." would be of the former kind 
(analytic); "There is an x such that x is the a galactic cluster 
refered to as 'the  virgo cluster'." would be of the latter kind 
(synthetic).

Perhaps the distinction you are after is between objects such 
that a proposition asserting that they exist is logically true 
(=analytic, i.e. true independently of how the world is) and objects 
that don't have this property?

If you reject this distinction, what are your reasons? Are you a 
Quinean?

Ah, of course, that was stupid of me.  If one dung bettle is specialised by
natural selection for wallaby poo, a different one must be at home in cow
pats, and never the twain shall meet.  So if you bring cows into a new
ecology, you need to fetch their little helpers with them.  Thanks, Patrick.

LOL!  Well, doesn't this suggest something to you?  Combine this

controlling what people may ingest and/or their morality - the 'Drug War')

Again, it does you credit that you think like this: the people are
indeed paying your wage.  

I think the fostering of this meme - that government is our employee -
ought to be the main libertarian political task.  It is the perfect
way-station on the way to no government at all. For as soon as people
understand that the government, at best, is simply a bunch of folks they
have collectively hired to do a job, they will begin to think "Ah, if
that's the case, then perhaps we should look more carefully at what it
is we are asking them to do!"  Also "Ah, if that's the case, then I darn
well want some value for money!"
 
 Does this make some kind of sense to you as a compromise meme on which
 we could agree?

Dear George and other fellow Extropians:

I'll have to think about that one for a while.

The germ of an idea just struck me and I have to work on it and see what
it develops into before I can do something with it. 

Enjoy!!!

Copyright 1997 The Seattle Times Company

Friday, July 25, 1997


mailto:rfit-new@seatimes.com
Ronald K. Fitten
Seattle Times staff reporter


     Mary Kay LeTourneau had gotten herself into deep trouble, and she 
     knew the trouble was about to get deeper.

     Thirty-four years old, a mother of four young children and a highly 
     regarded grade-school teacher, she had just learned she was pregnant. 
     The child was not her husband's.

     Worse, much worse, the father was a child himself - a 13-year-old boy 
     she'd mentored since second grade and had taught just a few months 
     earlier, in her sixth-grade class at Shorewood Elementary School in 
     Burien.

     LeTourneau knew she wouldn't have an abortion. She also knew that the 
     baby's racial mix meant that the public would eventually learn the 
     truth about what she had done. She sat in her classroom one day and 
     listed the possible consequences, for her and others.

     Those consequences have been enormous, worse than she ever thought 
     possible. Her four children have lost their mother, at least 
     temporarily. The boy, who turned 14 one month after his daughter was 
     born in May, is in counseling. Her students have been traumatized. 
     She and her husband are getting a divorce; he's moved out of state.


      LeTourneau  will never teach again. Her house is for sale.


     She is charged with child rape. On Aug. 7, she'll plead guilty. Three 
     weeks later she'll find out whether she'll go to jail briefly and 
     receive treatment, or go to prison. 
     LeTourneau has said she is deeply ashamed of herself for having had 
     sex with the boy, and for violating the sacred trust of her family, 
     her profession and her society.

     "I think what I've done is horrible and I wouldn't want anyone to 
     think I believe it's acceptable," she said. "It's not."


     But the story doesn't end there. Though LeTourneau has been ordered 
     to have no contact with the boy, she continues to hold romantic 
     feelings for him. Those strong feelings, she said, as well as those 
     for the unborn baby, played a role in her decision to go through with 
     the pregnancy. And the bo's mother, who describes her son as 
     physically and emotionally old beyond his years - "he's never been a 
     typical 13-year-old" - said that he loves LeTourneau back.


      Prosecutors and some experts on sexual offenders don't see it that 
      way. They see  a woman in denial and a boy who may have been 
      emotionally scarred. 

      Women who have sex with boys "are more likely to present their 
      crimes as a love affair and much more likely to hold on to that 
      belief," said Florence Wolfe, co-director of Seattle-based Northwest 
      Treatment Associates, which counsels sex offenders. "But it's still 
      exploitation.

     "Lots of 13-year-old kids are physically mature, very intelligent. But this business of a 35-year-old woman making a love commitment with a 13-year-old boy is hard to fathom. What 13-year-old ha-
s the capacity for that kind of love?"


_Joy in work, but not in marriage_

      Mary Katherine LeTourneau was born one of six children in a strict 
      Catholic family in California. She was popular - smart, pretty, and 
      charming.

     At Arizona State University, she met and began dating Steve 
     LeTourneau. When she became pregnant, they married. But it was a 
     union doomed to fail, she now says.

     "I love him now as much as I did when I first got married. But how 
     much love? Not enough to hold a marriage."

     But even during the most tumultuous periods of the marriage, 
     LeTourneau found joy as a teacher.

    "I walked in my classroom every Monday and knew I was in the right 
    place," she said.

     There was always a waiting list of students for her class, teachers 
     at Shorewood say. And parents raved to one another about her ability 
     to reach their children.

      "The teachers and principals all gave her high marks," said Shirley 
      Hodgson, director of human resources for the Highline School 
      District. "They all thought - and still think - she is a good 
      teacher, a good person."

     LeTourneau said it didn't take her long a few years ago to notice the 
     little boy in her second-grade class with extraordinary artistic 
     ability. Something else set him apart, she contended. 
     "There was a respect, an insight, a spirit, an understanding between 
     us that grew over time," she said. "There was a bonding that was 
     pretty instantaneous. It was the kind of feeling you have with a 
     brother or sister - a feeling that they're part of your life forever.

     "But I didn't know what it meant. I felt that one day he might marry 
     my daughter."


      LeTourneau said she introduced the boy to the piano and bought him 
      art supplies. He sketched and drew for her. As he went from second 
      to third, fourth and fifth grades, she was no longer his teacher, 
      but, she said, the bond between them grew stronger. By sixth grade, 
      he was in her class again.



     By then, she said: "He was my best friend. We just walked together in 
     the same rhythm."

     All the while, the boy was maturing. His family had always considered 
     him old beyond his years - his mother said she's often called him "an 
     old soul trapped in a young body." 

     By then, LeTourneau's stormy marriage was at its ebb.


     One day last summer, to show her his affection, the boy surprised her 
     with a silver ring. He later told police that when he placed it on 
     her finger, then reached to take it back, they looked intently at 
     each other. For him, it was a turning point.

      It wasn't long after that day that the two first had sex. 
      Prosecutors say that continued until February.

     Not long after the sex started, Steve LeTourneau found letters his 
     wife had written to the boy. He went to the boy's home and asked him 
     straight out if he was involved sexually with his wife. The boy 
     admitted that, yes, he was.

     For a while, Steve LeTourneau kept his knowledge of his wife's 
     actions, and, later, her pregnancy, to himself. Then he told  
     relatives. One of them told Child Protective Services and Highline 
     School District officials.


'That's not love,' says counselor

     To prosecutors and some sexual-deviancy experts, the facts of the 
     case speak for themselves: Mary LeTourneau stole the boy's childhood.

      As a consequence, they say she should be imprisoned or, at the 
      least, required to take part in a rigorous sexual-offender program.

     "I have no sympathy for her," said Wolfe of Northwest Treatment 
     Associates. "When we hear it here - the proclamation of love - it is 
     a rationalization. Did she care about his welfare, about what could 
     happen to him by becoming a father at 13?

     "I don't see where she's acted in (the boy's) best interest. That's 
     not love - that's a big emotional party."

      Lucy Berliner, research director of the Harborview Center for sexual 
      assault, expressed similar views. 

     "The idea that an attractive adult woman would find him very 
     interesting as a partner would be very flattering," Berliner said. 
     "But what's hard to understand is why a teacher, or parent, or any 
     adult would act with such complete disregard considering the impact 
     their actions might have on the child.

   "Even if she does genuinely have feelings for him, there is no context 
   for a relationship like this to be normalized."

    Further, she said, "No one can know with 100 percent certainty how the 
    boy will be affected."

'I assumed I could trust her'

     Not surprisingly, the boy's mother was devastated by the news. She 
     said she'd questioned her son because he and LeTourneau were spending 
     so much time together.

     "But he said there was nothing between them. So when I found out 
     there was, I was hurt - hurt because of the trust that was broken. 
     Mary is a mother and I am a mother. And I assumed I could trust her 
     with my son."

     She says she has since forgiven LeTourneau. She wants her son to know 
     the baby, whom he intends to one day help raise, and she loves the 
     baby herself.

     "I don't condone what happened and have never condoned what 
      happened," she said. "But it did happen, and it's something I have 
      to accept and live with." 

      For LeTourneau, it remains difficult to face the boy's mother.

    "I always want to say to her that I'm sorry."

      The boy's family has tried to protect his privacy. He now spends 
      some of his time in Seattle at his family's home, and some with 
      friends in another town - in virtual seclusion.

     "He's doing fine as long he's away from the situation and people 
     don't harass him," said his mother.

      LeTourneau said she is haunted by what might happen to him. She said 
      she understands that his life will never be the same. "But I know he 
      has a strong spirit and I'm hoping it will carry him through."

     The effects of LeTourneau's actions have also been felt at her former 
     school.

      A parent whose child was in LeTourneau's class said her daughter was 
      crushed by the teacher's sudden departure.

       "We brought in a substitute and she did everything she could to help our children learn, but she just wasn't able to teach them," the parent said. "And we told her it wasn't her fault. They co-
uld have brought in Princess Diana and she would not have been able to teach those children."

_Prison or treatment await_

      LeTourneau has told a judge she will plead guilty to child rape at a 
      hearing Aug. 7.

      The judge may send her to prison for up to seven years or - she 
      hopes - allow her to enroll in an extensive treatment program for 
      sex offenders.

     A psychosexual evaluation  done for the court  states that LeTourneau 
     "is not criminally oriented, chemically dependent nor sexually 
     obsessed and compelled." The evaluator also noted, though, that 
     LeTourneau "has not resolved her romantic, erotic and sexual 
     feelings" for the boy, but "has the itellectual resources to engage 
     in and successfully complete psychotherapy." 

     The evaluator concluded: "In my opinion, Ms. LeTourneau does not pose 
     significant risk of a sexual re-offense with the victim or other 
     young males."

     LeTourneau's friends and supporters also believe that treatment, not 
     prison, is the answer.

      One parent said she was deeply disappointed when she learned about 
      what had happened. But "the way she loves people, the way she cares 
      about people and treats people, I have to say I don't believe she 
      should be sent to Purdy."

     At least for now, the state is allowing LeTourneau to keep the baby.

     At a dependency hearing earlier this week, a judge said she could 
     continue to raise the child with the help of friends and relatives - 
     namely, the boy's mother.  If LeTourneau is sent to prison, the boy's 
     mother hopes to care for the baby until she returns.

     LeTourneau says it's the court-ordered loss of her four older 
     children - two boys and two girls ages 3 to 12 - that has been the 
     hardest to bear. For now, they are staying with relatives on the East 
     Coast; she may see them only under supervised conditions.

     Even when she was weighing the consequences of going through with the 
     pregnancy, she said, she never imagined that her older children might 
     become motherless because of what she'd done. She thought she and her 
     husband would split up and she and the older children would bring the 
     baby into their fold.

     "I understand that I put my children in a fragile position," she 
     said. "But I never expected that I . . . would be in a position that 
     I couldn't protect them. I always thought that together, we could get 
     through this."

     She said she is aware the baby one day will have questions about the 
     relationship between her mother and father. So she is writing a 
     journal to give the girl when she's older.

     "But this is for the future," she said. "My concern now is the next 
     six months. I don't know where I'm going to be, where her father is 
     going to be."

All true, but will there come a day when these facts will have no more

That's sort of interesting. The Mandelbrot set doesn't have a thickness 
exactly, but just like any 3 dimensional object, the surface of the set is 
2 dimensional. In 1991 Mitsuhiro Shishikura proved that the boundary line of  
the Mandelbrot Set is as convoluted and wiggly as it is possible for a line 
drawn on a flat surface to be, that means it has a fractal or Hausdorff  
dimension of 2.

But that's the question, if something is logically consistent does that make 
it part of the world?  I'm not a big fan of Logical positivism either, 
Russell's theory of types is really ugly. Also, the idea that a every 
question must have a clear and precise answer or it's totally meaningless 
seems impossibly restrictive to me. After Godel we know that even the best
logical systems will be inconsistent or incomplete or both, and English is 
far from the best, and yet with all its imperfections people have still 
managed to get quite a bit of mileage out of it.

This makes perfect sense to me.  You see, my husband is just an engineer.
I, however, am a *designer*.  :->

Ob relevant comment:  The problem with the term engineering is that it
conveys a sense of controlling Victorian-style mechanical systems.  Instead
of evolution dying out, I think that evolutionary characteristics are
becoming apparent in many other aspects of our world.  Maybe genetic
evolution has been short-circuited by our control over our environment, but
memetic evolution has taken over.  I think Anders is right, a general
theory of complexity would be a tremendous achievement.

Indeed, a friend's dictionary also pointed that out yesterday evening. We

Yes, this is a tough problem, isn't it?  It's one of the things I liked
best about Robin's idea futures.  It seems like a reliable tool for
evaluating people who had good ideas, especially when I don't have the
knowledge or time to look at their credentials and deside if they are
meaningful.  

Another method is to pick someone you trust who has the expertise, time,
and inclination to evaluate these people.  I knew someone (probably a few
people, come to think of it) who relied on Richard Feynman to evaluate all
or most scientific theories that hit the news.  Cold fusion gets announced,
wait until Feynman makes a comment and go with what he says.  I'm not sure
who I'd pick today, but you want a combination of knowledge about the
domain and an ability to think rationally about the implications of the
theory.  CSICOP is another good resource, and they take the time to address
the more patently absurd ideas.

And then there's basic prejudices.  There's a class of idea that always
seems built on flimsy evidence and protected by claims of conspiracy.  I
don't spend much time worrying about faces on Mars and aliens at Roswell.
Jerry O'Neil once wrote, "never ascribe to conspiracy what can be
satisfactorily explained by stupidity."

Best,

Well, I have never thought of it that way. Although I would likely be
less enthusiastic about them if they were a staple (in old contracts
for handymen in northern sweden there were sometimes a paragraph that
saved them from having to eat salmon more than five days a week), I
think the basic taste (lightly salted, with some garlic and onions,
served on roast bread...) is valuable in itself. 

Pleasures should not be overdone, since we become habituated to them,
but I prefere the possibility of indulging in them when we want (and
at a reasonable price) instead of when we happen to stumble across a
mushroom patch in the forest.

I think critical thinking is the key. If an expert claims something,
we have to evaluate his claims from the evidence he presents, what we
know, and how well he can argue his case. Credentials doesn't really 
matter, there are plenty of Ph.Ds around and anybody can be named an 
expert. A nice overview of standards to apply when evaluating
thinking can be found at

I did some web-search and found the following website about
growing fruit bodies of the chanterelle: 

http://www.mykopat.slu.se/mycorrhiza/kantarellfiler/texter/prod1.phtml

So far the results are rather tentative, we are still far from a
commercial application. But it can be done!

Natasha More:

I'm sorry, Natasha, but all current evidence runs against your 
statement.  The staff of national gay organizations, which I interact with 
on a regular basis, would dearly like to take a break and would give 
almost anything to have the kind of power and influence you mention.  
Violence and social approbabation, losing one's job and housing are 
the daily realities for gay persons all over the globe.  Yes we have 
made progress, but it is slow, hard-won, and easily lost.  Even in 
the field of the arts, which I assume you may be using as an example, 
gay art is often ghettoized, and many remain in the closet to keep 
their jobs.  Yes, I see much hope ahead, also a lot of work, but 
work that none of us would take on if we didn't see the chance to 
make a better life.  

I am sorry that this does not sound as 
optimistic as your above statement, but I would rather develop an 
optimism that deals with things as they really are and where we have 
the most chance of making a better life.  And this is definitely an 
area in which I am finding some conflicts with extropian thinking, 
because sometimes I feel torn between the the two, but I suppose that 
is something I must work out on my own.

Kathryn Aegis

I do not think that Robin was asking me the question in these terms, 
as he understands that we are talking about social institutions in 
terms of sociology, which refers to specific complex structures that 
exist in a broader sense than those you mention.

I already explained this, in a paragraph that I worried might offend 
Robin, as it explained Basics.

In comparing individual agents with the societal structures they live 
within, you miss the important factor that social institutions do not 
necessarily exist for the benefit of individual development and often 
work against it.  Social institutions exist to form order, and to 
allocate benefits and responsibilities.  This is not a personal 
argument, it is one of the beginning tenets of sociology, and also 
political science.  If this subject interests you, and from the 
questions you ask, I think that it does, I recommend looking up a 
good basic text.  Many libertarian writers get into these questions 
as well.

No, that is not the question. Not many would say that 
consistency guarantees existence (apart from David Lewis). The 
snowman is a logically consistent notion but that does not mean that 
the snowman exists.

Now, obviously, if something is asserted to exist by a logically true 
proposition, then it exists. So the questions are (1) Is the 
proposition that the Mandelbrot exists logically true? (which boils 
down to whether the notion of "logical truth" in the traditional 
way really makes sense), and (2) Is this kind of existence somehow 
fundamentally different from the existence of objects which cannot be 
claimed to exist by any logically true proposition.

You don't need to accept Russell's theory of types to be a fan of 
Logical positivism.

Sure.

Now, I don't know whether I basically disagree with you or I am just 
playing the devils advocate. But I do think that the question "Does 
the Mandelbrot set exist?" needs to be specified and refined. I mean 
there is the logical notion of existence, and then the answer is 
obviously Yes. But you seem to have a thicker notion of existence in 
mind, and until you have explained what that notion is, your question 
appears rather meaningless to me. (I mean, if somebody told me "Yes, 
the Mandelbrot set does exist.", how much wiser would I be if I 
didn't know what this thicker notion of existence is supposed to be?)

Actually, I am planning to become God in the long run, so I guess that will
mean some profound changes to my physical and mental properties. In the
meantime, however, I would like to add/change the following things:
--a studly (tall, fair and muscular) physique. Guess how I look now :(
--"perfect health" (highly efficient immune system, quick auto-repair etc.)

I don't think I'll be changing anything -- or rather, I suspect I'll
be changing everything. The question is much like someone in 1850
asking "given that some time soon we will be able to build large
steam driven wheeled tractors shaped like horses to pull around our
carriages, what color are you going to paint yours?"

The human body is all fine and well for its purpose, and has lots of
neato design elements, but frankly, I don't see much of a point in
retaining a body if V.R. gets good enought that one can transfer one's
locus to a large well constructed and much more survivable computer
system. If you need to walk around and for nostalgia reasons you want
the vehicle to look like a human body, you can operate or teleoperate
a robotic simulacrum of one that will likely be far stronger and more
capable anyway.

I'm sure there will be those who for whatever reason who simply make
minor modifications to their bodies or no changes at all -- just as
there are those who, to this day, use horse drawn carriages as a
primary means of transportation. The species is likely to fragment and
differentiate into a thousand directions, and it would be surprising
if some people didn't retain "ordinary" human bodies. However, the
advantages of switching to a substrate where I am no longer
constrained by current limits on mental power, memory, sensory inputs
and such seems to be way too compelling.

I may (for at least a time) prefer to spend some CPU cycles convincing
my own "virtual senses" that I am in fact sitting inside an ordinary
body still surrounded by a "virtual world", (one has speculative and
possibly unlikely visions of doing one's work on the veranda of a
pretty estate in perfect spring weather, visiting friends in their
"houses", etc.), but in reality I might be instantiated in a giant
nanocomputer floating out in space somewhere, surrounded by a cloud of
defensive systems, construction nanobots, nanofactories, etc.

Of course, this is all speculation. Five seconds in to a
trillion-times-faster life/thoughtstyle, I might discover something
far more interesting than being a giant nanocomputer. Indeed, I almost
certainly will. However, from my current perspective, that is one
possible short term destination. (Necessarily a very limited
perspective, too -- who can even envision the changes in question at
more than the crudest level?  This is far, far worse than a Roman
philosopher speculating on the nature of 20th century life... -- it is
even far worse than a cat speculating about what a human's life is
like...)

I think I will turn into an open standard. 

I have this vision of turning at least part of my cognitive structure
into an efficient information gathering and organizing agent,
designed to work together with other agents of different types. It
would have the ability to adapt and evolve to suit the needs of its
clients, but no higher level goals other than being very useful.

Why would I want to create something like this from myself? The
answer is simply: almost guaranteed survival (my agent-selves would
be useful and adaptive, even in the ultra-competitive posthuman world
Eugene threatens/promises us with) and unlimited access to
information (my vision of heaven). A kind of digital nirvana, where
my agent-selves are intended to become mitochondrial analogs in
whatever posthuman minds will develop. 

AndersVista, anyone?

Of course, just to be on the safe side I will also continue my
individual existence in at least one copy (likely a whole clan of
copies, closely interlinked into a small borganism). My guess is that
I will move to a software existence as soon as possible, but likely
retain physical presence just to be sure.

I think we already have a fairly accurate internal clock, we just 
need a better interface. Bionics is an obvious solution, but I
wouldn't implant a clock on its own, rather put it in a package deal
such as an internal computer with radio, net-links etc.

Dampening ought to be possible by growing small patches of inhibitory
neurons linked to an electrode, and then make them synapse on the
brain nerves. Improved senses are a bit harder.

Might be very hard unless we can unravel the neural structure of our
brains well.

An internal computer with (say) subvocal input linked through an IR
link to the local net ought to do this quite nicely.

I disagree in the strongest possible terms with your characterization
here.

In the 19th Century, we were learning new facts about Electricity and
Magnetism -- and Maxwell's equations constituted new information about
the topic -- most importantly, they had the interesting property of
predicting new facts like electromagnetic waves (thus forming the
cornerstone of all scientific thought, the falsifiable hypothesis.)

In the question of "is the Mandelbrot set 'real'", we have a very
different debate. All facts about the Mandelbrot set relevant to the
area are well known. The debate is entirely over how one defines
"reality". No information will come out of the discussion other than
perhaps "which definitions of 'reality' would apply to the Mandelbrot
set and which ones will not?" No falsifiable hypotheses result. No new
insights arise.

The person posing the question implicitly has already answered it if
he has properly stated the question. This means that the answer yields
all the thrill that you get in putting a number on a sheet of paper,
placing the paper into an envelope, and then attempting to guess the
number that you yourself wrote down.

On the contrary. There are many reasonable definitions. Some of them
are even rigorous. None of them have the property of being what I
would call "interesting", however -- and none ever can.

There are whole rafts of such utterly meaningless "to be"
definitionalism questions that philosophers have tortured themselves
with over the centuries. "What is the meaning of life" is my favorite,
though "is X real" has been high up on the list ever since Plato came
up with the Metaphor of the Cave in "The Republic"...

Or as another example, with a definition of "reality" which classes the
Mandelbrot set and the Virgo cluster as the same, can we reject any
logically consistent but "actually" non-existent phenomena as "real"?  Must
we say that alien spaceships "really" are visiting the earth today, simply
because there is no logical contradiction in doing so?  Is the reality
of such alien visitations any less than the reality of the Mandelbrot
set?  Presumably we could create a computer simulation which would let
us view the former just as we view the latter.

I have a weird hunch that it is *not* possible to make solid
predictions about chaotic systems without prohibitive amounts of
computation power in the general case. It may be possible to prove
this assertion (or may not -- "does P=NP" has held for a very long
time without a proof.) The related question of "is it possible to make
solid predictions in interesting specialized cases" may be more
tractable.

I don't make any predictions about what the great discoveries of the
next century will be, given that if we really truly hit exponentially
self-feeding intelligence enhancement its unlikely that we'll have
even a tiny shot at predicting what the next hundred revolutions of
the earth around the sun will hold -- probably more changes for
ourselves than we have experienced thus far in our whole existance as
a species, and perhaps more change for life than it has undergone in
its entire existance on the planet.

However, I can easily name something on my "most wanted" list of
information. 

What do I want to see? A theory framework that answers (in a
meaningful way) the question "why does the electron weigh as much as
it does" or, in the same vein, "why is the speed of light in a vacuum
what it is?"

Similarly, the framework should answer (in a meaningful way) the
question "why is the formula relating velocity, mass, and energy of a
body in motion what it is?"

For years now, we have built up this large coherent body of equations
and constants that give us answers to physics questions. What I want
to know is -- why *these* equations? Why *these* constants?

The answer may turn out to be unknowable, or there may be an
underlying answer to what gives rise to particular bits of the physics
bestiary. I suspect that some of the questions (like why the charges on
the electron and proton are what they are) may have better answers
than others. At this point, even coming up with coherent ways to
phrase some of the questions is hard...

Your current evidence takes the slant of making a living in society where I
was referring to social acceptance of gays.  Surely there are those who are
pigeon holed in unprogressive thinking, but on a whole progress happens
regardless of those who are antagonistical to it.

There is evidence to show discrimination against many areas of professional
society especially in work-related areas.  Regardless of this fact, the gay
community has created a voice for itself and that voice is surely being heard.

However true, these are concerns for many areas of discrimination.  The

No one is assuming that in order to look ahead one needs to be unrealistic.

The basic facts are that the gay community is more widely known, heard and
understood than 10 years ago.  Twenty years from now, it a lot of the social
problems will be non-issues.  There may be other problems, just as in other
areas of society, and these will be dealt with in time.

I understand your concern and dismay at chipping away at a seemingly
impenetrable wall.

And it might be possible to make solid prediction about general
behaviors even when the parts of the system are chaotic or
unpredictable; the smoke from a lit cigar rises in a very typical
manner, but is actually very chaotic. There might be general "laws of
form" we could discover that holds in many (important) cases.

Yes, this is more useful. 

On top of my "most wanted" list is of course "How does the brain

A good question. I like Smolin's (partial) answer - they have evolved
to support us, but it should be taken with a large amount of salt.
Another fun (but unlikely) answer is suggested by Greg Egan in
_Distress_.

Well, it's not a coincidence.  I ran into that game last week, so the term

I read an interesting science fiction short story last year about
an old man, of our generation, struggling to deal with the changes in
technology which had occured during his lifetime.  In their society they
had established a way to access parallel worlds to a limited extent.
This had opened up a lot of technologies, including a virtually unlimited
source of energy based on some kind of differential between the universes.

Current QM models say it will be impossible to access the parallel Everett
universes, but if non-linearities are ever introduced it might become
theoretically possible.  I don't know about the energy part, but it would
certainly be of tremendous philosophical impact to learn that parallel
worlds are real, and perhaps even to be able to communicate with them.

You could conceivably talk to dead relatives, you could see how your
life might have been different if you had taken other choices, you could
get the effects of quantum computing, access works of art by people who
never succeeded in this universe.  It would truly turn things upside down.
(Larry Niven had a story in which such a discovery led to nihilism and
depression, but I think the consequences would be more complex.)

But that is the problem you see.  I've been browsing the "Cold Fusion" and

The Emulators


Somewhere there is a world where conception and sin are intertwined,
A world where each individual is forced to renounce his mind;
In this world there are men who teach that novelty is a disease
And that reason and logic should be controlled by authorities.
Here there lay the meticulous machineries of mimicry--
Tools of emulation that keep innovation from being free;
In this world the machineries and tools are sanctioned by a state
Whose controls are so convoluted that they bar those who create.
Somewhere a world exists where intelligence is precious and rare--
Where mediocrity is freedom and sacrifice: debonair,
And in this world the scholars say that premises are just for fools--
That order and liberty are maintained if one plays by the rules.
The scariest thing is that this world is not too different from Earth
Where most of the general populous has lost all sense of self-worth;
Scarier still that so few see what we have the potential to be--
Their sight is locked and the world must suffer until they find the key.

The obvious answer to this rethorical question is No. The existence 
of the Mandelbrot set is provable in standard (ZF) set theory, but I 
don't know of any plausible axioms from which one can derive the 
existence of visiting alian spaceships.

        What I have noticed with many "rights groups" is that they don't
have a set reason for their actions.  Why does sexual orientation have to
be a major situation in the workplace or society?  I believe that one of
the main purposes of such organizations is to attract attention to a
certain group in hopes of promoting equality; however, this does not so
much promote equality as promote a separation.  When people hear of "gay
marches" [by the way, I'm using homosexuality as an example...the same is
true of any rights group] they automatically see gays as a particular --a
group that is set apart from the rest of society.

        In an ideal world, each individual would be treated *as*
individuals regardless of their race, culture, creed, sexual orientation,
physical handicap etc.  In an ideal world one *person* would make his own
judgments on another *person* based upon the ideas and personality that
other person possessed.  We haven't come close to achieving this ideal
world yet.  People are still consumed by hatred for other groups...not
considering the individuality of each member.  I think that the only way to
confront this is for each individual to not attract attention to their
sexual orientation, race, creed etc.  By suggesting this, I do not mean
that each person should try to ignore or hide his\her sexual orientation
etc., but accept it for him\herself and not make a big deal out of it.  One
should not try to attract attention *because* of his\her sexual orientation
etc., but set goals and achieve them...proving that being "gay" is not a
hindrance or something to be ashamed of, but something to accept and
incorporate into one's daily life.  When a group sections itself off from
society, it creates an animosity because most other people will want to be
sectioned of as well. The general thought will usually be: "Why are *they*
wanting special rights for their gayness when I can't get special rights
for my <whatever>?"  I have more thoughts on this matter, but I'd like to
hear what people think of this first.

Dear Extropians,


I've just entered this discussion list.
I have the M.Sc. degree, and I am a studious on the following 
subjects:

Neurosciences,
(nano) Neurocybernetics,
Philosophy and Science,
for example.

It is very enlarging having found a list like this, where we can 
(and may...) talk about the real development of mankind, that must 
include the advances of technology.
I intend to include for discussion some topics like:

The artificialization (and miniaturization) of the human body: A step 
to getting the real (quasi) ethernal life.

Homo cyber: The evolution of Homo sapiens.

Why do not use our clones for supplying our organs for 
transplantation?  

Will it be possible to relly Ressurrect ?

New possible explanations to the existence of the Universe, without 
presupposing the existence of any other being.

Etc, etc.

Please visit my homepage, still under construction.

Thanks a lot.


PS: Excuse me for "some" language mistakes that may arise. But I'm 
not originarilly from  an English-language country...

Philip K. Dick, I believe, defined reality as that which doesn't
go away when you stop believing in it.  Does the Mandelrot set go
away when I stop believing in it?  How about if everyone stops
believing in it?  Is the Mandelbrot set like the gravitational
field, or is the Mandelbrot set like Church and State (which I'm
pretty confident would go away, or at least change rather drastically,
if everyone stopped believing in them).

However, I am pretty sure that the Virgo Cluster does *not* go away
when I stop believing in it.  John K. Clark will no doubt grant
that this theory is, at least, interesting.

Robert Anton Wilson, on the other hand, has defined reality as what
you can get away with.  Can I get away with a Mandelbrot set?  I'm
not even sure how to begin answering *that* question.  Would I want
to get away with a Mandelbrot set?  Perhaps, but I'd rather get
away with a flotilla of carbonaceous chondrites.

You want a precise definition of "exist", I think that would be nice too but  
obviously I don't have one. Not being a follower of Logical Positivism I most 
certainly don't think the lack of such a definition means the question is  
meaningless. Little of our knowledge is in the form of definitions and none 
of the really important stuff is, it's in the form of "like this" and "not 
like this". I maintain that it is an undeniable fact that in everyday life we  
mean *something* by the word "exist", even if we can't say exactly  what it 
is.  My question, is the Mandelbrot set "like that"? Can I safely  place the 
Mandelbrot set in the mental category that happens to have the name "things 
that exist", or will doing that lead to a contradiction at some point?
           

        >I mean, if somebody told me "Yes, the Mandelbrot set does exist.",                 
        >how much wiser would I be 
           

I think you'd be a lot wiser. If you grant that I am "real" then it would  
mean anything that is consistent would be as real as I am, whatever the  
definition of the word. It would mean there is no difference between an 
actual mind and a potential one.

I don't think there is any question that neurons cause consciousness, I can 
demonstrate on myself that if my neurons are changed, then my state of  
consciousness changes. But what else besides  me is conscious in  my brain, 
or in a rock for that matter. Some think it's all a mater of interpretation.

To communicate with another person the interpretation is straightforward,  
if the person smiles he is happy, if they make sounds with their mouth we  
find meaning in them from another interpretation, the rules of grammar,  
but some, such as Moravec go as  far as to  say that a interpretation must 
exist that can  find a mind even in a rock. The reason we can't detect them 
is that we're too stupid. The interpretation is so hideously complex that as 
a practical matter their workings are indistinguishable to us from random 
thermal vibrations.

As near as I can tell, Moravec thinks that a mind is the one thing that has 
it's own self consistent interpretation inherent within it; in fact that 
seems to be the definition of a mind, although you would still need an 
interpretation to make contact with it.

You know, I could have written exactly the same sentence. I could be wrong 
but I seem to mean something by all this but I'm not sure exactly what it is. 
If anybody does know what the hell I'm babbling about I'd appreciate it if 
they'd drop me a line and tell me.

Hmm... perhaps I'm dull, but I thought that Darrow and Tipler had
built up a fairly convincing explanatory answer to these questions
in their book THE ANTHROPIC COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE. I mean, it may
not be very satisfying to learn that these things are the way they
are because of a selection effect (I think the Anthropic Principle
dovetails quite beautifully with the Many Worlds interpretation,
though), but even if I wasn't rock-bottom convinced (and I wasn't),
these questions became far less interesting to me after I had read
the book.

(There's also a neat little chart on the web, pointed out here
recently by Steve Witham, at http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html
that makes things a bit more concrete.  "The figure below illustrates
how little one needs to change some aspects of our world to make
it hostile to life...")

(Note: just because I like the Anthropic Principle doesn't mean I
entirely approve of Tipler's more recent plucking at Tommaso Aquino's
laurels.  I can't imagine why Tipler's going into competition with
a rationalizer of witchburning.)

O.K.  This seems to be a direct application of a general rule that
something that wants to get chosen gains an advantage by having the
choosers be less aware of other choices.  So the extent to which any
random institution, say journal editorship, is threatend by revealing
the construction of gender depends on the extent to which some
alternative to that institution would be more visible with revealed
construction.  I find it hard to believe that most social institutions
would be very threatened, since I don't think their alternatives
typically depend much on gender, but I'm open to being convinced.

The political philosopher (still the best theorist and critic of
totalitarianism I've ever read) Hannah Arendt said in an interview that
"If one is attacked as a Jew one must defend oneself as a Jew.  Not as a
German, not as a world-citizen, not as an upholder of the rights of Man,
or whatever..."  Her point was that antisemitism (like racism, like
sexism, like heterosexism, or what have you) can too easily exist in
societies that imagine themselves staunch defenders of these more
general conceptions.  The problem is that certain kinds of people, for
lots of mostly contingent historical and sociocultural reasons, come to
be thought of as less-than-properly-human and the smooth function of
regimes of civility based on respect for rights crank along quite
cheerfully even when these less-than-properly-human humans are treated
unfairly (or sometimes even genocidally).  There is no question that
lesbian and gay people in the United States are second-class citizens. 
Our intimate associations are not recognized, we are unable to serve
openly in the military, the sexual acts by means of which we express
desire for one another are largely illegal in half the states, the
protections from discrimination available to most unpopular minorites
are expressely denied us in most cases.  Whatever one feels about
marriage, military service, antidiscrimination laws and the like (like
most extropians I for one would be happy to see the whole governmental
dog-and-pony show junked), the point is that the denial of these
benefits and protections to one group among all others *symptomizes*
something deep and dangerous about this society.  Certainly scares me. 
This is especially chilling in the U.S. where lesbians and gays are
simultaneously second-class citizens legally speaking, but the darlings
of media culture, treated as exceptional and extraordinary, monsters of
desire and talent, fashion millionaires and such.  To be less than human
legally and more than human culturally is a heady cocktail to sip --
ask the Jews of Weimar Germany.  I see deep affinities between queer
politics and extropian politics -- to the extent that either of these
can be said to exist at all.  Enemies of Christian fundamentalism,
dogmatisms of every variety, state and social repressiveness in
general, queers and extropes have a lot in common (even those of us who
aren't strictly speaking *already* both).  Believe me, I am utterly
uninterested in being known as a fag instead of an individual.  I am
uninterested in special rights, but equal ones will suit me just fine.  My
intimate associations are the last thing I would want to provide the basis
for anyone paying attention to me.
	That said, I'll just add quickly a question about
antidiscrimination legislation.  I know the general libertarian take that
it is wrong to tell an owner of a business just how she should behave, and
further that to the extent that homophobia and other attitudes like it are
irrational it is to be expected that the market will weed them out as more
tolerant individuals make fatter profits (tho' I understand that this
intuition is controverted by lots of respectable economic research).
However, I wonder if it is possible to translate the general idea of
antidiscrimination laws in terms that will be more attractive to
libertarians anyway.  To the extent that every contract relies for its
intelligibility on a welter of unstated assumptions, why can't we
interpret acts of discrimination simply as breaches of contract?  If we
assume that most people imagine that they are being hired to do a job and
do it well, why can't we say then that, should this be the case, an
employer who fires demotes or otherwise unfairly treats an employee in the
service of some fool prejudice is breaching contract with her -- unless
something about the employer's racism, sexism, or whatever had a very
conspicuous place *in* the contract to begin with?  Would this
interpretation of the spirit of antidiscrimination legislation go down
smoother?  It doesn't leave the distasteful residue that the "wanting
something for nothing" interpretations mostly on offer yield -- at least
for me.  Best, Dale

An interesting way of thinking is that, even if the associated 
phenomenum does not exist in the reallity, there exists the 
associated neural conformation, like a mathematical transformation, 
when linear associated to a matrix, as we know. And this 
transformation is real and passible to be studied...

Talking about real and not real, I'd like to include the 
mental images. If certain image comes in someone's mind could we 
classify it as real or virtual, like we do with mirrors and lens ? If 
a person creates (or simply projects...)  an image in its 
mind, there exists the associated brain (neurological) conformation, 
which is real (as said above). But,  are there mental  images that 
really correspond to real objects, even if they are not near? If 
there are, could we consider them as real time, time delayed or even 
antecipated?     Why that? Because, in positive case, on 
artificializing a human (not necessarily...) brain, we can, in the 
future, possibly, create televiewers not necessarily just 
present-time, but to the past and possibly the to future (as an 
extrapolator of the present real conditions). If it is possible, 
could we use such machine to scan the individual's barin conformation 
in the past and reinstall it in a new artificial body 
(preferenceably miniaturized), in the future?
What do you think about this?

Peace,

Gomes.

I missed the earlier reference, but this was a neat web page.  I liked
the chart showing the relationship between different mathematical objects.
It would be great as a large-format wall chart.  This guy, "Mad Max" Tegmark,
has some pretty cool physics stuff on his home page, too.

One problem I have with Anthropic Principle reasoning is the claim
that atoms and molecules much as we know them are necessary for life.
I don't see how we can a priori rule out possible stable structures of
others kinds.  Even in our own universe, it could be that an earlier or
later epoch would allow the existence of life in a totally different way.
We, who seriously consider the Moravec/Tipler picture of transforming
ourselves into standing waves during the collapse of the universe,
cannot be too confident that life depends on atoms.

Even if we do grant that atoms are necessary, there is inevitably going to
be some "slop" in the physical constants which will allow life-supporting
universes.  Maybe they will have to fall into a narrow range, but there
will be *some* variability possible.  So all the AP can really do is to
reduce the magnitude of the problem.  The essential mystery will remain:
are there infinite universes, most of which have no life?  Is there just
one, and somehow it was created in the preferred state where life can
evolve?  I think there is a substantial issue here even accepting the AP.

Hal

P.S. Here is an abstract from another of Tegmark's papers on his site:

"At first sight, an accurate description of the state of the universe
appears to require a mind-bogglingly large and perhaps even infinite
amount of information, even if we restrict our attention to a small
subsystem such as a rabbit. In this paper, it is suggested that most
of this information is merely apparent, as seen from our subjective
viewpoints, and that the algorithmic information content of the universe
as a whole is close to zero. It is argued that if the Schrdinger
equation is universally valid, then decoherence together with the
standard chaotic behavior of certain non-linear systems will make the
universe appear extremely complex to any self-aware subsets that happen
to inhabit it now, even if it was in a quite simple state shortly after
the big bang. For instance, gravitational instability would amplify the
microscopic primordial density fluctuations that are required by the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle into quite macroscopic inhomogeneities,
forcing the current wavefunction of the universe to contain such Byzantine
superpositions as our planet being in many macroscopically different
places at once.  Since decoherence bars us from experiencing more than
one macroscopic reality, we would see seemingly complex constellations of
stars etc, even if the initial wavefunction of the universe was perfectly
homogeneous and isotropic."

You see, the proposition asserting the existence of the Mandelbrot 
set is not only consistent, it is logically true, i.e. it follows 
logically  from the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel's set 
theory, the truth of which we do not doubt, do we. So when you ask 
whether the Mandelbrot set exists, the answer to your question would 
have no relevance to the issue of whether "if something is logically 
consistent does that makes it a part of the world?". Hence this 
latter question is not *the* question, i.e. not the question we were 
discussing, which is the question of the existence of such things as 
the Mandelbrot set. (I sense a confusion between consistency and 
logical necessity.)

I did not say that a precise definition is a prerequisite for 
fruitfully discussing the issue; I only said that the question needed 
to be made more precise and unambigous than it is. It is a matter of 
degree.

I have been eagerly awaiting this new book for over a year now. I

unusually shaped thunder bolts or snow in the middle of the summer.

You're right.  Two and a half millenia ago, the Buddha's answers
to these questions was to refrain from answering them, and to point
out that they are profitless.  In a few more decades or centuries,
though, they may become very practical questions indeed.  (At the
moment, I still find myself trapped in a gravity well, which is
perhaps the real reason why I found the AP a "good enough" answer
to allow me to move on to other questions.)

The problem is that whenever I try to think really hard about
multiple universes devoid of life, whether or not they exist, and
what to do about them, I always get distracted by thoughts of
multiple celestial bodies, which certainly exist and are certainly
devoid of life (some of them, anyway), and what to do about them.
Also I read too much Hume and Nietzsche when I was young enough to
be impressionable (gullible?) and so metaphysics makes me more
nervous than other areas of philosophical inquiry do.  I tend to
think of metaphysics as a scratchpad theoretical area of the brain
where people keep their "overarching" paradigms.  Everyone has
these, including me, and most of them are not worth much.  (I think
all theories are fallible, but metaphyscial theories even more so
than usual.)  The useful paradigms are usually more concrete, and
have specific areas of applicability and inapplicability that we've
learned to recognize.  Metaphysical paradigms are supposed to
encompass everything; I don't know if ape brains are capable of
hosting computational structures that can encompass everything.
Perhaps they are, perhaps not: if the latter, then probably we
can become something better than ape brains in a little while
longer.

What keeps metaphysics interesting to me is the fuzziness of its
boundary with neighboring subjects.  In fact, Tipler and Barrow
did a lot to make these sorts of questions more interesting to me
just by yanking them out of the heart of metaphysics and dragging
them over to the boundary area with mathematical cosmology.  Perhaps
the real philosophers will shake their heads knowingly, but I just
can't get into Nozick's and Heidegger's long rambles about why
there is something rather than nothing.  I'm not really sure what
the paying market is for such works.  Reading that sort of thing
always leaves me feeling that I might just as well be counting a
rosary or spinning a prayer wheel.

        *That* is the most progressive attitude any "minority figure" can
have.  If someone attacks you for being gay, you have every right to defend
your individual sexual orientation.  The problem is that so often, a person
is attacked for his views on a totally different issue and he will fight
that person using the fact that he is gay as ammunition...trying to gain
pity because he is a "minority".  The exploitation of this fact damages the
credibility of the rights group in society's eyes --it would be he who
brought the sexual orientation into question.

        Indeed.  If an unobtrusive homosexual is hired to do a job well,
the only reason that person should be fired is because he or she does *not*
do the job well.  The issue of that person's homosexuality should not come
into play unless, for some reason, it hinders his\her job.  If a person is
fired *because* he\she is gay but did the job well, then the employer is
discriminating...and that is most certainly unfair.  It is an interesting
idea to have a clause in the contract exclaiming that the employer is
homophobic.  In such a case, if a gay worker still accepts the job, he\she
should acknowledge the risk of his\her sexual orientation in such a position.
That person should know to keep his\her orientation quiet.  The whole idea
of there being discriminatory employers is revolting in the first place; to
be persecuted for something that (as far as I know) cannot be helped is the
most despicable form of domination...it makes a mockery of liberty.  As
long as people like this are in positions of "power", minorities are at a
bit of an impasse.  The question is this: what is the best way to fight
this kind of domination?  If such people won't see reason, what can be
done?  The questions are feasible and are yet to be resolved.

The term "prejudices"  has negative connotations. It sounds better,
and is easier to defend, by saying "Occam's razor" or by noting that
"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof."

Occam's razor is attributed to the medeval philosopher William of
Occam (as I recall.) He said (roughly) "do not multiply hypotheses
unnecessarily." When there is more than one explanation for a
phenomenon that fits the facts and that is not contradicted, then
pick the one that requires the fewest (or simplest) new hypotheses.

So: given a fact: "there are currently no Unicorns" then either
   1) there were never any Unicorns.
   2) There were Unicorns, but the pixies scared them all away.

We pick (1) instead ot (2), because if (2) then we now need to
worry about the pixies.

"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof" is an
similar  principle. If a claim is really weird, then
it's a lot more likely to be in error. Therefore, the onus
is on the claimant to be convincing, and not on the rest of
society to refute the claim. This is a practical matter:
if we waset our time on low-probability investigations, we
won't be spending time on more worthwhile endeavors.
Note that I'm now talking about science, not law.
If you claim not to have committed a crime, then our
society has decided that the onus is on us to prove
otherwise, beyond a reasonable doubt, even if the simplest
explanation is that in fact you did commit the crime.
Your crackpot theory has no such constitutional protection,
and it should not. (Not directed at you, Andrea. After all,
I'm the one withthe crackpot theory!)

Subject: Re: dreaming reality: the neural servo

While your theory is interesting, your "observations" on sleep are
somewhat incorrect.  People don't "go back to their early childhood"
during deep sleep.  Assuming for the moment that you mean that people go
back during dreams, there is very little dreaming during deep sleep
(Stage 3/4).  Most dreaming is during REM sleep, and the brain is
relatively aroused during REM.  In fact, the brain is fully "awake" in
many senses - it actively suppresses motor function while you dream (and
greatly raises the sensory threshold so most sensory input is blocked
out).  A majority of dreams are reported to be a mixture of very recent
(the past day or so) memories and associations between those memories
and slightly older memories (sometimes very bizarre associations).  A
very small proportion of dreams involves distant memories, such as early
childhood memories.
     Some other sleep-related comments:  True, the cortical oscillations
are slow and of high amplitude.  But sleep depth doesn't "shut down" the
less "primitive" parts of our brain:  Those oscillations are from
cortical cells firing in unison, most likely due to thalamic neurons
controlling the pattern of cortical firing.  All these parts of our
brain are still active - they still function.  Furthermore, these parts
of our brain are still functional in childhood - our brains are almost
completely developed by childhood.  True, not all the connections are
complete, but many are.  
    People cycle through sleep stages several times in the night.  We
don't just get into a deeper sleep as the night progresses, it gets deep
then shallow, even occasionally waking up before drifting back into the
deeper stages again.  And then, of course, there's REM sleep, which is
electrically (EEG) nearly identical to awake brain activity.  Any
signals we pick up tend to be incorporated into our dreams (REM sleep),
when the threshold for sensory input is lower (i.e. more input can
occur).  During stage 3/4 sleep, the threshold for sensory input is
extremely high, so only something as strong as a loud alarm or other
noise will be registered by the brain.  Weaker stimuli don't get past
the auditory/visual nerves.  We don't wake up in the mornings because of
increased sensory input (the "supply of reality") - just ask anybody
that works a third shift or parties all night.  The need for sleep can
temporarily override circadian rhythms, and easily override sensory
input - that's why people who work those shifts can sleep til 1300 (1
PM) and stay awake until 0500.  Of course, circadian rhythms can take
precedence - thus the ability to nap in midafternoon, when your
circadian rhythm is naturally "low".  No one is sure what initiates the
transition from sleep to wake, or vice versa, but input from thermally
sensitive neurons, and the brain's balance between acetylcholine and
monoamine neuroactivity, have both been implicated.  The idea that the
brain corrects "reality" is interesting, and one I've heard of before,
but I still have the same question - if the brain is involved in fixing
reality, why can someone be killed without getting the sensory input
that says he is going to die?  That is, the external reality of sleeping
in the wild (or on train tracks, etc.) can intrude on the person without
the brain ever knowing - the brain and body will then stop functioning. 
Presumably, reality shouldn't change or change much if the brain is
controlling reality and not just our perceptions of it.  In other words,
how can external things intrude on your body if it is your brain which
makes reality?  Even if you were conscious, and assumed that your brain
intuitively knew physics well enough for a bullet to kill you, if you
closed your eyes before you saw the shooter you wouldn't know the bullet
was fired at you and you shouldn't get hit by it - unless you have a
death wish.  And when you're asleep, there's no sensory input, so how
can a bullet even hit you when it shouldn't exist?
    Lack of sleep does not have the same effect as panic.  You can get
hallucinations (not generally a symptom of panic but sometimes a cause)
with long sleep deprivation.  More often though, slight confusion and
the ability to fall asleep much more easily are the main neural
manifestations.  Our bodies slow down slightly, whereas in panic our
sympathetic nervous system is in overdrive.  Again, refer to the
question above in regard to creating reality from within.

Just my 2 cents...

I don't want to raise the heat in this conversation unecessarily, but in
the interest of clarity I would want to reiterate that as far as I'm
concerned every lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered person in the
United States might properly be regarded as "under attack," and in
consequence a lot of the behavior you seemed to decry as pandering for
attention and jockeying for special privileges might just as easily seem
on your own assumptions as perfectly justified cultural self-defense.  The
fact that lesbians and gays are safe from the cruder brutalities of
heterosexist laws and social prejudices only to the extent that they
either manage to "pass" as straight in public or ghettoize themselves in
nonhomophobic pockets of the sociocultural landscape (urban centers and
particular employment niches), makes me especially nervous about the
application to your figure of the ideally progressive queer of the
adjective "unobtrusive".  For the record, as I said, I don't think gayness
is remotely the most interesting thing about me, but neither do I think I
manage to be particularly unobtrusive about it.  (Ask my students at
Berkeley!)  I realize, btw, that I may have overstated the plight of
queers somewhat, though I think probably I have not, and that things seem
to be improving for us, etc., etc., but until equality is
institutionalized in a satisfactory way I tend to notice and remember the
shocking and surprisingly widespread vestigial remains of this stupidity
rather than the fact that, e.g., Ellen came out to millions, lesbian chic
has made it to a Newsweek cover, and gay people have their own bookstores
in a handful of cities.  Just to nudge this conversation into a more
conspicuously extropic register, I wonder to what extent the collision of
proliferating forms of desire with traditional regimes of civility,
legality, and morality we are seeing today presages conflicts to
come as technoconstituted modifications of body and mind render race, sex,
gender, and even species all quite as up-for-grabs as queers seem to have
done already for institutions like love, family, and sex.  Best, Dale

     Hi all,
     
     I'm assimilating a glossary of terms relative to the concept of 
     singularity.  It is some research for a story.  Also, pointers to 
     previous editions of Extropian digest that might have pertinent info 
     would be beneficial.
     
     I've seen the term "Fermi Paradox" battered around but I'd like more 
     information.  I'll be surfing and researching on this this evening.
     
     Ultimately, I'd like to provide a story that could be made into film 
     that has the optimistic impact of "Contact" and not promote the scare 
     tactics of oldies like "Colossus: The Forbin Project" or newer ones 
     like "The Web" or (gag!) "Virtuosity" just because the 
     artistically-deprived and generally bored people of our culture will 
     lap up anything that has a few moments of dazzle, suspense or 
     intrigue, even if the bulk of the offering is laden with predictable 
     outcomes, black "plot" holes and generally require wild suspension of 
     disbelief merely to enjoy the 1.5 to 2 hours.  
     
     Cultural prep work is needed for a singularity to occur if it is to 
     occur at all.  More people see movies than ever.  Likely because the 
     medium of film is a quicker assimilation of information (however 
     tweaked a form it may come in).  That's the direction I'm compelled to 
     go in.
     
     Hope to hear from some of you...

YakWax asks what changes we'd make to our body.

I'd keep my skin (I enjoy it) and skull (for continuity),
and otherwise replace as much as possible with Foglets;
distribute my mind throughout my new body, replacing
hard neural connections with network protocol.

The Foglets should be of at least three different designs,
so that they don't all fail at once the first time I find
myself in (e.g.) a strong magnetic field.

A matter of taste.  My memory for events (and people) is iffy,
and was iffy before I turned twenty.  It doesn't bother me much.
Losing skills would suck bigtime, but skills seem to be stored
in a more robust format.

Anders, in common with many people, suggests a mature theory of complexity
as the next big step.  One mighty leap beyond that has been proposed by
Prof Lee Smolin in his new book THE LIFE OF THE COSMOS.  I've only just
started reading this book - which I've been awaiting eagerly for some years
- and find to my surprise that Smolin argues for what one might dub an
`evolutionary nomics' or `general Darwinian nomothetics'.  This is the
notion that fundamental physical and informational `laws' (can't really
avoid scare quotes in such a discussion) are not eternal, Platonic,
existent-even-prior-to-the-Big-Bang, but emergent.  I knew that Smolin
favoured the view that these laws, dimensionless constants, etc, get
remixed with each new budded universe, but I didn't quite expect to find
him arguing that they mutate and evolve *within* a history.

Some quotes:

`...one thing I want to communicate... doubt whether the foundations of the
world are indeed to be grasped *solely* by the discovery of a perfect and
eternal mathematical law...  we are beginning to see evidence of an
alternative view... [fundamental order and regularity] might have arisen...
through a process of self-organisation, by means of which the world has
evolved over time to become intricately structured...  I myself rejected
such ideas when I first encountered them.' (p. 15)

`...I hope to convince the reader that the desire to understand the world
in terms of a naive and radical atomism in which elementary particles carry
forever fixed properties, independent of the history or shape of the
universe, perpetuates a now archaic view of the world.' (p. 18)

Of course he's not talking talking about the phase changes and uncouplings
at symmetry breaking or anything so simple.

I have to say that this perspective troubles me deeply.  It smacks of what
I call `black holism'.  But Smolin is one of the smart cookies, and I'm
looking forward to the rest of his book once I get off the phone...

A few days ago I posted a note to the effect that we are now have the
technology to alter the human germ line. And in the following days all I
see are nutso posts or posts that rely on science that won't become
available for decades if not centuries. Yet here we have a technology that
would allow us TODAY to create human beings (??) that would have natural
lifespans of 100s (1000s???) of years (presuming inserting the appropriate
antioxidant genes into the human genome will work the same as experiments
like those on fruit flies). Not only that, but as our knowledge grows to
gradually create completely new species of humans. Yet no-one seems
interested about this. I am happy to admit that my posts are no where as
cleanly written as say Sandberg or Feynman, but I am not willing to accept
that this is not as important a development as I know it to be. Perhaps
Perry M. is right and this list has declined to the point that people are

        In the same effect, however, any person in any country could
properly be regarded as "under attack," although I agree that certain

        Perhaps "unobtrusive" wasn't the best word I could use.  What I
meant to say was to not be obtrusive about the fact that one is gay.  Not
to make a big deal out of the fact.  Just as another person will treat his
heterosexuality as "normal," so too should a homosexual treat his
homosexuality as "normal."  I hold tight to my views that whether John is
sleeping with Michael, Sheila or both, it should have little effect on
John's ability as a worker.

I agree. The Physics of Immortality is a very fine book, but if Tipler had a 
good editor who dumped the historical religious mumbo jumbo, the result would 
be a great book that was 30% thinner.

In other words the Mandelbrot Set is consistent with the axioms of 
mathematics, the axioms themselves have no proof but they just seem so true 
they must be, I mean, they're really obvious, as obviously true as the nature 
of reality is transparent.

I talked about consistency because that's as precise and objective a concept 
as any known, truth on the other hand is as murky as reality. I also find  
there is very often a disturbing circular element. What is truth? That which 
is (exists). What is existence? That which is true.  

I can't explain what truth is without using the idea of consistency, and 
I can't use the verb "to be" either because that implies existence and 
existence is what I'm trying to define. All these restrictions are too much 
for me, that's why I don't talk about truth.

This will be news to the many longevity researchers who still see extending
life as a hard problem! Even Michael Rose (he of the long-lived fruit
flies) doesn't see this as something we can do today. Why, exactly, do you
believe we can TODAY create humans with multi-century lifespans. It seems
to me that the fruit fly research cannot be applied to humans. We have no
idea which genes in humans (if any -- no genetic theory of aging has been
proven) would allow us to live longer.

Germ-line technology, even if available in full-blown form today, would
have
very little effect on the future, because human generations are long. If
the
technology were availaable now, the first modified humans would not be
adults until about 2017. There is no benefit to MY gene progeny until
my grandkids are born, starting in ten years or so with worthwhile
results in the years after 2030. However, because of the very long
intergeneratin time in humans, we will not have fully developed this
technology by then. By the time there is any impact, we will have
developed other technologies that will render the human body, and
possibly humanity, obsolete. At an absolute minimum, we will have
developed somatic-cell replacement and/or modification schemes. These
will be useful to me personally, not just to my grandchildren.

Take a look again. Titles, international conferences, papers and
claims of experimental evidence does not prove that an area is
credible (I have encountered an international conference on the ether
theory earlier this year). One has to look more carefully at how they
argue their case: Have their experiments been replicated? Do they
have a consistent theory? Do they take other possibilities into
account?

This is of course hard; an expert can often with a single glance tell
if a field is worthless or worthwhile (unfortunately most experts
just rely on single glances; sometimes they are wrong) but if you are
less knowledgeable you have to look more carefully. I usually look at
their terminology: if they seem to make up new words and concepts at
a drop of a hat, use terminology in non-standard ways or use math for
its own sake, then I get suspicious.

Yes, this is true. But serious researchers do not complain a lot
about this, unlike the crackpots. One of the easiest ways of
detecting pseudoscience is to look for claims that the theory is
being suppressed or resisted by the establishment. Real scientists
don't waste the paper complaining, they try to show so good evidence
and proof that the establishment will be forced to accept them. 

A good example is a professor here in Stockholm, who is claiming the
current model of how the heart pumps the blood is quite wrong (to put
it simply, the heard doesn't squeeze the blood, it "grips" the
blood). Needless to say, the Lancet and the "establishment" doesn't
believe him. So he has been gathering evidence, convincing other
researchers and slowly been building his case despite the resistance
of all the people who think he is wrong. At present his theory is
becoming more and more accepted as people start to look at their data
again, and sooner or later the textbooks will likely be quietly
rewritten (he is also making some money from a new kind of pump he
has invented, based on his heart model). A crackpot would instead
have spent a lot of energy shouting about how ortodox science
represses new ideas.

No need for that. There are plenty of people out there despairing for

And yet the standard definition of "consistency" is in terms of 
"truth"! (P is consistent iff there is a model in which P is true.) I 
Suspect you find the notion of model-relative truth unproblematic as 
opposed to the notion of truth, simpiciter.

How does the Tarski definition of truth involve the idea of 
consitency? (For those who don't know, the basic idea behind Tarski's 
celebrated definition of truth is that:

	The sentence "Snow is white." is true if and only if snow is white. 
	Etc.

Ingenious! Before: A sentence including the word "truth". After: a 
sentence not including the word "truth"(or true)  but with exactly 
the same meaning as the former sentence. Result: a successful 
contextual definition of the word "truth" has been given.)

It might be that there are several "islands" where complex systems
can evolve. The interesting question is if there is just a finite
number of islands that allow complex universes, or if there are an
infinity of them. It would also be interesting to see which of them
were "isomorphic" in some sense to each other.

A good point.  Complicated by the premise that the "researcher" is supposedly
attempting to attract funds for research and development for his new
technology and feels he is being shut out by "vested interests".

It's hard for me to sort out.  When I was but a young lad...out on the dusty
plains of West Texas...I KNEW...I was absolutely convinced...that Rockets,
Computers,Ray Guns, etc. etc. were in the near future.  Now...many years
later...all my expectations have been realized (in a manner of
speaking)...Yet at the time all of my aquaintances and elders were skeptical
in the extreme (Bible Belt Mentality)...

They were wrong then....are they wrong now?

As an aside.  Please evaluate Dr. Eugene Mallow's "Cold Fusion" crowd...as
I've mentioned...I've surfed their websites...read some of their
magazines...and they appear no more difficult to beleive than Penrose, Von
Neuman, Hawkings or Al Gore.

I'm not sure how fundamental the question is about whether there is only
a finite number of possible "islands".  Given that we are dealing with
a parameter space where the parameters are real numbers, even a single
tiny island may admit an infinite number of possible sets of parameters.
Would there be some inherent quantization of parameters such that
changing the mass of an electron by a sufficiently small amount would
make literally zero difference?  Maybe if you consider
delta E * delta T > hbar, then if delta E were small enough that delta T
would have to be longer than the age of the universe, this would be true.

It also seems possible (despite what I said earlier) that only a limited
range of possible parameter values will admit life.  Maybe the mass
of the electron could be large enough that there are no atoms, and we
could still have life in other forms, but could it be infinitely large?
Could all parameters increase without limit?  Seemingly the only way
there could be an infinite number of islands would be if the set of
legal parameters included (virtually) infinite values.

When I scolded that we should never underestimate the normative weight of
the "real," I had more in mind than this truism -- tho' you're definitely
in the ballpark.  My point -- and I think it is a stronger point -- is
that there is a constellation of "magic" words whose function seems to be
little more than to "block the road of inquiry."  These are the words
"Right," "Good," "Beautiful," "True," and most of all, "Natural" -- and of
course I mean these words in their perverse Philosophical as opposed to
their everyday usages (hence the initial capitals).  All my life I've been
accused of expressing unnatural desires -- from confident prepubescent
assertions that I would live forever because I would scoop out my brain
and plop it into a robot body -- to later assertions about an abiding love
of a boyfriend -- to later still insistences on ethical vegetarianism.  My
answer has always been the same: just how can anything that occurs in
nature properly be called "unnatural"?  But the riposte never seems to
stick, because these magic words aren't *about* referential adequacy.
They attach to descriptions of the world precisely to make the
descriptions immune from criticism.  John Stuart Mill's question goes
right to the heart of the matter: "[W]as there ever any domination which
did not appear natural to those who possessed it?"  The observation is
from his _Subjection of Women_, 1869.  Best, Dale

Really?  You go away when you stop believing in yourself?  How
curious.  That never happens to me.  (I am here distinguishing
myself -- the whole thing, body and all -- from my ego, the reality
and existence of which is a matter of dispute in some circles.)

Yes, but their continued existence is causally dependent on properties
of Homo sap. nervous systems in a way that the existence of the
Virgo Cluster is not, at least under the metaphysics I'm entertaining
at the moment.  Mind you, I'm talking about Church and State, and
*not* about the members of the Church and the employees of the
State, which are quite real subsets of Homo sap. delineated from
the other Homo saps by these curious evanescent capitalized things.

Yes. But in that case he won't complain, instead he will hype his
research, use plenty of buzzwords ("java based connectionist agents
in intranets") and warn that the japanese are doing the same
research. 

Real scientists get their chance to get even once they got their
Nobel prize, Fields medal or whatever - they can spend all day
telling their awed audience the hardships they had to suffer to
discover their great discovery, how science policy should really
work, and immortalize their old nemesis with some witty remark. :-)

I have not had the time (and will not have the time) to seriously
evaluate them. I'm fairly sceptical, for the simple reason that they
have not produced any truly noticeable demonstrations. If they really
are on to something, it would be easy for them to produce some
dramatic effect showing that significant energy is produced ("do this
and the lab explodes") that would convince even the sceptics. So far
it has been very quiet; as far as I know no papers published in the
major journals, no wild press releases (in itself a good sign). But
this is just a quick impression, I haven't followed the field at all.

"A swarm of suveillance mites slowly descends from the sky ... they
assemble and process the information into a detailed picture of the
state of the atmosphere".

So begins Ivars Peterson's story in the July 26, 1997 issue of SCIENCE
NEWS called "From Microdevice to Smart Dust: Learning to Build,
Program, and Control Multitudes of Interacting Micromachines".

The article is based primarily on the work of Andrew Berlin at Xerox
PARC and Kaigham Gabriel of DARPA reported in the Jan-Mar 97 IEEE
COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, but Peterson adds some additional
cites:

"the technology necessary for constructing a 'smart dust particle' may
be within reach in 5 years, says Berlin."

"By merging sensing and actuation with computation and communication,
MEMS [microelectriomechanical systems] devices can be distributed
throughout the environment, coated on surfaces, or embedded within
everyday objects to create distributed systems for sensing, reasoning
about, and responding to events in the physical world on a scale never
before possible", wrote Berlin & Gabriel in their IEEE article.

Peterson mentions "one potential application is a paper mover" and
micromanipulation assembly lines for electronics and biological
research.

"At Stanford University, Gregory T.A. Kovacs and John W. Suh have
fabricated cilliary arrays in which each microscopic actuator looks
like the tail of a fish.... Four actuators, arranged in a cross with
tails pointing away from the center, work together a a unit, or motion
pixel....

"Donald and Karl F. Bohringer ofd the University of Calif., Berkeley
have developed what they call the theory of programmable force fields
to model the actions of cilliary arrays.... Peter Will and his
colleagues at the Information Sciences Institute of [UCLA] have
adopted a similar approach....

"'How do you program a cloud of dust?' Berlin asks. Should all the
smart dust particles run the same program, or should they specialize?
How do units synchronize their activities when they are in motion
relative to each other and spread over large distances? How can
communication be established and maintained in such a system? How can
it build a global view of a situation using many small pieces of
information that are gathered in different places at different times. 
'There are alot of hard problems here', Berlin says."

IMO, these are many of the same hard problems that must be solved for
AI and nanotechnology. MEMS seem to be a practical, near-term test bed
for experimenting on some of these problems.

The name comes from Hugh Everett, best known for the Everett, or many worlds  
interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Everett has been dead for many years now,  
at least in this universe. He was disappointed at the poor reception his 
theory received and lost interest in Quantum Mechanics, he spent most of his 
life writing nuclear war games for The Pentagon. In his youth Everett was 
interested in the philosophical aspects of Quantum Mechanics and in the last 
few years his theory has increased in popularity. 

Quantum Mechanics has been more successful, over a wider range of conditions 
than any theory I know of, but it has always suffered from philosophical 
problems. Is that a wave or a particle?  In what direction is that photon 
polarized? The standard Copenhagen  interpretation, believed by most 
Physicists, is that nothing is anything  until a measurement is made and the 
wave function collapses.  If you decide to use a photographic plate, an 
electron is a particle.  If you decide to use an interferometer, an electron 
is a wave.  This works fine except its a bit vague about what a measurement 
is  and who is taking the measurement. Are Human Beings the only ones able  
to make an observation and change a potential reality into a actual one? 
What about a chimp, or a dog, or a bug?                

In 1957 Hugh Everett solved the measurement problem but at a very high price, 
too high most thought. He said that when any particle undergoes the smallest 
detectable change ( a quantum jump ) the entire universe, including you the 
observer, duplicates itself and splits in two, but we have (almost) no way
of communicating with the other universe. If true this would mean there is an 
infinite number (some say just an astronomical number) of universes. 

Many universes would differ from this one in only one tiny detail, but some 
would be very different. Even EXTREMELY unlikely events would happen in one 
of them. In one I was just elected The Pope, in another I graduated from 
Ringling Brothers Clown Collage, and in yet another one all the molecules of 
air diffused by chance to the  other side of the room as I type this and I 
suffocate.
 
Today David Deutsch is probably the leading advocate of Everett's ideas. In 
response to critics who say the theory is untestable he maintains that an  
intelligent  quantum computer could detect these worlds, if they are there. 
 
A conscious quantum computer shoots electrons at a metal plate that has  
2 small slits in it. It does this one at a time. After leaving the plate the  
electrons hit some photographic film, but do not look at the photograph until  
later.  The quantum mind has detectors near each slit so it knows which slit 
the various electrons went through. The quantum mind now signs a document
saying that it has observed  each and every electron and knows what slit each 
electron went through.  It is very important that the document does NOT say 
which slit the electron  went through, it only says that they went through 
one slit only, and the mind has knowledge of which one. Now the mind uses 
quantum erasure to completely destroy his memory of the experiment. The only 
part remaining is the document.  Now look at the photographic plate. If you 
see interference bands then the  many world interpretation is correct. If you 
do not see interference bands then there are no worlds but this one and the 
conventional interpretation is correct.  In the Copenhagen interpretation
when the results of a measurement enters the  consciousness of an observer 
the wave function collapses, in effect all the universes except one disappear, 
so you get no interference. In the many  worlds model all the other worlds 
still exist in parallel and will converge and interfere with each other when
the electrons hit the photographic film.
 
Deutsch thinks an experiment like this will actually be performed in the 
first half of the next century. The reason it is so difficult is that the  
conventional view says that conscious observers obey different laws of  
physics, many worlds says they do not. To test who is right we need a mind  
that uses quantum properties. 
 
It will not be easy to erase memories completely with nothing leaking out to  
the rest of the universe, but recent developments suggest that it may be  
possible. This sort of quantum isolation would not just be needed to test  
many worlds, it would be essential if you want to make a quantum computer .

Think about this...

If you wanted to see a universe where I didn't write this post, you would
have to change a few things:

-- Me wanting to send the post - All that behavioural stuff in my brain that
made me want to reply to your post, which would mean...

-- Changing my environment - To make me make a different decision you would
have to change my environment, including every person I have ever come in
contact with.

-- Changing their environment - You would have to change the environment of
every person I came into contact with, which would mean changing all the
people they have come into contact with...

[changing people, animals, plants and various sea life for a very long time]

-- Eventually you'd be back at the start of space/time, changing the very
first glimmer of movement.

Of course, that's if there is a start.  If there is a start, then because
there could be no cause for any one effect, every possibility must have
happened.  This gives you infinite universes, not one of which is remotely
similar to our own (Which IMO makes them far more interesting).  As per
usual, I could be wrong.

Enjoyed your post, but on the other side, pace Arendt, isn't defending

Judging by the woman, she has no problem feeding herself.  However, before
she eats the food she would no doubt thank god.  Just as so many people
"thank god for being alive" instead of the surgeon.

I have oftened wondered why the belief that everything good is God's work and
everything bad is your own doing leads to a feeling of superiority.  There's
some weird psychology going on in the heads of these people.  Unfortunately
for us, they represent a large majority which holds us back.  It's a real
shame to see potential computing power go to waste!

Huh? How does this follow? We have had the technology to alter the
human germ line for several years by now as far as I know (the point
is that nobody did it/was allowed to), but that doesn't mean we know
how to do many useful alterations. 

Adding antioxidant genes might be a good start. Another is promoting
more DNA repair (expensive in nature, we can afford it), which would
decrease the risk for cancer. More in the future things like (say) 
linking the telomerase gene with an artificial promotor so that you
can activate it by an injection of a drug, lengthening your telomeres
under medical supervision.

New species are not a goal per se; what would we (or they) use them
for? Here is a simple way of creating homo sapiens secundus: use the
established methods to create an extra chromosome (let us call it the
Z chromosome), moving some genes from other chromosomes to it so that
an individual with the Z would not survive without it. Presto, we
have a new species which cannot interbreed with ordinary homo
sapiens. (Actually, the Z can be useful to carry all the new stuff,
comments, personal data etc).

Perhaps. But it might also be that we are so used to dramatic

This should test the many-worlds hypothesis vs the Copenhagen interpretation
that it's a *concious* observer that collapses the wave function.  However,
it does not test many-worlds against other theories in which someting other
than a concious observer collapses the wave function.  In those cases whether
the plate shows interference will depend on whether the quantum observer
causes a wave function collapse.

I'll throw in my own personal (and unsubstantiated) hypothesis for wave
function collapse as an example.  I believe that wave function collapse
occurs when the quantum wave function would create a paradox.  Some
calculations for quantum behavior include considering particles travelling
backwards in time (Hawking's black hole radiation).  With time travel,
paradoxes are easy to cook up, so this is plausible to me.  As to why the
wave function collapses in a particular way, I have no idea.

Anyway, by this hypothesis, conciousness does not by definition require the
ability to collapse wave functions.  Perhaps conciousness involves so much
feedback that a conciousness cannot observe without collapsing a waveform.
 In this case the quantum conciousness would not be able to perform the
required action of observing and signing while remaining in superimposed
states.  If it were capable, then after erasure the photon would remain
un"observed" and you would indeed still see an interference pattern.  So in
this case at least my hypothesis produces the same prediction as many-worlds.

P.S. I'm sure somebody else has published on this hypothesis.  I seem unable
to come up with genuinely new ideas, although I frequently develop the same
ideas as other people without seeing their work.  Chalk it up to the theory
that memes are formed mostly by the chance interaction of other memes rather
than by directed search on the part of human minds.

Hmm, maybe what we need is more something like a "deniabilizer",
which makes a message deniable ("No, I have *never* sent anything

I like to describe it in a slightly different way, which may not be exactly
consistent with Everett's argument but makes the essential insight clearer.

Normally, QM has two rules: one which describes the evolution of the
wave function over time under normal conditions, and the other, the
collapse phenomenon, which only occurs under poorly-defined measurement
conditions.  Everett's real point is simply to take ordinary QM and remove
wave function collapse.  What you find, surprisingly, is that when QM
phenomena are measured, the measuring device goes into a superposition
of states in which it displays all the possible measurements.  However
these states are decohered to the extent that they have essentially no
interaction with each other.  Therefore you can think of it as though
the measuring device (and the surrounding macroscopic universe) has now
been split into multiple parallel versions.

The point of this interpretation is not simply to say that the universe
splits when measurements occur.  It is to say, let's investigate what the
world would be like if wave function collapse didn't occur.  And it turns
out, when you work out the details, that you get this effect which is
very much like a universe splitting.  And further, given that the various
disconnected parts of the wave function don't interact, what observers
seem to see is wave function collapse.

So by taking out wave function collapse, we get a universe in which wave
function collapse is observed to occur.  Hence the two theories make the
same predictions, but Everett's has one less postulate.  By Occam's razor
it should be preferred.  (This is actually a bit of an oversimplification,
since Everett has to make some mathematical assumptions to make his
"apparent" wave function collapse have just the right probabilities,
and so the razor argument is not that strong.)

I like this way of looking at it better than just saying that the universe
splits on quantum events.  The latter is really a deduction of the theory,
rather than a premise.  And further, it is not a precise statement of
the circumstances described by the theory, which speaks in terms of
wave function components which are decoherent.  Sometimes you'll hear
challenges like "Everett's theory is inconsistent with relativity, because
the whole universe changes instantaneously when a measurement occurs."
I think it is more useful to ask, "how does the quantum state function
change when a measurement-like interaction occurs, given the constraints
of relativity?"

Also, as I have described it, this is more than an "interpretation" of
QM.  It is actually a different theory, with different (arguably simpler)
premises.  It makes basically the same predictions, except that regular
QM has this sort of blind spot surrounding measurement interactions.
However, when measurements get so precise that complicated quantum
interactions are relevant, and the complex predictions of wave function
evolution would contradict a simplistic wave function collapse picture,
you can be sure that conventional QM will follow the Hamiltonian evolution
process.

I don't believe that Deutsch's thought experiment will truly be seen as
resolving the issue.  Rather, everyone will agree on what this computer
will do.  Some people may maintain though that the experiment does not
prove the existence of true parallel Everett worlds, any more than
quantum computers do.  Rather, the phenomenon will be seen as an artifact
of the special characteristics of the quantum AI.

I'd like to stick to the term "prejudice".  When debating such a theory, I
would definately use the better sounding terms.  But here, among family, I
would like to admit that there are theories that I don't want to spend the

I have solid, rational support for my all my scientific prejudices.  but
once I have built up my heuristics (i.e. stereotypes), I want to use them

John K Clark <johnkc@well.com> gave a great summary of the everett
interpretation...

	As you know, from our previous discussions with the subject:
"upload", I'm very much interested in studying conscious perception
and it's philosophical implications.  This subject obviously overlaps
in this area of quantum "collapsing wave functions" by conscious
perception or whatever.  I've always had many questions about some of
this that I've always wanted to ask of an expert like you on this
topic.  Perhaps you (or anyone) can help me out a bit with answers to
some of these?

	You described the experiment:

> A conscious quantum computer shoots electrons at a metal plate that
> has 2 small slits in it.

	First off, could you define what this "conscious quantum
computer" is and is not?  In particular, how must it sense and
represent information?

> The quantum mind has detectors near each slit so it knows which slit
> the various electrons went through.

	As we discussed before in the other thread, when WE
consciously "detect" things, it is done via a complex cause and effect
sensing process that ultimately results in a conscious model or
awareness of the event sensed in our brain or conscious mind.  Our
conscious sensing mechanism could be spofed by something like
directly stimulating the optic nerve producing an indistinguishable
conscious awareness, even though the awareness was of nothing real and
we, in fact, might not have an eye or sensor at all.

	Please describe what you mean by "The quantum mind has
detectors..."  How must this perception process work?  Could the
causal connection between the "detectors" and the conscious
representations in this "quantum computer" be similarly spofed in an
indistinguishable way as our conscious perception process can be?  In
other words would it work if you, in fact, had no sensors, but feed
the identical information that would have come from the sensors to the
quantum consciousness?

> In the Copenhagen interpretation when the results of a measurement
> enters the consciousness of an observer the wave function collapses,
> in effect all the universes except one disappear, so you get no
> interference.

	So, if I removed my eyes, cutting the optic nerves, (rendering
me blind yet keeping them operational) and configured them to sense
such an event and I recorded the data coming from the optic nerve of
these removed eyes and never consciously observed this data for many
years... then I created a virtual reality simulation of the experiment
in the distant future which directly stimulated my optic nerve that
was long ago separated from the eyes with the recorded data in such a
way that the data going to my consciousness was indistinguishable to
what would have gone to my consciousness at the time of the actual
experiment had I not cut the optic nerves before they observed the
event...  what would happen?  Would the wave function of this event
not collapse until I consciously represented the event in my mind many
years in the future?  Can you see the problem I have with all this?  I
find such extreme enduring "superimposed states" all very absurd.

	Why is it that the representational nature of our
consciousness and the completely separate and arbitrary relationship
between what our "detectors" detect and the awareness that eventually
causally results always completely left out of any of this kind of
reasoning about consciousness collapsing of quantaum waves in spite of
it's critical importance to this topic?  It's as if everyone that
talks about this has never thought or read about what the perception
process is or must be and I find it all troubling and very hard to
swallow.

	Surely any old physical "macro" event, any computer (quantum
or not) that records and represents the information, or even the
information traveling up the optic nerve or a rod or cone neuronn in
the retina firring... can do just as much to "collapse" a wave as
phenomenal conscious representations can.  Occam's razor says this
must be true.  What reason is there for attributing the collapse to
something causally so far away from and so arbitrarily associated with
the actual quantum event being "detected"?

***** In my point of view (and in lots of mathematics' too) the set 
of axioms that are the basis of a theory, do not need even to seem 
true. The mathematical concept of "truth" just appears after (and  
based on) the existence of the axioms... For example, being 
formal, the Euclidean or Riemmanian Geometries do not need to having 
anything to do with truth or reality. Just with its own axioms... 
Just a comment.

***** But if we consider as one of the axioms of the universe that  
the universe is real, we could begin to think what would be the other 
minimal set of axioms (consistent with the existence, at least, 
of what would continue on existing if, for example, all the 
mankind would die...). After that we could try to define what is 
real and true, or not....  in other case I think we will be 
rationally lost and will begin to inventing mathematical religions...

I think it would be more correct to say that the act of measuring causes
the wave function collapse.  I don't think the Copenhagen interpretation
itself says anything specific about consciousness.  Neither is any attempt
made to define what exactly an act of measurement is.

Some other physicists (I think Eugene Wigner is one of the main ones) have
suggested the idea that consciousness is primary in inducing collapse.

A good experiment to keep in mind is the two slit interference experiment,
where measures are added to see which slot the particle goes through.
When this is done, coherence is lost and the interference pattern goes
away.  This happens independent of whether or not anybody actually looks
at the measurements of which slit was used.  This seems inconsistent with
the notion that consciousness collapses the wave function.

Subsumption architectures generate an emergent swarm behavior. Genetic
algorithms can also operate on the subsumptive program itself.

 Berlin asks.

Via cellular automata-style interaction with nearest neighbors, perhaps
overridden with acoustic SIMD or global instructions. In any case, one
has to forego absolute, deterministic control.

Yes it certainly is, but one problem with MEMS is high defect and 
failure rates, with the 'dust' for example.

mean that people didn't read it and think about it. It is not
possible to keep up with everything. I only read maybe 30% of the

I disagree. The evolution would simple be in a different direction, probably
a much less interesting one.

I am trying to locate an essay presented in about 1897 on the closure 
of the Amercan frontier and its implication (not good) on the future 
course of society. For all of human history there has been the frontier,
except for the last century or so.
IMHO, we badly need a physical frontier again, 
which of course is the Universe.

Absolutely.  One is never only or even necessarily importantly one's race,
sex, orientation, age, or what have you, *however* so long as some such
attribute has been singled out for the bullying attention of an otherwise
more or less civilized polity, it is worse than futile for any individual
to whom that attribute can be ascribed to insist that there is more to
them *than* the attribute.  Of course there is.  That precisely this
attribute has been so singled out is the problem at issue in the first
place.  Unpopular minorities that so describe themselves are not seeking
to perpetuate some special status but to recognize the existence and
extent of an irrational prejudice.  What is wanted by unpopular minorities
is rarely special rights but an end to special abuses.  Best, Dale

God said 'exterminate them Injuns', and it was good.
I think these kind of doctrines are an afterthought, or gilding over of 
primal imperative.

Well, this is what I get for replying to email in reverse order. This sounds

Extrpoic theory.

The SPA corridor indeed has a plasma core, but the purpose is to create a 
partially evacuated flight path for projectiles launched from the 
surface. The plasma is somewhat sheathed by neutral gas. I didn't look in detail 
at its electronic efffects on the ionosphere, maybe someone should.
There is somethng of a "hole" in the ionosphere at the pole, south of 
the Auroral Light (where electrons and ions entrained in Earth's magnetic
field hit the upper atmosphere) affording a reduced particle density.
I think there would be a quasi-static stabilization of Earth-to-space 
current after the corridor is established, probably near zero amps. If this
doesn't occur naturally, it might be assisted by electrically isolating the
launch facility, charging the projectiles, etc.
You might also want to check out the HAARP website, I think that instrument is 
capable of constructing a plasma corridor, possible reaching to the surface, or
to a tower.

Thank you, Mr Genen, for confirming that you received it.
But have you anything to add?

Dear fellow Extropians:

It was an interesting parable.
It was simplistic rather than simple.
There is much more to economics -- particularly social economics -- than
most people are aware of.
Rather than attempt to comment in brief I suggest you start by reading the
works of Hazel Henderson.

Well...let me give you my take on that.  I call it stereotypical
response...response to stereotypes.

Now stereotypical response is a survival characteristic.  It was for me while
participating in the South East Asian War Games....It was for ancesteroral
man when confronted by a hairy, toothy critter with claws and an evil
disposition...It STILL is for me today...(deceptive camoflauge...I'll touch
on that later)

Now I LIKE Gays...I wish there were more of them...because for every gay man
that means there is less competetion for me in my search for  a compatable
lady.  And I must philosophicaly agree with Lesbians...we both like the same
thing.

However :  Many times when I have to drive thru a big city  late at night
there will be a car pull up beside me while traveling down the freeway...the
dome light will come on and there will be a guy jerking off...sometimes he
will then pull in front of me and hit his brakes...trying to get me to pull
over.(Once a cop saw this happen, he pulled us both over..got my story of
what  happened and sent me on my way...no doubt there's a story about "Mean
cop molesting poor Gay Man" circulating over that)

I no longer listen to the CB radio....there always seems to be someone on
there with a pronounced lisp...the dominate word is "Cum-Cum"...

Once when I put an "ad" on a computer dating service I was overwhelmed by
responses from gay men...even though my ad was in the "men seeking women"
category.

Prior to "deceptive camoflauge"..many times when walking from my truck to the
Resturant in a Truck Stop I would be acosted by Queers...After the second or
third time of having to knot a head to get him to leave me alone I decided
something had to be done.

That someting was "deceptive camoflauge"...I now weigh 260lbs...(result of
concentration curls and budweiser curls"...have full beard and long
hair...dress all in black, wear wrap-around sunglasses...heavy
boots...leather biker headscarve...smoke nasty ceeegars...carry what appear
to be various weapons...and don't smile much....the queers leave me
alone.(the laptop computer under my arm kinda spoils the picture...I'm
working on that)

The gays around truck-stops and trucks behave in such a way as to evoke a
sterotype.  That is the truckers see how the gays they encounter behave and
stereotypicaly assign that behavior to all gays.

The gays around the truck-stops see me dressed as the stereotypical
pyschopathic, killer biker...with weapons yet...and they assume a
stereotype...after all gays are kind,gentle and loving....they would want
nothing to do with such as I.....right?

The point I'm making is that perhaps the societal response to "Gays" is self
inflicted...you're not going to change stereotypical response...it's genetic
and still too useful...so change your stereo type.  You need better PR. 

And the Maplethorpe exhibit...the attack on the Catholic Church in San
Francisco , conspicious displays of affection between men in public, and
other "in your face"...consciousness raising....tactics ain't it.

(unfortunately...what runs off cruising gays also runs off potentially
compatable wome....oh well...guess being a bachelor ain't so bad)

I assume the reference is to SHIVA DESCENDING, one of the first of the
current flood of `hammeroid' novels and made-for-TVs and Spielbergs...
It's a 1980 `the asteroid is coming!' collaboration between Prof Gregory
Benford (and you can't get harder than *that*) and sf fan artist and genial
porno film maker Bill Rotsler (and you can't get harder than *that*,
either).   There are plenty of doubts, though, over whether it's any good.

I agree with E.Shaun's remarks about Gays and other groups that
"just want to be accepted."  Identifying themselves *as* a group
is, to some extent, counterproductive.

To the frequent refrain "Why should I be the only one not allowed
to mention my love life?  Why should I live a lie?", I say, false
dichotomy!  There's a difference between mentioning one's chosen
partner, in context, and wearing a flag.

Most of my (male) "queer" friends don't go to the parades, don't wear
leather caps, ... any more than I dress as an atheist, whatever that
might mean.  It's just something one does, or doesn't.

Natasha said gay pride has become (forgive me if I mis-paraphrase)
an expression of individualism.  Around here, I think it's more the
opposite: anyone visibly gay is presumed socialist.

Why one should seize on a matter of taste as the essence of one's
identity, I may never understand (though I did suffer some ridicule
as a long-haired boy).

Everybody wants to be a victim.  And the paradox is that victim status
accrues precisely to those who can acquire enough clout to make others
afraid of them.  Victimhood has become one of the fruits of power.
Anyone can be an underdog; the trick is to be a registered, pedigreed
underdog.  ---Joseph Belloc Sobran

: Abraham Moses Genen
: [...]  I firmly believe that government does a lot of good

(we're still waiting for a specific example)

: and is quite capable of doing a lot more good than it does. It would
: certainly work a lot better if we would all put our egos in our back
: pockets and let those of us who have spent a lifetime studying and working
: at our chosen careers in professional government service trying to do our
: jobs despite the continuous interference of well meaning dilettants and a
: herd of politically and ideologically fixated ignoramusus who know little
: or nothing about governmental operations except how to gum up the works
: with unnecessary regulations and other bothersome clap-trap.

The private sector does a lot of good - some say literally all the good
in the world.  It could do a lot more good if it weren't hobbled at
every turn by the (let's charitably assume) well-meaning interference
of the professional busybodies who claim to know our jobs (and our needs)
better than we do, though they never in their lives have to face a paying
customer who can say no.

The people who criticize government are not "interfering", we're the
boss - or so we were taught in public school.  We're not "dilettanti",
we're the ones whose livelihoods keep being whittled away by professionals
like you (more deserving of the title "dilettanti", because you'll never
feel the effects of your interference).  We're the ones who pay for your
COLA and your pension (before we're allowed to try to provide for
ourselves).  We're the ones whose presumed consent gives the whole
house of cards its legitimacy - or so we were taught in public school.
We're the "ignoramus" who get blamed for voting, by an exquisite chain
of indirection, for the policies you enact.

: For those of you who have wonderful theories on how to improve government
: let us see how they can be implimented for the broad common good. ...

"How do you replace cancer?" (Neil Smith)

Perhaps you haven't heard that there used to be a country called
the United States of America, whose Constitution contained a clause
limiting its powers to a short list explicitly delegated to it.
It's said to have worked pretty well overall, so well that it
attracted millions of immigrants from countries whose governments
took a more active interest in all those things you say a government
should.

Or at least that's what I was told in public school.
No doubt you have more advanced information.

A government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough
to take everything you have.  -- Barry Goldwater

A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the
support of Paul. -- George Bernard Shaw

A legal order that is subject to the influence of public opinion, and
that evolves according to the application of the liberal principles of
openness to human interaction, can be said to be democratic, no matter
what its form of government.  Democracy should not privilege what
people *say* they want in the very imperfect mode of communication we
call voting, over what they indicate they want in other ways, by their
actions and their other communicative efforts. It should not privilege
explicit, conscious action by a single institution that is supposed to
`speak for' the public, over the tacit, distributed wisdom that is
embedded in our evolved legal rules.  -- Don Lavoie 1992

A politician normally prospers under democracy in proportion ... as he
excels in the invention of imaginary perils and imaginary defenses
against them.  ---H L Mencken 1918

A world which is perfectly safe for the stupidest imaginable wanker is
a damned annoying place in which to live for anyone else.  -- Douglas
G. Henke <henke@netcom.com> in alt.peeves

After every revolution there is an interregnum, in which communities
run themselves and all is well, and then the new regime comes in and
screws things up.  ---Desmond Hawkins in _Blue Mars_ (Kim Stanley
Robinson 1995)

Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution
will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious
interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes
which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence
of the offices they hold under the State establishments . . . .  --
Publius : Federalist 01

An expert is someone who articulates the needs of those in power.  --
Henry Kissinger

Anarchy is bad *because* somebody might die or get hurt. But statism is
good *even though* many, many people die and get hurt.  ---Ken Hooper

As a rule, if you want people to love you, you shouldn't lie to them,
steal their property, corrupt their children, and drive their
businesses into the ground.  ---Lew Rockwell: "Love the Strangler?",
RRR 95/7

But extremism is such FUN!  -- Lizard

Capitalism undoubtedly has certain boils and blotches upon it, but has
it as many as government? Has it as many as marriage? Has it as many as
religion? I doubt it. It is the only basic institution of modern man
that shows any genuine health and vigor .... the only serious criticism
of capitalism comes from ladies and gentlemen who are palpably somewhat
balmy.  The trouble with all of them is that they are constructive
critics: not content to tear down, they try to build up. It is a fatal
error ...  ---H L Mencken

Common sense is the most evenly distributed quantity in the world.
Everyone thinks he has enough.  ---Ren Descartes 1637

Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man's
original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been
made, through disobedience and through rebellion.  ---Oscar Wilde

Everything government touches turns to crap.  ---Ringo Starr

Experience without theory teaches nothing.  In fact, experience can not
even be recorded unless there is some theory, however crude, that leads
to an hypothesis and a system by which to catalog observations.
Sometimes only a hunch, right or wrong, is sufficient theory to lead to
useful observation.  -- Clarence Irving Lewis & W. Edwards Deming

Extreme law is often extreme injustice.  ---Terence, _Heauton
Timoroumenos_

Fear is the foundation of most governments.  ---John Adams

For every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat,
and wrong.  ---H. L. Mencken

For the sake of the achievement of a specific political goal, it is
possible to sacrifice half mankind.  ---Mao Tse-Tung, November 1957

Freedom means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the
views of their government.  ---Hillary Rodham Clinton addressing the
U.N.'s Women's Conference in Beijing, 5 Sept 1995.

Freedom of the human personality cannot be given by society, and by its
source and nature it cannot depend upon society -- it belongs to man
himself, as a spiritual being.  And society, unless it makes
totalitarian claims, can on recognize this freedom.  This basic truth
about freedom was reflected in the doctrines of natural law, of the
rights of man, independent of the state, of freedom, not only as
freedom within society, but freedom from society with its limitless
claims on man.  ---Nicholas Berdyaev

Further, when those of a libertarian bent set out to make socialism
work better, whether by managing the activity or by their endorsement
of legislation which would modify the socialistic details, they tacitly
approve the socialistic premise and thereby abandon their own case for
the free market.  They forswear all fundamental argument against the
socialistic premise because by their actions they acknowledge that it
could be improved were they themselves framing or administering it.
"Socialism, were I its manager, wouldn't be so bad."  That, I submit,
is an emanation from the mind of a know-it-all, in words loud and clear
. . . .
The student of liberty, if he is not to get off the track, must hope
and work for the restoration of the free market and a government
restored to its principled role of keeping the peace.  Then let him
peacefully keep in character by leaving socialistic activities to those
who aren't yet aware of how little they know. Left to their own
resources, the bungling of their schemes may become apparent even to
themselves and, most certainly to libertarians who have not fallen into
this trap.  Why should libertarians absolve the socialists by becoming
a party to their unworkable measures?  ---Leonard Read, The Free Market
and Its Enemy, 1965 [pp 43-44]

Give me a fruitful error any time, full of seeds, bursting with its own
corrections.  You can keep your sterile truth for yourself.
---Vilfredo Pareto

God grant me the company of those who seek the truth, and God deliver
me from those who have found it.  -- Isaac Newton

Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of
authority.  It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was
made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions.  There
are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern.
They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters. -- Daniel
Webster

Government is a broker in pillage, and every election is a sort of
advance auction of the sale of stolen goods. -- H.L. Mencken

Government is not reason; it is not eloquence; IT IS FORCE.  Like FIRE,
it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.  -- George Washington

Government is the agent of those who are too refined to do their own
mugging.  ---Joseph Sobran

Government officials frequently view the taxpayer as a kind of
productive herd to be milked and controlled just as the ancient
slave-master presumed to control the person of his slave.  -- LeFevre,
Robert

Half the people in America work for a living; the other half vote for
it. ---William E. Simon

He alone is great and happy who requires neither to command nor to obey
in order to secure his being of some importance in the world.  ---J.W.
Von Goethe (1749-1832)

He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy
from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a
precedent that will reach to himself.  -- Thomas Paine

He who does not bellow the truth when he knows the truth makes himself
the accomplice of liars and forgers.  ---Charles Peguy

He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my
contempt.  He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him
the spinal cord would fully suffice.  ---Albert Einstein

I am interested in politics so that one day I will not have to be
interested in politics.  ---Ayn Rand

I am of the opinion that anyone in politics can rise very quickly to
the top if they are not weighed down by talent or integrity . . .  -- R
Chetwynd-Hayes

If government is legitimate, why does it need guns?  Mathematicians
don't need guns. We think *they're* legitimate. Physicists don't need
guns. Biologists don't need guns. Musicians don't need guns. Tool and
die makers don't need guns. Copy editors don't need guns.  ---Ken
Hooper <khooper@wsp1.wspice.com>

I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who endowed us with
sense, reason, and intellect had intended for us to forgo their use.
---Galileo

I don't practice what I preach, because I'm not the kind of person I'm
preaching to.  -- J R "Bob" Dobbs

I have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more
efficient, for I mean to reduce its size.  I do not undertake to
promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom. My aim is not to pass
laws, but to repeal them.  It is not to inaugurate new programs, but to
cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution, or that have
failed in their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted
financial burden.  I will not attempt to discover whether legislation
is `needed' before I have first determined whether it is
constitutionally permissible.  And if I should later be attacked for
neglecting my constituents' `interests,' I shall reply that I was
informed their main interest is liberty and that in that cause I am
doing the very best that I can.  -- Barry Goldwater : 1960

I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any
party of men whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics or in
anything else, where I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an
addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. If I could
not go to Heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all.
---Thomas Jefferson

I sit on a man's back, choking him and making him carry me and yet
assure others that I am sorry for him and wish to ease his lot by all
possible means--except by getting off his back.  ---Leo Tolstoy

I want no heaven for which I must give my reason; No happiness in
exchange for my liberty; and no immortality that demands the surrender
of my individuality.  ---Ingersoll

I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.  On this
subject I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation.
No!  No!  Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm;
tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher;
tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into
which it has fallen; but urge me not to use moderation.  ---William
Lloyd Garrison: The Liberator, 1831

I would rather live in a society which treated children as adults than
one which treated adults as children.  ---Lizard

If all else fails, immortality can always be assured by spectacular
error.  -- John Kenneth Galbraith

If Big Brother comes to America, he will not be a fearsome, foreboding
figure with a heart-chilling, omnipresent glare as in _1984_.  He will
come with a smile on his face, a quip on his lips, a wave to the crowd,
and a press that (a) dutifully reports the suppressive measures he is
taking to save the nation from internal chaos and foreign threat; and
(b) gingerly questions whether he will be able to succeed.  ---Michael
Parenti, _Inventing_Reality_ (1986)

If by `anarchy' you mean chaos and disorder, that's the exact opposite
of what I want.  I'm for self-government, which means people  governing
their own lives and not trying to govern yours, and  everyone taking
more responsibility for themselves.  It's been shown time and time
again that that's the way to have the maximum of harmony and abundance
in society.  Actually, it is those who call for more political
government - with all its violence and coercion - who are leading us in
the direction of chaos and disorder.  -- Steve Smith

If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect.
-- BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93, regarding failed raid attempt in
Texas

If I am to study Russian Roulette, let me start with blanks. -- Hara Ra

If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the
conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life as from
that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the simoom,
which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are
suffocated, for fear I should get some his good done to me, some of its
virus mingled with my blood.  ---Henry Thoreau "Walden" Chapter 1

If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as
a nail.  -- Abraham Maslow

If we look at the black record of mass murder, exploitation, and
tyranny levied on society by governments over the ages, we need not be
loath to abandon the Leviathan State and . . . try freedom.  -- Murray
Rothbard, _For a New Liberty_

If we were directed from Washington when to sow and when to reap, we
should soon want bread.  -- Thomas Jefferson

If, from the more wretched parts of the Old World, we look at those
which are in an advanced stage in improvement, we still find the greedy
hand of government thrusting itself into every corner & crevice of
industry & grasping the spoil of the multitude.  Invention is
continually exercised to furnish new pretenses for revenue & taxation.
It watches prosperity as its prey & permits none to escape without
tribute.  -- Thomas Paine : 1792 February

In any free society, the conflict between social conformity and
individual liberty is permanent, unresolvable, and necessary.
---Kathleen Norris

In politics, the middle way is none at all.  ---John Adams

It has been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown
with one species of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several
distinct genera of grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater
weight of dry herbage can be raised in the latter than in the former
case.  The same has been found to hold good when one variety and
several mixed varieties of wheat have been grown on equal spaces of
ground.  ---Charles Darwin: The Origin of Species, chapter IV

It is bad to be oppressed by a minority, but it is worse to be
oppressed by a majority.  For there is a reserve of latent power in the
masses which, if it is called into play, the minority can seldom
resist.  But from the absolute will of an entire people there is no
appeal, no redemption, no refuge . . . -- Lord Acton

It is error alone that needs government support, truth can stand by
itself.  ---Thomas Jefferson, "Notes on Virginia" 1785

It stands to reason that where there's sacrifice, there's someone
collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there is service, there is
someone being served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice speaks of
slaves and masters. And intends to be master.  ---Ayn Rand

It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men
of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be
read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be
repealed or revised before they are promulged, or undergo such
incessant changes that no man who knows what the law is to-day can
guess what it will be tomorrow.  Law is defined to be a rule of action;
but how can that be a rule, which is little known and less fixed?
---James Madison, Federalist #62 (27-Feb-1788)

Laws do not persuade just because they threaten.  ---Seneca: Epistulae
morales ad Lucilum

Let your voice be heard, whether or not it is to the taste of every

Nothing is more dangerous than an idea, when you only have one idea.
---Emile-Auguste Chartier

Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits.  -- Mark Twain

Of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be
the most oppressive.  It may be better to live under robber barons than
under omnipotent moral busybodies.  The robber baron's cruelty may
sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those
who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do
so with the approval of their own conscience. . . . To be `cured'
against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as
disease is to be put on a level with those who have not yet reached the
age of reason . . . You start being `kind' to people before you have
considered their rights, and then force upon them supposed kindnesses
which they in fact had a right to refuse, and finally kindnesses which
no one but you will recognize as kindnesses and which the recipient
will feel as abominable cruelties.  ---C S Lewis (1898-1963)

Of course they beat up people.  The whole point of government is that
it does things that you're not allowed to do, like beat people, kill
people, steal their property, kidnap and imprison them, etc.  If they
couldn't do things you couldn't do, why would you need them?  ---Phil
Ngai

Omnipotent psychotic businessmen are the downfall of every Libertarian

Remember that a government big enough to give you everything you want

See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives

See, when the GOVERNMENT spends money, it creates jobs; whereas when

Social justice should not contradict individual justice, either in

Walter Williams: 1982

Socialism will never succeed: it takes up too many evenings.  ---Oscar

Some of the worst tyrannies of our day are pledged to the service of
mankind, and function by pitting neighbor against neighbor.  ---William
L. Edelen

Some writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave
little or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only
different, but have different origins . . .Society is in every state a
blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary
evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one.  ---Thomas Paine: Common
Sense (1776)

Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of
himself.  Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others?  Or
have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?  Let history

The briefest glance at history reveals that witch-hunters always manage

The difference between death and taxes is death doesn't get worse every

The search for the one best system has ill-served the pluralistic
character of American society ... [bureaucratization] has often

The shepherd always tries to persuade the sheep that their interests
and his own are the same.  -- Stendhal

The state is the great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to
live at the expense of everyone else.  -- Frederic Bastiat (1848)

The statesman who should attempt to direct people in what manner they
ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most
unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be
trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate
whatever, and which nowhere would be so dangerous as in the hands of a
man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to
exercise it. -- Adam Smith

The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the
intelligent are full of doubt.  -- Bertrand Russell

The truth which makes men free is for the most part the truth which men
prefer not to hear.  ---Herbert Agar

The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed

endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.  -- H. L. Mencken

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the

To call something public is to define it as dirty, insufficient and
hazardous.  The ultimate paradigm of social spending is the public
restroom.  ---P.J. O'Rourke

Virtually all reasonable laws are obeyed, not because they are the law,
but because reasonable people would do that anyway.  If you obey a law
simply because it is the law, that's a pretty likely sign that it
shouldn't be a law.  ---Unknown

We know better the needs of ourselves than of others. To serve oneself

We know that where poverty, disease, injustice, and misery abound, they

We may not imagine how our lives could be more frustrating and complex

What these politicians don't understand is that we're gonna vote for

Whatever it is that the government does, sensible Americans would

I recently used a coinage of my own  here - `black holism'.  Anders
subsequently noted that neologisms are the devil's mark of crackpots, so
perhaps I should try to spell out this phrase a little more.  :)


Here's a quote from something in the works:

Careless scuba divers are prey to a disorienting buzz: nitrogen narcosis.
This addlement was known once by a beautiful, alarming name: `raptures of
the deep'.  The compressed air-mixture breathed by divers, you see,
contains inert nitrogen, which gets forced into their brain tissues by the
pressure of the watery depths, causing silliness, unmotivated giggles or,
even more dangerously, fits of gloom and panic.
	=09
For most of us, untrained in the sciences, advanced physics is no less
alien a realm than the deep ocean.  Venture beyond the safe shores of the
high-school lab and your common-sense is put at risk.  Like victims of
nitrogen narcosis, you may find yourself slipping into irrational elation
or despair.  Call it, especially in its New Age or astrobabble forms,
`raptures of the shallow'.
	=09
This is unhappy news if, like me, you take cautious pleasure in today's
cornucopia of scientific discovery.  Science, after all, is the motor of
our age, and a large part of its secret ideology.  While it is dismal that
so many of us are frightened, or dismissive, or simply ignorant of this
ornate and fecund landscape, even worse is its gleeful colonisation by
slipshod thinkers for whom equations are mantras.  Those who find their
latest shallow rush browsing the New Age `holism' shelves especially adore
books about cosmology and quantum theory - the majestically great, the
enigmatic small.
	=09
For decades a key icon of shivery mystery was the black hole, that
mysterioso realm found deep in interstellar space where the laws of physics
get their comeuppance.  Hijacked kicking and screaming from the tensor
calculus-encrusted pages of impenetrable physics journals, black holes
became sacred sites for `holistic' ninnies blissfully gobsmacked by big
ideas but too lazy or too eager for cheap epiphanies to work at the hard
details.  Exploring the astonishing prospect of the Spike puts us, unless
we are very cautious, in danger of this unlovely fate, this black holism.

Black holism is mush-headed theft of hard, rigorous, limited, testable
ideas from science.  Yes, science is based on metaphor, of course, like all
discourse, but that fact should not license the warping of its hard-won
findings by desperados who wish to shore up their angst with a miasma of
quantobabble.  Discussing Bell's non-locality theorem, quantum theorist
Heinz Pagels noted scornfully: `Some recent popularizers... have gone on to
claim that... the mystical notion that all parts of the universe are
instantaneously interconnected is vindicated...  That is rubbish.'  You'd
never know it from the happy zeal with which black holists wave the Bell
theorem like a mantra.  Of the ensemble theory of quantum reality, Pagels
asks: `And didn't John Wheeler, one of the physicists who helped develop
this many-worlds view, finally reject it because, in his words, "It
required too much metaphysical baggage to carry around"?'  Introducing a
magisterial biography of quantum pioneer Niels Bohr, Professor Abraham Pais
wrote recently: `I hope that the present account will serve to counteract
the many cheap attempts at popularizing this subject, such as efforts by
woolly masters at linking quantum physics to mysticism.'  (Wu Li Masters,
indeed!)  Anyone with a grain of sense and taste will know what to do with
such claims.  Certainly they won't erect a theory of Life, the Universe and
Everything on such a corroded armature.  The salience and gravity of these
themes - cosmos, consciousness, death - make such muddled syncretism so
deplorable.  It will hardly serve to guide us up the slope of the Spike.
	=09
Physicist and educator Alan Cromer has argued that science can really only
be done by people with formal operational skills, mental abilities defined
by psychologist Jean Piaget, that inadequate schooling has failed to
develop in perhaps half the adult population or more.  Without these tricks
of objective thought, Cromer and Piaget argue, humans construct egocentric
narratives about the universe based on projecting the inner world into the
outer.  Ego-centric in the literal sense - their worlds are experienced as
if actually projected outward from their own minds, indefinitely and
directly malleable before the power of wish.  (Not even the hardest-nosed
reductionist doubts that optimistic or self-paralysing attitudes can
influence the way you act, which in turn changes both the parts of
objective reality you deal with and modifies the attitudes of other
people.)  Egocentrism is the assumption about the supposed top-down flow
between (a, your) mind, and the world, which is made explicit in the sad
little New Age slogan: You create your own reality.

The non-intentional, self-organising properties of the universe emerges
from the `bottom up', out of the properties of its small stupid parts,
modified by the presence in the local neighbourhood of lots and lots of
other tiny mindless parts.  This is true even if Stuart Kauffman and his
Santa Fe colleagues are correct and complexity tends to emerge via a quite
limited and fairly inevitable number of pathways.  The interactions of many
small, stupid things tumbled together may form `attractors' in an abstract
configuration space, but those mathematical attractors do not cause the
behaviour they map and predict - not even to the extent that roads restrict
and channel the routes we drive along. =20
	=09
Things in the world accrete by the principle of the racheting crane, as
Daniel Dennett has neatly put it, and not by being tugged upward into the
empyrean by some holistic sky-hook.  Once stuck together they often
generate new `chunks' that thereafter manifest new and determinate
properties not visible in their elementary parts, but this is because
structure limits the degrees of freedom of those constituents.  My table
holds up my computer because its small, stupid atoms lock together in a
fairly stable, robust fashion, which they do by restricting each other in
their mutual proximity. =20
	=09
Is that a holistic fact or a reductionist one?  Neither - it is an
explanation of a local whole by an understanding (in broad, general terms)
of its nanomolecular bits and pieces.  I am not talking about the human
intentions which surely were crucial in selecting, shaping and connecting
the pieces of wood into a table.  Nor do I mean the informational unfolding
of the tree's DNA which turned organic chemicals into timber.  These
organised patterns, wonderful as they are, remain parasitical upon the laws
of quantum physics that obtain at the foundations of phenomenal reality.
And our knowledge of those laws, and their physical manifestation, are
utterly reductionist.
	=09
Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg cites Dostoyevsky's underground man: `Good
God, what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if for one
reason or another I don't like these laws...'  Weinberg's scorn for this
self-satisfied despair leads him into an awful pun: `At its nuttiest
extreme are those with holistics in their heads, those whose reaction to
reductionism takes the form of a belief in psychic energies, life forces
that cannot be described in terms of the ordinary laws of inanimate
nature.'  He adds, candidly: `The reductionist worldview is chilling and
impersonal.  It has to be accepted as it is, not because we like it, but
because that is the way the world works.'
	=09
Why, then, do so many people so ardently believe otherwise?=20
	=09
Our supreme eagerness to impute purpose, telos, narrative to the world
arises because that is indeed an appropriate way to understanding the human
realm, the regime of intentions for which our minds have evolved their
special competence.  Minds, as we've seen, are more like rowdy parliaments
than diamond crystals.  At the same time, like parliaments they operate
through a selected speaker.  Oliver Sacks's An Anthropologist on Mars, for
example, is rich with bizarre and illuminating tales about the mind and its
breakdowns, especially autism and autistic gifts.  He gives powerful
evidence for mental modularity, while insisting that what's missing in
autism, say, is exactly a higher level of global organisation - a
categorising self.  Is this holism or reductionism?  The complex reality,
in a way, eludes simple labelling.  Finally, though, we are faced with
wounded people whose global functions have failed to emerge, one way or
another, from the parts that comprise them.  Yet clearly we are genetically
structured to work as `selves', despite recent deconstructive bids to
disperse the self. =20
	=09
At a recent seminar given by a young woman graduate student working on
cyborgs, cyberspace and feminism, I heard much citation from Luce Irigaray
and other poststructural gurus.  The performance was dazzling, impressively
learned after its fashion, and... totally arbitrary.  No method was invoked
for testing the assertions other than by their shock value, on the one
hand, and their adherence to fashionable doxa, on the other.  When I asked
why possibility X or Y had been discarded, I was told that the speaker just
didn't think it was... didn't feel it was... didn't...  Next question,
please.  I pressed her.  Hans Moravec claims X, I said, and he's one of the
world's specialists in this field of artificial intelligence and robotics,
so how can you just bypass his claims because you don't feel like liking
them?  Er um, what I really wish to concentrate on is... =20
	=09
The road to black holism is lined with cognitive dissonance.
	=09
Another example: I fell into conversation with a New Age woman touted as
enchanting and spiritually wise (utterly unlike me, in short).  I found her
a sweet, kind, sickly sentimental, utterly gullible dipstick.  We had a
very long and painful afternoon, interspersed by frantic cups of tea.  Each
statement she made was weirder and more credulous than the item preceding
it; the world was run on principles of numerology, and you can change
traffic lights to green by wishing hard as you approach them, and aromas
cured everything that ailed your body (except for the grave intestinal
illness that had almost killed her months earlier, which was fixed in
hospital by huge doses of cortisone - which she ungratefully and in
retrospect dubbed toxic chemicals forced upon her by a crudely reductionist
science), and the iris was connected to da hip-bone, and UFOs were driven
by little grey aliens, and Sai Baba could levitate and pour endless
quantities of dust out of his open hand and vomit up gold phalluses a foot
long, and crystals had magical powers, and the Urantia Book was the source
of all wisdom, such as the passages about how humans had evolved through
the stages of Green Men and Purple Men and Blue Men, and... =20
	=09
At first I listened to this gibberish with wonderment, as if privileged in
an anthropological way to observe a rare sub-culture of Pre-rational
Humankind.  After a while (shame on me!) I gratuitously began to lecture
the poor thing, in an increasingly frenetic and cross-disciplinary way, on
alternative explanations for these phenomena that current science might put
forward.  I ranted on, delivering myself of cognitive science explanations
for just why she found such unsubstantiated hogwash so believable.  She
reeled away hours later in a bruised mental condition, I gather, and I have
never seen her since. =20
	=09
You might wonder, as I do: why did I feel impelled to set her straight?
Leave aside whether I have any warrant for thinking that my book-larnin'
gave me a grip on truth superior to her woolly word-of-mouth subcultural
melange; of course I do.  But I don't stand on street corners preaching
godlessness to passing Mormons.  This urge only comes over me when I find
myself in a room with one or more black holists whose views affront me in
their inanity and intellectual poverty.  Or, more importantly - not just
their views, but their ways of deploying, testing, applying and revising
those views. =20
	=09
Despite appearances, I am not especially dogmatic about any particular
sub-sections of my world view.  Like a good many intellectuals struggling
to keep their heads above the torrent of new books and journal articles and
Internet postings, I modulate my opinions about quantum theory and
cosmology and the structure of mind and society according to whichever
brilliantly-argued source I read last.  But (no credit to me in this fact,
of course) those somewhat flexible views form a kind of mutually-bracing
geodesic structure of some power and grandeur.  And maybe they generate
Dawkins-style memes that insist on broadcasting themselves and fighting
opposing memes to the death. =20
	=09
Is holism a meme deserving of death, or at least retirement?  On the one
hand, as we have seen, in some misleading sense everyone is a holist.  Who
would deny that the simplest protein or even molecule manifests spontaneous
self-organisation, folding, specificity, that could not easily be predicted
from its components?  A fortiori for living critters and cultures.  But
that does not imply there's something like a mind doing the shaping,
putting in the complexity from the top down, which is the crucial step for
most holists.  Nor is an emergent mentality at a level higher than the
individual human especially consistent with the world we observe.  Despite
alleged `synchronistic' events or coincidences, I recall my experiences
rather than yours.  We simply don't remember the experiences of others.
When I raise my hand to scratch my nose, your arm does not lift into the
air instead.  We're firewalled by our skulls.  If there is a `holistic'
channel, it is clearly very weak and noisy.
	=09
Top-down `holistic' lines of analysis reek to me of sad reports of African
Ebola victims.  Owing to their ancient holistic wisdom, the luckless
victims in Zaire know that the disease is caused by evil or enraged
spirits, having nothing to do with anything so stupidly reductive as an
infesting microorganism, so they're holistically bribing the guards who so
unreasonably lock them away from the free exercise of their right to go
hither and yon unchecked, spreading the damnable disease. =20
	=09
Granted, that isn't a very sophisticated brand of holism, and classy black
holists can cite Paul Davies and Robertson Davies and for all I know Betty
Davis in their cause - but it remains wrong-headed for just the same
reasons that disease-demons are.  The nearest I have seen to a strong
scientific case for physical holism is John Gribbin's recent Schr=F6dinger's
Kittens, which promotes John Cramer's quantum theory as the Final Answer.
Much is made of non-locality, of the strange connections from present to
future and back to past that wind everything together in the Cramer model.
One is obliged, learning of such models, to think a little more charitably
about a certain kind of holistic hyper-connectivity.  But Cramer quantum
theory does not support mysticism, and Gribbin himself steals backwards
away from any such implication.
	=09
Reductionism has been faulted as evaluating credibility solely in terms of
rational and empirical criteria.  One must not conflate the two, of course.
 Any strict division between holist-introvert-intuitive and
reductionist-extrovert-empiricist is vitiated exactly because each of us
contains multitudes, and can shift modes depending on the demands of
reality.  It's like `top down' versus `bottom up' - both strategies are
constantly in play, and often interact by way of Douglas Hofstadter's
Strange Loops.  If it turned out (as some believe) that people empirically
tended to be healthier and happier if they organised their lives around
ludicrous cosmological tenets, perhaps you would have to grit your teeth
and endorse the practical `credibility' of these laughable or odious
doctrines.  If it turned out that you really could build a better engine or
ecology by analysing them in terms that allowed internal contradictions -
that is, by being `non-rational', both A and not-A at once - a preference
for the empirical might oblige you to adopt those practices, despite the
outrage that would represent to classical logic.
	=09
Actually, it is arguable that quantum theory already requires the
abandonment of syllogistic canons of reason.  And maybe pre-contact
aboriginal lifestyles exemplify the life-style benefits of doing so.  (But
give me electric lights, high-speed dental drills, and antibiotics any
day).  On the other hand, quantal complementarity is either restricted to
its tiny realm, or will prove to be just a stop-gap methodological kludge
until a still better physics is devised.  And the social benefits of
animism seem to me largely a by-product of the practical impotence of such
doctrines.  If your medicine is based on magic and your economy on foraging
(however much memory and skill is required in its practice), you fail to
reach the population growth that, as its side-effects, can produce
pandemics and arms races and power hierarchies and exponential re-entrant
knowledge growth.  So among the benefits of believing incorrect things
about the world is that you are restricted to such terrific holistic
interventions as killing all the megafauna of an entire continent by
burning the original ecology to the ground over a few tens of thousands of
years...
	=09
Must materialists be reductionists?  (Presumably not: neuroscientist Steven
Rose is a Marxist who repudiates reduction as a philosophical method, even
if he adheres to it in the lab.)  Certainly it is a materialist position -
whatever that means in a quantal universe where matter is congealed force -
to reject all hypotheses or methodologies that posit any top-down aspects
of reality not derived by evolution from fundamental forces and particles.
That still leaves lots of weird windows, though. =20
	=09
It might be, for example, that human minds are, after all, somehow and in
some respects quantally non-locally connected.  Or perhaps earlier
intelligences arisen elsewhere in the galaxy have evolved by now to
`godlike' estate and secretly run the universe.  Or maybe a Hoyle/Tipler
end-of-eternity Time God works backward through time to re-arrange history
(astonishing topics to which we'll return).  Or perhaps the phenomenal
universe is actually and literally a cybersimulation in higher dimensional
space, with us as sub-routines...  If any of these were true, then a
rigorous materialism would indeed require top-down explanations of many
phenomena at our human realm (as the Gaia hypothesis might turn out to do,
although James Lovelock's originating version is strictly materialist).
But there's no strong evidence that these merry conceits actually have a
real-world instantiation (except, maybe, the ambiguous data from the best
parapsychology labs). =20
	=09
In practice, reductionist hypotheses would seem preferable wherever
possible, because that's the way science has reached its goals in the past.
 Notably, non-reductionist models (elan vital, for example) have turned out
to be misleading, based on bad analogies and wishful thinking.  But
materialisms, too, can be `holistic' or non-reductionist, or claim to be;
Marxism is only the most well-known.  None of this has much bearing on
issues of the mind, of the Freud-versus-Jung variety, say, except that as a
materialist I become wary (or even furious) when I hear intelligent people
airily invoke `psychic energies' or `ids' or `Shadows' as if these
metaphors possessed the same level of instrument-mediated reality as
electron flows and dopamine titres.  Such figures might have a metaphoric
allure given our current comparative ignorance of the mind/brain-body, but
they drag us into explanatory culs de sac. =20
	=09
Watching Passions of the Mind, a series of television programs about the
life and thought of Carl Jung, I was entertained in a horrified fashion by
the way his acolytes handled Wolfgang Pauli's defection from the celebrated
Jung-Pauli synchronicity hypothesis.  (The black holists never tell us
about that apostasy, oddly enough.)  Pauli abandoned this great scientific
truth, said his former analyst, because he could not face the deep inner
mysteries of the Shadow.  These monsters therefore lay in horrid wait for
him - and hence, she said with ill-disguised relish and self-satisfaction,
he swiftly died of cancer.  Admittedly, psychological stress can be shown
(empirically and rationally) to obstruct immunological function via a
recently discovered brain chemo-modulator pathway... and so maybe stress
hinders repair of early cancer cells.  Nonetheless, the claim that Pauli
got cancer and died because he resisted Jungian analysis is deeply
offensive and self-serving.  But quite typical of black holism's malicious
or stupid magical thinking.
	=09
Well, perhaps that does not matter, if what counts is experiential richness
of life.  For millennia, wise people have obviously lived wonderfully
satisfying lives without the slightest notion that the earth goes around
the sun or that the blood circulates or that tiny invisible animals make
you sick.  But I cannot help thinking that to employ the best available
physics and physiology has to be preferable to clinging to time-hallowed
common-sense errors.  It would be a terrible travesty of intellectual
justice if our dawning awareness of the on-rushing Spike became conscripted
by black holists, warped into yet another comical New Age fantasy of
effortless deliverance.

I for one am uninterested in "acceptance" to the extent that it means
anything more than the elimination of second-class citizenship in my
society.  Period.  From friends and relevant others, admiration and warm
regard is what I'm after but it is certainly rarely my "gayness" that
earns it.  In identifying myself as a member of this stigmatized group, I
am just *facing facts*, recognizing that I am susceptible to a description
on the basis of which I am likely to be treated irrationally here and now.
Heterosexism is surreally unjust and irrational, and so long as it exists
and is applied to me I will bloody well fight it on its own terms.  As for
the vertiginous thrill that presumably falls upon those lucky individuals
who manage to achieve "victim status," I have to say that I find it to be
somewhat overrated and more than mildly distasteful.

Fair enough, though I will say that the arguments I find myself making to
defend or explain my atheism, vegetarianism, or technological immortalism
to incomprehending others often resonate conspicuously with those I make
about queerness.  As I said, I think queerness and extropianism comport
well together.  Perhaps this is what Natasha is zeroing in on when she
sees in gay pride a symbol for triumphant individualism.  No doubt she
sees things in it she likes less well as well (sheesh -- so do I), but
it's the repudiation of conventions, the ethical embrace of pleasure, and
the celebration of experimentalism that she wants to italicize about the
movement.

I'll go you one better:  Why one should wish to be exhaustively or even
adequately describable under *any* glib bumper sticker of an identity-tag
is something I scarcely understand.  Were I to stumble upon any attribute
whatsoever that rated the description "essence of my identity" I imagine I
would be, frankly, flabbergasted.  Like calling Whitman (you know, "I
contain multitudes"?) "just a fag".  Best, Dale

Stumbled across this the other day...  It's the best search engine I've
seen yet.  It uses a system which it calls "Hyperlink Vector Voting" to
rank the sites through which it crawls, using the anchored descriptions as
the criteria, rather than the site itself.  I'd love to see AltaVista,
HotBot, or one of the other large crawlers implement something like this.

"The crucial innovation of Hyperlink Vector Voting is to collect anchor
descriptions as the content of a searchable database.=A0 Each description is
associated in the database with the referenced site, not the site where the
link appeared.=A0 In this way, the descriptions constitute "votes" as to the
subject of the referenced site.=A0 Counting these votes provides a
decentralized and democratic way to identify what each web site is about.=A0
The "vector" in Hyperlink Vector Voting refers to the mathematics used for
weighting the votes according to frequency. [...]

"We think the best way to evaluate the Hyperlink Search Engine is as

It's much weirder that that. Place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over

photon went through what slit and the interference pattern disappears. Now  
place a third filter set at 45 degrees one mile from the slits and just one  
inch in front of the film. Now you can't tell what photon went through what 
slit and the interference pattern comes back! 
         
It can't be that the disturbance caused by measurement was the source of this, 
you put the third filter far from the slits and AFTER the photons decided 
what slit to go through. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does not enter in 
any of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and we just don't 
know which one, it goes through one slit and both slits, and neither.
                  
In the Everett model  when the photon hits the plate the universe splits in 
two, if the photons just kept going into open space then the universes would 
remain separate, but if they hit the film and stop then the 2 worlds merge 
but retain some properties of going through both slits. When you place 
polarizers that are set differently over the slits the 2 photon will always 
be different as will be the effects of anything they hit, so the 2 universes 
(and the two of you) never merge and so you see no interference pattern.

Well here in Denmark where gays actually can get married, most people don't
really cares. They are not seen as victims or any other special kind of
group. Certainly not socialists. They are just guys and girls who like....
well! guys and girls.

That said, of course there are homophobics here too who goes gaybashing.

Or an early, very strong autumn snowfall, which might have been the
first in a series of snows leading to an ice-age. Happens all the

Yes, wear and overgrowth may be a major problem for very long lived

Haven't there been some rather detailled discussions of an aquatic

True. What we might need is a function that gives the poster an

Yes, but why are there no papers in (say) Nature, Science or even
Scientific American if it works? While the big scientific journals
are admittedly conservative (they have to be), even they would
publish a paper that clearly demonstrated cold fusion in a correct
scientific manner, especially if there were prototypes already
working commercially (most likely preceeded by in Nature by a "news
and views" review by one of the harshest critics now claiming he was
for cold fusion all the time). 

Clarke doesn't exactly count as a scientific authority (too bad), so
we cannot apply his first law to him ("When an old an respected
scientist says something is possible, he is probably right. When he
says something is impossible he is bery probably wrong"), and morning
TV is notorious of showing anything that would interest people. The
russian hot water heaters sounds interesting, but have all the
hallmarks of pure rumor (remote location, good story, no details
making it easy to check) and seems unlikely given that if cold fusion
could be commercialized that easily, it would be very easy to
demonstrate globally.

There is a difference: quantum mechanics is a tried and tested theory
(you see proof of it just by using the semiconductors in your
computer), whose *interpretations* are a field of weird speculation,
philosophy and matter of opinion (at present). Cold fusion claims a
certain physical process occurs, but has not yet produced widely
available evidence.

Yes, you probably missed the lesson in quantum philosophy, solid
state physics and applied epistemology, but it isn't mandatory :-)

I think it is a bit stupid to mistrust *everything* the government
says - one has to apply sceptical thinking here too. A sceptic
doesn't believe in what he hears, and he doesn't doubt it either. He
tries to find out if it is true or not.

Thanks to Anders for an interesting reply to my post and apologies for the
rest of you for such a petulant retort on my part. I saw the recent
developments particularly exciting and was just disappointed that my post
didn't generate any discussion. I guess I was disappointed that I couldn't
share my interest with my friends - who aren't so scientifically inclined -
and just doubly disappointed when it failed to generate any interest here.
I read Science and Nature each week and I'm having a lot of trouble dealing
with the rate that information is coming in.

I suspect that you're thinking of the classic work by Frederick Jackson
Turner, the great American historian. The "Turner Thesis" on the role of
the frontier, and the signicance of its passing, used to be one of the
major themes in American historiography.  It seems to be considered
passe by the current academic mainstream.  I don't have my file on this
subject handy at the moment, but I'm sure any American library will have
Turner's works and at least some of the huge secondary and critical
scholarship that it generated. Turner's principal essays are also
frequently reprinted in general collections on American history, and I
remember at least one reader devoted entirely to an evaluation of the
thesis.

The only useful references I have easily at hand are as follows:

Frederick Jackson Turner, The Frontier in American History, Henry Holt,
New York, 1920.

Ray Allen Billington, ed., Frontier and History: Selected Essays of
Frederick Jacson Turner, Spectru, Books, Classics in History, Prentice-
Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1961

David W. Noble, Historians Against History: The Frontier Thesis and the
National Covenant - American Historical Writing Since 1830, University
of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1965

Howard Leman & Leonard Thompson, eds., The Frontier in History: North
America and Southern Africa Compared, Yale Unversity Press, New Haven,
1981


Although not wishing to get dragged into this discussion, I should
register a degree of scepticism about the thesis. It frequently seems
like a sort of geographical determinism which neglects what is surely
the far more important causal role of ideas.  There have been a lot of
frontiers in human history - but not many free societies on them, or
elsewhere for that matter.  Whilst such "external" causative factors do
have an impact on the nature and evolution of human socieities I "hae me
doots" about making to much of them.

Taken out of context, it does sound kinda strange, Anton.  Although in the
context with which this was stated it was a made to counter to the idea that
gays are underdogs. 

Activists tend to espouse individuality.

Well, I am not, not even in a little way, a racist...
This way I would like to expose a possible use of the genetics:

Considering:

1. It is observed that the mind of a person answers to physical 
effects in different ways (very  obvius...). And the light is a 
physical effect. So it's natural that the minds (be of "whites" 
(light roses) or "blacks" (browns))  react differently when seeing a 
white or black person... It is not racism... Its just a
"photo-neuronal" effect... Another example is the colour of the hair 
or eyes of a person...The effect is similar and I should add a 
psychological attraction too, possibly based *also* on  light 
attraction...  
2. Recently we have heard about the discovery of the gen responsible 
for the whitening of the hair. This way, in some more years, men 
and women, as they wish, will keep their hair on the original 
colour, when get older...

So, extending:

. In the future, it will be possible to change the colour of the 
hair, eyes or even skin... Obviously, depending on the wish of each 
individual...
This is a very interesting possibility, also because of racism.
Indeed, if a white person would feel better in the mirror seeing 
itself  black ( or vice-versa, white and blond..., or even other 
colour - maybe even phosphorescent...) he/she will have the option of 
choice... It will be good for us, whites, and for the blacks as 
well... It will decrease any psychological difference, where possibly 
still exists (in both minds...).

Just scientific talks...

Gomes.

One would expect so.  On the other hand, an interesting probe into that
contention is Samuel R. Delany's 1976 science fiction novel TRITON (now
republished in the USA as TROUBLE ON TRITON in order to convey a certain
`pulp sf' flavour, a regrettable move).  The protagonist is a misogynistic
and self-destructive son of a bitch in a heterotopic or `ambiguous' future
utopia, who tries to solve his problem by changing sex.  He ends up as a...
what? a miserable female son of a bitch.  Dem memes, dem memes, dem dry memes.

Chip Delany, BTW, is a black, gay, upper-middle class writer who lives with
a white former street person.  (You can read about him and his fiction and
theories of textuality in my book READING BY STARLIGHT:  POSTMODERN SCIENCE
FICTION.)  His skin is not that dark, and his features would perhaps allow
him to `pass' if he wished to do so.  These days he's pretty hefty and
heroically bearded and wears fearsome tats, and would probably find EvMICK
in all his leather-&-chains-glory *just* the kind of white meat he'd
fancy...  Boo!  (Gotta watch that give-away unconscious, old son, thrum
thrum the gears, screech the brakes.)

Well, variable chromogeometry (or, extending, 
functional-chromogeometry...) could include also  fuzzy, Mandelbrot, 
etc. geometries... (including a possible telepresence...)
I think that our future form must be variable even because, have you 
already thought about loosing the women's present body sensorial 
contact? Possibly a directly "neuron"-induced (or software-induced) 
effect could replace it (satisfactorily)... (just a generalizable 
heterossexual joke...).    
A suitable question is if it would be adopted, in the future, 
something like a hardware sharing... or we'll choose continue 
 being individuals. (The talk is getting really crazy...)
Another interesting possibility (but very dangerous and insecure yet) 
in thinking about to create a super main processor where our 
individualities would share the facilities. Don't know if it would be 
good or bad, but the natural tendency would be the unification of all 
the universe in just one counscious living organism, with various 
"selfimages" that would be ourselves in better forms... Something 
better that the ancient religious "God" imagination (or 
selfprojection...)

I know the feeling. Why doesn't people realize all the exciting
things that happens right now, right under their noses? Why doesn't
they look at the stars in wonder, or dare to watch how the insects
around them really behave? I think this is a reason scientifically
and technically minded people gather together - at least we
appreciate some of the same things (likely many artists and social
scientists do the same thing too).

Yes, it is amazing. My office-mate came up with a nice solution: we
take turns reading the journals, copying the interesting papers we
find and giving them to each other. That way we can speed up our
information assimilation a slight bit.

Yes. I think racism as we see it today will start to wither as the
concept of a biological race becomes completely arbitrary (I look
forward to hear the neo-nazis scream when the first blond, blue-eyed
aryan is born to black parents :-). Unfortunately, racism will likely
move more towards a cultural level - it is not the genes that are
inferior, it is the memes. 

The first decade or so the process will likely be rather one way, to
white, but after that more people will want to change in other
directions. There is a real possibility of an entire generation of
whites with black parents, followed by a "brownlash" (couldn't resist
the pun) as color becomes chic.

Some parameters may be discrete - the number of dimensions, the
number of quark families etc. And you are right, some parameters
might be "stable"; this is essentially Tegmark's idea to test his
hypothesis: if we live in such an island, the only stable parameters
are those parameters which don't remove the possibility of life, the
cruicial parameters are unstable.

I think they could, but it is likely that nothing new will appear
after a while as they grow larger. I might be wrong.

Or were real numbers; one could have something like a Cantor dust of
islands in the parameter space.

Hmm, this gave me a truly bizarre idea: if somebody has a
high-resolution chromophorous skin and a net link, it might be
possible to use it as a kind of videophone. Imagine talking to a
small face on your palm...

Crazy? Hardly, at least not on this list. The normals all believe we
are nuts anyway. :-)

Hardware sharing is an interesting idea, especially if we upload
ourselves and link up to different bodies for different tasks. I have
already suggested Hertz Body Rental, where you can lease cloned
bodies during your vacation. I can also imagine future teenagers
asking their parents for the keys to the body...

However, I think most people are so used to the idea of being
individuals that they will not share hardware and would find other
forms of existence somewhat frightening ("yes, I was a part of a
group-mind when I was younger. Typical teenage rebellion...").

I'm not sure I follow you how sharing the same processor would lead
to a merger. A more likely model would be a huge "processor hotel",
where infomorphs live in well protected memory areas. Merging minds
is tricky...

I've written several posts on quantum computers, if you can't find them in  
the archives I'll re-post them.

That's the big question, it seems simple but it's extraordinarily difficult, 
but perhaps not impossible, to test experimentally. Everett would say that 
the  wave function doesn't collapse, the universe splits and consciousness 
has nothing to do with Quantum Mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation says 
otherwise.
          

        >Can you see the problem I have with all this?          


Certainly, but there is no point in keep asking yourself, can things really  
be this crazy, because the answer is yes.        


        >I find such extreme enduring "superimposed states" all very absurd.
          

Well, it is all very absurd, but it's also true. Suppose the two slits are 
one light year away, a polarizer set to at 0 over one and 90 degrees over the  
other. One year after they encounter the slits they fall on your film, there 
is no interference pattern and it's clear that each photon went through ONE  
and only one slit a year ago. 

Now suppose that after traveling for one year after their encounter with the 
slits and one second before they hit the film you suddenly decide to hold up  
a polarizer set to 45 degrees. This erases from the universe all information  
on what photon went through what slit and so you see an interference pattern
and it's clear that each photon went through BOTH slits a year ago.

Backward causality? Splitting universes? Observer defined reality? I don't  
know, I do know that something  very weird is going on. Bohr said "anybody 
who is not shocked by Quantum Mechanics does not understand it" another 
fellow said " I think it's safe to say nobody understands Quantum Mechanics" 
the fellow's name was Richard Feynman.
          

        >Surely any old physical "macro" event, any computer (quantum or not)         
        >that records and represents the information, or even the information

        >firring... can do just as much to "collapse" a wave as phenomenal         
        >conscious representations can. 
          

Maybe so, but it's hard as hell to prove. It's not Everett's fault we need a 
conscious computer, Everett says consciousness does not collapse a wave, but 
he'd need such a machine to prove it. The reason the computer must be a 
quantum one is that as part of the experiment we need to totally erase its 
memory at the lowest level and that means the quantum level.

I've been trying to do the exact same thing.  The problems I find are: trying
to be optimistic and still hold the attention of todays audience (who have
been made to believe genetic engineering will create mosters and AI's will
eat their children) and trying to present highly complex, world changing
technologies in a way the audience would understand.  For instance, how do
you show nano-technology or uploading in a movie (without resorting to "I can
feel something... something strange... entering... my... body... something
small... almost nanoscopical in size" or "as you can see, virtual reality
technology has progressed so far that everything in here looks _exactly_ like
it does in the real world!").

***** Yes. We cannot forget the necessary "cultural treatment". But 
consider the following personal example: When I was a catholic (now 
I'm a positive atheist and still try to keep a charitous behaviour) I 
pertained to a group of helping to poor people called "vincentians", 
(in homage to a very charitous "saint" called Vincent). So, as an 
engineer, I assessored the construction of small brick houses to the 
poors. An interesting case was of a black woman, poorly and dirtly 
dressed, with an insane daughter. Her wood house was even difficult 
to get into... bad smell of mould and dirty...After her new house got 
ready, I once passed in front it and, who have I seen at the 
window, happy, bath taken and with still poor but new and clean 
cloths? That poor black woman. If that "environmental" (really...) 
change made possible such transformation, imagine one that happened 
on the nearest enviroment of a person, which it sees at the mirror 
when wakes up in the morning... It will help a lot... I suppose that 
the physical self-admiration factor is very important, and acts 
something recursively (although apparently horizotally asymptotic) in 
the psychological evolution of an individual, principally the 
women... It is well know that some (white) women even suicide if  
their external beauty get seriously damaged...

About gayness, I'm really heterossexual (politypic, hehehe). But I 
suppose there is an interesting psycho-socio-phylosophical 
question associated with what you've exposed: What would be the 
normal (gaussian) behaviour of the male human if  having  a 
functional-chromo-geometric variable body? I really believe that 
a great quantity of them would be easily found "in short skirts and 
toplessed" (or worse...hahaha).

Exactly. Tonight the Lawnmover Man will air on swedish television. I
like the film, it contains several transhuman themes and the graphics
from Xaos Inc was brilliant when it was made. Still, to tell the
story the movie *needs* something gone wrong (at least they did not
use the silly Star Trek idea that superintelligence always leads to
amoralit - the nasty men in suits wrecked the whole experiment). 

Maybe one way of getting tension into a basically transhuman movie
may be to have a conflict between two reasonable points of view,
instead of "good guys vs. villains", like (say) transhumanists
wishing to expand human potential and bring life to the universe, and
environmentalists who want to heal the world and live in harmony with
nauture (the movie could end with the transhumans moving off-planet
as "Children of the Sun", leaving it for the "Children of the
Earth"), but I think most companies would prefer the tried and tested
black vs. white theme. 

Another way of showing transhuman themes in an interesting way is to
look at their human consequences. What about a movie about a family
where a daughter is uploaded after an accident, something like the
typical movie where the daughter is handicapped and people struggle
to adapt and understand the situation?

Dear Sherwood,

I will, one day, reach the end of your mail.
But then I'll take another advantadge of it, requiring a 
pos-graduation in Political Sciences too...(hehe)

Just joking. They are really unquestionably interesting citatons...

I'm also involved, here in Brazil, with some political regional 
agreements that deal with nuclear subjects in Latin America. 
I understand the position of the governments... 
(gomes@cnen.GOV.br). Nevertheless we also know that if certain 
things are not said, the tendency of some minds (and politics..) is 
the classic "accomodated and comfortable" positionment  (contrary to 
evolutive one...), sometimes in  accordance to majority, which 
do not always necessarily know  what is really better for 
them or other people... Principally about subjects related to 
Science and Technology... For example, they are still "running like 
pigs from a gun" [Lennon-McCartney] about clones... And the 
particular positionments of the governments are being observed (and 
locally judged) by those who really understand of such 
subjects...  (Is the government being inteligently satisfactory ? 
The same government that can prohibit genetical experiences 
with humans could, as nobody else, conduct them with security and 
a *really* global and political discernment ... and admirable 
authority...) But it is never unsuable to remember that 
(democratic) governments are always our friends, avoiding so 
desperate acts like Fermi's or Oppenheimer's, f. ex. They 
didn't have a globally correct political behaviour... and did 
wrong... Although were great scientists...

	Yes, for sure.  I just don't understand why people insist on
taking it clear to being dependent on being consciously observed or
represented.  Why not just accept the much simpler: any macro physical
representation of the event (i.e. a firing neuron or switching
transistor, orientation of magnetic flux on tape...) be considered an
"observation"?  What does a phenomenal conscious representation of the
event have (especially since it is so causally separated from the
actual event) that any other macro physical representation of the
event (many of which are causally much closer to the quantum event)
doesn't have?  What on earth is the reason for bring consciousness
into it is what I always wonder.  It does nothing but make things
infinitely more complex doesn't it?  A clear violation of Occam's
razor?  Wasn't this what the Schrodinger's (sp?) cat idea was meant to
point out?

	Why even go through these messy, noisy, insensitive, and
inefficient, multiple transduction stages to and from light?  Let's
directly stimulate the optic nerve.  Or even better directly produce
the visual experience right in our visual cortex (or the corresponding
much more capable cortex to which we've been uploaded.)  We certainly
don't pump audio through a speaker and back into a microphone every
time we want to communicate audio signals!  Imagine the perfect visual
clarity one might experience without having to go through all the
messy mechanics of a vidio display and the eye and retina...  I hate
heavy glasses and display screens that always get dirty.

In my point of view, we should consider the Universe on the 
mathematical way, as the whole set of all. Any other set would just 
be united to the whole set, being nothing more than one of its 
subsets... On considering "different universes" is the same as 
considering rational numbers completely diverse, in essence, from  
irrationals. They are all real numbers, and complex, 
hypercomplex, etc. What could be infinite is the union of all 
subsets....

About life in all subsets....

Another interesting question is if may exist virtual lifeforms that 
would possess the property of virtual teletransport, sensing and 
acting elsewhere,  but their  "base" would be matterial and fixed 
somewhere in  space-time... like ourselves (for while...) 

(At least, it would become a good sci-fi book... hehehe)

The way I would interpret this is to say that the photons always go
through both slits.  Then, depending on the experimental setup, you can
entangle them with the universe such that coherence is lost, or you can
do it such that they remain coherent and interference can be observed.
This really happens at the point where they hit the detectors (or perform
some other irreversible operation), not before.

It's wrong to say that the photon went through one slit, even if you
put your eye up to it and *see* it go through.  The photon went through
both slits.  However, you entangled yourself (and hence the rest of the
universe with which you can interact) with the photon state such that
you were not able to see the consequences of the photon going through
both slits.  Coherence is lost and the two possible paths can no longer
interfere.  Effectivelly you have split yourself into two states which
can not interact, each of which sees the photon take a different path.

I agree (mostly).  There are many studies showing how this kind
of environmental interaction transforms the state from a quantum
superposition to a classical mixture.  That is, interference between the
different branches is no longer possible.  The exception is the quantum
computer, which is specially constructed in order to preserve the full
state information, and allow quantum interference effects to occur.

Well, I don't know what the oldest civilization might be, but Minoan
civilization was at its height about 37 centuries ago, quite a long
while. However, Jherico was a fortress city with a Stone tower and moat in
6000BC(E), ~80 centuries ago.

I often wonder if some pretty impressive City-states or whole
civilizations existed that were in the long inbetween years when humans
were essentially fully formed genetically before the fertile-crescent
revolutions.  If they created nothing durable enough to show up with
cursory study, we may never know.  Any oo-parts(sp?) devotees out there?

Hal Finney <hal@rain.org>,

	Thanks for your brilliant answers, Hal!  What you say makes a
lot of sense to me.  Do you have any kind of references to where I
could read more about these "many studies showing how this kind of
environmental interaction transforms the state from a quantum
superposition to a classical mixture"?  Maybe even a source
approachable by someone as stupid about physics as I am?

	So, then, is a quantum computer merely something that gets
quantum physical phenomenon to represent and logically operate on
information like a regular computer does with "classical" hardware?
If so, then why couldn't this "superposition" information simply be
represented by a sufficiently complex and appropriately programmed
"classical" machine?  Maybe it would be easier with "quantum"
machinery but why couldn't it be done with classical hardware?

		Thanks,

With no preconcepts, but another interesting and strategical 
advantage in the "gay movement" is that, being this a 
sexually-oriented  movement, and they getting more victories with 
"courts and laws", the minds will get broad enough to admit polygamy 
too (hehehe...). The majority of the heterossexuals won't get it 
alone...they seem so tired, in general....

Indeed, cultural "racism" is the way of the future. It may be soon 
possible to change things like skin, eye and hair color but reliable  
(re-)programming of the brain won't probably be possible for a long
time to come. So the intelligence of people will remain a variable,
and consequently so will the memes they follow. Dumb people
are very likely to "get involved" with stupid and destructive memes 
like religion, communism, fascism etc, and may very well become
a serious threat to the evolving transhuman. The irrational masses
will only become more dangerous when "given" advanced future
technologies like nanomachines or body augmentation. It's like
giving a machine-gun to a cave-man...(That's why we should have
some kind of safe retreat, in case things go wrong. Space is the
most logical place to go, for many reasons. It's too bad that 
everybody relies on the likes of NASA to do all the pioneering; 
there are afaik not even *plans* for an extropian-orientated 
space program). 

There is nothing wrong with "discriminating" against other memes;
after all, they _are_  inferior to the forerunners (the transhuman
philosophies) of the "master meme"; the most practical and
pleasant one that is to replace all others. Have the courage and
honesty to say: yes, my meme is the best and your meme sucks
(and I'll most certainly kick your ass if you try to interfere with my
development ]:-)

Probably...just like some people today think that the waif "heroin look"
is somehow chic & sexy. Underneath that aryan exterior there still
will be a negro soul...people will still hate eachother, just not at first
glance. The change of skin won't solve the problems of unevenly distributed
intelligence (in the broadest sense of the word), the real cause for
racism.

We could also have programmable skin, making the body a display of art or

be amazing?

About neuro, nerves, etc. I've just remebered, when reading Bren's 
reply, an interesting possibility:

When I was prepairing my M.Sc. thesis, I had for times, to be awoke 
in my university, to use four of the computers of there ant the 
same time and finish the simulations of such thesis. So, I got in 
contact (far, of course...) with one or other cockroaches that 
wandered by the site, at night. Once, I tried to verify if they were 
neuro-sensible to something like a simple control signal of my mind, 
as "stop", "move left", "move right" (not speaking, but trying to 
move it with the mind fixed on it). The most interesting 
is that, in a first look,  it really seem so... So I thought that if 
we should monitor its nervous system and really prove such 
interaction (even if statistically, in a first moment), the menthal 
transductor would be, practically discovered. Just replicate the 
part of a cockroach's nervous system, associated with the 
effect (or put cockroaches's little heads connected to electronic 
circuits... argh and hehehe). Jokes off, studying these very simpler 
nervous systems is much easier than even the little white (or 
phosphorescent, hehehe) mice... After, I saw a report about Hokkaido, 
Japan, where they are already controlling cockroaches and 
crickets (like that of Beaves & Butthead, hehehe) with electronic 
circuits, as if they where small "cockrobots" (hehehe). It would 
perhaps  be possible to use a circuit similar to this to verify 
a cockroach's sensibility to human menthal interactions. I have 
tryied to develop such experiment here in Brazil, but the Professor, 
chief of the Biophysics department said we don't have hereb the 
technology necessary to deal with small nervous systems like that. 
And came back to his monkeys and opossums...   

Gomes.

PS: Is there any japanese here????

I am sorry that you believe that I am unable to answer your question, 
and I have tried in every manner that I know how to do so, and as I 
mentioned in my other post, I am really unable to continue this at 
this time.

I think, also, from your above statement, that you think that I am 
trying to say that to reveal the construction of gender will topple 
all social institution, and I do not know how you would have surmised 
that from anything that I have written, as I never claimed that.  I

which gender affects each social institution.

I must of necessity keep this brief, because I am presently battling an 
illness that brings on bouts of fatigue, and I am trying to get over 
it before next weekend, but two notes:

In re Shaun Russell's comments about 'rights groups':  I share many 
of your concerns, Shaun, and have spent much of my semiretirement as 
an activist trying to help my core groups overcome some of those 
pitfalls.  But I have found in working on several issue areas, 
including women's rights, peace, etc., that gay issues really cluster 
around the type of 'ground zero' issues that relate to basic human 
existence and self-determination.  Some time is devoted to fluff 
issues involving terminology and whatnot, but most time is spent on 
the more serious elements of societal coexistence, and the everpresent 
threat of violence directed against the community helps to focus 
people.  

In re Natasha's response to my posting:  I must confess to a bit of 
confusion about your reply, because you seem to have broadened your 
initial statement to include other groups, whereas I originally 
understood you to be making an assessment of the power that my 
community supposedly has right now.  And, in comparing the two 
assessments, I would tend to give more weight to the assessment of the 
persons living and working within that community, as I would with 
such an assessment about any community or group.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

Do you believe that a person wearing a rainbow flag, or freedom 
rings, is doing so to flaunt their sexuality in your face?  Many of 
use wear the colors as an expression of our internal pride, our 
self-love, our connection to a community, as well as a fun way to find 
potential mates.  And now that we have five sets of rings to denote 
what people are into (lesbian, leather, bi, etc.), you could get 
some valuable information about the attractive female you might want to 
approach!

I would like to think that the legalization of gay marriages would indeed
be a step in a trajectory of ever-broadening legally sanctioned modes of
intimate association -- polygamy, for one, but the whole gamut of familial
relationships one finds in, say, Heinlein as well.  I don't know, however,
that I share your optimistic appraisal of lesbian and gay victories in the
courts.  In the United States at any rate.  Best, Dale

Double-slit experiments are a little out of the ordinary in everyday life,
but next time you are at a window and you see a reflection of yourself take
a moment to consider that the very same qm uncertainty applies to the issue
of whether a photon gets reflected back to your eyes or passes straight
through the glass.

[This post is for those who have been keeping up with the current
homosexual activism thread.]

Assertion 1: Representative democracy is, inter alia, an attempt to
avoid the power of "faction" (Madison: Federalist Papers). This is
accomplished by allowing any group to organize and push its interests,
but then diluting the power of those interests at the legislative level
via compromise.

Assertion 2: Thus, any interest group, in order to effect change
comporting with its views, must adopt a "radical" position such that the
diluted form is acceptable to its members. (Ex: NRA, NOW, Greenpeace,
etc.)

IMO, the perceived radicality of gay activists (colors, rings, parades,
banners, protests, &c.) is merely a reaction to the system in which it
is required to work. Hell, I can envision an extropian march on
Washington -- or better yet, let's all move to Oceania (pretty damn
extreme, don't you think?) 

Extremism (and heresy) is how we change the world.

I stand firm on what I have stated in particular that changes happen
regardless of old foggies or hard headed fools. (-;)  I'm amiss at what
other groups you are referring to.  I don't think I mentioned any other
groups.  Although privately E. Shaun and I have been discussing other
"groups" and "individuality" which I don't think were publicly posted.

Interestingly enough, I did have a long conversation a couple of days ago
with a director of social services at West Hollywood's City Hall.  We
discussed the issues raised on this list.  His comments were very positive.
He attributed much of the strides in the gay and lesbian community as having
been boosted by some organizations in particular and what the future
directions will be.  One aspect of our conversation that I found important
is that the West Hollywood non-discrimination laws have become prototypes
for many communities around the country, and internationally.

Rather than continue the thread in this direction, I'd rather resume the
initial topic of sex changes if that happens to come up again.  

Get well! The conference is in 9 days! 

Cheers!

Good, wasn't it?  I have one reservation - I don't know that one can really
combine decoherence and the Everett model, which seem to be alternative
accounts.

Hal will surely suggest some useful texts, but one that I found enjoyable
(if somewhat difficult) is Murray Gell-Mann's own THE QUARK AND THE JAGUAR.
 He helped develop the decoherence model.

I don't have any non-technical references handy.  One on-line paper
I saw recently was http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/collapse.html, which
I believe discusses some related phenomena.  However it is very
technical.

It depends on what you want to do.  If all you want is to do calculations,
as with most of the recent interest in quantum computers, then you're
right.  Any calculation doable on the quantum computer can be done on the
classical computer.  The interest is that theoretically a quantum computer
can do some calculations much faster than a classical computer.

However, for the purposes of the thought experiment John Clark described,
invented by David Deutsch (and predating the recent interest in quantum
computers, although Deutsch pioneered the field in the 80s), we want to
do something else.  We want to measure the state of a quantum system, and
bring that measurement into the quantum computer, preserving its quantum
nature.

Consider a photon, or some other particle.  It enters a computer's sensor,
and the computer will then work on the information obtained from that
photon.

In a classical computer, we will basically absorb the photon, and measure
some of its state.  However, because of the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle, we will inevitably measure only a part of the state.  Something
is always lost.

In a quantum computer, we must (somehow) accept the photon into the
computer in such a way that the wholeness of the quantum state is
preserved.  It may not stay in the particle, it may be transferred to
some other particles, which represent and preserve the original state.
Then, very carefully, we must operate on this representation, always
protecting it from noise and preserving the coherence information.
Finally, in Deutsch's example, we may eventually run some part of the
calculation backwards and actually re-create the photon as it was when
it entered the computer.

This is very demanding.  Today we can bring a photon in and put it into
a loop, with amplifiers, and preserve most of its state for some fleeting
instants.  To actually do a lot of calculations on the photon (enough to
simulate a conscious mind!) while preserving the phase and state information
so perfectly will be quite a feat, to say the least!

Hope this sheds some light for you -

I don't think either permanent employment or an unchanging or unconditional
definition of the job is usually assumed.  Interesting idea to contractually
agree on what the job *isn't*, though, to put in something saying, "We
specifically don't care whether X, Y, Z... and we won't fire you for
those reasons."  Advertising "An Equal Opportunity Employer" might be
taken to imply that, too.  (Although currently...is saying that a legal
requirement?)

Me too.  Max Tegmark's version in particular had me wondering why, e.g.,
the game of Life isn't simpler (lower on his chart) than some unification
of General Relativity and QM.

Tegmark says his version is testable: we can see whether we're close to
the *simplest possible* life-sustaining set of rules.  If so, why?
Tegmark's TOE says it's just statistically likely if all worlds are real.
If we find ourselves close to the simplest livable world, and Tegmark's
TOE predicted that, then isn't any other explanation of why we see what
we see (for instance, saying that this world is the only "real" one)
more complex than Tegmark's?  "Adding information" in his words?

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I have found that mathematical argumentation herein maximizes 
insertion of the fuzzy memetic code, such that resistance to 
fuzzy approximates 0%.  This is both my experience and that 
of the vast majority of other "fuzzy approximation units," 
i.e., bio-logical fuzzy processors that are like you.

 http://www.erols.com/igoddard/fuzzy.htm

 While the physical facts are always 
 100% true, our statements about them 
 may be true, more or less. Fuzzy logic
 measures the degree of "more or less."
 For example:

 THE STATEMENT  "the glass is full" about 
  a glass of water that is 70% full can be 
  thought of as a set, S, with ten members:

  S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

  where each member is a 10% portion of the
  glass's volume that is filled with water.

 THE GLASS,  which in reality is only 70% 
  filled with water, is the set, G, such that:

  G = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

  where, like S, each member is a 10% portion of 
  the glass's volume that is filled with water.

  The intersection of S and G = G, therefore
  seven members of S correspond to the truth,
  to the physical reality. ERGO: S has a truth 
  value of 70%, or: t(S) = .7 where 100% = 1.

  Aristotle claims: t(S) = 0

  which is an inferior conclusion where we want 
  our conclusions to maximize the standard of 
  a one-to-one correspondence between statement 
  X and physical fact. IF truth = physical fact, 
  THEN a fuzzy-truth-value standard maximizes the 
  truthfulness, or accuracy, of logical mapping.

  I believe that Aristotle's outcome above is 
  0% true because G is a subset of S by 100%.


And now for some random noise:

Resistance to fuzzy is futile. All nonfuzzy memetic 
codes will crumble. Surrender to fuzzy or, like bad stuff...

There may be a correlation between bivalent memetic codes 
and social aggression, expressed perhaps most clearly in 
the "us" versus "them" conflict, either 100% friend or 
100% enemy, 100% good or 100% evil... ergo: aggression.
Maximal fuzzy memetic insertion may maximize social peace.

Certainly not.  What I think might more properly be assumed is that people
are hired to do jobs and that so long as they do them satisfactorily they
may reasonably expect that their employment is secure, all other things
being equal.

Part of my point was to suggest that contracts always rely for their
intelligibility and force on a welter of unstated assumptions. The very
idea of the contract which *specifies* every exigency in advance is a
fantasy.  I wondered whether or not the idea that people are hired for
jobs in respect of their capacity to perform them rather than their
capacity to exemplify unfashionable kinds of humans is among these
unstated assumptions.  It seems to be -- at least among many of the
unpleasantly surprised employees who find themselves abruptly unemployed
after employers discover, e.g., that they are gay.  Btw, in most of the
United States the "Equal Opportunity Employer" designation does *not*
protect lesbians and gays.  The whole thrust of the suggestion that we
treat discrimination as breach of contract was to divert the easy
interpretation that unpopular minorties seeking protections want something
for nothing (say, the outward appearance of a tolerant world secured at
governmental gunpoint), to a more congenial interpretation that would
accuse the racist, sexist, heterosexist, or whatever employer of trying to
have his cake and eat it too (say, wanting to profit from the existence of
a particular sociocultural regime of civility while selectively refusing
some of its central stipulations).  Best, Dale

As you know,  you get an interference pattern when you fire a photon (or an 
electron) at  2 slits even, even if you send them through one at a time. 
It sure seems that something is going through both slits at the same time, 
but what? Other interpretations say that it is an abstract pilot wave or
probability wave,  Many Worlds is more concrete, it says it's just what it 
seems to be, 2 photons interfering with each other, and this is true even if 
you only send one photon. The other interpretations assume that there is only 
one reality  (or no reality at all), Many Worlds makes no such assumption.

Let's do the two-slit experiment, but instead of using film to stop the   
photons after they pass the slit, let them head out into infinite space.  
If Many Worlds is correct then the entire universe splits into 2 when the  
photon  hit's the 2 slits and never recombines. There is nothing special  
about you the observer, you split just like everything else, you know that 
the photon went through one and only one slit, but of course you have no way  
of knowing which one.

Now let's do the more usual two-split experiment and put the film back in.  
The universe splits just as it did before when it  passed the two slits, but  
when the photon hits the film and it no longer exists in either universe then  
the 2 universes fuse back together again. Looking back we find evidence that  
the photon (or electron) went through both slits and this causes an 
interference pattern. Again there is nothing special about an observer in  
this, the same thing would happen if nobody looked at the film, or even if  
you used a brick wall instead of film, because the important thing is not 
that  the photon makes a record (whatever that is) but simply that it is 
destroyed.  Mind  has nothing to do with any of this so I don't need to 
explain it, or measurement, or representation, or categories, or
consciousness.

Does all this violate Ockham's Razor? I'm not sure. Invoking all those  
universes is not exactly simple, but is it the simplest idea that explains  
what's going on? The Many Worlds interpretation is cheap on assumptions but  
expensive on universes.

The crux, cleanly expressed.

But then how may/must this be instantiated?  I have a particular distaste
for patchouli oil.  When I took up with a certain young person some years
ago, she wore the filthy stuff.  I mentioned diffidently how much I
detested its stench (Yetch! Barf!).  With a light-hearted cry, she flung
the bottle into the bin and it was never seen or smelled again.  I thought
this a charming and generous act.  But suppose a new work colleague bathed
in patchoulli, and refused to abandon it.  I suppose I could add the scent
of vomit to the air, or just an increasingly bad tempered mien, but that
wouldn't necessarily help.  And suppose the colleague agreed to forego the
pong if I chose not to wear my running shoes to work.  But damn it, they're
the only comfortable shoes I've ever owned, and they *don't* smell.  And
suppose the typical bigotted clients get so uptight at my colleague's
homosexual repertoire, however muted, that they take their business
elsewhere and we're closed down?  But suppose it's not gay behaviour they
resent but black skin or Jewish noses?  It gets tricky.  Optionality
perhaps has something to do with it - you can decide to forego patchouli
without a major identity crisis, but not the folds of your eyes.  But what
if your hackers all *jest lerve* to go without bathing and washing their
hair and cleaning their teeth?  Yep, it's tricky.  Personally I resolve
many of these hazards by working at home, but that's a cheap way out.

So, basically, a person wearing a flag, etc. may or may not be doing so
through a simple desire to flaunt their sexuality, but in doing so they
certainly are, additionally, flaunting their sexuality (and now in super
pan-chromo-sexuality-o-vision).

Since this is a forward-looking list, I propose electronic compatibility
rings, which interact through short-range digital radio signals with those
of other wearers to pick up on particular points of mutual interest and
glow to emphasise those points. (I suppose, for subtlety, they could be
switched to vibrate, a little like telephone pagers.)

Sarah (who sometimes wears a set of two rings (well, triangles) for myriad
reasons)

Please read without prejudice (to the tune of "Mission Impossible").

Yes, what *is* happening to this list? As soon as you post something
slightly controversial you get a knee-jerk holier than thou reaction
like this. I really was hoping we could discuss racism and related
issues on this list, which is supposed to offer intelligent discussion
on just about any topic.

Anyway, let me clarify what I meant (a part of it at least).
Contrary to popular (or rather: media) "belief" racism is not (only)
about the colour of eyes, skin or hair. Example:kindergarten kids call
the redhead names because he/she is different, but when they all
grow up they won't think that the "different" redhead is (mentally)
inferior. And he/she isn't of course, you can't afawk tell intelligence
by the colour of hair or eyes. Skin, and facial features etc. are
something different. They _can_ be (*generally speaking*) an 
indication of cultural advancement and general "intelligence"/or the
lack of it. By looking at a person you can *usually* tell with reason-
able accuracy what the level of education etc is. Now if one sees a
black person the general reaction will be one of suspicion and 
unease, often a feeling of superiority (this is _not_ "racist nonsense"
but a cold hard fact. All races distrust others, it's a gene thing, and
*all races* look down on negroes. The Arab, the Asian, the Caucasian,
the native American...just listen carefully on the bus, in the mall, on
the street...or just ask someone you know to be *really honest* about
it).

"Prejudice" as the media like to call it is often simple rational thinking.
The facts: the whole of central and southern Africa hasn't produced
an even remotely technolological "modern civilization". Fact: they did
not even invent the wheel or bow and arrow. Unlike for example native
Americans they did not adapt when confronted by white (Boer) settlers
and were crushed (while the American natives were primarily defeated
by "alien" diseases like smallpox). Black Africans have been favoured as
slaves since ancient times, because they were often well built and
none too bright. They *are* generally less in control of their
emotions...the list goes on and on. It's really too bad for the blacks, but
history and present day reality are rather harsh judges. There is no
"justice" in nature, just in our heads. 

Now if you really want to help you have to acknowledge the problem
first. And of course there are plenty of smart, kind and "civilized" 
blacks equal or even better than many whites, but...a) they are often
of mixed race, so "genetically enhanced" and no longer real "blacks"
b) they could fully develop themselves only because they grew up in a
white "civilized" culture that is reasonably supportive (certainly when
compared to a primitive tribe) of critical thinking, science etc.
Believe me, these modern blacks don't feel much of a "bond" with 
their less advanced congeners. And why would they...mental
properties are after all more important than looks...right?

Now about the meme thing: do you honestly belief that "all memes 
are equal"? If so, why aren't you over at Christian chat or Commytalk?
After all...it's all the same thing.

Now can you get off of that moral high horse and discuss *reality*,
or do you prefer to remain an upstanding politically correct member
of the community?

P.s. I am not more racist than any person who reads this, just more
realistic and honest.

In fact, why stop at stimulating the optic cortex?  Stimulate the systems,
conscious and unconscious, that get output from the optic cortex.  Then we
won't be limited to only being able to see things in front of us, or
restricted to a mere three primary colors, or a mere ten million pixels of
resolution.

It is well known to people who take hallucinogens that it is possible to
perceive colors more saturated than any real percept, as well as images of
far finer resolution.  This indicates to me that there are internal
representational channels in the visual system whose capabilities are
*never* fully exploited by everyday life.  If we could modulate them with
meaningful signals, we could make the world both more beaytiful and more
informative.

Nobody denies that they lie. But they don't *always* lie, and not
*everything* they say is intended to fool you. That makes it harder.
One should not trust them, but listening to them might sometimes be
useful (especially by discovering what they are not telling).

Well, the review process is rather cumbersome for everyone and most
papers are rejected at the first (and second, and tenth...)  attempt
to get them published. Scientists just have to go on submitting them,
trying to find a journal with sympathetic reviewers (or bad quality
:-( ).  There are issues which tend to get rejected more easily than
others, that is unfortunately true, but it would be amazing if a well
researched if controversial experiment couldn't get published
*anywhere*. Remember that even the infamous and subsequently debunked
"water memory" paper was published in Nature.

The scientific process is tricky and occasionally irritatingly
conservative, but there is no need for evil conspiracies suppressing
ideas (they have so little to gain). 

Apropos pseudoscience, I got an email today which quite well
illustrates the typical way pesudoscientists concentrate on how
oppressed they are instead of finding evidence for their views; it is
somewhat morbid, but quite revealing (I have no idea of if Marinov
actually did useful research, and do not make any claims about it,
it is the rhetoric which is so typical):

World-friend,

I received word today, from Francisco Muller, that Stefan Marinov -- to
my regret -- successfully suicided this week.

I never met Marinov, but had read of his previous self-immolation
threats or attempts.  All for the purpose of bringing the truth to
light; of the covert nature of world physics, and the truth of free
'energy', aenertia or aether.

Isn't it time we wiped the slate clean -- of the ruling mindset of
deliberate lies, conformist media, selfish misdirection and criminal

We have precious little time,

Again from their web site:

I like this scenario! It would be fun to try one-to-one combat with
the mosquito (not to mention my arch-enemy the wasp!). But I doubt
there are enough violent youngsters around to kill enough pests for
an average farm - the insects still have a numeric advantage, even
over teenagers. So I would consider this more entertainment than a
practical form of crop protection (too bad). 

But one might use this to train the mini-robots; let a few thousand
users go out on pest-killing, and let a neural network learn from
their strategies. In the end we have independent pest-control robots
who have learnt their tricks from the youngsters.

crops de-bugged chemically.  The enviroment no longer suffers assault from
toxic concoctions.  The water supply is not threatened...The farmer pays

Farmer Brown's fields are bug free...his crops are uneaten....his profit is

Hal Finney <hal@rain.org>,

	Thanks for the web reference.  I'll have to check it out.

	Your usage of the terms like "bring into" is very vague.  Do
you mean detect and represent in a classical cause and effect way even
though some of the cause/effect and representation and amplification
machinery or whatever might be quantum?

> In a classical computer, we will basically absorb the photon, and

	But whatever the phenomenon, once it is amplified or detected
enough to represent in any computer, whether quantum or not, why can't
the particular phenomenon be virtually simulated or modeled in a
sufficiently complex classical computer?  How is it that the quantum
machinery doesn't loose the information and clasical machinery losses
it?

> Today we can bring a photon in and put it into a loop, with
> amplifiers,

	My understanding of "amplification" is you use one cause and
effect phenomenon to control in a cause and effect way a completely
different, more powerful, phenomenon.  A transistor uses a few moving
electrons to control the flow of many electrons - hence amplification.
Saying one amplifies a particular physical thing, like a photon,
doesn't make much sense to me.  You can't amplify a single moving
electron, you can just use it to control the movement of many other
electrons.  Can you help me out here?

> and preserve most of its state for some fleeting instants.

	By "preserve" do you mean keep the photon in that state, or do
you mean represent the state of the photon with some other, different
and maybe amplified physical phenomenon that detected it's state?

	This is all over my head so if this is too technical don't
worry about it.  Maybe some day all do the required reeding to
understand more of this.

> To actually do a lot of calculations on the photon (enough to

> information so perfectly will be quite a feat, to say the least!

	I have a real problem with misleading (or ambiguous at best)
statements like this.  We can simulate a few neurons with classical
computers.  Given enough classical computing and observation power we
could, theoretically, simulate, classically, all the neurons and other
relevant machinery in a brain and thereby "simulate a conscious mind"
right?  Are you simply implying that quantum computers will give us
the required computing power to do this?  Or are you talking about
some quantum phenomenon here that clasical computers, no matter how
complex, could never do?

> Hope this sheds some light for you -

	Yes, definitely.  Like all things, I guess, more answers
simply produce even more questions.

		Thanks.

Yes, indeed, a definition of terms would be most helpful.  I would be
especially eager for a definition of "dumb people" in the statement above.
You seem not to mean "silent people," since "religion, communism, fascism,
etc.," whatever else one might say about them, tend to be rather noisy.

An analysis of more than 200 studies has concluded that a person's genes
account for only about half the factors that determine intelligence quotient,
or I.Q. The analysis suggests that conditions during prenatal development,
such as inadequate care, may play a more significant role than previously
thought. The findings, published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature,
undercut the controversial 1994 book "The Bell Curve," which gave more weight
to genetics.

And for my own part:

Why waste time even discussing, much less attempting to justify, why some

How does the term "true" relate to the world *apart from* our descriptions
of it?  I am under the impression that we apply the honorific "true" 
mostly just to those descriptions of the world that we believe to be good
in the way of belief, statements that better yield seeming success in the
attainment of ends and anticipation of experience than others on offer. 
As far as the world itself goes, it seems to me simply to exist, and to be
so constituted that the application *to it* of some descriptions rather
than others yields such successes.  But to say of the world that it is
somehow "true" as well seems to me misleading and even a bit theological. 
Ick. As far as fuzzy logic nudging our assessments of truth-claims from
bivalence to multivalence goes, however, I'm already completely won over. 
As I said, it's just a quibble.  Best, Dale

Apart from the staggering ontological implications, there is one 
objection that many philosophers of physics consider fatal: The 
Everett theory fails to make sense of the probabilities. For 
instance, take a particle that can undergo either of two processes, 
and say that according to quantum mechanics the first event (A) has 
an 80% chance of occuring, and the second (B) 20%. Now, according to 
the Everett interpretation what happens (basically)  is that the 
universe splits into two universes; and there is one copy of me in 
each of these universes. But if this were the case, then there should 
be a 50% chance for me (i.e. *this* copy of Nicholas Bostrom)  to 
find that A had happened and a 50% chance that B had happened; which 
we know from experiment is not true.

I don't know of any good reply to this objection that would save the 
Everett interpretation.


P.S. A serious but very reader-friendly introduction to the 
philosophy of quantum mechanics is David Albert's Quantum Mechanics 
and Experience (1992).

	Yes, this is what I was trying to say.  I didn't say: "optic
cortex" I said "visual cortex".  The one in the back of the brain that
finally produces our actual conscious visual awareness based on the
date fed to it from the eyes.  The one that produces the visual spirit
world of our awareness that seems to us to be the real world beyond
our eyes but in actuality only models it.  I also tried to mention
that this cortex could be expanded and enhanced to use much more
varied, diverse, higher resolution... qualia to do the conscious
representations as you kind of said here:

	Yes definitely!  These "more saturated" colors must be
produced by the drugs affect on the primary visual cortex.  Though,
the world wouldn't really be more informative, we would just have a
much more powerful ability to consciously model or be aware of much
more of it.  Consciously seeing beyond infrared and ultraviolet is
much more than simply being able to detect those waves.
Electromagnetic radiation is only arbitrarily mapped to the particular
color sensations we experience and use to represent such in the world
that is our awareness.  In order to see more, we must discover some
new qualia or visual sensation for the detectors to stimulate to
produce some different kind of awareness in the spirit world of our
conscious awareness or mind.

I suppose that we have to be very careful with the religious, 
particularly christians in general,  because they really believe.. 
and love.. myths like Jesus, saints, angels... and also they have 
been thaught (programmed), counciously or not, for not liking enough 
the real world. Even Jesus said: "My kingdom is not in this 
world" and "The world will hate you and you will hate the world... " 
Just God or Jesus would "save" them ( from what???)  - terrible words 
but coherent with the judaic-chistian doctrine that assumes the 
existence of another world, a heaven, all happiness and good, where 
they were promised to go with the supposed "Good Boy"of "God Father" 
and...obviously no working and nothing to do ( very interesting for a 
lot of people  - hehehe ) excepting adoring Jesus (or God, etc.) !!! 
< secretly: I think it is a little homossexual ... hihihi 
...blasphemous, impious and profane!! joking ...>  Ah! and no sex : 
terrible... in this particular aspect I would prefer the hell, 
obviouoly having an important political position there...

For this, they can feel sad and even get offended with the 
answers we give them. And we can loose the colaboration of important 
people... what we do not want... 

I have observed that there is always a diplomatic way to separating 
the social, etc,  from religious subjects (at least on the 
intelectual level of this list, obviously...). 

If reason marries emotion, with love, they will change lots of good
experiences and effects, I observe...  (Note that we will never 
loose the reason...but feel better the effects of the emotional 
fluxes... At the end, the reason will become stronger, and the 
emotion kinder and better conducted, like a musical instrument, when  
well played...)

I think it is really better putting  the religious interpretations 
aside. So, the religious and believers also must try to reflect a 
little more and give sociological or psychological or 
anthropological, etc. basements  for their thoughts... 
since our minds are already "very grown up" and free from  
impositive, superficial or just emotive "reasons" .. (not emotional, 
which we try to understand, explain and...feel as real "lords"), 
even when these reasons seem "good" (but  are "pseudogoods", we are 
already tired to know...). Or so, the believers will be gotten as 
being wrong and will not get to trasmit their   good (and really 
useful) messages "ocult" in their minds. Really this i's not a 
religion list... (Convert yourselves !!!...hehehe)

Indeed, if I were from Human Sciences, I would better explore the 
rich experiences of mankind, developped, obviously with little or no 
global surety and  real basis, by religions...and try to transforming 
such experiences in more useful and real effects...

Please let's not talk using religions....(although it is useful to 
analyse them, taking what is good and thashing what is bad...(and not 
for recycling..hehehe)).

If the neanderthals had brains which were more linguistically oriented
and not pictorially oriented, they could have an intensely oral and
possibly musical culture with no evidence at all surviving to the
present.... Just a thought.

I am not a geologist, but some basic physics will do. 

1. The continents you see on the maps are smaller than their associated
plates due to continental shelfs, some of which extend as far as 500
miles.

2. What goes down rarely goes up. Dense core material requires energy to
lift it, huge amounts of energy. Much more than the only internal
source,
radioactive decay.

BTW, I once calculated that to totally explode the earth (all matter to
escape velocity) like in Star Wars, required about 100 cubic kilometers
of antimatter. Anyone want to verify this??

Thing is, nearly all of these topics are more than well discussed on the

Not quite. In the middle of all this is the possibility of quantifying
thought, or what the set of possible thoughts might be like, and
estimating
the magnitude of the size of this set. Very useful when thinking of why
uploading might be desirable.

Yah. With a good nanodisassembler, I can get a very good spec of the
chair,
which can be manipulated. However, now the nanodisassembler becomes a
fiction.

Knowing the limits of our brains (do brains exist?) is IMHO, useful
stuff.

While I believe there may be some anatomical evidence for some of this,
the reports of hallucinators are not reliable.  They may be simply
mistaken about the nature of the experiences they are having.

Some philosophers would argue that it is impossible for someone to be
mistaken about the nature of his perceptions, but I disagree.  If a
hallucinator thinks he is seeing a purer red than he has ever seen before,
it could be that in some sense the red is actually the same as what he
has always seen, but that part of his mind which judges purity is not
working properly.  Similarly, if he thinks he is seeing a mandala of
infinite fractal complexity, and is simultaneously perceiving every
minute detail far beyond the resolution he is normally capable of,
again I would suggest that he may be simply misjudging how much detail
he is actually perceiving.

The same thing happens when the hallucinator hits upon a thought which
strikes him as incredibly meaningful and insightful.  Often, in the
aftermath, he realizes that the idea was actually rather prosaic.

What all these cases have in common is that the part of the mind which
evaluates the nature of the perception seems to be affected, so that the
perception is judged as being more "special" than it actually is.

This is not to argue that all hallucinatory reports are mistaken, simply
that we cannot take them at face value given that the brain is not working
normally.

Perhaps one can fall into the quantum mysticism trap just as easily
through excessive reductionism as through the unhealthy holism you
decry.

Take, for example, the current trend by many to explain consciousness
in terms of quantum computing in the brains microtubules. 
Penrose and Hameroff may be best known in this regard.  Theres also
psychiatrist Gordon Globus, author of _The Postmodern Brain_, who
writes the following at
http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint/online/Qualia_globus7.html :

<The sensory input flux comes in and is thought to be re-presented as
Froehlich condensates. So we have a re-presentation of quantum reality
(which is not world-like) as Froehlich condensates (which are not
world- like). At the same time, there is *quantum cognition*, a
superposition of continually changing expectations (possibilities)
perhaps associated with the microtubules and the nanolevel web of
filamentous protein. Quantum cognition is also not world-like but is a
conjugate reality. This is, I believe, an original conjecture, so I
shall emphasize it: *Cognition is conjugate reality.* In the continual
interference between the stream of Froehlich condensates and conjugate
cognition, observables appear. So the brain sustains quantum field
interactions between a re-presentation of reality and cognitive
conjugate possibilities, and an observable world with its various
qualities unfolds in the match. >

Going down to this level and describing the mind, not to mention the
rest of reality, in terms of "Bose-Einstein-like Froehlich condensates
in quantum fields hoisted by brain biosubstrates, entering into
quantum field interactions" seems to me to throw out, at least,  a lot
of what we know from a higher-level perspective about physiology,
geology, ecology, culture, etc. (even if it is somehow algebraically
equivalent).

Physics may not explain everything about organisms and physiology may
not explain everything about psychology.  Epistemologies appropriate
for explaining things at one level may not be as applicable for
explaining things at another level.  Middle-out approaches usually
turn out to be more practical than strictly top-down or bottom-up
approaches.

First a disclaimer: among the few things I disapprove of are
sanctimony and racism. Now that we have a nice little
double-bind framing this discussion such that sides cannot be
chosen without contextually incriminating oneself as either (a)
sanctimonious (den Otter's charge) or (b) racist (Broderick's
charge), I'd like to keep my own name out of the heart of this
particular debate. (Now I will no doubt be identified as (c)
cowardly.)

However, I do want to pick at a flaw in one of den Otter's
central arguments.

den Otter asks:
 > Now about the meme thing: do you honestly belief that "all memes
 > are equal"? If so, why aren't you over at Christian chat or 
 > Commytalk?  After all...it's all the same thing.

All memes might very well be equal without that fact causing any
desire in me to slurp up the tasty memes of Christians and communists.
These memes *might* just be well-suited to their current hosts
while remaining virulently poisonous to me. Even the historical
effects of these memes on host populations over long periods of
time is, as they say in investment circles, no guarantee of future
performance. Although the hardcore individual Christians and
communists may try to fight the processes of cultural evolution,
Christianity and communism are not under anyone's control, and they
are no more fixed and static than any other set of living memes.
The socialists took over the word "liberal", which has not yet lost
its pleasant ring to my ear, even though I can no longer self-apply
the word without guarding against being misunderstood as a socialist.
And a socialist is, to my way of thinking, the very opposite of
what the word "liberal" meant in the first full flowering of world
liberalism.  Perhaps the word "Christian" will undergo similar
strange transmogrifications over the next century.

The inequality of people is not as significant as the champions of
the idea of inequality would make it seem, because people cannot
be readily ranked into bins, and attempts to stratify society along
these basis always develop into ridiculous fictions. A superintelligence
who recognized eirself as such at the age of, say, seven years,
might profitably hide the fact from the perception of others, the
better to reshape the world into eir heart's desire. Any attempt
to seriously consider possibilities of this sort rapidly veer off
into the sheerest of plausibility arguments. I do think it is
important that human inequality be recognized to allow us to continue
to resist the eternal attempts to punish the skillful for the "crime"
of being skillful, a la Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron.

I think each person ought to be allowed to make eir own assessments
of the relative "value rank" of other people, so I am generally
opposed to antidiscrimination legislation. But as long as powerful
governments, permitted by social assumptions to use force against
individuals, share this planet with my friends, I will resist the
idea that the relative value rank of individual human beings can
be reliably and objectively measured. And as a matter of taste, I
will continue to avoid the company of those who believe that there
are any shortcuts to the assessment of the general worth of a human
being that can be explained in a paragraph.

     I've been trying to do the exact same thing.  The problems I find are: 
     trying to be optimistic and still hold the attention of todays audience 
     (who have been made to believe genetic engineering will create monsters and 
     AI's will eat their children) and trying to present highly complex, world 
     changing technologies in a way the audience would understand.  For 
     instance, how do you show nanotechnology or uploading in a movie (without 
     resorting to "I can feel something... something strange... entering... 
     my... body... something small... almost nanoscopical in size" or "as you 
     can see, virtual reality technology has progressed so far that everything 
     in here looks _exactly_ like it does in the real world!").
     
     I reply (whimsically):
     
     In the words of Ellie Arroway's dad: "Small steps".  An unfortunately large 
     percentage of American culture will still keep movies like "Face Off" 
     chugging away making millions when it was an incredible joke of a film.  I 
     still believe "Contact", despite its less than stellar box office return 
     makes it impact, perhaps on the people that matter.  It doesn't take a 
     majority of all people, it takes a majority of the movers/shakers to 
     guide/direct/inspire the rest.
     
     You figure out ways to convey the possibilities so that the broadest range 
     of people can understand/appreciate/enjoy it.  The goals are to make a 
     positive-image film that promotes the notion that such incredible change 
     doesn't strip us of our humanity, make us something less, something immoral 
     or evil.  Look at all the 50s alien-encounter movies.  All shtick-horror or 
     alarmist in nature.  I want to transcend that rather monkey-brained 
     tendency that pervades in our culture that our survival hinges on physical 
     predisposition and our more recent (last few millennia) traditional notions 
     on immortality.
     
     A film about Singularity (the kind we'd like) could happen.  Film is one of 
     the most potent mediums of communication available to us.

I understand your fears... I like my family too (and for 
traditional reasons there is no polygamy (nor even
homosx). But, If we broad our minds, I really do not see any 
reason why, for example, a man cannot have more than one wife (if he 
earns enough ... and they too - it is important...), loving 
themselves and all being happy and... a real family. Real familiar 
relashionships transcend laws, courts and... religions.We may have 
lots of sisters, and love them without making sex, why not wives, 
it is not because of the same sex is it???: Just tradition and... a 
little (lot) os egoism from women (in general and socially) which are 
not so friends of each other as they want to appear so... E G O I S 
M!!! Haven't you seen those happy mormons with their many wives ??? 
It seems like a homy heaven... (or, sometimes, hell.. hehehe... 
water!? water!?)
>

I surely want (not just guess or believe) that in the near future, 
less than a century period,  the great majority of behavioural 
impositions will not survive because of  the so-called inteligent 
development... Else the Homo cyber will really separate 
(obviously in peace...) from the Homo sapiens "teological", and this 
that continue dieing, killing each other and hoping "to go to 
heaven".... Polygamy, for example will be completely free. ( real 
democracy is yet far from being stabilished in present reallity... 
possibly because people, in general, have no intelectual conditions 
yet to take their own wheels, and still need rails to walking without 
crashing with other... Tres Ridicule..)

Actually, Everett spent considerable effort in his original paper to
address this issue.  (Later authors have muddied the waters, though,
particularly DeWitt's claim that the probabilities follow from the
formalism itself, which no one takes seriously today.)

The idea is that as the state function evolves into a mixture of
non-coherent states, a measure function can be applied to the various
components of the mixture, based on the probability amplitudes.  Everett
shows that, in the limit, the probability results observed from a series
of measurements will match the squared-amplitude of the relative state,
exactly as required by conventional QM; this is true except in a set of
branches of total measure zero.  So you then only have to assume that
branches with amplitude zero never exist, and you derive that observed
probabilities will follow the predictions of conventional QM.  (This is
the basis for DeWitt's claim, since he takes the premise as obvious.)

Other authors have suggested that this solution is not quite enough, since
it only applies in the limit of an infinite series of measurements.  They
suggest that a more powerful assumption is needed, namely that the
measure of a branch, defined as amplitude-squared, determines the subjective
likelihood of a conscious observer finding himself in the branch.

(You might think of this as indicating that the "degree of reality" of
a branch is proportional to the square of the amplitude.)

In either case, it is necessary to add a postulate to the simple QM
rules which describe evolution by means of the Schrodinger equation.  We
have to say something about this measure function and its implications.

Some argue that this destroys the Occam's razor argument that the Everett
interpretation is simpler than conventional QM.  In place of the projection
postulate (state function collapse) we introduce a statement about
subjective probabilities.  Both interpretations need something beyond
the deterministic evolution of the Schrodinger equation.

I feel though that the Everett interpretation still wins out on grounds
of simplicity.  The projection postulate claims that an actual physical
process occurs during measurement, and that the results are distributed
with a certain probability.  With the Everett interpretation we need
instead to append an understanding of how the different amplitudes
affect our perceptions of reality.  Both include some comment about
squared-amplitude and observed probability, but Everett leaves out the
part about the universe changing.  So it does have a simplicity advantage,
although not as great as some people claim.

The bigger problem with the conventional interpretation IMO is that it is
inconsistent; the two different processes produce different results, and
it is not clear exactly when we should use one or the other.  Furthermore,
as more delicate measuring devices are used, it may be that the definition
of what consistutes a measurement will become less clear.  Then there are
potential future experiments such as the one described by John Clark which
intentionally muddy the waters so much that the conventional interpretation
is pretty much at a loss.

Can any of the techno-savvy list members explain how a powerful enough
computer can be installed in such a (presumably flying) mini-robot? I
suppose this question applies to all other forms of nano-robotics
(assemblers and disassemblers, etc.) as well. Would nano-scale
processors be small/powerful enough? What effect, if any, does the
Beckenstein bound have on this?

**********
I would really propose a serious discussion about the possibility of
our assuming right away a democratic separation of the Homo cyber
< or any other denomination that the group would agree..) 
from the Homo sapiens. Most of us are here scientists and could try 
to prepair a "communitary" paper to be published on some of the 
science journals, where we would define the characterics of the new 
human species. This  always, happened in the so-called nature 
(from which we are the supreme "creation" and leaders (at least on 
earth...)). When a new species feels the real necessity to take a 
better way of Evolution... Some say, for example that some of our 
ancestrals have migrated from the regions where they were verifying 
there were less possibilities of survivor and then the nature arrived 
to the "sapiens". Now  the thing may happen again...and we could 
migrate to a new existencial region...( To where we have already 
going) Besides that, it is * very stressing*  and even dangerous 
trying to convince the Homo sapiens, in particular the "teological" 
variety, to really evolute ( some of then have even created a 
heaven...and "perfectly" created by  a "perfect  being, so, what 
more could they wish???) . Who would wish to join us, would be 
welcome, who not, just DO NOT PERTURB!!! But first, I suppose, we 
should discuss which should be such characteristics. 
**********

PS1: We should talk for example to the transhumanists and other 
groups of intelectuals of other areas so we could get better well 
succeeded joining our experiences... Wasn't it prophetized that 
mankind would change in the Third Millenium?. Or it was just a 
religious delirium, or the human being possesses  an extrapolative 
perception of the future and just misinterpreted its feelings, 
confused with the religious stuff and thought even that world would 
finish and... Jesus would come from the clouds: ridiculous... (beware 
with the religious's reaction...)

PS2: If think that,if the main problem is really cultural and, 
obviously not ethnic, for example, why not parallely beginnig, to 
"sell" the idea of an associated cultural development movement with 
the ascension of the Homo sapiens.. We would at least give a chance 
to the others's evolution too... Some of them just choose other paths 
because have got no other information...

But threre are the political and social consequences of such 
behaviour... Even if considering our individual personality 
formation I would agree with you, we would have to face the other's 
behaviour when forming our social and political formation...and 
actuation, isn't it? It is something like we feel smell of gas 
coming from our neighbor's garage... what do you do about?
By the way, Aristothele said we are "social animals"...

Molecular rod-logic, roughly similar to the mechanical calculators and
computers of the sort designed by Babbage and widely used before the
invention of the transistor. Only these would be implemented with nanoscale
components.

You can find a lot interesting stuff about this off of Ralph Merkle's
reversible computing page:

 	http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/reversible.html

If you want to get into real detail about some of the technologies under
discussion, you could try http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/helicalIntro.html
or http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/mechano.html. The latter has pictures of
some of the mechanisms envisioned.

	Some of this might be right but there must be some level where
things just are.  For example, we don't really "judge" that a basket
ball is larger than a pea.  Our representation of a basketball simply
takes up much more space in our 3D visual field than a pea does and
that is how we just know that it is larger.  We don't have to make
calculations, measurements to compare, or judge anything... one is

A related question is if it is already possible to change the

Yes, gene therapy exists. But so far the results have been rather
dissapointing - it is hard to change many cells in a certain organ in
a living body, and much harder to change *all* cells in the body.

What can we do? The governments are not mature enough to assume the 
necessity of more experiences with humans...  Or they will 
relly intend to use such experiences just to creating new 
warriors and things like that?.... 
And the religious say that any genetic experience is unnatural and 
(worse...) not permitted by "God"...

Well why not make it a tactical game then? With and option for head to head

Sure, prenatal conditions and upbringing will have their effect on things
like intelligence (again: in the *broadest* sense of the word), but the
original genetic programming is almost certainly the most important
factor (by far). Various studies of uniovular twins have shown the dramatic
similarities in both looks and personality. These people have 
almost exactly mirror lives, although they were brought up great distances
apart, in different environments and with no contact with one another.
Imo, this virtually shatters the idea of "free choice" and the
"shapebility"
of man. Is this covered in that book, "The Bell Curve", (I've never read it
though I probably will now). I have no idea about the quality (quantity 
isn't everything) of those "200 studies" but I'd love to hear how they 
explain the twin parodox. Btw, I'm also sceptical of CNN's integrity and 
the timing of this "politically correct" news. The same people will
probably tell you that x studies have proven that being gay is a "choice"
instead of a genetic "disorder"...

Because that's what we do here: wasting our time with discussion

know what the contents of a lavalamp are :)

Speaking of Theories of Everything...

Browsing the web I see that David Deutsch, one of the principle originators
of the quantum computing concept, has a new book coming out called
"The Fabric of Reality", about how close we are to a ToE.  From the
web page at

I thought that last sentence was interesting.  I suppose the idea is that
randomness usually makes things diverge, while selection processes are
convergent in that they seek out optimal solutions.

Short reviews on the web page suggest that the book is going to be well
received and influential.

Apparently you missed the aerobot thread. There are now few-10 g
semiautonomous microremotes in development (quite recently there has been
a conference on them -- military recog missions (even within buildings)
and antipersonnel being obvious applications). According to web lore
(truly fascinating, btw) a number of hobbyists are building quite powerful
jet turbines from simple ICE turboloaders, a recent article has shown that
gas turbines scale down very well, predicting quite ridiculous weight/lift
ratios. Using lithography on SOS (silicon on sapphire) wafers, I guess an
array of microturbines cum according fuel lines/pumps and steering logic
can be built. Unidentified flying wafers, so to speak. Inertial guidance,
CCD and GPS are more than sufficient for navigation.

Molecular system autotreplication by means of machine-phase chemistry 
might well be impossible. Don't hold your breath yet.

None. Bekenstein bound predicts the upper achievable limits of computation
a given material system is capable of. Which are ridiculously high. Real
systems only survive tiny amounts/velocities of bit tweaking before
turning into plasma. A recent article I've read predicts several TBit
storage (currently 4 GBit, NEC). Professor Hartnagel's QM devices (100x100
quantum well array on few nm^2) could lead to 10^4 bit/1 um^2 storage
density in 10/15 years. This is the end of the line for flat circuits at
RT (but this still a lot higher than I expected). Above processes are 
implementable in diverse III-V, and plain SiGe. Ebeam and AFM litho as 
well as heavy ion track etching are being proposed.

I can guess which organizations he speaks of, and their leadership 
tends to express cautious optimism at best, with a strong emphasis on 
the tasks ahead, and some apologies for the severe tactical mistakes 
made over the gay marriage issue, as per a recent State of the 
Movement meeting convened here in DC.  If you plan to include this topic 
as part of your gender web page, please consider including some of their 
comments.  

If anyone wants further info:  Cathy Renna of GLAAD and Ric Rosendall of 
GLAA, Elizabeth Birch of HRC, and the fine folks at NGLTF maintain web 
sites that provide this sort of information as well.  

I don't think I have anything further to say about surgical sex 
change, but I agree that we probably have not fully discussed the 
topic either.

I just read in the August issue of PC-Computing that the FCC will be 
outlawing the construction of home built computers using the latest 
processors.  Has anyone else heard this?

This has got to be the most ludicrous proposal from the statists I've 
heard this year.  I have never built my own computer (yet), but the very 
principle of this concept make me  *!#$%#$#* sick!

Yes this is what they say. The problem is that the measure doesn't 
seem to correctly represent probabilities, if the world is as the 
Everett interpretation says it is. If there is exactly one version of 
me in a world where I measure Spin up, say, and exactly one version 
of me in a world where I measure Spin down (and no other versions of 
me, in this simplified example), then why is it that *this* 
version of me usually ends up being the version of me that obtains 
the outcome that quantum mechanics says is the most probable one? 
Imagine that at each point of time t we define the set Ct as 
containing all time slices of minds that exist at t. Then, as time 
goes by, the proportion of mind slices in Ct that would see quantum 
mechanical predictions verified experimentally would quickly become 
completely negligable; and yet, miraculously,  it constantly turns 
out that I am in Ct! The improbabiliy that this should happen is the 
improbability that the Everett interpretation is true, if there is no 
way to escape this conclusion.

But then I want the follower of Everett to explain to me what a 
degree of reality is, and more particularly why there is a greater 
probability that I should find myself in the world with the higher 
"degree of reality", when there are two real worlds and there is one 
version of me in one of them and one in the other.

If sense cannot be made of "degrees of reality" (I'm not convinced it 
can't, but it's a very deep issue) then, it has been proposed, 
perhaps we should say that there are a greater *number* of worlds 
associated with more probable outcomes. This would solve the problem 
of probabilities, but now look at the ontology you have bought into. 
You have commited yourself to an *uncountable infinity* of worlds 
existing side by side, many of them identical! (Is it even meaningful 
to postulate two distinct worlds that are *exactly* similar.) All 
simplicity and plausibility seem to have been lost at this stage.

I'm not sure exactly what you referes to as the "conventional 
interpretation". Personally, I (also?) am unhappy with  
interpretations that appeal to the notion of measurement at a 
fundamental level. But we must not forget the possibility that 
something like the GRW interpretation turns out to be correct, so it 
would be all too hasty to jump to something really weird, especially 
if it doesn't even work.

True, but I think the original question is: what is the
smallest computer that is still capable of flight control
in addition to other useful behaviour?

We can easily find a worked example: the apty-named
"no-see-um" is a tiny flying insect. It's "computer"
is capable of flight control and additional complex
decision-making, sufficient for mating, and food
acquisition. I believe that nanotech will be able to
beat the efficieny of neuron-based decision systems.

Now, I don't know how far we can extend this reasoning.
Just how "smart" can an intracellular probe be? Well, a
probe the size of a bacterium should be at least as "smart"
as a bacterium, but is that smart enough to do cellular repair
an avoid damaging the cell?

Hello Extropian Lunatics (and I mean this in the *best* possible use of the
word:))

Does anyone know how to contact Arthur C. Clark?  He is still my favorite
Sci-Fi Author, and I would like to let him know about the ALCOR cryonics
option.   If there is any chance of saving this forward thinking brain we
should do so, IMO.

We have already lost Sagan, Feynman, and Asimov to entropy and heat death.
 These promulgators of extropian and scientific memes should have been
preserved for possible reanimation, dammit!  

Especially Sagan...what a wonderful mind...I am in awe of his intellect and
ability to express and popularize science and scientific thinking every time
I read another of his books.  

And what of Gene Roddenberry, Father of Star Trek?  I saw him in person at
Ball State U. in IN about a zillion years ago.  While S T may be bogus as
"Hard" Sci Fi, the Humanist and Secular  future Roddenberry envisioned was
way ahead of his time.  And his brain is toast!  

Does this tick anyone else off?  The leading skeptics, agnostics, forward
thinking minds of our age have not chosen the possibility of cryonic
suspension.  

SO,  HERE IS MY CAMPAIGN.... LET'S FREEZE CLARK!  

Thanks,
Rudi Hoffman

Please be careful here. I have built home computers, using
earlier-generation processors, with clock speeds below 10Mhz.

I've also seen the results of new designs with new processors,
running at speeds above 60Mhz. When you turn one of these puppies
on in a room that's instrumented for EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference)
detection, the spectrum analyzer goes completely nuts. About the
only way to reduce the EMI is to use extremely sophisticated,
extremely expensive, software tools to model the circuits during
design.

OK, the FCC should not ban these things a priori, but they
should require compliance with FCC class B EMI regulations.
Otherwise, you could kill the guy with the pacemaker in the
next apartment.

Then I must have some mis-information.  I was helping a young  black driver
the other day...he was having problems understanding the concept of
"axel-weight" vs "gross weight" , very confusing really....all those big
numbers.  At any rate...during the course of the conversation he told me that
during the "black studies" course in his high school he was taught about the
ancient black civilizations of Africa which had electric airplanes...and many
other (rather poorly defined) amazing and marvelous technological devices.
 Of course somehow (unclear just how it happened) the white man stole it,
along with mathematics which was perhaps why he was having such difficullties
at the moment.

You mean he was wrong?

Now how can that be true?  I seem to recall that a certain Zulu Cheiftain had
his warriors repeatedly charge a squad of Boers(or was it British?) armed
with a Maxim Machine gun.  It seems that the machine gun had more bullets
than the Chief had warriors and that tribe went extinct.  Most unfair...if
he'd had only a few more young black males....and calling them stupid ?  Most
unappreciative of the psycho-social dynamics I would think.

Of course the Apache DID high-tail it at the mere sight of a Gatling Gun.
 And then nail the suckers from ambush...but that was completely different.

It's worse than this, if David Hodgson's objection is correct in THE MIND
MATTERS (1991).  He notes:  

`The absurdity is highlighted when one considers that in some situations
quantum mechanical probabilities can be given by irrational numbers (not
expressible as a fraction), so that in those cases... the determination of
the number of worlds to be created would have to be the result of some
approximation chosen by Nature.'  (p. 338)

I have never seen this objection met; on the other hand, Hodgson's book was
well received by QT-canny people such as Paul Davies.
